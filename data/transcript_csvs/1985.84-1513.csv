1985.84-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.487,We will hear arguments next in California against Ciraolo.
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,13.258,13.908,Thank you.
1985.84-1513,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,216.288,219.323,I take it the curtilage aspect is immaterial.
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,219.323,223.56,"In this case, Your Honor, it wouldn't matter if it was in the open field."
1985.84-1513,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,225.444,231.481,"Well, it isn't in the open field, hut it is, as you say, open to view from above."
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,236.302,236.885,No.
1985.84-1513,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,236.885,242.105,"What do you understand the word ""curtilage"" to signify?"
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,242.105,245.573,"My answer, Your Honor, is Ciraolo's yard."
1985.84-1513,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,266.504,270.625,What would you say about a large greenhouse?
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,288.05,297.406,"If you can see, in my view, if you can see through the greenhouse, sure, you can take pictures, and the reason to me is--"
1985.84-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,297.406,300.358,And if you can persuade someone that that is marijuana--
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,300.358,304.06,--And if you can--
1985.84-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,304.06,306.928,"--that is, if you are going to get a warrant before you actually seize it."
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,306.928,310.563,"--And if you can persuade them that is marijuana, you should be able to get a warrant."
1985.84-1513,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,337.131,352.123,"Mr. Sullivan, I assume you agree that a police officer would not be authorized to make a ground entry examination of the curtilage in this case."
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,352.123,352.706,Yes.
1985.84-1513,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,352.706,361.895,"Now, what about a low level hovering helicopter examination?"
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,361.895,363.745,One of the attorneys--
1985.84-1513,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.745,365.264,Do you think there is a distinction there?
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,365.264,372.668,"--One of the attorneys in the prior case, Your Honor, said that there is a California case, and that is right, there is."
1985.84-1513,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,376.904,378.154,What is your view of--
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,378.154,382.974,My view is that there are lots of other ways of handling that kind of problem.
1985.84-1513,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,392.08,399.233,--Is there a Fourth Amendment violation by virtue of the low level hovering helicopter in your view or not?
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,399.233,419.897,"--I suspect that if you are hovering over 20 feet you have got a strong case that it may well be, but I am saying that if this Cort was ever presented with that situation, it probably would first look to the question of whether there realistically are better ways of adapting or controlling for that kind of abuse."
1985.84-1513,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,436.443,449.35,"Well, perhaps you don't, but do you recognize that there are Fourth Amendment limits to the type of technology and enhancement of ordinary powers of observation that police can use?"
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,449.35,459.808,The Fourth Amendment to my mind imposes limits on the expectations of privacy which people have that society is prepared to recognize.
1985.84-1513,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,460.441,471.449,Are we prepared to recognize an interest against the use of infrared photography or some other visual enhancement devices of that kind?
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,471.449,476.568,"--In my view that would turn... my feeling would be no, Your Honor."
1985.84-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,536.772,540.926,May I follow up on one of Justice O'Connor's questions?
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,543.878,544.478,Yes.
1985.84-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,544.478,549.782,What if the police rented a fire truck or a tall crane and climbed up to the top of it and looked over the fence?
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,551.966,581.735,"Yes, I think the ladder situation, the hook and ladder situation is a foreseeability problem, and I think I stated in my brief, Your Honor, that to my mind the reason why the knothole or the ladder hypothetical causes a problem is precisely because the homeowner has taken means to protect against the kind of intrusion you are talking about."
1985.84-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,635.286,646.076,"If that is your test, what if the respondent here had grown a big tree or something that partially but not totally concealed the marijuana plant because he wanted to avoid this very risk?"
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,648.009,653.747,"--If it is exposed to the air space, then it can't be a very good tree."
1985.84-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,653.747,662.686,"It is exposed to all except a very sharp-eyed police officer with a good, sharp camera, just as it is exposed on the ground unless you get a ladder."
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,663.621,668.339,"Well, that is not this case, Your Honor, because in this case the officer just had to look down, and he wasn't using--"
1985.84-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,668.339,668.823,--I understand.
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,678.095,678.345,--Yes.
1985.84-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,697.073,698.24,What is your answer to the knothole?
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,698.24,706.328,"Well, the answer to the knothole is that in many cases I can foresee it being perfectly legitimate."
1985.84-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,729.028,731.23,"If it is a knothole you have to stand on a ladder to see through, then it is bad?"
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,731.23,742.835,"Well, there are... you have to draw distinctions that respond to people's foreseeabilities, to the foreseeability of situations."
1985.84-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,809.813,818.502,I would like to test out something in Justice O'Connor's question.
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,846.938,852.057,"Yes, and I suspect the Court would spend about a half-page on that, citing the decision in Karo."
1985.84-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1057.708,1067.463,"Mr. Sullivan, in Oliver we had an open field a substantial distance from any residence."
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,1093.362,1100.285,"No, Your Honor, because if I was going to make that argument, I would be saying... I would be contradicting myself in saying the police can walk into your back yard."
1985.84-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1108.172,1110.141,They may photograph it.
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,1110.141,1122.531,"If they can see it... I mean, all I have to argue, and what I am arguing is, if they can see it with the naked eye from air space, sure, they can take a camera and photograph exactly what they saw, which is what they did here."
1985.84-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1122.531,1135.874,"And that would be true, for example, if you had a type residence with a patio in the back surrounded by a brick wall and, say, a swimming pool in one part of it, and marijuana being planted right beside the swimming pool."
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,1138.493,1155.519,"If you can see the marijuana with your naked eye from air space, I don't think it makes one whit of difference or not the officer has a camera with him or not, because all he is doing is... the expectation of privacy vis-a-vis aerial observation wasn't there to begin with."
1985.84-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1158.269,1160.054,From the air.
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,1160.054,1160.821,--From the air.
1985.84-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.048,1193.208,"Mr. Sullivan, if I understand your argument, the case would be different for you if the marijuana, instead of being these very large plants, were tiny plants, and at 1,000 feet they would have to use high-powered equipment that was very, very sophisticated in order to detect the fact it was marijuana."
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,1196.41,1200.048,I suspect that might well be a different case.
1985.84-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.564,1202.398,You would distinguish that case.
1985.84-1513,0,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,1202.398,1218.759,"I understand I was hearing the previous example given by Justice Powell, I believe, of looking through one of the glass buildings that has opaque windows in it, and using some sort of penetration aid to visually observe that."
1985.84-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1310.1,1315.987,Mr. Krause?
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,1315.987,1326.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there is a word that hasn't been mentioned much today, and that is the warrant."
1985.84-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1465.935,1468.721,"I suppose the answer to that is, they didn't have probable cause."
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,1468.721,1471.923,"Well, I don't know whether it is up to us to say that."
1985.84-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1513.25,1520.856,Is there any limit in your view to what may constitute curtilage around a residence as to space?
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,1520.856,1522.072,There certainly is.
1985.84-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1537.532,1538.567,How big can it be?
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,1540.3,1553.843,"I think it depends upon what really is the intimate area connected with the house, and I wouldn't mind accepting Mr. Sullivan's definition that he gave in his portion of the argument."
1985.84-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1598.188,1612.198,"Suppose, given the enormous profits in the drug business, that someone takes two acres or four acres and builds a wall entirely around it as tall as the ceiling of this room."
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,1617.317,1624.506,I think that you are pressing me to give an answer when I can't give it.
1985.84-1513,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1702.369,1711.808,"Mr. Krause, did I detect anything in the brief that your position would be a little different if this were a routine police patrol by air?"
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,1711.808,1752.035,"Yes, I think our position would be a little different because that kind of a situation raises the same issue that Justice White dealt with in the Camera case, that it is impossible to be specific as to probable cause as required by the Fourth Amendment, so I have suggested that under those circumstances where there is routine aerial surveillance of back yards on an intense basis that is going to take place, that the administrative warrant solution would seem to be ideal, and could be adopted on the same basis that this Court adopted such a solution in the Camera case."
1985.84-1513,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1773.115,1776.417,I am not sure that I understand your focus argument.
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,1801.966,1803.132,"I agree, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1513,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1803.132,1807.6,So why isn't the same thing true of the examination from the air?
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,1807.6,1811.988,Because the focus was not on what they could see from the ground.
1985.84-1513,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1818.308,1820.844,"No, but they could have seen it in a routine patrol."
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,1824.561,1831.299,--Because the focus intensifies the attention given to a particular back yard.
1985.84-1513,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1874.411,1877.096,"Well, protected from what?"
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,1878.763,1883.667,Protected in the same way that the home is protected from an unwarranted entry.
1985.84-1513,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1883.667,1885.234,I don't think the Court has said that.
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,1896.925,1921.459,"The Oliver case said, joined the home and the curtilage in opposition to the open field, and I am sure that the majority wrote that opinion to answer the attacks of the dissent, who were complaining about the Oliver case narrowing privacy, and they said, no, we don't narrow privacy in the areas where it really counts, in the curtilage and in the home."
1985.84-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1949.709,1952.811,"Yes, but you wouldn't show any protection if there were no fence."
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,1952.811,1954.561,"If there were no fence, it would be--"
1985.84-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1954.561,1955.494,It would still be curtilage.
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,1955.494,1956.877,--It would be a waiver.
1985.84-1513,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1990.697,2002.32,"Well, in this day and age, with the frequency of air travel, it may well be that if you don't put a patio cover over your back yard you waive any right for an aerial look."
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,2002.32,2015.045,"I think the kind of frequency of air travel you are talking about, Justice O'Connor, and I will have to get back to the focus, is not the same kind of scrutiny as I am talking about."
1985.84-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.0,2180.183,"On what grounds, Mr. Krause?"
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,2180.183,2183.019,--On grounds of invasion of privacy and--
1985.84-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2183.019,2185.971,You mean not a federal constitutional--
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,2185.971,2188.256,"--Well, I think he could have a Bivens injunction, yes."
1985.84-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.256,2190.875,"--Well, that would assume there is a Fourth Amendment violation."
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,2190.875,2192.493,"And I think there is, for this reason."
1985.84-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2192.493,2194.093,But that is what we are trying to decide here.
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,2204.715,2208.936,"I realize that without what I am going to say next, but what I am going to say next is that the--"
1985.84-1513,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2208.936,2210.736,Would you have a dirty hands problem?
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,2210.736,2213.821,"--Well, you could say that."
1985.84-1513,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2213.821,2218.708,The government is interfering with my violation of the law.
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,2218.708,2235.753,"I think that certainly without the warrant situation you have got the jumping the fence situation, as Mr. Sullivan agreed, that he couldn't peak over the fence by jumping the fence or putting up a ladder."
1985.84-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.674,2256.083,"But am I correct in understanding that you would find no objection if the police as a routine matter sent up an officer every day to fly at 1,000 feet and look for these plants?"
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,2256.083,2258.299,"Yes, I would find an objection."
1985.84-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2263.153,2274.711,"I understand you would think of an administrative warrant, which isn't, of course, isn't even mentioned in the warrant clause, but apart from the warrant, when you say that that would... that would be prohibitive, if you say that is prohibitive, then you are not relying on your focus argument."
1985.84-1513,1,36133,marshall_w_krause,,2274.711,2288.353,--I would say that it is prohibitive without an administrative warrant to specifically look into people's property for purposes of criminal law violation.
1985.84-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2583.143,2585.729,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Sullivan?"
1985.84-1513,2,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,2585.729,2587.581,"Just very briefly, Your Honor."
1985.84-1513,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2696.6,2698.5,All he had to do was to get a warrant.
1985.84-1513,2,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,2698.5,2701.902,"Your Honor, he couldn't get a warrant."
1985.84-1513,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2730.404,2732.94,You really mean that they will do what I tell them to do?
1985.84-1513,2,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,2736.358,2737.742,I mean that they--
1985.84-1513,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2737.742,2738.594,You really mean that?
1985.84-1513,2,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,2738.594,2739.877,--I mean--
1985.84-1513,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2739.877,2741.046,Do you really mean it or not?
1985.84-1513,2,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,2744.581,2746.264,"--No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1513,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2746.264,2746.866,Thank you.
1985.84-1513,2,35057,laurence_k_sullivan,,2746.866,2755.186,"I simply mean that they read opinions carefully, and I didn't mean it in any other way but that."
1985.84-1513,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2757.936,2758.638,"Thank you, gentlemen."
