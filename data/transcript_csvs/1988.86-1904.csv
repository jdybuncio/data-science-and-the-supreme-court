1988.86-1904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.588,"We'll hear argument now in No. 86-1904, Arizona v. Youngblood."
1988.86-1904,0,30615,john_r_gustafson,,17.973,18.874,Gustafson.
1988.86-1904,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,18.874,20.673,You've Americanized it.
1988.86-1904,0,30615,john_r_gustafson,,20.673,25.107,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.86-1904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.876,182.692,"Mr. Gustafson, did the defense ask for any Brady materials in this case?"
1988.86-1904,0,30615,john_r_gustafson,,182.692,185.703,"No, and they don't need to."
1988.86-1904,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.127,203.134,"What does the record show, if anything, that the State disclosed to the defense about the existence of the swab and the clothing?"
1988.86-1904,0,30615,john_r_gustafson,,203.134,209.587,--The record shows... there's an absence in the record on this part.
1988.86-1904,1,20787,daniel_f_davis,,1525.337,1532.31,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.86-1904,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.532,1583.343,You made the tactical decision not to test the swab.
1988.86-1904,2,30615,john_r_gustafson,,1583.343,1584.335,"No, sir."
1988.86-1904,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1669.54,1680.617,"Well, in any event, when did the defense know that the victim's clothing had been obtained by the police and that a swab had been taken?"
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,1680.617,1684.139,"I don't know the precise date, Your Honor, and I was not trial counsel."
1988.86-1904,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1702.833,1712.079,The defense knew quite early on that these items existed and presumably could have made a demand to have them tested.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,1712.079,1714.999,"On December 10, such a request would have been meaningless."
1988.86-1904,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1722.795,1724.165,"Well, the swab had been refrigerated."
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,1724.165,1725.016,"I agree, Your Honor."
1988.86-1904,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1725.016,1727.229,"So, it wasn't meaningless as to that."
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,1731.961,1741.736,"Your Honor, with regard to the swab, the testing... we could continue to do testing today, but it is most unlikely that anything would develop from the swab."
1988.86-1904,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1755.526,1768.376,"But certainly an objection was made and an argument to the jury that it was... the State should have done this testing, and that there was a reasonable doubt because it wasn't done."
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,1772.317,1773.248,That's correct.
1988.86-1904,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1773.248,1774.738,Okay.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,1774.738,1789.267,"Now, as to the clothing which both criminalists agree contains the better semen sample, the larger sample, the better preserved sample, that... testing of that was impossible as of December 10."
1988.86-1904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.02,1868.461,"Is it your complaint, constitutional complaint, that the State failed to test something at a time when it could have been tested, and by the time you found out that that sort of thing existed it was too late to test it?"
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,1868.461,1870.2,"That is part of our complaint, yes, sir."
1988.86-1904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1870.2,1871.641,What's the other part of your complaint?
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,1871.641,1875.304,That they failed to preserve it so that we could perform the tests.
1988.86-1904,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1921.555,1923.376,What tests do we employ?
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,1931.02,1933.133,Well--
1988.86-1904,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1933.133,1941.759,"The State didn't offer, as in Trombetta, the results of some scientific testing that the defendant then couldn't rebut."
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,1964.332,1966.954,"--No, Your Honor, with that I take some exception."
1988.86-1904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1979.864,1983.726,What case do you rely on for the proposition you're now stating?
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,1983.726,1985.297,"--Well, in the first place--"
1988.86-1904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1985.297,1988.6,Because Trombetta certainly doesn't support you because it does talk about good faith.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,1992.271,2006.38,"--Well, in the first instance, I think that... in the first place, I think that looking at cases like Valenzuela-Bernal indicate that what we are primarily concerned with is the content or the evidence, whichever way it falls."
1988.86-1904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2006.38,2008.411,"But, Valenzuela-Bernal doesn't come close to supporting you."
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2011.503,2021.18,"They made the conscious decision to dispose of that evidence after determining that the evidence had no probative value for either side, and the defense could not counter that argument."
1988.86-1904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2021.18,2025.372,"Now, what case is a holding in your favor on this point?"
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2025.372,2030.337,"Well, if... I think that Brady and Agurs and that line of cases."
1988.86-1904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.337,2036.38,"Well, but they aren't... you don't seriously mean that those are holdings in your favor on this point, do you?"
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2036.38,2037.299,They're not squarely on point.
1988.86-1904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2037.299,2038.661,"Well, of course, they're not."
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2041.222,2043.113,"Well, if I may, Your Honor."
1988.86-1904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.571,2075.745,When did you first have the opportunity to know that there was a swab and that there were clothing?
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2075.745,2078.756,"Again, since I did not try the case, I don't know the precise date."
1988.86-1904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.756,2079.206,Well--
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2079.206,2080.228,It would have to be--
1988.86-1904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.228,2084.229,--Do you... do you at least by the time of the first trial?
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2084.229,2084.83,--Certainly.
1988.86-1904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.83,2085.851,They knew that?
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2091.275,2092.026,"No, Your Honor."
1988.86-1904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.319,2101.232,But if the... do you contest the notion that the clothing and the swab are mentioned in the police reports?
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2101.232,2103.754,"--I assume that they were, and I would assume--"
1988.86-1904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.754,2105.064,"Well, if they were and they were available to the defendant."
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2105.064,2106.996,--I will assume that they were.
1988.86-1904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.996,2114.409,"And if they read them, they knew about the clothing and the swab at a time when tests would be all right."
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2114.409,2115.12,"No, sir."
1988.86-1904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2116.63,2118.593,Why wouldn't that be the case?
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2118.593,2123.446,--Because the arrest occurred six weeks after the samples were taken.
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.617,2157.55,You had a shot at doing the P-30 sample on the swab.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2157.55,2158.261,"--Yes, sir."
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.261,2159.901,And you didn't even take that shot.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2159.901,2160.762,"No, sir."
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.762,2170.84,"So, one really wonders how... you know, how sincere you are about using this evidence as opposed to really using it as an argument to the jury, which is how you did use it."
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2170.84,2172.04,"Well, sir--"
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.04,2177.823,"You tell us that there wasn't much chance that you'd get anything from the swab, but there was some chance--"
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2177.823,2179.275,--That's correct.
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.275,2179.996,--and you didn't take it?
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2179.996,2187.099,"In order to get anything out of the swab, we would have to test it by some means other than by a P-30 analysis."
1988.86-1904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2216.439,2221.003,Why is that the crucial issue as to whether they tested enough from the swab?
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2221.003,2231.068,"--Well, because the only tests that we have that we can look to are the ones that were performed for the blood markers, for instance, on the swab."
1988.86-1904,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2249.391,2254.684,"But now, this is not evidence that the State used... introduced at trial to incriminate the defendant."
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2254.684,2255.265,No.
1988.86-1904,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.265,2257.084,It wasn't incriminating.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2257.084,2258.286,"No, it was not."
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2258.286,2260.056,Why can't you retest?
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2269.814,2276.038,That was the opinion of the State's criminalist was that there was not enough to retest.
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2276.038,2280.132,I thought he said that a test could be done on the swab.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2280.132,2281.802,He said he could go back and retest it--
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.802,2282.323,Yes.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2282.323,2284.266,--but he didn't think that there was enough there.
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2284.266,2286.176,He didn't think.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2286.176,2287.137,That's right.
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.137,2289.679,And that was enough to satisfy you.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2289.679,2291.869,"Well, it seemed to be enough to satisfy the State."
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2293.451,2295.262,The State didn't have a client they were trying to get off.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2308.472,2312.022,"--But the situation that we're in, we're doing destructive testing."
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.401,2327.053,I don't understand that.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2338.94,2342.103,"If there was in the amount that had been tested, that's correct."
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.103,2343.632,Not in the amount that had been tested.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2345.384,2349.868,Perhaps... I'm obviously not making myself understood.
1988.86-1904,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2356.311,2356.922,Right.
1988.86-1904,3,20787,daniel_f_davis,,2356.922,2358.832,The first test is conducted.
1988.86-1904,4,30615,john_r_gustafson,,3209.291,3216.235,This case isn't like Brady v. Maryland or United States v. Agurs.
1988.86-1904,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3292.504,3300.771,"Do you agree that on the state of this record, that after six weeks, the samples on the clothing had deteriorated so that a useful test could not be made?"
1988.86-1904,4,30615,john_r_gustafson,,3300.771,3302.702,No.
1988.86-1904,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3338.015,3350.974,xxx the only thing that can possibly happen to him in the test is that... is that it will eliminate his reasonable doubt argument.
1988.86-1904,4,30615,john_r_gustafson,,3350.974,3358.968,"What he... as to that one piece, but there were several pieces and he won't examine any of them."
1988.86-1904,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3363.713,3368.785,"Mr. Gustafson, do you agree that the P-30 test doesn't do anything except tell you how much--"
1988.86-1904,4,30615,john_r_gustafson,,3368.785,3369.875,Yes.
1988.86-1904,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3369.875,3370.867,--how much semen you have.
1988.86-1904,4,30615,john_r_gustafson,,3370.867,3371.858,That's it.
1988.86-1904,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3371.858,3375.108,"It's a useless test, isn't it?"
1988.86-1904,4,30615,john_r_gustafson,,3375.108,3379.512,It is except it was of importance here.
1988.86-1904,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3437.589,3444.694,"Well, I suppose when the tests... when the evidence was gathered, they had no suspect."
1988.86-1904,4,30615,john_r_gustafson,,3444.694,3445.934,That's correct.
1988.86-1904,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3445.934,3450.057,"And so, they may or may not ever have had a suspect."
1988.86-1904,4,30615,john_r_gustafson,,3450.057,3451.079,That's correct.
1988.86-1904,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.079,3462.787,"So, I guess the claim is that the State must preserve this... the clothing and the swab for as long as the case is open."
1988.86-1904,4,30615,john_r_gustafson,,3462.787,3465.158,Yes.
1988.86-1904,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3465.158,3467.371,"Thank you, Mr. Gustafson."
