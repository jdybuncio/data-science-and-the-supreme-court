1975.74-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.753,We will hear arguments next in United States against Janis.
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,34.054,36.225,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-958,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.441,284.016,What civil rights does the Government have?
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,284.016,288.858,"The right to the collection of taxes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I meant, its right in the civil litigation."
1975.74-958,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.858,291.15,Oh! I see.
1975.74-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,291.15,307.936,"This might have some effect I suppose on the activities under the informant’s statutes where people secretly inform, give information that leads to tax liabilities, is that possible?"
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,307.936,311.075,I suppose it would be if they have given the information to the Internal Revenue Service.
1975.74-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,322.901,353.349,"Suggesting there is a possibility that when a tax assessment or deficiency claim is based upon an informant’s information, this case would perhaps have some implication that the Court must inquire or someone must inquire into how the informant got his information that he passed on to the Internal Revenue, is that possible?"
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,353.349,355.314,I suppose it is possible Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.74-958,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,381.03,396.88,"Mr. Solicitor General, would you have a different case if the Internal Revenue Service agents had seized this records and this money directly themselves by a warrantless search?"
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,396.88,399.574,"I think one might, Mr. Justice Powell."
1975.74-958,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,470.059,479.095,How frequently do we have a situation of this kind where the IRS is using material so obtained from State or Local authorities?
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,479.095,495.189,"Well, the only thing in the record on that Mr. Justice Blackmun, is the statement by the police officer here that when it was a large bookmaking operation, he generally passed the -- notified the Internal Revenue Service, for the smaller one he did not."
1975.74-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,508.417,533.37,"Mr. Solicitor General, suppose the Federal tax people were told or otherwise knew that the information that was being presented to it had been obtained by patently illegal search and seizure, I know you suggest that as a general rule he should avoid the exclusionary rule, but what about in the individual case where the officer knows, (Voice Overlap)?"
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,533.37,550.835,"Well, I think Mr. Justice White that the issue is always an issue of general deterrence and not an issue of, are we upset about this case because this Court has recognized it is too late to repair the privacy or interest of the individual raising the case."
1975.74-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,584.988,594.621,"But even if they were -- even if they were going to say that he would exclude evidence on the facts I posed, that is not the case here, I take it?"
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,594.621,597.441,That is not at all the case here.
1975.74-958,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,624.775,627.145,"Did you say, should not have been?"
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,627.145,663.228,"I will suggest it, Mr. Justice Brennan, that when a warrant has been obtained, when the primary purpose of the exclusionary rule has been carried out to force or to urge that they will get the police before a neutral and detached magistrate and when they make a good faith and bona fide effort to show a probable cause and later it is said that there is a procedural defect, indeed on the -- a mistake on the part of the magistrate, if he had asked in this case, something did not satisfy him, it is quite likely the information --"
1975.74-958,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,663.228,664.963,(Inaudible)
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,664.963,666.972,"Well, it is one way to decide this case."
1975.74-958,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,667.766,670.413,It is not addressed to the Lower Courts?
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,670.413,683.293,"Well, the Court of Appeals did not say anything, Mr. Justice Brennan and the District Court merely had findings of fact and conclusions of law and as I look at this case, there are so many ways it could be decided."
1975.74-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,726.678,761.237,"Under the holding of the -- what we have before us, essentially the District Court holding, suppose the IRS had come to this information by reading in the Los Angeles Times an account of the motion to suppress in the State Courts and then proceeding from that information conducted an investigation, does this holding insulate the Government or would it be subject to the same challenge that your friend is making?"
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,761.237,765.181,"I think that would, Mr. Chief Justice would be subject to the same challenge that my brother is making here."
1975.74-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,782.382,794.138,"Even though that knowledge has become public property by virtue of being reported in a newspaper, account of the motion to suppress?"
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,794.138,816.056,"Well, if it were not the view of the Court below and of my brother here that the Government would be foreclosed in such a case, then I think it would be relevantly unimportant that the Government was told by a Los Angeles police officer because the Government could have leaned of it easily later through the proceedings in the Municipal Court."
1975.74-958,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,839.224,850.435,"Your emphasis on deterrence pose one's view while that exclusionary rule has other premises, additional integrity and so forth?"
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,850.435,895.008,"Well I think it has been suggested, Mr. Justice Brennan that those other, particularly judicial integrity interests, run just about parallel with deterrence, so that the analysis turns out to be much the same and indeed if judicial integrity meant that evidence of this sort could not be used in this tax litigation, then I would really suppose that you would have to overrule Harris against New York, Calandra, Peltier because those are all cases in which evidence of this sort gets used in some way and if judicial integrity means that under no circumstances may anything happen because of --"
1975.74-958,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,895.008,899.341,"I guess those were all three cases in which I dissented, were they not?"
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,899.341,900.394,"True, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1975.74-958,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,900.394,903.174,"Well, is the case that Harris relied upon, Walden or Wal --?"
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,903.174,903.546,Walder.
1975.74-958,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,903.546,904.962,"Walder, yes."
1975.74-958,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,907.375,911.43,"No, but I do recall that it was the same as Walder or not."
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,1552.004,1556.967,Mr. Chief justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-958,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1610.127,1616.525,How would that effect the basic proposition that is presented in this case?
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,1616.525,1629.287,It would affect the basic proposition because the Government has chosen to rely solely on its certificate of assessment.
1975.74-958,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1683.056,1690.97,Was that in fact the basic issue in more -- in sharper relief?
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,1690.97,1697.205,It does put the basic issue into relief very clearly.
1975.74-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1766.588,1773.326,"I thought he denied that it was a policy of police procedure, it was just his individual?"
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,1773.326,1775.792,"He said it was his police procedure, I believe Your Honor."
1975.74-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1775.792,1776.829,It was his?
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,1776.829,1777.901,His police procedure.
1975.74-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1777.901,1780.687,But it was not under the rules and regulation of the Police Department?
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,1780.687,1783.351,It is not under the rules and regulations of the Police Department.
1975.74-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1783.351,1795.994,"What happens if the police were very friendly with a reporter and tells him, you know, I arrested so and so and he is a bookmaker and gave him all the facts and the reporter gave it to the IRS?"
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,1795.994,1803.282,Your Honor raises an interesting question which is precisely what happened in the Suarez case in the Tax Court.
1975.74-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1833.366,1835.189,And that is your position?
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,1844.707,1847.955,"That is not my position, Your Honor."
1975.74-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1861.995,1864.595,Assume that was illegally obtained.
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,1866.583,1873.282,The Government in its petition for certiorari conceded that the evidence was illegally obtained.
1975.74-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1925.684,1938.128,What if we were to decide that we would not parse search warrants in civil proceedings the way we did in Aguilar and Spinelli in criminal proceedings?
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,1938.128,1939.651,"I am not sure I understand your question, Your Honor."
1975.74-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1939.651,1952.039,"Well okay, Aguilar and Spinelli were direct appeals in criminal proceedings and there the Court went into some details as to whether the affidavit properly supported the issue in civil warrant."
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,1974.81,1983.607,Then what Your Honor is suggesting is a different standard for the admissibility of evidence in a civil case as opposed to a criminal case.
1975.74-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1997.522,2013.411,"Well, you could put it the other way around and say that where you are going to impose criminal sanctions on a citizen, you will hold the Government to a higher standard than when you are simply trying to collect back taxes?"
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2013.411,2016.488,It is the same Fourth Amendment applying to all people.
1975.74-958,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2038.234,2043.555,"What about the Walder case, followed by the Harris case for example?"
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2046.081,2048.563,"I believe, Your Honor, they were."
1975.74-958,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2048.563,2060.996,"And the evidence even though concededly obtained initially in violation, nevertheless was admissible in the criminal case for impeachment?"
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2060.996,2063.88,"For impeachment purposes, yes Your Honor."
1975.74-958,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2149.954,2156.604,What interest does a policeman in Los Angeles have in seeing that the Federal Government gets its proper tax revenues?
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2156.604,2159.076,"Well, Your Honor he has a very close interest."
1975.74-958,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2162.622,2167.601,"Well, is it different from yours or mine to see that everybody pays his fair share of taxes?"
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2167.601,2172.802,"He has -- his interest is to prevent crime, which is a commendable interest."
1975.74-958,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2183.964,2186.465,You mean the way they got to Al Capone back 40 years now?
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2186.465,2187.607,"I did not say that, Your Honor."
1975.74-958,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2243.147,2251.062,Maybe the object is also to collect income taxes from a very lucrative source as far as narcotics are concerned?
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2251.062,2260.248,"The object is to collect income taxes and the collection process is commendable, but the collection process can be within the framework of the constitution."
1975.74-958,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2260.248,2271.181,"The IRS might well be criticized as being less than diligent if it did not pursue narcotics income, might it not?"
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2271.181,2275.497,There is no doubt that the IRS should pursue narcotics income.
1975.74-958,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2302.043,2303.286,The Los Angeles Police Department?
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2303.286,2305.937,The Los Angeles Police Department.
1975.74-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2348.742,2358.673,"When you say that the evidence was illegally obtained, I take it there has been no trial of the action that the Government might bring against your client, do you?"
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2358.673,2361.85,There -- the evidence was obtained by the Los Angeles Police Department.
1975.74-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2361.85,2368.325,"Well, what I meant is the action -- that there – any action that the Government seeks to bring against your client yet been tried?"
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2368.325,2369.612,Yes.
1975.74-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2370.831,2373.489,I thought you were the plaintiff in this case.
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2373.489,2375.293,We are the plaintiff in this case.
1975.74-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2397.634,2404.084,And was the -- did the Government have an opportunity to proffer its evidence and so forth at the trial or did it?
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2404.084,2413.011,That is precisely the first point I made when I stood up here and wanted to correct something for the record that this was not on a motion for summary judgment.
1975.74-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2413.011,2425.394,But I -- it does not have to have been on a motion for a summary judgment for the matter to have gone off on a motion to suppress or the effective granting of a motion to suppress rather than a full trial on the merits.
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2439.542,2440.487,Alright.
1975.74-958,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2489.55,2493.861,"That is all set out on the top of page 5a in the District Court’s opinion, where it is summarized?"
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2493.861,2494.525,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2494.525,2503.132,"But those computations are not “evidence” in the normal understanding of the word, are they?"
1975.74-958,1,28019,herbert_d_sturman,,2503.132,2510.745,"What we have here, Your Honor, is an excise tax based on bookmaking activities."
1975.74-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2545.353,2557.858,"When you say something as derived from figures that were obtained from the Los Angeles Police Department, I do not think of “figures” being admissible in trial on the ordinary evidentiary sense?"
1975.74-958,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3299.188,3300.534,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-958,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3358.364,3360.174,Disposition of the tax claim?
1975.74-958,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,3360.174,3363.493,"Of the tax claim, precisely Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1975.74-958,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3366.179,3369.21,"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General."
