2012.11-556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 11-556, Vance v. Ball State University."
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,10.272,12.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,59.455,62.573,Let's say you have a work room.
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,94.795,104.317,"No, Your Honor, because in that circumstance the adverse action would not amount to -- would not be severe."
2012.11-556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,106.519,110.137,"Well, that could be -- that could be far more severe than, for example--"
2012.11-556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,110.137,111.621,Hard rock instead of--
2012.11-556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,112.173,122.695,"--It could be far more severe than simply saying, all right, you know, you're going to -- as in this case -- you're going to be cutting the celery rather than, you know, baking the bread, or whatever."
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,122.695,127.449,"--Well, no, Your Honor, this is the -- the severity is an objective standard; it's not a subjective."
2012.11-556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,148.512,163.939,"Well, but, I mean, there are places where the environment -- you know, an assembly line or something like that -- where the task may not be that different, but how you -- the environment in which you have to perform them may be far more significant than whether or not you're attaching the door handles or the front fenders."
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,163.939,167.408,"--Oh, for sure, Your Honor, but they have to be judged on a case-by-case basis."
2012.11-556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,167.408,167.924,"Well, exactly."
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,195.41,206.885,"Well, Your Honor, the Respondent actually exaggerates the determinativeness of the Seventh Circuit rule, and the indeterminativeness -- both indeterminativeness and unpredictability of the Second Circuit rule."
2012.11-556,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,287.685,290.92,"Well, could you point out what the materially augments rule means?"
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,300.895,326.176,"--It has to be sufficient to enable the harasser to instill either fear in the victim that the victim should not turn the harasser in, or that it may have to do with the harasser's ability to control the physical location of the victim."
2012.11-556,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,345.024,356.129,"There are situations where the assignment of responsibilities is extremely unpleasant, and so it's easy to see how the testimony would apply in that situation."
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,365.42,367.337,"--Well, Your Honor, this--"
2012.11-556,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,367.337,376.709,"You said that being subjected to country music or hard rock or Wagner, you know, every single day in the workplace would not be sufficient."
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,380.93,394.32,"--Justice Alito, this part of the standard, particularly the materiality requirement, is meant to track this Court's standard in Burlington Northern, where it said that only actions that are materially adverse to the employee would count."
2012.11-556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.509,407.58,"Mr. Ortiz, why isn't the question that you're presenting academic in this case?"
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,449.49,461.132,"--Justice Ginsburg, we actually tried to bring those things up before the Seventh Circuit, but the Seventh Circuit found it unnecessary to reach them because of its holding as to supervisory liability."
2012.11-556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,547.154,562.414,"Mr. Ortiz, suppose I agree with your standard, but I just can't find on the record as it has been presented in this Court any evidence that Davis actually served as Vance's supervisor."
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,581.709,587.279,"First, Justice Kagan, it is important to keep in mind that the record was developed under the wrong legal standard."
2012.11-556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,588.498,588.998,"Well, is that the case?"
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,594.819,603.074,--There was evidence that was probably not developed below because the Seventh Circuit's standard was so absolute.
2012.11-556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,615.632,617.148,What other than the job description?
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,639.831,643.116,"Well, Justice -- there is two separate questions, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,705.373,709.26,"What I mean is not the statement, well, she's a supervisor."
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,724.02,740.863,"--Well, there was no overt threat like that in the record, but the person who was hurling racial epithets at her was in a position of authority over her, both according to the job description, also according to her understanding, according--"
2012.11-556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,740.863,743.665,But that was also -- that would be for a very confined period.
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,752.604,753.539,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,814.76,820.314,What was the most unpleasant thing that Davis could have assigned the Petitioner to do?
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,824.116,841.728,"Certainly within the -- within the job duties that she traditionally did, the kind of things she had to work with, what she had to do, things like this, working with onions, chopping onions all day might be punishment."
2012.11-556,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,847.799,849.416,But that would materially augment?
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,851.033,852.485,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,852.485,855.32,"Chopping -- how about chopping other things, just chopping?"
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,859.572,860.488,"Possibly, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,868.309,892.959,"Mr. Ortiz, did she ever have that authority, because the record as far as we have it says that the work assignment, what Vance was doing, came from the chef or from Kimes, and the most that Davis did was transmit the chef's orders of where people would be stationed."
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,892.959,896.911,"Your Honor, it is not quite clear at this point."
2012.11-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,917.092,919.694,"Counsel, may I interrupt a moment on--"
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,919.694,920.494,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,920.494,925.097,--following up on an issue raised in part by the Chief and by Justice Ginsburg.
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,938.588,940.274,"For sure, Your -- for sure, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,940.274,941.474,That would be your position?
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,941.474,942.226,Yes.
2012.11-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,942.226,961.538,That this could not be grounds that someone who directs an employee's day-to-day activity should be treated like someone who hasn't actually undertaken the threat because the situations are different.
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,961.538,962.738,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,968.007,968.876,Is that what this fight is about?
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,1002.347,1006.216,That this Court would require under those circumstances?
2012.11-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1006.216,1012.453,"Would require, would permit the affirmative defense to be raised by an employer."
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,1012.453,1021.309,It doesn't actually map on well to the structure of the affirmative defenses laid out in Ellerth and Faragher.
2012.11-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1021.309,1049.578,"No, but there is a difference between those supervisors who take direct activity, tangible direct actions, who are in power to do that, and supervisors who don't have that power, because supervisors who don't have that power are supervised -- their actions are supervised in a way that non-tangible employment supervisors are not."
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,1049.578,1069.659,"Under the existing affirmative -- affirmative defense, as I understand it, Your Honor, an employee who doesn't complain, unless they are reasonable in not complaining, in most cases would make the affirmative defense unavailable to the employer."
2012.11-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1075.229,1078.848,"No, it's whether, whether or not this whole fight is over that issue."
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,1078.848,1084.251,--That -- this whole -- the fight is in -- in part about that issue.
2012.11-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1085.684,1088.119,"No, because it's also about the burden of proof."
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,1088.119,1088.353,--Yes.
2012.11-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1088.353,1100.011,"So if we keep the burden of proof with respect to the employer raising the affirmative defense, does that solve half your problem?"
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,1100.011,1100.861,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1137.719,1146.372,"Would you tell me what you see as the major difference between the EEOC and the Second Circuit rule, and why one is compelled over the other?"
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,1157.763,1159.465,--Your Honor--
2012.11-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1159.465,1161.049,--the standard it sets forth?
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,1161.049,1164.417,"--it is -- it is entitled to deference under Skidmore, no more."
2012.11-556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1169.719,1170.671,Excuse me.
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,1173.273,1176.809,"--Because it's -- it's only informal guidance, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.878,1184.747,That's an absolute rule?
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,1184.747,1189.632,"--Well, Your Honor, it's a little bit contentious on this Court."
2012.11-556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1200.34,1219.719,"Have you answered the argument it shouldn't get any deference because what -- what the EEOC guidance does is it is -- it is interpreting two decisions of this Court, and this Court, not the EEOC, is in the best position to determine what those two cases mean?"
2012.11-556,0,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,1219.719,1225.705,"Well, what it is, Your Honor, is it represents an interpretation of the word “ agent ” in Title VII."
2012.11-556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1254.559,1255.475,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1267.132,1269.834,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1301.973,1304.407,What about -- what about the music hypothetical?
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1304.407,1305.693,--Well--
2012.11-556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1305.693,1308.728,Where -- where do you think your test comes out on that?
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1308.728,1314.965,"--I think it comes out, most likely, against concluding that the person is a supervisor."
2012.11-556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1333.361,1336.046,Why -- it doesn't really have to do with the number of tasks.
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1349.186,1350.222,"It could, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1373.636,1389.728,"And -- and your tests sort of use that, just as you've posed it, as some broad continuum in which we're going to have countless cases trying to figure out whether music falls closer to this end or, you know, what -- the senior employee controls the thermostat, is that closer to this end or that end?"
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1399.453,1409.309,"Well -- well, I guess, Your Honor, as Your Honor put it to -- to Petitioner's counsel, the competing approach would be the approach adopted by the Seventh Circuit; but, that approach has some serious flaws."
2012.11-556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1421.966,1428.02,"Well, isn't cleaning the toilets a limited -- isn't the authority to decide who cleans the toilets the same as the authority to decide what the music is going to be?"
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1434.959,1441.78,"Well, we don't -- I guess, we don't know enough about the threat to force her to clean the toilets for a year to know whether it's only one thing."
2012.11-556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1454.754,1461.074,"But your argument is if the only authority was to decide who cleans the toilets, then -- then that would not -- that wouldn't count, because that's just one thing."
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1461.074,1470.715,"No, I think that -- I don't think we have an answer to that until we know how much of the day's work is encompassed by cleaning the toilets."
2012.11-556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1470.715,1477.119,I thought in Faragher it was that -- that the lifeguard gave her her daily work assignments.
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1480.505,1484.975,"He -- he controlled every aspect of her -- of her day's work, and cleaning the toilets was one aspect of it."
2012.11-556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1489.36,1491.629,"Well, that can't possibly be what the case means."
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1519.696,1523.898,It doesn't constitute authority over daily work activities.
2012.11-556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1526.183,1526.583,Have you--
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1526.583,1528.302,--We haven't encountered it in real cases.
2012.11-556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1528.302,1529.568,"--Well, you've looked this up."
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1561.856,1563.406,"They haven't, Justice Breyer."
2012.11-556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1563.406,1564.025,"They have, or they have not?"
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1564.025,1564.775,They have not.
2012.11-556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1567.058,1567.975,How do you know that?
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1585.603,1593.292,"--Well, they haven't -- I guess that's two components to the answer, Mr. Chief Justice -- they haven't generated reported or underreported decisions, as far as we've seen."
2012.11-556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1602.914,1605.933,The EEOC lawyers think the EEOC plan is working just fine.
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1605.933,1608.885,"Well, that -- I -- I understand that that's not entirely surprising, but--"
2012.11-556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1608.885,1609.218,But I guess they'd tell you.
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1614.539,1614.872,--Right.
2012.11-556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1614.872,1616.824,"--what the problems are, if they have problems."
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1616.824,1617.358,Right.
2012.11-556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1620.21,1622.495,"I mean, we can ask the other side the same question."
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1634.369,1635.885,"--And I don't think it has, Justice Breyer."
2012.11-556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1644.141,1648.379,Could I ask you how the Seventh Circuit test works in operation?
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1671.577,1676.612,"That if there's no authority over -- to -- to direct annual employment actions, then--"
2012.11-556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1676.612,1678.998,"No, no, the secretary is fired by the head of secretarial services."
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1688.787,1693.491,--The professor would not qualify as a supervisor for purposes of Ellerth-Faragher framework.
2012.11-556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1693.491,1694.091,Under the Seventh Circuit test.
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1694.091,1699.645,"And so you'd look at it as a -- you'd look at the professor as a coworker, and you'd apply the same standards that applied to harassment conducted by the coworker."
2012.11-556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1699.645,1709.183,"Even though, of course, it's actually more difficult for the secretary to complain about the professor than it would be for the secretary to complain about the head of secretarial services."
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1709.183,1709.734,Yes.
2012.11-556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1724.177,1728.997,"And Mr. Srinivasan, if I can just continue on about this, because I just don't even understand the Seventh Circuit test."
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1737.437,1740.472,--The Seventh Circuit would say that as far as we can tell.
2012.11-556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1766.206,1769.574,You've -- you've talked several times about this going along the spectrum.
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1775.312,1778.514,"--Well, I think that the -- control over daily work activities is where we would draw the line."
2012.11-556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1819.924,1822.626,Do we have a developed record enough to do that in this case?
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1822.626,1823.159,--I'm sorry?
2012.11-556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1823.776,1825.745,Do -- do we have a developed record enough?
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1848.258,1853.728,"I think -- I think the real question, Justice Sotomayor, is whether the parties had a sufficient opportunity to develop the record."
2012.11-556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1875.26,1886.866,"The conclusion in your brief is that the judgment of the court of appeals should be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings, and now -- now you are telling us that we should -- we should basically write an opinion on summary judgment."
2012.11-556,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1886.866,1888.366,No.
2012.11-556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1904.911,1906.878,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1912.081,1914.699,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1928.193,1942.001,"We took this case to decide whether the Faragher and Ellerth -- and Ellerth supervisory liability rule is limited to those harassers who have the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline their victim."
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1944.719,1945.769,That's right.
2012.11-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1957.795,1958.178,All right.
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1979.042,1986.046,"--Well, most importantly, Justice Alito, because the courts need guidance on how to apply the EEOC and the Second Circuit standard."
2012.11-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2049.488,2059.994,I understand Mr. Ortiz to say that there's at least a dispute of fact about whether Davis could have controlled what Petitioner did on a daily basis.
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2059.994,2064.398,"There is -- there is neither a material nor genuine dispute on that, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2066.082,2069.1,Doesn't her job description say that she can assign tasks in the kitchen?
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2069.1,2073.753,"--But they -- they omit the -- the clause that follows, which is critical, which is"
2012.11-556,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.905,2103.457,We didn't take this case to -- to decide those factual questions.
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2103.457,2104.057,"--Your Honor, you--"
2012.11-556,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.057,2105.14,We really didn't.
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2115.563,2119.067,"--Well, Your Honor has excellent briefing defending the Seventh Circuit."
2012.11-556,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2124.369,2125.553,"They are not talking to us here, are they?"
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2125.553,2127.203,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2162.81,2164.512,Was that -- that question wasn't presented.
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2172.451,2174.986,"That -- that's absolutely right, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2196.567,2208.89,"Every -- every time -- every time you adopt a rule rather than a multifactor analysis, there are going to be particular cases that fall outside the rule that look like a harsh result."
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2245.064,2248.0,"--We do have great difficulty, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2270.031,2283.256,"Well, I think -- I think your friend on the other side was -- made a good point in his reply brief, which is the variety of circumstances you think courts should look at just happen to correspond with the factual issues that you would have resolved in your favor."
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2283.256,2285.125,"--Well, I -- I would take issue with that."
2012.11-556,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2300.9,2302.419,What does that have to do with agency?
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2306.288,2307.088,"Well, Your Honor--"
2012.11-556,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2307.088,2325.016,"I mean, I can understand Congress writing a statute that says, you know, any -- any person given -- given authority by the employer, which authority is used to make it more difficult for a person to complain about racial or sexual harassment, is bad."
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2333.355,2356.054,"--What this Court said in Faragher and Ellerth -- and I appreciate that you dissented in the case, but what this Court said was it adopted section 219(2)(d) of the Restatement, Second, of Agency, the notion that if -- if there was -- if the employee was aided in the accomplishment of the harassment by virtue of an agency relation, that that would be the agency trigger for liability."
2012.11-556,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2356.054,2356.22,Then why not leave it there?
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2358.004,2360.272,And RMA then--
2012.11-556,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.272,2361.022,--then you don't need it at all.
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2365.01,2371.329,"--I don't think it would, Your Honor, because we agree, certainly, with the EEOC that there are material limits to how far that principle could be stretched."
2012.11-556,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.333,2377.667,Why?
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2381.185,2381.469,"Well, for the very--"
2012.11-556,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2381.469,2388.708,"If you are aided, you know, you're going to work in a cold room unless you, you know, comply with my sexual advances, apply the principle."
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2391.141,2413.323,"--This is the balance I think that the Court struck in Ellerth, Your Honor, which was -- it took into account that the statute was passed against the backdrop of agency principles; but, yet, Congress also was cognizant that imposing vicarious liability on the employer for acts that the Court recognized were not themselves authorized by the employer, that that was a punitive aspect of that, and the Court would establish limits."
2012.11-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2487.122,2492.275,What guidance would your -- what guidance would the kind of opinion that you're suggesting we write really provide?
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2505.2,2508.035,"--I think it's a lot of guidance, Justice Alito."
2012.11-556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2556.349,2558.301,But why should that -- why should that matter?
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2597.859,2598.676,--Right.
2012.11-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2698.356,2725.84,"If you were willing to concede that this would be a close case under the Second Circuit standard or under the EEOC guidance, then there might be an argument in favor of our applying those tests -- or one of those tests to the facts of the case, because then that might provide some guidance, even though we are supposed to be a court of review, not a court of first view."
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2741.468,2745.837,"--Well, Your Honor, we don't think it's a close case, but my friend does, and his amici do."
2012.11-556,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2778.741,2798.821,"Mr. Garre, there is one BSU internal document that -- a note to the file by a compliance officer, who apparently investigated one of the complaints, that says that -- Kimes is recorded as saying -- he's the avowed supervisor -- that he, quote,"
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2808.946,2820.235,"It doesn't, Your Honor, if you agree with our principle, that the EEOC also agrees with, that having some limited or marginal authority to lead or direct as a matter of law is not sufficient."
2012.11-556,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2889.031,2890.014,"Mr. Garre, could I ask you about that?"
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2913.18,2929.373,"--Well, first, I would look at her summary judgment briefs, Your Honor, and in those briefs she argued that Davis was a supervisor because, one, under the job description she had the authority to lead and direct, the same sorts of things that we are talking now and would be talking about under the EEOC and Second Circuit tests."
2012.11-556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3146.799,3148.834,Mr. Ortiz said it wasn't just part-time.
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3158.274,3162.909,"--Well, we disagree with that, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3278.719,3281.838,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-556,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3281.838,3282.671,"If you have no more questions, thank you."
2012.11-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3282.671,3284.688,"Mr. Ortiz, you have 4 more minutes remaining."
2012.11-556,3,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,3284.688,3287.006,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3323.498,3339.941,"Well, if you adopted that rule I suppose you could couple it with an increased duty of care on the part of the employer to take necessary steps to prevent forbidden harassment."
2012.11-556,3,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,3343.994,3360.271,"Well, Justice Kennedy, that in fact is one thing the Seventh Circuit has tried to do, but it dispels any kind of certainty and predictability in the rule, because the duty of care of course would be determined by a jury only after hearing a particular case."
2012.11-556,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3458.002,3458.954,"Well, is there any?"
2012.11-556,3,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,3487.771,3493.591,"Well, Your Honor, first, the Solicitor General's office does not now take the position that affirmance is proper."
2012.11-556,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3493.591,3495.793,I read what they said in the last page of their brief.
2012.11-556,3,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,3502.481,3503.483,Yes.
2012.11-556,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3503.483,3504.299,Is there--
2012.11-556,3,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,3504.299,3505.116,There is.
2012.11-556,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3505.116,3506.282,--What is it?
2012.11-556,3,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,3506.282,3515.905,"On page 197 of the Joint Appendix, in the deposition testimony of Ms. Vance, she says that Davis told her what to do, what not to do."
2012.11-556,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3523.578,3528.112,I think Justice Breyer's question was what's not in the record?
2012.11-556,3,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,3528.112,3529.481,"--Oh, what's not -- I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3529.481,3535.468,Do you have something that's not in the record that will materially add to this discourse?
2012.11-556,3,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,3535.468,3536.585,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3575.193,3577.378,--That's all in the record in this Court.
2012.11-556,3,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,3577.378,3577.778,Yes.
2012.11-556,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3577.778,3578.997,Just not in the Joint Appendix.
2012.11-556,3,21319,daniel_r_ortiz,,3578.997,3579.814,"Just not in the Joint Appendix, Your Honor."
2012.11-556,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3580.264,3580.764,"Thank you, counsel."
