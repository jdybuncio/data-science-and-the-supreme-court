1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.227,We will hear arguments first this morning in the Jenkins v. Anderson.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,13.738,18.273,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-6809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,68.766,79.263,Wouldn't you say that Bell v. Wolfish last year that the presumption of innocence was something a word of art peculiar to criminal trials?
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,79.263,82.457,"Yes, but I think that that is a restricted concept of it."
1979.78-6809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,82.457,85.033,You disagree with --
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,85.033,90.19,I agree with the Court's declaration so far as the Court went.
1979.78-6809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.21,193.648,"Well, the defendant can be called before a grand jury and required to give blood samples, handwriting analysis, and that sort of thing; can he not?"
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,193.648,199.254,"That is true, but we have said that that is not testimonial in nature, have we not."
1979.78-6809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,199.254,203.255,"Yes, but I take it the State wouldn't do it if it didn't feel it was helping prove its case."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,203.255,206.212,"Well, I suppose not."
1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,248.422,255.896,"But once he takes the stand in his own behalf the situation undergoes some change, doesn't it?"
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,255.896,271.737,"Yes, it does but we cannot -- we cannot punish a person for exercising a constitutional right simply because he exercises another right, and that is the right to give evidence under the Sixth Amendment."
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,378.128,382.955,Did the lower court hold there was a duty on the part of the defendant to do any of these things?
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,382.955,384.951,"No, but I think it is --"
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,384.951,392.658,That the failure to do them if brought out on cross-examination may undermine his credibility.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,392.658,396.044,It doesn't have to imply that one has the duty.
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,396.044,396.986,Not necessarily.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,413.625,423.41,But isn't it a matter of credibility if a person is subpoenaed before a grand jury and he claims his right under the Fifth?
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,423.41,429.579,"Well, that is right but he wasn't summoned before the police and didn't assert any such right."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,432.569,445.146,I think it is an awfully strange doctrine that says that if a person is hailed before a grand jury he may exercise with impunity his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.
1979.78-6809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,491.09,498.153,"Do you suggest as a -- well, you certainly don't suggest as a general rule of evidence that silence is irrelevant."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,516.051,517.432,Yes.
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,517.432,526.171,"Well, isn't silence in civil cases a perfectly relevant matter to be brought out?"
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,526.171,527.452,In civil cases we are dealing with --
1979.78-6809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.452,534.357,"Well, I know but that isn't because there is any duty of anybody to talk, but it is because it is relevant as Justice Stevens suggests."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,534.357,541.873,But in civil cases we are dealing with such inconsequential things as money and --
1979.78-6809,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,541.873,551.999,"But the only reason it is different in criminal cases is because of the Fifth Amendment, it isn't because it is irrelevant or not meaningful, it is just --"
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,551.999,554.704,"Well, that may be Mr. Justice --"
1979.78-6809,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,554.704,560.436,But isn't your argument though that the Fifth Amendment forbids this; isn't that the amendment of your argument?
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,560.436,561.387,Right.
1979.78-6809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,568.816,597.134,"Well, Mr. Ziemba, to take the last hypothesis that you proposed of someone sitting in his living room and hearing a radio broadcast that there had been a crime committed and perhaps he was a suspect and he was ultimately indicted and tried, took the stand and the prosecutor sought to impeach him because he had failed to rush down to the police station and give his version."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,615.646,631.408,"I think that the Supreme Court of the State of Michigan would probably decide the case on the face -- on the basis of People v. Bobo cited on page 26 of the Petitioner' brief where the court said."""
1979.78-6809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,654.034,661.599,"Well, why did the -- your client have to go to the Federal courts to get relief here if the Supreme Court of Michigan feels that way?"
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,661.599,668.994,"Mr. Justice White, I keep asking that question time and time again."
1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,776.184,788.008,"It is a little more than that, isn't it, counsel; he just didn't remain silent, he fled from the scene of a homicide situation --"
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,788.008,788.303,Yes.
1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,788.303,791.46,-- a man was stabbed to death.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,802.555,805.437,"I am not sure, Your Honor."
1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,805.437,811.659,"You make so much importance, you have devoted 10 minutes or 12 minutes to."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,817.104,818.369,"No, he did not."
1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,818.369,822.63,Was it raised in the first appeal?
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,822.63,830.748,In the -- petitioner here had court-appointed counsel on his appeal as a right to the Michigan Court of Appeals.
1979.78-6809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1006.318,1007.281,But they didn't.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1007.281,1011.77,They did not; no.
1979.78-6809,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1067.091,1070.662,Maybe a white person would be?
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1070.662,1075.285,"Well, I don't know that that would be the case Mr. Justice."
1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1093.623,1099.853,Did he have a prior criminal record?
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1099.853,1101.322,I am not sure.
1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1104.775,1105.496,"Well, there is some --"
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1105.496,1123.053,"He had no -- no, no, in point of fact I recall, Your Honor, he gave the explanation that he was -- that he was in addition fearful that because he had been placed on probation just recently by one of the judges of the court of the city of Detroit."
1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1128.012,1133.054,He was not wholly unfamiliar with the criminal process.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1133.054,1151.751,"Your Honor, I don't think that when an unschooled individual goes through a criminal proceeding -- a case on the time that he is necessarily thoroughly educated, given the -- in the principles and processes of the criminal law."
1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1233.36,1242.234,I notice from the record that there apparently was no objection to the prosecutor's references to his --
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1242.234,1253.179,"There were no objections to the arguments of the prosecutor referring to the exercise by the petitioner of his right to silence; there was not, Your Honor, no."
1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1253.179,1261.38,But you say that this -- at least I got the impression you said this case turned entirely on his testimony.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1282.392,1286.467,"Yes, I would say -- I would say that was a fair representation, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1286.467,1294.743,The jury verdict came down to whether they were going to believe one set of witnesses or believe another set of witnesses?
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1294.743,1304.627,"I think -- well, no, I think -- no, my experience is that the jury wants to hear from the defendant, what's his side of the story."
1979.78-6809,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.636,1456.341,May I ask you about the extent of your position in the case.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1462.947,1480.017,"I do to this extent, that the Doyle case is correct but the Doyle case seems to say that the police invent constitutional rights when they inform a defendant of the Miranda rights."
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1480.017,1486.443,"Well, Doyle was due process, wasn't it?"
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1489.226,1493.47,"Well, I am sure the Fifth Amendment is in there some place."
1979.78-6809,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1508.679,1512.431,It is equal to the Miranda case.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1512.431,1513.611,"Yes, I would say --"
1979.78-6809,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1513.611,1516.973,Directly relates to the Miranda --
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1516.973,1517.518,Certainly.
1979.78-6809,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1518.925,1522.11,And this case now before now is not.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1524.84,1525.246,Yes.
1979.78-6809,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1529.945,1530.614,"No, no."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1530.614,1531.236,You see.
1979.78-6809,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1532.817,1539.299,"One can question whether or not it did, but you submit that it didn't."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1539.299,1555.082,"All that Miranda says is, ""Look, will you please take a person into custody, inform him of the fact that he has a right to remain silent because otherwise he may not know and he may be frightened into making a statement,"" you see."
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1575.476,1595.87,"Well, is it your view -- I just want to be sure I understand your theory -- is it your view that anytime a defendant has a constitutional right to remain silent and does so, notwithstanding how relevant that silence may be to the some issue in the case the prosecutor may never bring out the fact of silence because he has a constitutional right to maintain his silence?"
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1595.87,1597.895,"Precisely, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1617.749,1620.822,As long as his speaking might incriminate him.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1620.822,1622.608,"Well, in this case --"
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.608,1632.959,"It is not right and you would qualify your statement, you are relying on the Fifth Amendment --"
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1632.959,1634.778,That is the basic underlying -- yes.
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.778,1639.468,"Well, that is protection against self-incrimination, that entails self-incrimination."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1639.468,1650.223,That is true.
1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1684.101,1685.421,Not necessarily.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1694.409,1697.26,"Why should he have to do that, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1979.78-6809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1709.549,1711.84,Nobody is saying he had to do it.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1711.84,1713.916,"Well, the prosecutor certainly was."
1979.78-6809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1713.916,1726.731,All the prosecutor was saying was that the fact that he didn't do it is relevant in an evidentiary sense in deciding whether or not he was telling the truth at the trial.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1726.731,1735.328,"I am sorry, but I cannot see any difference --"
1979.78-6809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1735.328,1735.647,"Well, I really."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1735.647,1738.302,-- in saying that and saying you had a duty.
1979.78-6809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1738.302,1741.085,I regret my illogic.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1741.085,1743.003,"No, its --"
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1743.003,1759.428,"You say it would just be a contradiction in terms if you added to the Miranda warnings, you tell him you have a right to remain silent and the right to a lawyer and so on; but that if you remain silent your silence may be used against you."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1767.873,1781.35,"Well, if the case is laying down a rule like that, I would just throw up my hands and say I just don't understand the law -- I just don't understand the law."
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1781.35,1799.321,"Mr. Ziemba, supposing that your defendant, your client got on the witness stand and testified that immediately after killing he went to the police chief and told him it was self defense and what happened and he is in fact had been silent and had not gone to the police chief."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1803.299,1808.781,"Well, that's -- then he has gotten on the witness stand and told a deliberate falsehood."
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.781,1817.587,"Well, but that is what the theory of the State is here, that he got on the stand and told a deliberate falsehood, it is inconsistent with his silence."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1817.587,1818.49,No.
1979.78-6809,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1818.49,1822.656,"You disagree with it, but that is their theory."
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1822.656,1831.746,"You see the ultimate question for the jury to decide is whether or not the defendant is telling the truth or not, you see."
1979.78-6809,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1835.325,1837.275,Very well.
1979.78-6809,0,20441,carl_ziemba,,1837.275,1838.483,Thank you.
1979.78-6809,1,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,1842.533,1846.65,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-6809,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2179.703,2184.706,"Well, whether it was inconsistent with his plea or not was a matter for the jury to decide."
1979.78-6809,1,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,2184.706,2186.518,"Yes, sir, and they made their selection."
1979.78-6809,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2186.518,2194.292,"And you suggest that they were influenced to the extent that they reduced this by two grades, from first degree murder down to manslaughter."
1979.78-6809,1,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,2194.292,2195.205,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-6809,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2195.205,2196.996,I see.
1979.78-6809,1,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,2196.996,2211.016,"I say with the acceptance of a theory such as that and making it part of the law of this Nation, I say the handcuffing of prosecuting authorities would certainly occur."
1979.78-6809,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2225.621,2230.178,Do you think that a man charged with a crime is obliged to give himself up?
1979.78-6809,1,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,2230.178,2235.544,"Oh, no, sir, I don't think there is any constitutional duty of that, sir."
1979.78-6809,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.602,2237.886,I thought that is what you were saying.
1979.78-6809,1,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,2237.886,2239.209,"No, sir."
1979.78-6809,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.209,2240.277,I misunderstood you.
1979.78-6809,1,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,2241.37,2267.746,"No, I say that we have the right once he takes the stand to attempt to cast doubt upon his self defense plea and his escape and concealment is certainly an act inconsistent -- and that has been generally held -- with a plea of self defense."
1979.78-6809,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2270.408,2271.638,Very well.
