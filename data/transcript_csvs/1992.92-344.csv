1992.92-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.502,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 92-344, Chris Sale, Acting Commissioner, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service v. The Haitian Centers Council, Inc.--"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,15.891,18.294,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.92-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,106.192,115.839,"Ms. Mahoney, was this directive aimed at any Haitians who were leaving Haiti, or just Haitians who were leaving Haiti for the United States?"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,115.839,119.742,It's directed at Haitians who were leaving for the United States.
1992.92-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,200.41,208.407,"Ms. Mahoney, you don't claim that section 1253(h) is unconstitutional, I take it?"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,208.407,210.928,"No, Your Honor, we're not claiming that it's unconstitutional."
1992.92-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,210.928,214.041,Has any effort been made to amend the statute?
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,214.041,216.071,Since this occurred?
1992.92-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,216.071,216.292,Yes.
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,216.292,218.074,Not that I know of.
1992.92-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.661,283.307,"Ms. Mahoney, after the court of appeal's ruling last spring, was an injunction actually entered by the district court?"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,283.307,285.939,"Yes, it was, Your Honor, but this Court stayed it."
1992.92-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.939,299.526,"And was... did the injunction... was it directed against the Commandant of the Coast Guard and the Commandant of the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, too?"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,299.526,305.47,"Yes, I believe that it was directed against all of the defendants, and definitely against the Commandant of the Coast Guard."
1992.92-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,305.47,308.014,What did it command them to do?
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,308.014,334.812,"It commanded them not to return any interdicted Haitian who would be threatened with persecution in Haiti, and necessarily, in order to comply with that order, Your Honor, we would have to conduct some sort of asylum screening so that we could be in compliance with the injunction, otherwise we wouldn't know whether we were returning someone who might fear persecution."
1992.92-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,334.812,346.131,"Is the asylum screening, Ms. Mahoney, that's taking place in Haiti pursuant to the Government's obligations under section 1253?"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,346.131,348.082,"No, it is not, Your Honor."
1992.92-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,355.508,359.461,So this is just a gratuitous effort on the part of the Government.
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,359.461,370.629,"Well, it is a humanitarian effort on the part of the Government to provide an orderly way for persons with genuine fears of persecution in Haiti to seek asylum and come to the United States."
1992.92-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,410.627,417.242,"If a person in Haiti is found eligible for asylum, what steps are taken to allow him to enter the United States?"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,417.242,432.77,"They are transported to the United States, and hundreds of people have in fact been brought to the United States pursuant to that procedure, which again is being expanded by the President, and emergency refugee funding was just devoted to that."
1992.92-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,471.697,479.201,What is the authority of the United States to conduct such extrastatutory... take such extrastatutory steps?
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,479.201,482.034,"Oh, those are not extrastatutory."
1992.92-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,492.882,493.052,All right.
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,493.052,505.451,--The system that Congress set up really reflects the differences in the obli... in the benefits that are to be afforded to aliens outside the United States and aliens who have reached our shores.
1992.92-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.947,557.74,"None of this has anything to do with the legal issue in front of us, though, I believe."
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,569.269,570.31,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.61,572.893,So maybe we can talk about that legal issue.
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,572.893,610.528,"--The... the point here, Your Honor, is that the power that the President has under 1182(f) and 1185(a)(1) is to adopt procedures... these are in the nature of emergency powers, and they are to adopt procedures in response to crises abroad or international situations which he thinks to be appropriate in the national interest, and it is these combination of procedures, direct return plus the availability of the 207 screening, that makes for both a humanitarian policy and one that is certainly well within his legal authority."
1992.92-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.317,663.193,"Ms. Mahoney, who directs the Coast Guard under the current policy?"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,663.193,666.386,"The Department of Transportation, the Commandant of the Coast Guard."
1992.92-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.031,681.186,Does the Attorney General ordinarily have jurisdiction over the conduct of the United States on the high seas?
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,681.186,683.699,"No, Your Honor, the Attorney General does not."
1992.92-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,723.055,727.029,"Ms. Mahoney, may I just interrupt you on one point before you get too far from it?"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,748.223,781.566,"--Your Honor, you're referring, I believe, to 14 U.S.C. section 89, and it does provide that when the Coast Guard is acting under the... basically as the agent of a particular department, that it will use its procedures, but here it is clear that the Coast Guard is acting at the direction of the President under the President's powers under 1182(f) and 1185(a)(1), and that is a very different source of power than that which is conferred on the Attorney General to enforce our immigration laws within the boundaries of the United States."
1992.92-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,811.696,817.119,So basically your argument is that 1253(f) is really irrelevant to the issue that we've got here.
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,817.119,819.801,"No, Your Honor, I wouldn't say that it's irrelevant."
1992.92-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,857.855,869.982,"Isn't it true that both 1182(f) and 1185 deal with the power of the President to prevent entry into the United States, rather than to return to any particular destination?"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,871.795,872.536,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1992.92-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.148,887.947,That's right.
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,888.919,889.119,Right.
1992.92-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,889.119,889.94,To suspend entry.
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,889.94,900.274,"To... to suspend entry, but 1185(a)(1) specifically talks about prohibiting travel, and by adopting rules and regulations that he deems appropriate."
1992.92-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.274,905.578,"Well, it deals with aliens who are to depart or enter, or attempt to enter or depart."
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,905.578,906.249,"Attempt to enter, Your Honor."
1992.92-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.695,944.756,"Not, but if there were another statute that said you shall never send anybody to Cuba, for example in so many words, that wouldn't... this statute would be... the statute on the books would still leave the President full of power to control entry and departures from the United States."
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,952.242,961.359,"Well... well, that could be, except that in this case these facts demonstrate that that would make the powers that have been conferred on the President ineffective under these circumstances."
1992.92-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.697,976.177,Right.
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,976.177,989.238,"So, in other words, the... it would be difficult to believe that Congress intended to skirt... circumscribe the President's authority in a way that he has to permit a mass migration across the seas to our shores."
1992.92-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.802,999.789,"Well... well maybe it's impractical and unrealistic, but at least theoretically consistently with the law, he could interdict them and send them someplace other than... than Haiti."
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,999.789,1000.28,Well--
1992.92-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.28,1004.201,And that would be consistent with the statutory authority to keep everybody out of the United States.
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1004.201,1005.633,--Uh--
1992.92-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1005.633,1007.734,Maybe he can't do that as a practical matter.
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1007.734,1007.884,--But he can't do that.
1992.92-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.674,1011.287,"But if you just look at the words, it's consistent with the various--"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1011.287,1016.939,"--He can't enforce the prohibition and 1253(h) is not directed to the President, it's directed to the attorney general."
1992.92-344,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.939,1017.25,"--The attorney general, I understand."
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1017.25,1029.409,"I'd also like to turn to the fact that the court of appeals didn't address the threshold issue really, of why it could assert jurisdiction in this case, what was the cause of action here?"
1992.92-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1090.122,1090.303,Yes.
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1113.539,1122.774,"Your Honor, if self-executing were meant to create a cause of action, an actual cause of action on behalf of that alien, I suppose that's true."
1992.92-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1135.023,1136.385,Do we have any treaties--
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1136.385,1136.525,And it was--
1992.92-344,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1136.525,1142.467,--Which create causes of action analogous to the one we're discussing in this hypothetical?
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1142.467,1143.639,"--I don't know the answer to that, Your Honor."
1992.92-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1210.978,1233.252,"Ms. Mahoney, does... does that mean that if, say, a Haitian appears at the American consulate in Port-au-Prince and makes a case for political asylum and the consul simply misunderstands the law and says there is no case, does that person then have no remedy in the United States courts unless--"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1233.252,1233.763,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1290.022,1292.272,--Why wouldn't they have a claim under the APA?
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1295.284,1300.99,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that the APA is territorial only, but the INA precludes review."
1992.92-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1428.177,1446.549,"Does 1253(h) rest on the assumption that the... the powers over the very subject matter that you are describing, or the executive power over the very subject matter that you are describing will be exercised only by the attorney general, and is that why 1253(h) is addressed only to the attorney general?"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1446.549,1458.738,"No, Your Honor, I think that 1253(h) is addressed only to the attorney general because it is only addressed to the removal of aliens within our territory and that is done only by the attorney general."
1992.92-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1468.085,1469.314,"Well, may I... just because time is short--"
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1469.314,1469.485,--Certainly.
1992.92-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1469.485,1471.237,--May I interrupt you with another question.
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1499.995,1507.231,"If I understand your question, Your Honor, you're saying that we should conclude that the President's authority was circumscribed or that he did not have authority to do this."
1992.92-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1507.231,1514.126,"That... that it was circumscribed and it's a circumscription which, at least as a Constitutional matter, is not presently before us."
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1514.126,1534.9,"No, Your Honor, I don't think we could construe it to circumscribe the President's authority in that... in that light, especially since in Knauff v. Shaughnessy itself, the President suspended exclusion hearings which were required by statute for an alien bride who was entitled to admission so that she could be with her husband, if she was otherwise admissable."
1992.92-344,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1606.627,1609.989,Was... was that concern expressed by others than the Dutch and the Swiss?
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1609.989,1633.396,"Well, it... it was responded to by the President, I believe in July... in the July 11th negotiating session as well, saying that there was no great... he was responding to concerns that it might be applied extraterritorially and pointed out that the second paragraph specifically refers to where the alien is and that that was a territorial limitation."
1992.92-344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1681.864,1684.835,"Well, before you sit down, a couple of irrelevant questions."
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1686.765,1687.987,"No, Your Honor, I have not."
1992.92-344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1687.987,1695.01,Are you familiar with a book called The Comedians by Graham Greene?
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1695.01,1696.762,"No, Your Honor, I'm sorry, I'm not."
1992.92-344,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1696.762,1698.041,I recommend it to you.
1992.92-344,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1698.041,1698.672,Thank you.
1992.92-344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.672,1701.645,"Thank you, Ms. Mahoney."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,1703.768,1722.692,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1992.92-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.217,1786.144,"Mr. Koh, uh, uh, Ms. Mahoney says that the order is directed just at Haitians who are leaving Haiti for the United States."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,1786.144,1791.717,"--Your Honor, they are not interdicting people and asking them: Are you going to the United States?"
1992.92-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1797.373,1802.756,"Well, then, are... are they... are they out of compliance with the President's order?"
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,1802.756,1810.803,"Your Honor, if someone was coming from 700 miles away and past many countries, it would be quite a while before we were sure what their ultimate destination was."
1992.92-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1832.429,1843.488,"Well, if you set up an interdiction order 13 miles outside the United States you turn people back for what may be a very perilous hundreds of miles of... of journey."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,1843.488,1862.17,"I understand that, Your Honor, but if you refer to the Government's brief, on page three, they point out that under the old interdiction program, the one that operated under President Reagan and President Bush for more than 10 years, where there was minimal screening applied, that that program was very effective, and that it saved thousands of lives."
1992.92-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1898.11,1905.133,You... you have joined the commandant of the Coast Guard and the Commandant of Guantanamo?
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,1905.133,1906.145,"That's right, Your Honor."
1992.92-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2006.073,2008.525,"Yes, but, Mr. Koh, that's the issue."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2015.03,2021.986,"--Well, Your Honor, the point that we have made in our brief is that you must look to the broader purposes of this statute."
1992.92-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2023.285,2023.635,"Yes, I understand."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2033.541,2035.404,"--Well, that's a further point of our contention."
1992.92-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2047.194,2049.795,It... it'd really help me if I... I understood what your answer to my question was.
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2049.795,2056.19,"--Your Honor, what we're saying is that the question here is when the attorney general takes the immigration laws out onto the high--"
1992.92-344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.19,2058.762,"Let me just state my question, so you understand it clearly."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2074.581,2076.185,"--If the issue were posed that way, yes, I would agree, Your Honor."
1992.92-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.246,2205.979,"Since it is good for it to be that way, it must be that way."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2220.801,2222.913,"Justice Scalia, there is a law against it."
1992.92-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.065,2224.625,"Well, let's talk about the law."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2269.616,2269.947,--Justice--
1992.92-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2269.947,2273.439,That one contained explicitly a territorial limitation.
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2277.692,2280.974,"--Justice Scalia, I would... uh... differ with your interpretation of the case."
1992.92-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.319,2362.341,"Well, here's what we said in Stevic."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2385.679,2385.94,But--
1992.92-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.94,2393.447,"--That if one of the differences was no extraterritorial application, that would have been... would have been a prominent one that... that we would have mentioned."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2393.447,2404.074,"--But, Your Honor, if you read on, what you will see is that it was suggested that the attorney general honored the dictates of article 33, and thereby exercised his discretion in conformity with it."
1992.92-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2404.074,2407.107,"Yes, but we mention nothing about extraterritoriality."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2407.107,2411.882,"Your Honor, that's because no extraterritorial interceptions and returns were going on at the time."
1992.92-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2411.882,2417.556,"But... but that language leaps out at you, ""within the United States"", in the earlier version."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2417.556,2418.187,Your Honor--
1992.92-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2418.187,2424.01,"And if we had thought that that was a difference from the protocol and from article 33, we would certainly have noticed it."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2424.01,2426.292,"--Your Honor, we cite here simply plain language."
1992.92-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2437.75,2448.109,"Well, but we acknowledge that even with that language, before it was removed, it was in conformity with article 33 and the protocol."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2457.474,2460.736,"But that illustrates, Justice Scalia, is the point that was raised by Justice Kennedy."
1992.92-344,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2490.21,2502.575,"Mr. Koh, what did the 11th Circuit think the statute meant, and determine that it meant, in the case that was brought there in the 11th Circuit?"
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2502.575,2508.071,"Your Honor, the 11th Circuit accepted in dictum the assertion which is now being made by the Government."
1992.92-344,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2514.178,2519.653,"Now, are you going to address any question of collateral estoppel in your comments today?"
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2519.653,2519.904,"Yes, I will."
1992.92-344,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2540.029,2551.028,"Well, if you read the court's description of the class, it certainly is broad enough to include the people that you have... uh... that you're representing today."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2551.028,2554.839,"--We would challenge that, Your Honor, as the 2nd Circuit pointed out below."
1992.92-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2715.766,2734.7,"Mr. Koh, do you agree with Ms. Mahoney that if a Haitian makes an application for political at the consultant in Port-au-Prince, and the consul does not follow applicable law in processing it, that Haitian, nonetheless, does not have a remedy in the United States courts."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2734.7,2739.923,"--Yes, we do, and this comes back to the point that I was making with Justice Stevens."
1992.92-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2881.89,2884.941,"Mr. Koh, could I ask you another question about the prior suit."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2900.901,2902.864,"That's right, Your Honor, and we represent no screened-outs here."
1992.92-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.864,2904.024,And pardon me?
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2904.024,2905.486,We represent no screened-outs here.
1992.92-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2905.486,2906.067,Okay.
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2911.7,2915.731,It would affect those people who have been screened in or who will be screened in.
1992.92-344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2918.712,2924.097,"How can this injunction apply to only... you know, only that class and not the other class."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,2926.341,2931.843,--All that we're... the Government has no... they claim to have a problem with the injunction.
1992.92-344,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3258.503,3266.878,"Do you take the position that it's irrelevant whether the treaty is self executing or not self executing, because it's been executed through the statute?"
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,3266.878,3270.782,We believe that that only reinforces our result.
1992.92-344,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3281.318,3290.247,"But it's... you're... you're... it's not fatal to your case to find that the treaty is not self executing because of the statute, I take it."
1992.92-344,1,27441,harold_hongju_koh,,3290.247,3294.106,"--Because of the statute, which expressly embodies the treaty."
1992.92-344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3322.545,3324.748,"Thank you, Mr. Koh."
1992.92-344,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3327.6,3347.252,"There's a basic principle in our law that is reflected in Johnson v. Eisentrager, it's reflected in the INA, it's reflected in the construction of 243(h) that governed here for 30 years, that ordinarily an alien's right to protection from a country only arises when they arrive in the territory of the United States."
1992.92-344,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3370.186,3371.608,Then... then why didn't it say so?
1992.92-344,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3375.989,3385.727,"The word return, as Judge Walker notes in his dissent, had been used as a reference in statutes before to the manner in which you exclude people from the United States."
1992.92-344,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3452.903,3454.705,"Thank you, Ms. Mahoney."
