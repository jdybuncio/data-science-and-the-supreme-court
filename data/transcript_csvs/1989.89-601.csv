1989.89-601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.622,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 89-601, the Commissioner of the... Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Marie Lucie Jean."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,13.924,16.76,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-601,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,105.75,112.339,"Well, what is there in the statute which justifies our making the distinction between the merits stage and the fee stage?"
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,121.112,127.599,"No, Your Honor, it is that point where the parties really disagree, and it is that point that I was about to address right now."
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,187.321,189.923,"Mr. Larkin, can I interrupt with something that ran through my mind?"
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,209.468,212.639,"--Well, that is one way to break the statute down."
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,243.724,245.76,I know you could draw the line either of the ways.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,250.228,253.866,"Well, in most cases there are not going to be a difference."
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,253.866,254.332,If cases are--
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,254.332,259.935,"The one... there is... there will be a category of cases where there is a difference, and that is this category."
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,325.045,327.997,--But I still don't think I have an answer to my rather simple question.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,351.962,358.766,"We... we think that if we were substantially justified in that sort of circumstance on the remedial stage, you wouldn't get fees for that part."
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,363.27,371.007,"But your position is anything that is severable as to which you have a substantial... substantially justified position, no fees as to that phase of the litigation."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,371.007,371.491,--Yes.
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.632,384.317,What do you mean could?
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,392.237,393.289,Yes.
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,393.639,400.526,Or are you saying that it's up to the discretion of the... of the district court to decide whether it is going to do the one or the other?
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,400.526,401.376,--The former.
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.376,402.095,Okay.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,402.095,412.168,The legal rule would... in that case would rest and give primary emphasis to that portion of the statute which says the fee request has to be made once the final non-appealable judgment is entered.
1989.89-601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,418.388,428.695,I would think Hensley would... the Hensley case would support some sort of distinction whether or not you make a formal break down between two sections of the case.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,436.885,442.955,"Yes, Your Honor, and Hensley, as we explained in our opening brief, would be authority for looking at the statute that way."
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.084,546.107,"Mr. Larkin, what do you do about the perpetual motion objection that is made here by... by the respondent?"
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,546.107,546.64,Your Honor--
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.64,548.173,That is to say it will never end.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,565.684,569.286,"--Your Honor, my answer to that is a practical one."
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.622,598.005,What court can decide that all at once?
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,598.489,599.055,--The district court.
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.055,599.741,The district court.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,599.741,603.043,"In a lawsuit that begins in the district court, the district court can make that inquiry."
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.145,607.578,Fine.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,607.578,608.347,--for the court of appeals.
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.347,608.98,Right.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,608.98,613.799,The court of appeals will then be able to look at all of those at one time.
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.469,619.236,"Well... well... but, excuse me."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,629.511,635.497,--If... if the court of appeals goes through all of those inquiries and rules against us on every one--
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,635.497,635.997,Right.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,635.997,641.901,--what is left at that point is the question of whether or not they spent a reasonable number of hours on the appeal.
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.19,657.094,"Oh, there... there is no inquiry as to whether your appeal was reasonable?"
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,657.094,660.28,"Well, if the court of appeals concluded--"
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,660.28,663.748,"I mean, they could find against you even though you were reasonable."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,663.748,664.184,"--Well, that's right."
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,668.052,669.119,Right.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,669.119,670.688,--that our position--
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.688,671.354,Was wrong.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,671.354,682.728,"--was wrong, and we were unreasonable in taking the appeal, then the other side would be entitled to fees in the court of appeals, and the question would just be a reasonable number of hours."
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.728,683.111,Okay.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,688.299,696.303,"If the... if the court of appeals rules against us and says they are eligible for fees, the court of appeals can then ask the parties to submit the number of hours they reasonably spent on the appeal."
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.303,697.321,Suppose the court of appeals doesn't say anything?
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,701.273,704.409,"Well, then the other party is certainly going to file a request."
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.875,706.427,Before the district court.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,706.427,708.261,"--No, or before the court of appeals."
1989.89-601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,732.411,736.03,Is there any question involved here of fees on appeal?
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,736.03,745.069,"Well, the narrow question that the court of appeals addressed in this case really just dealt with the fees in the district court, because there haven't been any calculation yet or anything made to fees on appeal."
1989.89-601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,745.069,752.14,So we are talking about fees for fee litigation in the district court for work done in the district court.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,752.14,752.506,Correct.
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,755.458,756.009,May I ask--
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,772.853,773.571,Correct.
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.771,788.831,"Well, if... if... if you say that there are these discrete stages, how does your concession square with your argument that there are discrete stages?"
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,788.831,792.967,"--Well, that... that serves as the bridge from the merits to the fee stage."
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,797.52,807.542,And they are entitled to all of the time they expend reasonably in compiling their hours and making their fee request.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,809.361,811.094,"Well, what we said was--"
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,811.094,813.463,Isn't that a fee on a fee that you don't want to pay?
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,813.463,813.846,"--No, no."
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.45,822.236,"Well, why isn't it a fee on a fee?"
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,822.236,826.438,"Well, if they are entitled to fees on the merits, we thought that that was best seen as part of the merits."
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,833.277,836.895,"Well then, what is, what is wrong with... what are you complaining about now?"
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,837.778,840.78,--What we're complaining about is this.
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,873.235,873.652,"Yes, but--"
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,873.652,884.792,"--has to apply, because it's the only requirement that there is in the statute, and because the Congress required... limited the waiver of its sovereign immunity to situations where we were not substantially justified."
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.792,885.342,"--But, Mr. Larkin--"
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,885.342,888.613,"We don't think there should be an exception, in other words, just for fee litigation."
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.613,902.271,"--Well, what if you... what if you challenged the number of hours or the rate that is to be applied, and the district court thinks your position is substantially justified, but just plain wrong?"
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,912.312,912.946,"No, no."
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,927.571,934.059,But you don't think they would be entitled to fees for defending that submission?
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,934.059,938.511,"--If we are substantially justified, they are not entitled to fees for defending that submission."
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.463,942.498,What if they... but if you weren't substantially justified?
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,942.498,943.315,Then they are.
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.315,944.415,Just like any other--
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,944.415,945.95,That's right.
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,948.835,963.578,"--Well, what about you challenge, you say that you challenge the fee because you think on the merits you were substantially justified, and the court says well, you were, but you are wrong."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,963.578,963.944,--Then they--
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.944,964.878,You say no fee?
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,964.878,966.363,--Then they don't get a fee at all.
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,969.129,970.731,"No, no."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,973.165,973.931,--That's right.
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.55,980.104,"I am still puzzled about this bright line, because it seems to me that there are fee requests and fee requests."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1004.886,1007.088,"No, if... if... that would not be."
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.91,1026.55,"So what you do, then, you spend lots and lots of time itemizing and documenting so you are sure nobody is going to raise any questions about the form of your submission, because you know you will get paid for that."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1026.55,1031.404,"--Well, if... and if that is what happens, then that should simplify the litigation over this matter."
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.831,1050.031,Without the... I see.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1050.031,1055.335,"--then, if they... if they do that, then we are reasonable, because they are not following the law in that circuit."
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.335,1056.319,May I ask a question?
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1072.88,1075.315,I'm not sure whether there is any uniform rule on that.
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.2,1084.588,"Because it would seem to me that if you have made that determination, then you know you are going to get fees and you would pay them."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1088.856,1089.575,--It's possible.
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1120.111,1129.7,"--Well, now the time that is compensable for preparing the fee request, suppose some of that time is devoted to research to develop the argument that there was no substantial justification?"
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1137.223,1139.425,"That would be, under the way we've looked at the statute."
1989.89-601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1139.425,1144.56,So a lot of their research and work on the substantial justification issue would be compensable under your bright line.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1144.56,1151.031,"They only have 30 days to do it, so it is not as if someone can prepare, you know, the same way that you can for litigation on the merits."
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.745,1225.364,"Mr. Larkin, you are going to do it issue by issue?"
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1250.979,1252.014,--You could.
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.249,1331.716,"Well, I suppose it could be that the time in litigating the government's objection to fees on the ground that your position was reasonably justified, it could be that the time litigating that might exceed, in terms of attorneys fees, might exceed any recovery that--"
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1331.716,1334.252,"Well, it would be an unusual case for that to happen."
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.402,1344.874,"--Well, it may be, but I suppose if, if the... suppose there weren't any recovery."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1348.81,1352.214,"--Well, it... there wouldn't be any dollar award in that case to a party."
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.214,1352.88,Exactly.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1352.88,1353.28,But--
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1353.28,1355.249,But there would be an attorneys fee.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1355.249,1356.199,--There would be an attorneys fee.
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1356.199,1357.732,If you were not substantially justified.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1357.732,1358.133,Correct.
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.985,1375.043,"And if they are not entitled to fees for proving that you were not substantially justified, why, every dollar they pay their attorney for that litigation comes out of their own pocket."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1375.043,1376.495,"Well, they are entitled to--"
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.495,1395.541,And I would think... don't you think that Congress had some idea of making a recovery... rendering the plaintiff cost free for attorneys fees if he prevails and the government's position was untenable?
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1395.541,1399.36,"--Well, if our position at the fee stage is, as you put it, untenable--"
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.36,1399.96,"No, on the merits."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1400.56,1408.55,"--Oh, well, if our position on the merits was untenable, then they will get an award of fees for the time they spent to vindicate their rights at the merit stage."
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.55,1418.156,"But not at the time... not if you oppose their submission and say that you were substantially justified, and then thereafter you litigate like mad."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1422.976,1423.56,Correct.
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1424.493,1431.832,And so every dollar they pay their attorney to oppose your submission is out of their pocket.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1431.832,1433.532,"For the fee litigation, yes."
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.618,1435.251,"No, no."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1437.118,1437.836,--For the merits?
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.286,1444.473,--Every dollar that they pay their attorney reduces in effect their recovery on the merits.
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1444.473,1445.689,That... that's correct.
1989.89-601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.925,1450.127,Don't you think Congress had some idea that it ought to be cost free to them?
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1450.127,1451.093,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1467.089,1485.966,"Mr. Larkin, when you are... what you are proposing is that the standard where... where you have lost on the merits, but you assert that attorneys fees should not have been awarded because although you lost, you were substantially justified."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1496.941,1497.441,And that can--
1989.89-601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1497.441,1499.726,You think the judicial mind can entertain this concept?
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1500.593,1501.876,--Yes.
1989.89-601,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1533.414,1540.185,"Well, but if that is true, Counsel, the district judge was also reasonable in making the original fee award, so far as appeals are concerned."
1989.89-601,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1540.185,1545.839,"--I am not saying you can just tally up the numbers on each side, but what I am trying to do is give you an example of how that can occur."
1989.89-601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1555.813,1557.113,"Very well, Mr. Larkin."
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1558.932,1561.265,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-601,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1661.48,1667.82,"Well, Mr. Kurzban, wasn't our decision in Commissioner against Jean several years ago, wasn't that part of this case?"
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1667.82,1668.486,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-601,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1668.486,1670.938,"Well, that wasn't fee litigation, was it?"
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1670.938,1671.922,"No, Your Honor, it was not."
1989.89-601,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1671.922,1676.157,So the merits have also been litigated during this period of time.
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1676.157,1682.996,"That's correct, but the government's position has not been advanced one iota since that litigation."
1989.89-601,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.272,1702.307,"Just a minute, Mr. Kurzban."
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1714.099,1715.051,"--Oh, I am sorry, Your Honor."
1989.89-601,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1788.413,1806.91,"Mr. Kurzban, under your view of the statute, do you nonetheless concede that under Hensley the district court has considerable discretion about allowing fees at all, for instance for losing claims, if several claims are made?"
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1806.91,1807.826,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1989.89-601,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1807.826,1817.166,"And also, discretion to determine what is reasonable for attorneys fees, and perhaps to adjust within that category."
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1817.166,1817.866,Absolutely.
1989.89-601,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.069,1936.611,"Mr. Kurzban, how, what... let's take the government's doomsday case, where... where you come in with a fee request that is plainly in excess of the statutory limit, and there's no justification."
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1947.051,1952.805,"--Under Hensley rationale, we might not be entitled to the fees for the appeal."
1989.89-601,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.805,1953.221,Well--
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1953.221,1956.923,And we might not be entitled to the fees for pursuing that issue.
1989.89-601,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.923,1958.042,--On appeal.
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1958.042,1961.311,"On appeal, and in... and in the district court we might not be entitled to those."
1989.89-601,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1961.311,1966.731,"But then... but then you have already divided the litigation into two pieces, which you say is a no-no."
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1966.731,1967.998,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-601,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.736,1976.736,You get all your fees.
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1976.736,1977.653,--No.
1989.89-601,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.321,2023.134,"Well, if the government then says well, we oppose this fee request because we think the hours spent were excessive, or the rate requested is too high, and the district court agrees with them, you're not entitled to fees for defending your submission?"
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2023.134,2029.121,"On those issues, under Hensley, under a reasonableness test, yes, we would not be entitled to it."
1989.89-601,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.052,2138.092,Suppose we thought that there was something to the government's submission that fee litigation really is a separate lawsuit.
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2146.132,2152.602,"No, because the statute says that it's fees in the civil action."
1989.89-601,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.486,2166.696,"Well, I know, but I am just assuming that... I guess we disagree with you on that, that fee litigation is a waiver of sovereign immunity really, involves a waiver of sovereign immunity."
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2177.384,2177.851,--Okay.
1989.89-601,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.553,2182.455,I believe they just said it right here in Court.
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2182.455,2186.573,"--Well, they take the position that the fees are fees in the civil action."
1989.89-601,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.167,2200.733,"Well, I agree."
1989.89-601,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2214.426,2229.936,"--Well, assuming the hypothetical, and obviously we don't want to concede that, but assuming what Your Honor is saying is correct, I think the answer is that no, the substantial justification threshold would not apply, because it would defeat the very purpose of the act for the very reasons that you have suggested."
1989.89-601,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2312.09,2313.84,"Thank you, Mr. Kurzban."
1989.89-601,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2316.708,2318.927,And I will make only two points.
1989.89-601,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2377.882,2378.932,"Thank you, Mr. Larkin."
