1988.87-826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.237,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-826, Goldberg v. Sweet."
1988.87-826,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,9.439,10.056,All right.
1988.87-826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,10.056,12.741,--until some of the people clear out or stop talking.
1988.87-826,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,24.715,25.331,Thank you.
1988.87-826,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,92.51,98.497,Why... why is it you say that they levy it on the whole of the... of the service?
1988.87-826,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,131.051,138.372,"--No, Your Honor, because the State courts have held already that the tax is, in fact, levied on the entirety of the call."
1988.87-826,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.472,228.696,"Well, Mr. Smith, to get back to Justice Scalia's question, do you think Illinois could have imposed a gross receipts tax on all of the charges charged in Illinois on the call--"
1988.87-826,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,228.696,229.296,"Well, this--"
1988.87-826,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,229.296,230.863,--the totality of the charge?
1988.87-826,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,230.863,232.398,"--If it had been apportioned, Your Honor."
1988.87-826,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,234.517,245.472,"Don't you think under our precedents, under sales tax generally, that a tax imposed by Illinois on the totality of the charge would be upheld?"
1988.87-826,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,245.472,255.18,"--Not whereas here, Your Honor, part of the commerce by definition occurs outside the taxing State."
1988.87-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,282.097,297.007,"It seems to me that everything you have said so far, if you transfer it to our case in D. H. Holmes that we had last year involving the catalogs, means that we were wrong in reaching the decision we reached in the catalog case."
1988.87-826,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,297.007,298.624,"No, Your Honor, I would say not because--"
1988.87-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,298.624,301.809,The transaction takes place in part out of state.
1988.87-826,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,315.302,317.42,"--No, Your Honor."
1988.87-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,333.613,337.315,"Well, but it... it was a use tax based on the value of the catalogs."
1988.87-826,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,337.315,342.803,"--And the use tax, Your Honor, was levied only upon the in-state distribution of the catalogs."
1988.87-826,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,347.623,350.392,"Well, here no call that's not billed to Illinois is taxed."
1988.87-826,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,361.282,362.232,Illinois--
1988.87-826,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,362.232,369.603,But it... but it... but... but... and it... and it taxes it even though it happens to be paid in another State.
1988.87-826,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,369.603,370.638,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1988.87-826,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,371.888,380.244,"So, a gross receipts tax would not cover a call that is billed to an Illinois number but sent to Washington and is paid there."
1988.87-826,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,380.844,390.85,"--Your Honor, the construction of this statute is that the tax is levied only upon calls that are charged to an Illinois service address--"
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1515.996,1524.234,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-826,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1595.532,1603.786,"Mr. Frey, what about a call from Chicago to Seattle that someone in Florida puts on his Florida credit card... on his Florida--"
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1603.786,1605.721,You mean charges to his Florida number?
1988.87-826,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.721,1607.104,"--Charges to the Florida number, but it's--"
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1607.104,1608.423,It's clearly not taxed by Illinois.
1988.87-826,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1608.423,1609.189,--It's definitely not taxed.
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1609.189,1610.106,Definitely not taxed.
1988.87-826,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1624.349,1631.352,"If an Illinois subscriber makes a call from Florida to Seattle, charges it to his Illinois number."
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1631.352,1632.038,That is not taxed.
1988.87-826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.775,1642.644,But it doesn't have to be paid by anybody by that address.
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1644.762,1648.298,The statute expressly says that it's irrelevant where it's billed or paid.
1988.87-826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.298,1648.598,Right.
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1648.598,1656.737,"And GTE makes a lot of the fact that it can be billed or paid someplace else, and that that means it's not an Illinois sale, which is obviously I think not the case."
1988.87-826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2037.75,2038.55,Why?
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2038.55,2044.939,There would be a serious problem because that tax would not pass the internal consistency test because--
1988.87-826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2044.939,2054.544,You mean... you mean the other... if another State... it would just be... what you're saying is it would be double taxation of the same call.
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2055.078,2061.132,"--There would be the... at least the potential for double taxation, and there would be actual double taxation with many other States."
1988.87-826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.006,2083.148,"So, as a... so, with respect to the Washington statute, for example, you think the... if there's a problem, the credit cures it, or is there a problem at all?"
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2083.148,2093.669,"Well, I don't think... I don't think there's a problem, and I will get in a moment to why I don't think there is any problem at all even though you could hypothesize a particular phone call that might be taxed twice."
1988.87-826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.455,2100.24,"Well, let's say... let's... let's suppose... just suppose a phone call like that."
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2102.859,2104.477,The credit would cure it anyway.
1988.87-826,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2136.448,2147.721,I'm told the credit provision only applies if the same taxpayer is asked to pay twice.
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2157.862,2159.814,"--It could, and I don't think that would be a problem for reasons I'll get to."
1988.87-826,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2249.471,2263.279,"Before you leave that, Mr. Frey, they... they... as I understand your opponent, he said, well, but in order to take that position, you have to mix up your taxpayers and lump them all together in a way that Scheiner prohibits."
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2263.279,2266.767,--I'm... Scheiner is one of my very favorite cases.
1988.87-826,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2266.767,2267.617,"Well, I would think it would be."
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2267.617,2273.004,But I can't say that I'm... that I understand what it is that he is referring to in Scheiner.
1988.87-826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.125,2337.91,"Well, your opponents don't represent callers."
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2344.981,2347.183,--They represent residents of Illinois.
1988.87-826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.183,2348.233,Well--
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2348.233,2352.604,"Well, GTE is a carrier."
1988.87-826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.604,2352.97,--Yes.
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2352.97,2359.491,But the incidence of the tax we are told... we are told we can't look at this as a gross receipts tax on GTE.
1988.87-826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.548,2388.343,"Well, I suppose part of the argument is that the... is that it doesn't make any difference how... what distance the interstate call covers, and the longer it is, the less connection really that Illinois has for it."
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2389.643,2392.811,--Let me... let me say--
1988.87-826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.811,2396.163,--You can only call in-state between the borders of the State.
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2396.163,2400.983,"--I mean, that is true, but I guess there are several things to be said about that."
1988.87-826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2400.983,2405.269,And the carrier says I'm carrying this call from China.
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2405.269,2406.019,"Yes, all right."
1988.87-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2474.794,2484.352,You're saying it's the same price as the ordinary sales tax because a certain portion of the price of any tangible goods has to be attributable to--
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2484.352,2485.085,It's the point you made in your--
1988.87-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.085,2486.785,--to the transportation of those goods from elsewhere.
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2486.785,2487.221,--Right.
1988.87-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2487.221,2489.021,"So, every sales tax has that effect."
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2489.021,2489.671,Yes.
1988.87-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2671.638,2674.49,Have we ever applied that... that requirement to a sales tax?
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2674.49,2679.81,--You've never... a sales tax is an unapportioned tax.
1988.87-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2684.798,2688.666,"If we regarded this as a sales tax, we wouldn't even have to confront that problem."
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2688.666,2691.035,I think you would not have to confront that problem.
1988.87-826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2952.684,2958.421,"Assuming what you have just said is true, assuming everybody adopts the same scheme, right, as Illinois?"
1988.87-826,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2960.79,2968.146,"--No, I don't... I don't care... let me... let me get to that because that is a point that has come up several times."
1988.87-826,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3247.924,3249.46,"Thank you, Mr. Frey."
1988.87-826,2,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,3251.662,3252.795,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
