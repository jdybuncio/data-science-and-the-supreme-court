1982.82-502,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.98,"We will hear arguments next in the case of Pallas Shipping Agency, Ltd. against Joseph Duris."
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,75.845,76.875,Thank you.
1982.82-502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,415.802,430.531,"Mr. Carle, would you agree that the statutory term compensation order is a term of art as it's used elsewhere in the Longshoremen's and Harborworker's Act?"
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,430.531,443.306,That troubles me on the term of art.
1982.82-502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,474.121,488.726,"I think the Solicitor General's brief indicated support for that concept and I wondered if that were true, why the same meaning wouldn't carry forward in Section 33(b)."
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,488.726,495.457,"Well, it's certainly our contention that it don't."
1982.82-502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,495.457,505.47,"There doesn't seem to be any real reason why the term wouldn't mean the same thing in all sections, including this one."
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,543.719,548.389,"That, I don't believe, is quite correct."
1982.82-502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,584.906,589.981,"Well, this one came as a result of a formal hearing, which is one way to do it."
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,606.428,611.8,--I find no authority for that in the regulations or the Act itself.
1982.82-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1349.362,1351.627,"Before you do that, Mr. Carle, can I ask you just one--"
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1351.627,1352.142,Certainly.
1982.82-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1352.142,1353.252,--one specific question?
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1364.965,1365.7,Yes.
1982.82-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1384.129,1384.754,I understand.
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1384.754,1390.502,"And after the 206, of course, it would continue at the same rate."
1982.82-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.68,1421.646,"You then are not relying on the 208, because your brief says when the 206 and 208 were filed."
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1421.646,1422.177,--Yes.
1982.82-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1427.675,1429.018,But you don't today?
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1429.018,1429.752,Pardon?
1982.82-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1429.752,1431.359,You don't today.
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1431.359,1440.466,"No, we suggested that it could be used as one means of determining when an award might be entered."
1982.82-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.69,1466.939,What if he had a permanent disability case?
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1466.939,1467.939,Pardon?
1982.82-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1467.939,1473.359,"What if you have permanent disability, so that your period of payments extended for a longer period of time?"
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1473.359,1474.484,No.
1982.82-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.827,1481.761,What I'm really trying to find out is whether you really rely on the 208 form at all or not.
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1487.307,1504.458,"It's a form... it's one of the considerations which we propose that this court might consider and, as I say, I understand it has the advantage of certainty after a temporary disability period."
1982.82-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.458,1504.926,In a temporary disability case.
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1504.926,1511.875,It has the disadvantage of handing the employer a stale claim.
1982.82-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.875,1522.324,"I suppose the trouble with the form 206 is that it's a little bit contrary to the terms of the statute, because that form, in terms, is compensation without an award."
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1526.51,1533.602,"Yes, but really, as we pointed out in our brief, all compensation starts without an award."
1982.82-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1538.755,1542.083,"But the statute talks about an award, that's the problem."
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1542.083,1542.77,Yes.
1982.82-502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1633.232,1646.477,"Mr. Carle, it seems to me that the interpretation you ask us to make here would render meaningless the penalty provision in Section 14."
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1671.92,1680.369,"Well, I would just have to respectably disagree, Justice O'Connor."
1982.82-502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1692.224,1708.187,"But it's your position, now, that just starting payments, making payments to the employee, in effect, amounts to an award by a compensation order under Rule... Section 33."
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1716.684,1718.01,--That's correct.
1982.82-502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1719.807,1729.256,"So you don't need Section 14 to say there are two kinds of penalties, the ten percent and the twenty percent because you never use the ten percent."
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1730.209,1735.192,"Well, it would depend on how long and when they started the compensation."
1982.82-502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1738.862,1742.189,But your position is that once you make a payment--
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1742.189,1742.814,--I understand.
1982.82-502,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1744.235,1755.183,"--as an employer, then that's an award equivalent to an award by a compensation order so, thereafter, you have only the 20 percent penalty and you'd never reach the ten percent."
1982.82-502,0,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,1758.089,1766.648,"Well, you would certainly need it, for instance, the act provides for contravention immediately or within 14 days."
1982.82-502,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1792.824,1800.244,Mr. Gallagher.
1982.82-502,1,42716,thomas_w_gallagher,,1800.244,1802.477,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1982.82-502,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2037.68,2043.131,"Does this happen frequently in this area of the law, where the injured party makes a deal with the shipowner?"
1982.82-502,1,42716,thomas_w_gallagher,,2043.131,2043.881,--Very rare.
1982.82-502,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2043.881,2045.052,Why is that?
1982.82-502,1,42716,thomas_w_gallagher,,2045.052,2050.222,I think that the situation is such that the longshoremen really follow what the dictations of the law are.
1982.82-502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2689.526,2692.415,"Mr. Gallagher, may I ask you a question?"
1982.82-502,1,42716,thomas_w_gallagher,,2703.144,2711.751,"I think that you have to go right back to the statute, that there still is a six month statute of limitations, only on those occasions, however, when there is an award."
1982.82-502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.751,2714.64,"Under 98 percent of the cases, there's no award."
1982.82-502,1,42716,thomas_w_gallagher,,2714.64,2719.107,"Well, in most situations, it's up to the employer."
1982.82-502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.851,2738.552,"Well, but that's really not my question."
1982.82-502,1,42716,thomas_w_gallagher,,2746.972,2747.518,Potentially you could.
1982.82-502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2747.518,2749.908,You think it's... you think you could.
1982.82-502,1,42716,thomas_w_gallagher,,2749.908,2750.174,I think you could.
1982.82-502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2807.166,2808.557,It could have been filed.
1982.82-502,1,42716,thomas_w_gallagher,,2810.196,2810.993,It could have been.
1982.82-502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2810.993,2812.491,"--it could have been filed in 1990, 19--"
1982.82-502,1,42716,thomas_w_gallagher,,2812.491,2815.397,"My caveat to that, though, is, however, it's highly unlikely."
1982.82-502,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2822.941,2826.862,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Carle?"
1982.82-502,2,44272,william_d_carle_iii,,2826.862,2828.235,Yes.
1982.82-502,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2966.664,2968.07,"Thank you, gentlemen."
