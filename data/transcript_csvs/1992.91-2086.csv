1992.91-2086,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.138,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 91-2086, the Granite State Insurance Company v. the Tandy Corporation."
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,11.179,14.442,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-2086,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,154.144,174.287,"Well, Ms. Webb, are you assuming that an action for a declaratory judgment in that respect is the same as an action for an injunction or for damages because the declaratory judgment statute which you set forth in your brief at page 3 says that the district court may declare the rights."
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,179.191,184.605,"Your Honor, there seems to be some discretion in the declaratory judgment statute."
1992.91-2086,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,226.101,228.222,What do you do with the Brillhart case?
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,228.222,234.196,"We believe that the Brillhart case, a decision almost 50 years old at this point, cannot be read in a vacuum."
1992.91-2086,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,254.52,260.904,"Well, were all of the cases that you described as the more modern cases, did those all involve declaratory judgments?"
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,260.904,262.076,Colorado River did not.
1992.91-2086,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.725,281.807,"Ms. Webb, I don't quite understand how you express... how you expect this to work."
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,308.565,310.214,I don't believe so.
1992.91-2086,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.116,317.32,"I hope not, because that would be an awful waste of time if they have discretion not to issue it, why don't they have discretion not to hear it?"
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,317.32,325.425,"--Well, in the first place you have to start with the proposition that jurisdiction is unflagging, and you have to go from there into--"
1992.91-2086,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,325.425,326.347,We've never said its unflagging.
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,331.19,342.477,"--Well, certainly in Moses Cone and NOPSI this Court has reversed abstention decisions in declaratory judgment cases, which... and the Court has continuously emphasized the importance of the obligation to exercise jurisdiction."
1992.91-2086,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.488,366.792,"Well, you must take the position, then, that after taking all of the evidence and proceeding with the trial, the district court does not have the discretion to deny the declaratory relief, either, if the reason he's going to deny it she's going to deny it that there's a State action pending, right?"
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,366.792,372.316,--I don't believe that the fact that there's a State action pending is a sufficient reason to deny declaratory relief.
1992.91-2086,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.316,373.848,Why do you say that?
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,373.848,380.043,Because this Court has continuously emphasized that the presence of a parallel action is no bar to the Federal court's ruling on an issue.
1992.91-2086,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.043,390.488,"It seems to me a very good reason to deny the declaratory relief, that there's a prior action pending, comity, consideration for the State."
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,402.095,420.598,"Well, we would certainly disagree with your position that it's a valid reason for declining to issue the requested relief, but the issue is not whether or not the district court... I'm sorry."
1992.91-2086,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.973,477.005,What if the State court action had been filed first?
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,477.005,481.247,"In that case, Your Honor, there is a good argument for leaving it in the State court."
1992.91-2086,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,481.247,484.759,So then it's not an unflagging obligation.
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,488.061,506.414,"We would suggest that the Declaratory Judgment Act represents such an important congressional intent that litigants who have Federal jurisdiction be allowed to retain their Federal jurisdiction and proceed in Federal court, that abstention would not be appropriate even in a later-filed State court action."
1992.91-2086,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,512.297,515.479,But you don't... you would say they shouldn't defer even then.
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,515.479,517.052,I would say they shouldn't defer even then.
1992.91-2086,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.052,521.722,Wasn't there just a stay in this case?
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,521.722,523.525,"There was just a stay in this case, but because--"
1992.91-2086,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,523.525,526.606,So it really isn't an abstention case in the sense that you dismissed the case.
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,526.606,530.559,--It has the same effect as an abstention case because res judicata--
1992.91-2086,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,530.559,532.021,But it isn't an abstention case.
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,537.796,540.076,--They did not dismiss.
1992.91-2086,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,552.044,556.305,"Well, then you go back to the question that Justice Scalia raised initially."
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,583.605,592.573,What we are suggesting is that the district court has to engage in abstention analysis before they can make a decision whether to abstain or not.
1992.91-2086,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,592.573,593.832,But it's not--
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,593.832,594.683,Not that he has--
1992.91-2086,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,594.683,595.903,--But you call it abstention analysis.
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,622.351,632.228,"--That's exactly what the district court has done in this case, and we believe that the district court's analysis was incorrect, because he ignored the court's unflagging obligation to exercise jurisdiction."
1992.91-2086,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.671,637.043,"Well, to begin with, he hasn't dismissed the case."
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,639.024,653.451,"--It does not matter in... certainly not in the Moses Cone analysis, which was also a stay, and which this Court decided resolved under the Colorado River plus two additional factors."
1992.91-2086,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.522,677.848,Do you agree that the Colorado River factors should govern?
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,677.848,689.445,"In the first instance, we would prefer to say that the legislative policy of the Declaratory Judgment act, coupled with valid Federal jurisdiction, means that the Federal court cannot dismiss or stay a case of this nature."
1992.91-2086,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,711.601,721.389,"So if the Colorado River factors happen to balance out against you, why, you wouldn't be here, I guess."
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,721.389,733.307,"Well, the Colorado River doctrine states, when it's coupled with Moses Cone, that the obligation to exercise jurisdiction is unflagging, and the factors must be exercised or weighed in light of that unflagging obligation."
1992.91-2086,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,739.698,747.545,My proposition was that let's assume that the Colorado River factors clearly balance out against you.
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,747.545,750.117,--If the factors--
1992.91-2086,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,750.117,751.095,You would say you would lose the case.
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,751.095,752.167,"--Yes, sir."
1992.91-2086,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.167,756.701,Which is to say it's not really an unflagging obligation.
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,758.842,759.813,But only--
1992.91-2086,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,759.813,761.723,"--If you lose on the Colorado River factor, right?"
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,761.723,773.882,"--The obligation only flags if extraordinary circumstances exist, and the Court has identified those extraordinary circumstances in the various abstention doctrines... Pullman, Burford, Younger... and the factors of Colorado River and Moses Cone."
1992.91-2086,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.574,817.709,And you think that that call is different from the call as to whether you issue the declaratory relief.
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,824.363,824.863,Yes.
1992.91-2086,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.863,825.946,--It's governed by equitable principles--
1992.91-2086,0,17221,ann_e_webb,,825.946,826.346,Yes.
1992.91-2086,1,34728,lynne_a_liberato,,1605.182,1613.169,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-2086,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.059,1678.051,"Well, that's okay, isn't it?"
1992.91-2086,1,34728,lynne_a_liberato,,1678.051,1679.771,It's okay--
1992.91-2086,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.771,1685.515,"I mean, that's why we have Federal courts, because some people don't trust State courts, so do we get mad when they come into Federal court?"
1992.91-2086,1,34728,lynne_a_liberato,,1685.515,1697.804,"--We don't, but there are times when it's appropriate to consider that and times when it's not, and in this particular case it's a misuse of the declaratory judgment action to seek that safe harbor."
1992.91-2086,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1727.824,1733.907,"Well, why shouldn't it do it here, other than the reason that there's forum shopping, because I frankly don't find that a very persuasive one."
1992.91-2086,1,34728,lynne_a_liberato,,1735.129,1765.598,"--Well, there are many reasons, and... for example, the danger of piecemeal litigation, the application of State law rather than Federal law, all of these types of factors that you hear frequently discussed in cases using Moses Cone and using Colorado River, and even using abstention, those kinds of analysis also apply to the determination of whether there should be declaratory relief granted, at least the declaratory judgment heard."
1992.91-2086,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1777.195,1792.565,"May I ask you a question, just so... I don't know whether it's actually in this record or not, but supposing the State court had a 3-year delay on getting to trial and the Federal court's calendar was current, because one of the things they always did was dismiss all of their declaratory judgment cases--"
1992.91-2086,1,34728,lynne_a_liberato,,1797.72,1799.541,"--I think so, yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-2086,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.675,1804.183,What was the condition here?
1992.91-2086,1,34728,lynne_a_liberato,,1807.085,1809.398,--The record doesn't tell us that.
1992.91-2086,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1809.398,1812.468,"But he... there's something he should have considered but it's not in the record, so we don't know."
1992.91-2086,1,34728,lynne_a_liberato,,1812.468,1822.215,"Well, but in this particular case what is in the record is the fact that there was practically no progress in the Federal court action."
1992.91-2086,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1823.097,1826.739,"Well, how... because you filed, what, within 30 or 40 days, is that what it was?"
1992.91-2086,1,34728,lynne_a_liberato,,1826.739,1829.501,--The State court suit?
1992.91-2086,2,17221,ann_e_webb,,3187.003,3193.969,The first thing I'd like to comment on is Ms. Liberato's pronunciation of utmost good faith.
1992.91-2086,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3214.481,3215.763,"I repeat, wow."
1992.91-2086,2,17221,ann_e_webb,,3217.834,3219.075,It's a form policy.
1992.91-2086,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3347.161,3364.792,"So I guess, if I'm right about what the review of the failure to issue a declaratory judgment is, a district judge would always be wise to accept jurisdiction and deny the declaratory judgment instead of simply saying, I won't take jurisdiction."
1992.91-2086,3,34728,lynne_a_liberato,,3369.046,3380.893,"In terms of getting reversed, I guess that's correct, but we believe that unless the traditional concerns precluding a declaratory judgment exist, the district court should maintain jurisdiction."
1992.91-2086,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3382.185,3383.357,"Thank you, Ms. Webb."
