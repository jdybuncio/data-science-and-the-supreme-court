1996.95-789,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.18,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-789, the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Construction and Michael Arceo."
1996.95-789,0,32662,john_m_rea,,13.18,16.482,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,39.679,50.105,"But before you do that, could you tell me, counsel, it seemed to be conceded by both sides, certainly by Dillingham, that this is a plan."
1996.95-789,0,32662,john_m_rea,,50.105,54.188,"The answer, Justice Kennedy, depends on which this."
1996.95-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,69.708,74.913,"Well, are there apprenticeship programs that are clearly not ERISA plans?"
1996.95-789,0,32662,john_m_rea,,74.913,75.723,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,75.723,79.916,"And do those exist, or is this... is that just a hypothetical?"
1996.95-789,0,32662,john_m_rea,,79.916,81.698,"No, that's not a hypothetical."
1996.95-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,118.672,120.913,"Well, let me just ask this further question."
1996.95-789,0,32662,john_m_rea,,125.448,125.618,--Yes.
1996.95-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,125.618,128.012,--apprentice programs that are not ERISA plans?
1996.95-789,0,32662,john_m_rea,,128.012,129.011,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-789,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,140.798,143.4,But those are the ones that you meant by unfunded?
1996.95-789,0,32662,john_m_rea,,146.053,146.282,Yes.
1996.95-789,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.444,166.016,What do you mean by unfunded again?
1996.95-789,0,32662,john_m_rea,,167.005,179.073,That there is no trust fund or arrangement by which the employer or a group of employers put in money and then use that to pay for the operation of the training.
1996.95-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.073,183.317,Is it easier to get certification if you do have funding?
1996.95-789,0,32662,john_m_rea,,183.317,184.348,We frankly don't care.
1996.95-789,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,203.993,204.484,"Well, thank you."
1996.95-789,0,32662,john_m_rea,,208.838,212.929,"One of the reasons, Justice Kennedy, why it's not... we've asked ourselves the same question."
1996.95-789,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,243.349,252.235,"But the Fitzgerald Act is, you know, I think precatory, isn't it, kind of a feel-good type of thing that doesn't really impose any specific legal requirements on anybody?"
1996.95-789,0,32662,john_m_rea,,252.235,261.661,"--It doesn't impose specific legal requirements, Chief Justice, because it's a voluntary act, but it's not merely precatory either."
1996.95-789,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.885,315.567,Is the California law applicable here?
1996.95-789,0,32662,john_m_rea,,319.881,322.663,"--Yes, it operates as an incentive."
1996.95-789,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,322.663,324.814,Is it... does it do any more than that?
1996.95-789,0,32662,john_m_rea,,324.814,325.405,Yes.
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1068.667,1084.138,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.663,1172.625,"Now, this argument requires you to establish, however, that not all apprenticeship programs are ERISA plans."
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1177.349,1177.85,No.
1996.95-789,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1245.144,1248.079,You mean by Federal funding or assistance?
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1248.079,1248.306,--No.
1996.95-789,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1248.476,1248.816,What are you talking about?
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1248.816,1249.416,--No.
1996.95-789,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1266.69,1270.971,But you say if the employer pays out of his own general funds it's not?
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1270.971,1271.592,"It's not, and that's--"
1996.95-789,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1271.592,1272.303,What's the difference?
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1272.303,1292.105,"--The difference is that as the Court... that was exactly the difference that the Court relied on in Massachusetts v. Morash, and the difference is, where it's just the... it's impossible to distinguish what's going on from the normal payment of compensation to a worker in return for the worker's normal taking care of his job in the case where the compensation just comes out of the employer's pocket, and moreover--"
1996.95-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1292.105,1295.489,"Well, that's a good idea, but where do you get that out of the language of the statute?"
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1300.404,1302.154,--It doesn't... I--
1996.95-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.154,1304.357,--just devising distinctions that we think are useful?
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1304.357,1304.597,--No.
1996.95-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1336.322,1337.611,Excuse me.
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1348.832,1374.697,"--In order to be a... it has... the Secretary of Labor has determined that in order to distinguish between normal workplace, what goes on normally in the workplace and the kind of benefit programs that ERISA was designed to regulate, that the distinction in the case of apprenticeship and other training programs is between funded programs which are benefits of the sort ERISA is intended to regulate and nonfunded programs, which is just the employer hiring the employee."
1996.95-789,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1374.697,1375.777,But the statute refers to programs.
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1378.698,1380.441,That's correct.
1996.95-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1380.441,1383.292,"It not only refers to programs, it refers to funds separately."
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1383.292,1383.843,"That's right, but also--"
1996.95-789,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1383.843,1384.554,Fund or program.
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1384.554,1397.283,"--That's right, but also the statute throughout and in the pre... in section 1001 which talks about the purposes of the statute and elsewhere throughout the statute talks... it's quite clear that the statute is directed towards benefits."
1996.95-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1402.078,1405.701,But 1002.1 defines employee welfare benefit fund.
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1410.473,1415.867,"--Well, the Secretary does have statutory authority in 29 U.S.C. 1135."
1996.95-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1415.867,1426.613,"What basis in 1002.1 does the Secretary rely on for making that distinction, because it does seem that the definition covers any plan, fund, or program."
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1426.613,1451.412,"The basis in... the basis is that that term, that entire phrase, plan, fund, or program for the purposes of providing apprenticeship or other training programs itself has to be... that itself... that it's really a definition of that whole term, and I will admit that the distinction between funding and unfunded in this case, as in Massachusetts v. Morash, that that's not something you're going to find in Black's Law Dictionary if you look up any of those individual words."
1996.95-789,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1451.412,1451.973,Or in the statute.
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1451.973,1452.304,"No, but it is."
1996.95-789,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1464.803,1472.359,Are you saying that you must give a different meaning to the word program in the first part of the clause than in the second part of the clause?
1996.95-789,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1472.359,1474.499,No.
1996.95-789,2,39489,richard_n_hill,,1642.954,1647.015,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-789,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1660.115,1694.556,"Well, wouldn't it mean that in any case like this, for example, in which the employer in effect wanted to exempt himself from the apprenticeship obligations and the wage differential that that implies, he would have a perfect way to do it simply by agreeing to the apprenticeship scheme as part of his contract, then funding his apprenticeship scheme with a trust fund like this, them claiming on your theory that all of the State regulations on apprenticeships relate to the plan and becoming free of the regulations?"
1996.95-789,2,39489,richard_n_hill,,1703.472,1706.915,"Well, I think there are many ways to take care of those abuses like that."
1996.95-789,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1708.027,1709.239,Under existing law?
1996.95-789,2,39489,richard_n_hill,,1709.239,1709.99,--Under existing law.
1996.95-789,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1728.332,1744.384,"Would that, then, leave your client in the same position that the client is in if the State prevails here, except that he would be in that position as a result of the enforcement of the different statute, the payroll differential statute as opposed to the apprenticeship scheme under the contract?"
1996.95-789,2,39489,richard_n_hill,,1744.384,1759.383,"Well, I think the difference between my client's situation and the one I just outlined is that my client has established a formal plan and program with written standards, with supplemental training, with a wage progression that corresponds to periods of training, and--"
1996.95-789,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1759.383,1773.004,"But he's doing it for the purpose, in effect, of honoring State law or State regulation with respect to apprentices which he now says is unenforceable against him because he's funding his obligation by an ERISA plan."
1996.95-789,2,39489,richard_n_hill,,1773.925,1776.847,"--Well, I think the reason that this contract--"
1996.95-789,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1776.847,1777.598,Isn't that your argument?
1996.95-789,2,39489,richard_n_hill,,1777.598,1787.874,--I'm not sure... I think the reason that this apprenticeship program was established was that we have this Federal system of creating incentives to comply with apprenticeship programs--
1996.95-789,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1787.874,1790.368,"No, but why did your client establish the ERISA plan?"
1996.95-789,2,39489,richard_n_hill,,1809.22,1810.923,--I think I would put it slightly differently.
1996.95-789,3,32662,john_m_rea,,3322.051,3325.644,Then I think I have one point and one suggestion.
1996.95-789,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3382.506,3383.716,"Thank you, Mr. Rea."
