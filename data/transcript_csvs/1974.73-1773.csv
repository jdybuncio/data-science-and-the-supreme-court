1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.652,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1773, Foster against Dravo Corporation."
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,49.776,53.614,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,126.213,128.356,"I take it that's illustrative only, isn't it?"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,128.356,129.58,It's only illustrative.
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,136.898,140.561,Is it continuing escalator here?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,140.561,141.273,That's right.
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,141.273,143.265,The true continuing escalator.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,143.265,150.917,"Well, we argue that a continuing escalator principle should apply in this case."
1974.73-1773,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,177.609,180.049,I'm just curious Mr. Sachse.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,185.736,187.705,"No, that's not so."
1974.73-1773,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,192.616,192.863,"Well, how about to new volunteers?"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,192.863,194.624,-- to volunteers in the army.
1974.73-1773,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,194.624,195.011,It does?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,195.119,196.168,"Yes, it does."
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,197.285,202.082,"A volunteer, I suppose, is inducted in the same sense that a draftee is inducted, isn't he?"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,202.082,205.539,"Well, there are different sections of the act but they apply the exact same rule."
1974.73-1773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.539,213.619,"You mean, anybody can say to his work time he's been a volunteer for the army it would be years but they never are coming back?"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,213.619,214.834,That's right.
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,225.234,227.344,Volunteering for a career in the army?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,228.166,228.839,No.
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,228.839,230.509,-- as a volunteer for 30 years.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,230.509,238.192,"No, their limits on how many years if applies drafted I think its two years volunteer to something, I don't recall the details --"
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,238.192,239.152,But they are short.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,239.152,247.058,There are limits there and there are also limits on how quickly you have to re-apply within 90 days of being released after you apply to the same.
1974.73-1773,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,247.058,252.13,"I might say Military Selective Service Act is a little misleading, isn't it?"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,252.13,255.429,Well that cites at 10 on the appendix --
1974.73-1773,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,255.429,257.084,To that Act?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,257.084,261.428,"Well, its part of that Act but it -- but it covers more than that."
1974.73-1773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,261.428,273.437,"Right now, right now if you volunteer for a full hitch in the army, it -- it doesn't have to do with you involved here, this Act upon us."
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,273.437,277.076,I don't want to make a definite statement on that.
1974.73-1773,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,283.228,289.686,"If it didn't apply to the volunteer army, this would be rather just this case, wouldn't it?"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,292.722,295.029,"But it's really, it's just."
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,381.011,383.079,I'm not sure I follow you.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,383.079,385.056,"On March 6, 1967 --"
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,385.056,385.288,Yes.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,385.288,392.062,-- he begins his military service and he's paid 56 hours of vacation benefit.
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,442.538,445.243,"No, he doesn't even get the benefit of a rookie because --"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,445.243,445.789,That's right.
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,445.93,447.393,-- the rookie got to pro rata of 20.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,447.393,448.152,That's correct.
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,448.152,448.194,20 hours.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,448.194,451.005,He doesn't even get the pro rata that a rookie would get.
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.005,451.212,Right.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,451.212,474.365,"Now, the company says that this is just a straight application of the contract because in these 13 weeks, when he came back, he hadn't serve 25 weeks in the prior year, then in the full year, when he comes back, he hadn't serve 25 weeks at the plant in that year and so this is the way the contract works."
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.044,557.501,Is the maximum vacation 56 hours?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,557.501,562.286,"No, it goes up depending on how many years he's been in employment."
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,562.286,562.551,I see.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,562.551,577.292,"And the company is not dispute that the way of figuring the maximum vacation is continuous and he would get credit for his years in the service for that (Voice Overlap) just arguing that qualification for it, 25-week qualification."
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,577.292,585.596,Is your argument -- does your argument one of essentially of linking vacation rights to seniority?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,585.596,585.836,That's correct.
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,585.836,586.912,On his return.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,586.912,602.64,"Our argument makes a distinction in vacations and I think it has an advantage to it and that it I think can get the lower courts out of the kind of mess that they've been in, in trying to work out every detail of every contract."
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,635.594,637.595,And that's compensation really.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,637.595,640.075,"And in that, we say, it's compensation."
1974.73-1773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,676.946,688.661,Does the record show Mr. Sachse what the typical number of weeks put in per year was by a worker would say five years seniority?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,695.896,712.791,"I think there is data in the record on worksheets of particular employees junior to him, 47 weeks, the week -- the year that he was there beforehand, I believe is typical."
1974.73-1773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,740.625,740.898,I would suppose --
1974.73-1773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,740.898,746.714,What do you believe did petitioner receive while he was in the service?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,746.714,747.783,I don't know.
1974.73-1773,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,776.031,785.079,"Well, there is such a thing as a terminal leave in the military which they used to be and I think that they will have two-and-a-half days a month, is that still true?"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,785.079,785.89,I just don't know.
1974.73-1773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.62,799.108,Let me interrupt you just a minute Mr. Sachse.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,799.108,800.523,Yes.
1974.73-1773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,800.523,827.567,"I would assume that by the Government's own theory, it might make a difference whether the typical number of weeks worked was say 30 and/or 50 that if the most a man could expect to work during the year were 30-32 weeks and the company required 25, then it might be more analogous to a kind of an earned credit type of thing."
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,827.567,833.942,"Well, then I understand the point you're making."
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,944.861,971.208,"Mr. Sachse, while you're pausing for a moment, let me see perhaps this is oversimplification. Are you trying to attack the 82 weeks of military service on to the bar -- the gray marked bar that preceded it or you just kind of attack your two gray marked bars together for purposes of vacation?"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,971.208,972.729,Let me put it a different way.
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,990.64,992.665,Even though he got a vacation from the army?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,992.665,1002.792,"Even though he got a vacation from the army that the military service is a separate thing that the purpose of the Act is to: number one, encourage people to go into the military."
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1008.918,1016.149,"Well then, if that's the theory then you ought to be able to get the differential and pay too."
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1016.919,1037.84,"No, what we -- no, our theory is that you can ignore what happened in the military, that the question is when this man came back when you start figuring his first vacation after he's back, you have the right to count his time in the military just as if it had been --"
1974.73-1773,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1037.84,1043.126,"Well, then but you're entitled to the first month off?"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1043.126,1043.638,Sir?
1974.73-1773,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1043.638,1049.389,Will be entitled to the first month off a vacation?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1049.389,1049.511,"Well, --"
1974.73-1773,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1049.511,1051.844,You'll see that's -- you got to get out of that.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1051.844,1067.146,That's a problem in this that bothers me and that is when a man comes back with only a week or two towards the end of the year and we've debated a bit about how this should be solved.
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1085.767,1100.23,"Well then going back to my question, your answer to my question I should think or simply would be, yes you are trying to attack the number of days of military service onto the number of days of employment that preceded this number of days."
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1100.23,1101.273,I think that's correct.
1974.73-1773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1102.132,1107.467,Will he get vacation for both 1967 and 1968?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1107.467,1120.727,He would get -- I prefer that speaking of the year in which he gets it because there's some confusion that he would get a vacation benefit in the year 1968.
1974.73-1773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1120.727,1121.271,That's right.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1131.674,1133.194,"Seven days, I believe it is."
1974.73-1773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1133.194,1133.972,Seven days?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1135.958,1137.702,He would get a seven-day vacation.
1974.73-1773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1137.702,1138.281,Alright.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1145.464,1146.581,"No, no, no."
1974.73-1773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1149.402,1150.703,"Well, is it not the year he came back?"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1150.703,1158.163,"He came back in 1968, October 7, 1968."
1974.73-1773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1160.594,1163.529,"Alright, now, what -- how much vacation does he get?"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1169.016,1175.109,"No, we'd only given the same vacation that he would've gotten in 1968 if he'd been working steady."
1974.73-1773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1175.109,1176.499,And we forget 1967.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1176.499,1177.798,Forget 1967.
1974.73-1773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.635,1181.222,He got plenty time to leave.
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1181.222,1182.37,That's right.
1974.73-1773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1183.81,1186.878,"Oh, I see."
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1186.878,1194.738,"Now, we have an alternative position which is that this --"
1974.73-1773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1194.738,1198.018,"I take it's drawn by Congress, aren't you that --"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1198.018,1205.486,"Well, when, I say we, what I mean is I really have to mean to two things."
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1616.918,1622.526,"The form -- those holdings held that that's the form of deferred compensation, isn't it?"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1622.526,1623.161,That's correct.
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.161,1627.513,"So, it's related directly to the wages he received at the time."
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1627.513,1633.27,"It's related to the wages, it's related to his seniority in the plant."
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1635.031,1639.944,"It's the length -- the length of service, the length of service plus the wages."
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1639.944,1640.364,That's right.
1974.73-1773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.163,1733.707,"What the Government's position, Mr. Sachse, in the case of the contract that calls for a one day vacation for each month worked the preceding year?"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1733.707,1741.752,The -- our position is that if it's clear in the contract -- one day vacation for each month worked.
1974.73-1773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1741.752,1743.91,"Each month, each two weeks, whatever you want to call it."
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1743.91,1771.867,"Well, if it's tied close enough to a precise amount of work done, we then say that it's a pure function of wages and if the contract is clear that the returning veteran does not have a right to it and the broadest example of that is a pooled vacation benefit where money is actually set aside in a pool for vacation."
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1786.955,1800.077,But isn't -- isn't his legitimate expectation that he will not lose the benefit of that period from the time he began to work there until the time he went into the service?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1807.487,1811.094,"Well, he's being made a new man again, a rookie again."
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1816.862,1817.249,Well that --
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1817.249,1830.737,And the company's has written at that way but we don't think that squares with seniority and status provisions of the Act and particularly with this Court's prior cases on it.
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1846.507,1852.197,With no credit to the employer for whatever number of days vacation were given in the military service?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1852.197,1853.076,No.
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1854.357,1857.69,On what theory do you just disregard that theory?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1857.69,1860.328,That vacation was part of his military service.
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.611,1898.329,"Well then, it might have been a terminal leave pay as Mr. Justice Stewart suggested that the last -- and that's common with military personnel, is it not, that they are discharged as of March 30th that they leave active duty on --"
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1898.329,1912.227,"There are a lot of vagaries in the military about how these things worked, we're trying to keep out that you know you can be discharged and have to go across the country and think that's wonderful or you can be discharged and be in a terrible situation."
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1917.098,1920.312,But you want to treat them all the same?
1974.73-1773,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1920.312,1935.041,We want to apply the principle at that time in the military counts as time in the plant and figuring their entitlement to vacation when they come back but just when they come back.
1974.73-1773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1939.226,1955.172,Mr. Shoop.
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,1955.172,1959.812,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2005.656,2009.247,"They're not still seeking that much, are they?"
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2009.247,2012.259,The complaint in the initial case sought that much.
1974.73-1773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2055.668,2060.579,"Last year, you mean precisely what, what period?"
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2062.572,2078.54,"Okay, between the year of 1966, between January 1st of 1966 and December 31st of 1966, Mr. Foster earned one weeks vacation, 56 hours."
1974.73-1773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.74,2168.719,"Of course, one thing the Government contends as I understand it is that this is less like an earned vacation than it might be since the man who works 25 weeks and the man who works 50 weeks gets exactly the same amount of vacation."
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2168.719,2169.448,No.
1974.73-1773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2169.448,2170.244,That's not right?
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2170.244,2171.682,That is not correct.
1974.73-1773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2195.186,2199.186,"Okay, but how about two guys of each work for Dravo five years."
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2202.742,2206.133,They both would get the same vacation the next year.
1974.73-1773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2284.033,2289.59,"Well, is that true Mr. Shoop in your plants of business, it's not seasonal, is it?"
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2289.59,2291.354,No sir.
1974.73-1773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2291.354,2292.841,No.
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2292.841,2298.729,"Dravo is a shipbuilding corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and business is pretty good, right."
1974.73-1773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2298.729,2300.326,And it's not a seasonal business.
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2300.326,2300.645,"No, sir."
1974.73-1773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2300.645,2304.757,Could have been.
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2304.757,2339.66,"Now, to answer some other questions that were raised in part of my argument, the question here is more than the $377.92 involved which are the vacation entitlements in 1967 and the vacation entitlements in 1968 which by the way Your Honors, in 1967, he became entitled to another days vacation."
1974.73-1773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2425.374,2427.011,Whether he returned or not return?
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2427.011,2428.027,"Well, if he returned."
1974.73-1773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2432.057,2434.67,And that return within in a certain --
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2434.67,2436.345,"90 days, he has to return --"
1974.73-1773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2436.345,2436.666,Within 90 days.
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2436.666,2442.644,-- within 90 days after his discharge from the selective service to be entitled to any reemployment benefit.
1974.73-1773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2442.644,2448.671,"And if there's a -- if he's been in the military longer than a certain number of years, it's not applicable at all, is it?"
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2448.671,2450.507,"Yes, let me point that out."
1974.73-1773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2476.203,2477.501,That is if they've --
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2477.501,2481.96,"If they enlist in the military service, they can stay in the military service for four years."
1974.73-1773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2481.96,2484.206,For up to four years.
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2484.206,2502.106,"A fifth year, if they are requested by the Government to stay an extra year and this came up during the Cuban Missile Crisis is when they asked some people to stay in the service and they amended that statute of that time to increase up to five years upon request of the service."
1974.73-1773,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2519.851,2523.412,"Well what's the enlistment hitch now under the volunteer argument, three years or?"
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2523.412,2524.967,I think it's still three years.
1974.73-1773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2624.828,2636.311,"Now, when you speak of the vacation bonus, you mean that the practice of giving one day and a half for each day if you take it between January 1st and March 1st or something."
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2636.311,2639.175,My familiarity is we give him $30.00.
1974.73-1773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2657.536,2677.4,"Going back to your hypothetical case, is it your position under that the Government's theory would require you to take a man who work for 30 days for Dravo and then went into the service for four years and then came back."
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2685.953,2704.685,"If the position he'd held in the 30 days was other than temporary and it's no holding that he was a -- that a probationary employee as other than temporary that was decided by the Fourth Circuit in Allen versus Weirton Steel, I believe in quite a number of years ago."
1974.73-1773,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2722.202,2735.025,"Mr. Shoop, are you suggesting when you mentioned insurance benefits that if a veteran would die in service, he'd be entitled to participate in the company's group insurance program?"
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2735.025,2751.548,He certainly wouldn't under any of the plants that I am familiar with but a logical extension of the Government's argue -- argument in this case would appear to me to hold that that's a possibility.
1974.73-1773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2792.521,2799.457,"Of course, he gets not vacation from anyone in 19 -- between 19 -- in the year 1969."
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2799.457,2811.223,"In the year 1969, he got no vacation time off but he earned vacation that was taken effective January 1st of 1970, or could've been taken at that time."
1974.73-1773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2811.223,2817.972,"Which is like saying, he earned a vacation sometime in 1970 but he didn't get anything since 1969?"
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2817.972,2828.114,He did not get any time off or he did not get any pay but he earned a vacation that he takes in 1970 and I think you will find that that's the way vacations are.
1974.73-1773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2831.635,2832.581,"Well, sure."
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2845.97,2846.998,"No sir, Your Honor."
1974.73-1773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2859.13,2875.705,"Well, he put in a year -- from January 1, 1968 to January 1, 1969, he put in presumably 39 weeks with the military and 13 weeks with Dravo but he got no vacation the following year."
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2875.705,2882.312,That's right.
1974.73-1773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2903.362,2908.831,Let me back up to your statement about the 13 weeks at the end of 1969.
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2922.365,2923.281,"No, sir."
1974.73-1773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2935.445,2944.756,"Well then, when -- at what point in 1970 would he get the benefit of the 13 weeks which he worked in 1969?"
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2944.756,2960.593,"He would never get the benefit of working those 13 weeks except for the fact that in length of vacation, it will be recognized that the entire year of 1968 would be -- I believe those 13 weeks were worked in 1968, Your Honor."
1974.73-1773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2962.958,2967.181,Didn't the Third Circuit say that that should be remanded to the District Court.
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2967.181,2967.768,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2967.768,2970.8,That particular issue that the Chief Justice inquired about?
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,2970.8,2981.519,The Government has at this time in their brief that wasn't reached an argument made an argument for a pro rata benefits.
1974.73-1773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3050.975,3066.507,"Well, if we affirm the judgment of the Third Circuit, the case would go back to the District Court and the employee would have a right to litigate at least as matter of contract law, whether he's entitled of pro rata vacation."
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3066.507,3072.818,"The issue before the District Court would be one, was the matter raised and litigated there?"
1974.73-1773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3086.755,3107.105,"But if you say, that although the Act doesn't require you to recognize that he's entitled to a vacation, you say that he works all of 1969, then in 1970, he's entitled to a vacation and you say you will -- the length of the vacation pay that he's entitled to, you say, will include the time he was in the military."
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3107.105,3107.874,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3107.874,3110.457,"Well, the -- now, do you say the Act requires that?"
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3110.457,3111.802,"I would think so, sir."
1974.73-1773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.802,3114.357,Because you must treat him as having been on the payroll.
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3114.357,3115.245,Because no.
1974.73-1773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3129.972,3137.759,Well that's only -- that's only if you work those -- that's only if you've been entitled to vacation during those periods.
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3137.759,3138.698,Not necessarily.
1974.73-1773,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3151.755,3175.875,"Well, Mr. Shoop, what happens with an employee who does not go into the military service but who in 1967, whatever reason worked only 20 weeks, in 1968, worked only 15 weeks but then he comes to 1969, he works 52 weeks, how do you compute his vacation earned for 1970?"
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3175.875,3178.997,Okay.
1974.73-1773,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3214.264,3215.879,Whether or not he earned any vacation.
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3215.879,3218.711,"Whether or not he took it in the previous years, I think --"
1974.73-1773,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3218.711,3219.929,Whether or not he earned it.
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3219.929,3223.919,"Whether or not he earned it, right I think in those cases --"
1974.73-1773,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3223.919,3225.376,So that's pure seniority.
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3225.376,3226.492,That's pure seniority.
1974.73-1773,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3239.562,3254.159,"Mr. Shoop, on remand, if you prevailed here, on remand, will you also have under consideration a pro rata for 1965?"
1974.73-1773,1,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3254.159,3255.507,Well --
1974.73-1773,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3255.507,3255.954,Or is that --
1974.73-1773,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3255.954,3259.665,"No, 1965 there's no problem."
1974.73-1773,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3265.99,3267.705,Why not 1965 also?
1974.73-1773,3,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3267.705,3276.58,"Because 1965, see that's where they missed the -- the Government isn't getting the -- he got his 1965 vacation in 1966."
1974.73-1773,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3283.207,3289.882,"But why was he entitled to it, it was not 25 weeks, or is it just because he began work in that year?"
1974.73-1773,3,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3289.882,3301.794,"As Justice Stewart pointed out, the rookies -- and this is -- this is something that's negotiated in a contract to protect an employee who is coming on the payroll new."
1974.73-1773,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3301.794,3302.173,Okay.
1974.73-1773,3,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3302.173,3309.935,And he is entitled to some benefits at that period of time as a new employee but he's only entitled to one day.
1974.73-1773,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3328.19,3350.04,"In other words, the total length of his service from his first employment date down to 19 -- the beginning of 1970 is used to measure the amount of vacation but not to give him any dollars for the period he was in the military service?"
1974.73-1773,3,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3350.04,3353.403,"No sir, you earn your vacation each and every year."
1974.73-1773,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3353.403,3355.6,"But your answer to my question is yes then, is it?"
1974.73-1773,3,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3355.6,3356.698,Yes.
1974.73-1773,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3356.698,3383.121,"I wonder Mr. Shoop, you said this was within the statute, this is related to seniority yet Section 2 says should be so restored in such manner as to give him such status in his employment as he would have enjoyed if it continued in such employment continuously from the time he was entering the armed forces to a time his restoration of such employment."
1974.73-1773,3,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3396.031,3398.967,"As that probably do, yes sir."
1974.73-1773,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3398.967,3410.159,"Because at least for purposes of a length of vacation he gets in 1970 that he earns in 1969, he's given credit for his time in service."
1974.73-1773,3,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3410.159,3411.923,"Yes sir, right."
1974.73-1773,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3665.725,3669.785,"Well, but he didn't -- he didn't meet the conditions of the collective bargaining agreement."
1974.73-1773,3,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3669.785,3670.571,But he met --
1974.73-1773,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3670.571,3671.539,No question to that.
1974.73-1773,3,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3671.539,3674.623,-- all the earnings requirements of the collective bargaining agreement.
1974.73-1773,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3696.115,3701.253,"Well, you don't have the same agreement that was involved in the Eagar case, in the -- yes, Eagar case."
1974.73-1773,3,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3701.253,3703.686,No but I got this similar agreement.
1974.73-1773,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3709.164,3712.356,Plus be on the payroll at the end of the year.
1974.73-1773,3,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3712.356,3720.302,"I would say, my position on those if we have those in these collective bargaining agreements that those are seniority provisions."
1974.73-1773,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3720.302,3724.152,"Well, it's easy position for you to take now."
1974.73-1773,3,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3724.152,3724.442,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1773,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3724.442,3726.007,Since you don't have that in your agreement.
1974.73-1773,3,40556,robert_h_shoop_jr,,3726.007,3728.48,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1773,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3863.029,3863.749,Thank you gentlemen.
