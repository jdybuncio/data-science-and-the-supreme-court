1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.854,We will hear arguments first this morning in Penn Central Transportation Company against the City of New York.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,17.165,20.907,"Mr. Chief Justice, Justices of the Court."
1977.77-444,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,39.978,44.489,"When you say greatest, are you referring by population?"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,44.489,49.525,"I would prefer to encompass all aspects, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1977.77-444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,49.525,51.329,Or weather?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,51.329,54.309,I will still stay with greatest.
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,54.309,55.991,Or total debt.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,55.991,56.91,Total tax.
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,56.91,58.081,Tax.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,58.081,60.719,It may qualify on all those scores.
1977.77-444,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,60.719,64.709,"Mr. Gribbon, what city are you referring to?"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,64.709,68.211,Not Chicago.
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,194.688,202.698,"Is there a record anywhere, a picture or a drawing, an architect's drawing or a sketch of what this building would look like?"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,202.698,205.462,"There is, Your Honor."
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,208.967,210.539,Not in the Appendix?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,210.539,212.126,"Not in the Appendix, no, Your Honor."
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,214.875,215.769,Thank you.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,215.769,218.944,Which is large to understand.
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,266.935,275.323,"You do not question the right to the City of New York to take this entire property, do you?"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,275.323,284.066,"No, Your Honor, the issue raised here is not, as some of the brief seem to suggest, whether the City of New York may validly preclude Penn Central from constructing a building."
1977.77-444,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,306.515,317.095,Is there any doubt about how this case would have come out before the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,317.095,320.636,"I would think the same considerations are present now, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1977.77-444,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,320.636,324.543,What would you have relied on before the enactment of Fourteenth Amendment?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,324.543,327.214,I would think the Fifth Amendment.
1977.77-444,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,327.214,329.861,But Barron v. Baltimore said the Fifth Amendment --
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,329.861,333.689,"Well, there might have to be a little rewriting of some of the decisions there."
1977.77-444,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,356.314,364.769,"In today’s legal climate, you do not have to be that vague as in the case from this court held that the Fourteenth Amendment does incorporate the Fifth Amendment --"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,364.769,367.881,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,415.039,418.665,Are you talking about the full cost? The full cost of what?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,418.665,427.838,"Of not being able to build an office building, the loss that is suffered by being prevented from developing an office building over the terminal."
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,427.838,436.347,"Now it has been held in a case, Hudson, I think it was, that a municipality could limit the height of all buildings within its borders."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,436.347,437.485,"Your Honor, I think that is true."
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,442.513,443.594,Why isn't that a taking?
1977.77-444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,443.594,448.317,Pan-Am Building is not the shortest building.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,448.317,448.8,"No, Your Honor."
1977.77-444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,449.423,450.349,It is right next to it.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,450.349,451.504,Right next to it.
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,454.156,457.346,"The taking is just the same, selective or non-selective, is it not?"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,457.346,458.648,"No, I think under the zoning case --"
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,458.648,469.743,"It might be discrimination, but from the point of view of the taking it is just exactly the same if you limit every building in the municipality to no more than 4-15 stories."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,469.743,487.13,"I think the decisions indicate that zoning which is comprehensive and applies substantially equally to all people affected within the area can be tolerated as a non-compensable taking on the ground that the benefits and the burdens are reasonably dispersed, not precisely."
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,487.13,490.421,"From the point of view of the property owner, the taking is precisely the same, is it not?"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,490.421,491.406,That is right.
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,506.65,512.33,I can understand your argument based upon discrimination of some kind.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,529.507,536.289,I think in many instances there is just as much of a taking on the property owner when something is done by regulation as by eminent domain.
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,555.322,567.685,"Well, is it not the point that in the situation you are referring to as distinguished from now, it is Mr. Justice Stewart is referring to, the taking some but not all or the taking one but not all the others."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,567.685,569.197,"That is right, selective."
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,575.865,577.748,I fully understand.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,589.114,597.597,All I can say is that the zoning cases have viewed it as being a permissible use of the regulatory power when it is done in a way --
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,597.597,601.725,"You do not try to justify it rationally, you just say that that's authority, not reason."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,601.725,611.078,"That is right, I do not know that it isn't rational to say when all people within the area are similarly treated, nobody can have a residence or nobody can have industry."
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,613.255,618.517,"When several wrongs do not make it right, they make just several wrongs, don't not?"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,618.517,619.62,"Yes, I think that is right."
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,638.377,641.212,Was there a matter of equal protection here somewhere?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,641.212,649.857,"Well, Your Honor, we do not argue any equal protection. I think it is a solid case for a taking."
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,671.618,686.601,"The theory behind the take -- I will avoid the use of the word 'taking', the limitation because it is an historic place and historic monument is that that is for the benefit of everyone."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,686.601,687.722,Of everybody.
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,687.722,690.562,"So you say if it is for the benefit of everybody, everybody should pay for it."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,690.562,692.88,Everybody should pay for it.
1977.77-444,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,704.662,725.017,"Is it not part of the reasoning for the generalized use of the height regulation the notion that all of the buildings that are subject to that height regulation also derive some benefit from it in that their competitor, so to speak, cannot build above them and each of them will have a good view from the top floor and that sort of thing?"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,725.017,726.254,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,731.727,741.879,"As my brother Rehnquist implies in his question, the theory is I think that benefits are accorded to everybody in terms of light and air and so on."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,741.879,743.652,"Yes, which is not true here."
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,743.652,744.745,Right.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,744.745,754.713,"We are solely burdened and unbenefited, everybody else, not just the buildings, but the visitors, and the people who do it are the ones that get the whole benefit out of it."
1977.77-444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.619,1097.048,Would you be making the same argument here if all you wanted to do was to replace the building with one of the same height?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1110.448,1116.041,I think if it caused this loss and from what you say it would cause this loss we would be making the same argument.
1977.77-444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.519,1126.04,It is just not that some air space is being taken.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1126.04,1127.207,"Well, in this particular case --"
1977.77-444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.207,1128.292,"Well, I know, but that is not --"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1128.292,1130.001,"No, that is not the whole thing."
1977.77-444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.949,1147.827,So this would be a taking because the city would be keeping you from making more profit than you could by using the same size building.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1147.827,1152.127,"I would put it because they are taking a part of our property, for taking a part of our property right."
1977.77-444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.127,1164.845,"You would make the argument even if it were conceded which I am sure it is not, even if it were conceded that the old building was profitable in the sense that you were not losing any money on it."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1164.845,1166.347,"Yes, Your Honor if there were a cost --"
1977.77-444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.347,1174.235,"If you could double what the county would show you could make by using the building, you would say they are taking part of your property."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1174.235,1176.96,"I think that is a fair statement, yes."
1977.77-444,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1176.96,1178.962,That is your fundamental argument?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1178.962,1184.148,"Well, it is based on the notion that the reason they are doing it is to benefit the general public."
1977.77-444,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1210.514,1219.45,"Mr. Gribbon, back in 1911, one plan considered it was a 20-story tower on the property, was it not?"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1219.45,1220.772,"Yes, over the terminal?"
1977.77-444,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1220.772,1221.517,Yes.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1221.517,1222.751,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.77-444,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1222.751,1228.502,Has anything along that line been suggested that Commission here at this point?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1228.502,1230.05,"No, Your Honor."
1977.77-444,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1266.095,1272.559,"Adjacent to the contrary, but the other way."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1272.559,1274.204,That 20 stories would not do?
1977.77-444,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1274.204,1274.742,Yes.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1274.742,1285.025,"No, there has not been to my knowledge, but, there has been no resilience in the Landmarks Commission with three efforts to do this under guidance of noted people."
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1301.235,1326.7,"Suppose 20 years ago, 30 years ago before we were as much concerned with the past as we are now and preserving the past, you had built over the Penn Central Station without using any part of the station but just build over to 60-70-storied hotel."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1341.127,1345.828,"They can condemn it or they can regulate it, and we would be entitled to compensation."
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1352.362,1362.546,Are you suggesting that there is no difference in the taking aspect today in the present situation than in the one I hypothesized?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1362.546,1366.224,"Well, I do not think there should be, and I do not perceive a difference."
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1367.575,1371.391,In terms of Fifth Amendment principles.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1371.391,1377.169,I would think that would clearly have been a taking 20 years ago as well as today.
1977.77-444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1377.169,1387.972,"Mr. Gribbon, not to long this case, how did Penn Central or Grand Central, how did they get that piece of land right in the middle of Park Avenue?"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1387.972,1394.963,"Well, there is a long history to it, they bargained they were pioneers --"
1977.77-444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1394.963,1397.328,Did they steal it fair-and-square?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1397.328,1409.798,"They did not steal it fair-and-square, they acquired it over a long period of time, and indeed that building there has done a great deal for the middle of New York and which came first is pretty hard to say."
1977.77-444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1409.798,1413.622,"It sure does, when you are driving, you have to go all the way around it."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1413.622,1416.564,"Well, that is what the city wants to maintain."
1977.77-444,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1416.564,1418.057,I see.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1418.057,1427.443,"They acquired it over many years from predecessor railroads largely and it is the Grand Central Terminal now that we are talking about and not Penn Central, that is gone."
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1658.327,1672.709,"As I read over the briefs filed by your brothers and sisters on the other side, it is my impression that none of them really tried to defend the basic reasoning of the -- that part of the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, would you agree with that?"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1672.709,1675.008,"I believe that is a fair statement, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1977.77-444,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.011,1690.853,"Well, the Court of Appeals really is a statement of Henry George’s single text, is it not?"
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1690.853,1693.191,Very close.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1693.191,1699.806,"Yeah, but I submit, it is not a statement of sound Constitutional Law."
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1703.981,1707.448,Henry George.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1707.448,1708.988,James would be different.
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1807.824,1815.338,"Mr. Gribbon, down near the White House across the street from the Hay-Adams Hotel there is a historic church."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1819.246,1820.441,St. John's?
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1820.441,1822.677,St. John's Church.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1871.558,1872.571,"I think it would, Your Honor."
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1879.345,1894.769,"Now in that process or that inquiry it developed that that church was the result of many, many contributions by people that the church corporation as such did not ever put a single dollar into it."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1896.945,1897.638,I do not think it would.
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1902.083,1907.242,They would be entitled to get the compensation for the highest invest use of that land as of today?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1907.242,1912.102,"Well, that is a phrase that has been bandied in the cases, and I am not too sure of the meaning."
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1918.515,1922.05,"Presumably, at the moment, the highest and best use would be a hotel site."
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1922.05,1927.876,"If that is permitted by the generally applicable zoning laws, and I take that it would be because there is a hotel across the street."
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1927.876,1932.059,They would of course be limited to the height limits of Washington D.C.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1932.059,1933.446,Whatever they are.
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1933.446,1934.413,800-Feet or something.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1934.413,1936.718,The same as everybody else is limited.
1977.77-444,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.568,2096.818,"Mr. Gribbon, may I interrupt with a question that when does the taking take place?"
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2117.057,2119.528,I would think it would take place at the former time.
1977.77-444,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.528,2125.808,Then why do you say the putting a plaque on the door of a home is just a ceremonial act? Why would that not also be a taking?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2125.808,2129.099,I do not think it imposes any burden or a loss.
1977.77-444,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2133.79,2136.085,Is he not equally forbidden to tear down the house and sell it for something else?
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2136.085,2149.701,"No, that depends upon what he can later workout with the Landmarks Commission, whether he can have additions to it, which will not impair the integrity of the house just as Penn Central attempted to do things that would not impair the terminal."
1977.77-444,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2151.877,2153.768,"Oh, I see."
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2153.768,2159.794,But then you are assuming with the house that it is in a single family occupancy zone.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2159.794,2160.342,Yes.
1977.77-444,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2160.342,2163.393,So it can never be anything more than basically what it is.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2163.393,2166.49,It is not burdened the way Penn Central has been burdened.
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2166.49,2167.668,Which is in a commercial zone.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2167.668,2171.044,In a commercial zone where it is precluded from doing what is permitted under the zoning law.
1977.77-444,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2171.044,2172.33,By all others in the commercial zone.
1977.77-444,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,2172.33,2173.903,Right.
1977.77-444,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2207.759,2208.224,Mr. Koerner.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2208.224,2212.593,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, may it please the Court."
1977.77-444,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2224.584,2226.035,I do not think so.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2233.921,2237.823,"Well, let me just establish the perimeter of the appellant’s argument."
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2237.823,2240.136,"You do not contend this is a zoning case, do you?"
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2240.136,2240.859,No.
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2252.578,2254.212,As applied to one particular unit?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2254.212,2257.592,"No, this is the nub of the case."
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2283.69,2284.913,Can it not be different from the case we have now?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2284.913,2286.11,That is correct.
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2288.804,2291.203,How would it be different to a constitutionally?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2291.203,2305.028,"In this particular case, we have a comprehensive land use plan which sets out in advance the criteria for determining whether or not a building is architecturally or historically significant."
1977.77-444,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2315.502,2331.246,"What if the five boroughs got together and said together that there just is not much open space in the five boroughs and so we are going to preserve all the open space just as it is, even though it may be in private ownership."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2334.37,2336.167,It would depend on the strength.
1977.77-444,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2337.922,2339.667,"No, finding that there is a --"
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2339.667,2352.561,"The answer would be, no, because the individual who was affected by the regulation would not be getting any return on his property, nor would he be permitted to use his property for any purpose."
1977.77-444,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2352.561,2358.153,"Suppose that he was allowed to use it as open space, he could graze cattle there or have dairy trucks."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2358.153,2361.747,"No, because that would not be economically productive."
1977.77-444,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.512,2387.488,"Suppose, in my brother Rehnquist’s example, he was permitted to put a fence around it and if people want to come and sit in the sunshine, they could pay a little fee and they would be raised enough to pay his taxes and maybe 1% profit."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2387.488,2390.096,"No, that would be insufficient."
1977.77-444,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.848,2409.249,"It would not be enough for the land owner to say, “I may be able to make a profit here the way it is, but I can make two or three times as much if you permitted another use?”"
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2409.249,2410.529,That is correct.
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2427.401,2429.912,Which isn't counsel a valuable right?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2429.912,2436.304,"Yes, but it must be balanced against the validity of the land use regulation."
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2436.304,2437.796,Which is for the benefit of whom?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2437.796,2441.434,Of the entire community of which the appellant is a part.
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2441.434,2447.874,But you do not think the entire community should bear the cost of the benefits for the entire community?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2447.874,2457.933,What I am saying is that the entire community should pay the appellant if the restriction denies him the right to a reasonable rate of return.
1977.77-444,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2473.447,2478.577,"When you say reasonable rate of return, you sound like it is a public utility."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2478.577,2487.383,"No, we have not quantified it except to the extent that it has been suggested that 6% would be reasonable."
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2500.478,2515.415,"But suppose instead of this being owned by the Penn Central, this had been a private residence of great historic importance, Commodore Vanderbilt’s house or some such thing, and the Landmark Commission wanted to take it."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2522.464,2528.806,"Well, in that case, the question was, whether or not our designation would interfere with the existing use?"
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2538.716,2546.844,"How about my hypothetical question to Mr. Gribbon on St. John’s Church over, by the White House by Lafayette Park?"
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2557.288,2558.798,No.
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2573.527,2591.152,Even if they wanted to do what the National Presbyterian Church did to sell its downtown church for a very large office building site and move out to the outskirts where the parishioners can get to the church more rapidly?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2591.152,2599.882,"If there was a justification and then they could apply to the Landmarks Commission and that would be a condition, that would be considered by the Commission."
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2599.882,2601.083,In fixing value?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2601.083,2601.667,Yes.
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2606.884,2612.364,Is the Landmark Commission qualified to deal with due process?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2612.364,2613.955,No.
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2613.955,2615.998,Aren't you giving it business?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2615.998,2616.891,No.
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2626.029,2629.292,You say it is not a Zoning Commission.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2629.292,2631.63,It is like the Zoning Commission to the extent that its --
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2631.63,2634.16,"But a minute ago, you said, “Oh, no”."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2634.16,2635.25,"No, I was not able to finish."
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2635.25,2637.194,You were not going to get in the zoning business.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2637.792,2639.019,"No, what I said --"
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2639.019,2640.457,But now you are going in zoning?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2640.457,2641.516,No.
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2654.999,2660.109,I assume that Commission knows how to operate a railroad terminal?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2660.109,2670.839,"No, the Commission determines whether the railroad terminal fits under the criteria before it, that is, whether it is architecturally and historically significant."
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2678.721,2680.055,But who makes that determination?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2680.055,2683.867,The Court in this case made that determination after a lengthy trial.
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2683.867,2687.493,"I am talking about with the Commission by itself, do they make that determination?"
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2687.493,2689.505,There is a procedure within the --
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2689.505,2695.757,I understood two or three times Penn Center went there trying to work this out.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2696.79,2697.968,No.
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2697.968,2698.746,They did not go there?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2698.746,2708.162,"Well, they had applied to the Commission for the right to knock-down Grand Central Terminal and put up an office building."
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2776.334,2780.456,"The Landmark Commission can do this at any time, it sees fit."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2780.456,2780.786,No.
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2785.011,2788.528,Time-wise they could do it on a building that was 80-years-old.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2788.528,2790.071,"Yes, that is correct."
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2810.597,2813.396,I assume that is true as to all State Commissions.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2813.396,2813.97,That is correct.
1977.77-444,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2813.97,2817.424,"So there is nothing new, it is old but especially for this Commission."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2817.424,2825.699,"Well, that is precisely our point that this is a land use regulation that has the same effect as any other land use regulation."
1977.77-444,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2825.699,2834.295,"What if in that proceeding the Court decides that the Commission was absolutely right, no one can dispute this is a historical landmark?"
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2835.188,2839.892,"No, because all that says is that the designation is proper."
1977.77-444,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2851.103,2854.784,And what standard do they use?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2854.784,2862.491,"Whether or not the property, as restricted, is being precluded of all reasonable beneficial use."
1977.77-444,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2864.479,2871.008,Do you mean that not of all economic use but some profitable?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2871.008,2872.116,That is correct.
1977.77-444,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2897.196,2901.385,Do they set a percentage of return on initial investment like the public utility?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2901.385,2909.572,"No, they have not, they did not do that because in this particular case there was such a failure of proof they did not have to quantify it."
1977.77-444,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2909.572,2918.353,"You say as the case comes to us, we must judge it on the basis that the Grand Central’s present use is profitable?"
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2918.353,2922.663,Must be and Your Honor that is the essence of this case.
1977.77-444,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2928.009,2928.808,Mr. Koerner.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2928.808,2930.624,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-444,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2930.624,2934.323,Grand Central is still used by the railroads for passenger service.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2934.323,2935.332,That is correct.
1977.77-444,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2935.332,2946.364,Let us assume that the Interstate Commerce Commission allowed the station to be clothed for rail service on the ground but not enough people used it for that purpose.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2954.277,2956.419,Right.
1977.77-444,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2956.419,2958.841,What would your position be with respect to that situation?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2958.841,2964.006,Penn Central would be entitled to relief because the property as restricted was not economically viable.
1977.77-444,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2964.006,2967.134,Was that clear from the New York law?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2967.134,2976.538,"Yes, and I again want to emphasize the attempt by the appellant to ignore the substantial factual data presented during the trial."
1977.77-444,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2976.538,2981.561,Is there a specific section of the New York Law that deals with that situation?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2981.561,2989.076,"In this particular case, it came under the guys of the challenge to the application as a deprivation of due process."
1977.77-444,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3011.84,3013.633,But that is not in the statute.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3013.633,3015.361,"No, it is in the statute."
1977.77-444,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.361,3015.856,It is?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3015.856,3025.232,"But, Penn Central was a tax-exempt property and the statute did not have this exception applicable to a tax-exempt property."
1977.77-444,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3032.783,3053.203,"In any event similar to the question of my brother Powell, if the company at any time in the future, next year or the year after that, any time it can prove that the situation has changed and that the property is no longer economically viable, it will get relief."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3053.203,3054.627,That is precisely the answer.
1977.77-444,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3055.233,3060.47,What again is the definition of being economically viable?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3060.47,3069.166,"It was not required to be quantified in this case, but it has been traditionally meant that on his investment, he would be able to earn approximately 6%."
1977.77-444,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3069.166,3070.877,Like public utilities.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3070.877,3074.048,Correct!
1977.77-444,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3074.048,3097.917,Supposing that the New York Central railroad is applying to the Railroad Rate Commission in New York for an intrastate fare change and the Commission decides that you can make 6% on -- which we consider a reasonable rate without a spur track of three miles which you presently own.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3107.536,3111.984,"No, because I do not see the strength of the public purpose in that particular case."
1977.77-444,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3111.984,3119.303,Supposing they want the spur track is a railroad museum to show how the 20th century used to look?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3119.303,3131.376,"Well, then again, the answer to Your Honor’s question is that in your application you are singling out that particular railroad and restricting its development of its property."
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3164.853,3173.909,"Mr. Koerner, could I return for a moment to Justice Powell’s question about economic viability of demolition or something like that."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3182.481,3185.6,There are two bases for Certificate of Appropriateness.
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3206.487,3208.207,On the ground of economic --?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3208.207,3209.001,That is correct.
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3209.001,3218.148,"What section of the statute authorizes that, 207-6.0?"
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3222.066,3224.49,Can I?
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3226.316,3229.136,"Alright, but you do agree that with respect to the --"
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3229.136,3231.652,Section 207-8.0.
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.652,3232.848,"8.0, I see."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3237.176,3252.932,"No, because while he could not get administrative relief, we agree that if he have had established his case in Court that the property was not economically viable he would have been entitled to judicial relief."
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3252.932,3254.221,But not under subsection 6?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3254.221,3257.29,"No, that is correct, under due process."
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3257.29,3258.126,Under the Constitution.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3262.423,3271.175,If we had not had the added step that whatever deficiency was in the Landmark Law was corrected at trial.
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3271.175,3278.878,But the Landmark Law in it as it reads is unconstitutional if it does not allow for some kind of remedy when there is this kind of economic --
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3278.878,3280.139,That is correct.
1977.77-444,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3288.706,3292.409,"Mr. Koerner, I am a little confused about your references to tax-exemption."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3295.11,3301.422,The railroad does not have to pay full city real estate taxes on the terminal.
1977.77-444,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3313.201,3317.238,Is the theory be that they are taxed in other ways or --?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3317.238,3322.226,It was intended to encourage them to keep up the railroad system.
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3322.226,3329.719,Does this make any difference to the constitutional issues in this case whether they were totally tax-exempt or paid the full tax that everyone else pays?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3329.719,3332.183,No.
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3332.183,3335.161,So In this respect they are in the same posture.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3335.161,3335.806,That is correct.
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3335.806,3337.824,Same posture as St. John’s Church?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3337.824,3346.463,"That is correct, with the exception that here though you can equate their business with whether or not they can make a reasonable rate of return. You can determine it."
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3400.1,3403.054,"Mr. Koerner, before you do that, let me just understand your theory."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3408.026,3409.009,That is correct.
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3409.009,3409.874,Then why do we have to consider?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3409.874,3420.156,Because the air rights are part of the comprehensive scheme in an attempt to at least recognize that we are going to try to do everything we can.
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3420.156,3424.382,But maybe you have been generous than the Constitution compels you to be.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3426.587,3429.667,"Because, Judge Pritel felt that the air rights --"
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3429.667,3431.497,Nobody is defending his rationale.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3431.497,3447.457,"No, to the extent that he relied on the air rights, it was appropriate to consider the air rights in the context of the whole package to determine exactly whether we have been fair."
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3447.457,3448.939,What difference does it make whether you have been fair?
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3449.901,3459.656,Because the fairness concept advocated by the appellant goes to the concept of due process in determining value.
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3463.24,3466.134,But your legal position is you do not have to be fair.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3466.134,3468.157,"No, that is not our legal position."
1977.77-444,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3468.157,3472.064,"Your position is, as I understand is that there can be a taking sometimes under this contemplation."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3472.064,3479.31,"That is correct, but there has not been in this particular case and that the facts and circumstances of this particular case show there has not been."
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3595.06,3596.775,"Mr. Koerner, let me just ask one more question."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3609.535,3614.128,"No, because I do not think the transfer rights were of the equivalent values."
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3614.128,3615.483,You concede they were not.
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3615.483,3618.307,"It was not litigated in Court, all that was litigated --."
1977.77-444,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3618.307,3620.637,"For purposes of our decision, we should assume they are not."
1977.77-444,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3620.637,3626.14,That is correct.
1977.77-444,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3626.14,3627.606,Mrs. Wald.
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,3627.606,3630.28,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-444,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3729.996,3734.353,"Mrs. Wald, can I just interrupt because it goes to what you are reciting out."
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,3743.751,3746.024,I do not believe it has directly done so.
1977.77-444,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3746.024,3748.343,So it has never done anything comparable to what we have before us in this case?
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,3748.343,3763.832,"Not to my knowledge, but may I add that it does provide subsidization to local groups to embark upon some of their projects pursuant to laws like the New York City Landmark Law which use a regulatory framework for preservation."
1977.77-444,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3763.832,3769.558,"Is it fair to say that the federal policy has always been where there is a public benefit, the public shall pay?"
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,3769.558,3773.881,I believe that that is an overstatement for the following reasons.
1977.77-444,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3814.486,3825.973,I suppose a farmer up near Manassas is suddenly informed that the records now discover an important part of the Battle of Manassas was fought on his farm.
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,3846.082,3862.59,"If we are referring now, as I believe you are to the national government taking such action, then right now the national government would either have to do it through eminent domain or through a state or local government which had jurisdiction."
1977.77-444,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3880.144,3889.913,"Yeah, the Chief Justice’s question was a constitutional question and that is because that is what we have in this case, not you happened to have at the moment, a federal statute."
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,3889.913,3893.386,It is always very hazardous to pass unconstitutional questions ahead of time.
1977.77-444,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3893.386,3897.635,That is what we have to do in this case.
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,3897.635,3902.112,"You are passing on a statute, of course, it is one the books for New York City."
1977.77-444,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3913.369,3914.857,Without compensation?
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,3914.857,3922.484,Without compensation in the sense that it would be subject to the same test which we suggest constitutionally apply the state and local government.
1977.77-444,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3934.42,3943.607,The beneficial use that my farmer friend up at Manassas has in mind is to leave it to his children or to sell it as the case maybe.
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,3958.818,3976.583,"I am not suggesting they could take it, Mr. Chief Justice, I am suggesting that a valid historical landmark statute could allow them to restrict its usage so that a particular historic framework or particular historic use would not be violated."
1977.77-444,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3976.808,3985.176,"If we had an offer to sell it to the supermarket, a landmark supermarket, would that be right?"
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,3993.132,3996.121,"I am sorry, I am not sure I understand your question, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1977.77-444,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3996.121,3999.793,I just want to put one little point to the Chief Justice’s question.
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4015.846,4018.813,Is that the price you suggest that the government would have to pay?
1977.77-444,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4018.813,4021.512,Yes.
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4021.512,4042.214,"I believe that the Federal Government could indeed enact a statute which would not require them to pay the price you suggest, the going rate on the market for the land simply because they had restricted its uses so as to prevent him from selling it to the supermarket."
1977.77-444,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4042.214,4046.658,Let me get back to the hypothetical that I gave Mr. Gribbon and see what your answer is.
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4098.95,4113.274,I do suggest that the District of Columbia could have passed a regulation which required after designation through a reasonable mechanism of that church as a historical site.
1977.77-444,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4133.558,4144.562,You would not say that if it were sold for $10 or whatever the buyer would pay then he just close down the church. You could not make him operate the church.
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4145.915,4147.68,"No, I would not suggest it."
1977.77-444,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4147.68,4160.613,"The city here indicated that if they seized operating as a church, it would no longer be appropriate to restrict the use."
1977.77-444,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4160.613,4161.769,Without compensation.
1977.77-444,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4161.769,4163.015,Without compensation.
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4163.015,4178.929,"I would suggest that since the property was originally -- its original, its present use at the time it was designated was as a church, that indeed nobody can be made obviously to operate a church if they do not want to."
1977.77-444,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4183.546,4200.513,"Well, in the Grand Central case, are you differing with your colleague that if Penn Central just shut the terminal down, that it would still be required to leave the building as it is?"
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4200.513,4209.608,"Certainly, I believe the statute is valid, and under the statute if it wished to shut down the station, to cease operating, to demolish the --"
1977.77-444,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4209.608,4210.193,Not demolish.
1977.77-444,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4210.193,4222.951,"It is cease operating, then they go in before the Commission and say, “We are not making a nickel on this unless we can do something with it, we cannot even pay our taxes on it, reduced as they are.”"
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4233.922,4249.59,"I believe that the courts, although it is not in the statute in Grand Central’s case, but I believe that the New York courts in that situation if they did not want to operate it at all would indeed permit them to cease operating it."
1977.77-444,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4253.659,4264.593,"The point is, in the event hypothesized by my brother White, would the Constitution then require that compensation to be paid?"
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4264.593,4272.593,I do not believe that the Constitution requires the compensation to be paid simply because they decided they did not want to operate it anymore as a railroad station.
1977.77-444,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4346.709,4357.907,"Mrs. Wald, just applying it to the historic landmark area, if the landmark designation causes the property owner to actually lose money on the property, then it's a taking."
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4361.11,4362.388,That is pretty much the test.
1977.77-444,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4371.236,4373.926,Is it just one penny a profit or a reasonable return?
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4373.926,4377.131,"Certainly, the cases do not tell us in the past."
1977.77-444,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4379.11,4380.08,But we have to decide.
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4380.08,4384.016,“No set of formula has a reasonable return or a beneficial use.”
1977.77-444,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4384.016,4386.399,"You just say, just a marginal profit would not be enough."
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4388.275,4391.651,I would say a reasonable return is a beneficial use.
1977.77-444,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4391.651,4397.916,"In a reasonable return, how does one measure that if it is a lot less then it could be obtained by putting it to some other use? Is it still reasonable?"
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4397.916,4405.01,"I believe so and I believe that is exactly what all of the cases have said, we do not take the test of the most profitable use."
1977.77-444,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4406.008,4409.066,"But, you do not take the test of the least profitable use either."
1977.77-444,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4409.066,4410.181,It could be zero.
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4410.181,4424.481,"I certainly believe that Constitution would require the owner, if he could not use it for a particular purpose to be able to go out and find the most profitable use consistent with the point of the regulation, namely the preservation of the landmark."
1977.77-444,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4424.481,4427.069,Do you mean you are going to make him do something with it?
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4427.069,4428.851,"No, we are going to permit him to do something with it if he wants to."
1977.77-444,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4428.851,4431.342,What if he just wants to board it up?
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4431.342,4452.802,"If he wants to board it up and that does not, in some way infringe upon the historical preservation aspect of the property, then he could do that, it is the historical preservation simply said, this is a beautiful church to look at from the outside and we do not care what happens, whether anybody goes in it or anything else."
1977.77-444,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4459.502,4467.35,"Who should pay the $10,000 a year insurance premiums on it and public liability in the meantime?"
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4467.35,4475.41,"Well, the church might be the wrong example, but in essence the owner continues with all of both the liabilities and the profits of ownership."
1977.77-444,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4479.354,4482.611,What profit have you got on a boarded up building?
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4482.611,4486.231,If you boarded it up by your own choice then you --
1977.77-444,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4486.231,4494.338,"No, boarded it up because the government from your point of view would not let him sell it -- would not let them sell it."
1977.77-444,2,38448,patricia_wald,,4494.338,4508.447,"In most of these cases, the sale and indeed in the case instance here in the New York Law they do not forbid the sale per se, they only forbid the sale for a use which is restricted."
1977.77-444,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4588.445,4588.867,Thank you.
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4590.424,4605.306,"If I may briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, I shall like to answer Mr. Justice Marshall’s inquiry and make clear that Penn Central did make an effort with the Landmarks Commission to obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness and no exterior effect."
1977.77-444,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4639.082,4642.564,"What if in passing this ordinance, was it an ordinance?"
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4643.339,4645.576,This Landmarks Law is an ordinance.
1977.77-444,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4645.576,4658.591,"What if they had done their homework before they have passed the ordinance and said the following landmarks are hereby designated right in the ordinance, and they did 30 of them or 40."
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4665.885,4674.932,"I think if the economic impact on us was the same, ultimately as it is here, the fact that they were designated in the law rather than designated by the Commission would be immaterial."
1977.77-444,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4674.932,4679.668,"But, you would not be singled out."
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4679.668,4684.607,"Well, certainly were singled out much more than the zoning case."
1977.77-444,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4684.607,4686.121,At least you would be one of 30.
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4686.121,4689.213,"Yes, but we understand that they do not operate the same way."
1977.77-444,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4702.423,4709.232,"Well I think as I heard this argument, it has narrowed the issue, as I understand your opponent."
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4731.605,4732.576,Does it operate here?
1977.77-444,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4732.576,4735.485,Yeah.
1977.77-444,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4735.485,4748.95,Do you agree that we judge the case on the assumption that the station is a sustainable economic operation?
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4748.95,4750.639,"No, I do not think so, Your Honor because the only --"
1977.77-444,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4750.639,4751.993,"I know, but you disprove it or --?"
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4756.403,4767.934,I say the Court of Appeals finding to that effect is totally erroneous because it is based on this concept that we need only earn or return on the privately contributed ingredient.
1977.77-444,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4769.592,4773.226,"Well, let us assume for the moment that we accept it."
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4779.504,4785.199,"I still say, even if you accept it, the decision is wrong and we are entitled to compensation."
1977.77-444,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4790.57,4810.259,"In your brief at Page 17 you cite this Court’s opinion in Fuller, where you say that the government in a condonation case can exclude from consideration of the jury the value that maybe added by the fact that the government build a post office near the site 80 years ago."
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4811.851,4812.497,I think it is.
1977.77-444,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4857.218,4858.949,"The expected use, is that what you said?"
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4858.949,4860.663,"That is what it said, an expected use."
1977.77-444,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4860.663,4864.724,How is that different from the highest and best potential use?
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4864.724,4866.289,I am not sure how it is different.
1977.77-444,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4886.133,4897.231,Is that term obsolete when a church could show that it has a contract to sell the church and the site for $4.5 million?
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4899.741,4903.578,I would put it under terms of expected use.
1977.77-444,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4903.578,4909.108,"The highest and best use might be to sell it as a slaughter house for $8,000 that the zoning would --"
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4909.108,4912.259,The zoning would prohibit it but for a legitimate use.
1977.77-444,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4912.259,4918.477,The highest and best use always is restrained by the permissible use.
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4918.477,4927.937,"As the Solicitor General recognizes, a statute such as this Landmarks Law creates unusual opportunities for arbitrary action."
1977.77-444,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4965.164,4977.725,"What if you have a regulation put down by OSHA that puts down a number of safety standards and the owner says, “I simply cannot run the business with all these safety standards.”"
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,4987.913,4999.953,It may be if the representatives have decided that those OSIA requirements are necessary to do away with harm that may be a price that the individual owner has to pay.
1977.77-444,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5019.688,5032.272,"In the Causby case, the air space above a minimum safe altitude was not deemed compensable, was it?"
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,5032.272,5033.378,"Above, yes."
1977.77-444,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5046.137,5052.542,It was impact on the use of the land below on the surface.
1977.77-444,3,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,5052.542,5054.865,"Well, yes, but I do not know that that would distinguish it."
1977.77-444,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5061.164,5062.073,Thank you counsel.
