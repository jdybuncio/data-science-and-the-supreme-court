1979.79-672,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.022,The case is submitted.
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,58.174,61.501,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,156.565,159.797,"Well, it -- it turns basically on the statute, doesn't it?"
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,169.155,170.045,That is correct.
1979.79-672,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,731.685,735.734,Were these neutral employers?
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,735.734,743.78,They were on the finding of the Board that was sustained by the -- by the Court of Appeals.
1979.79-672,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,743.78,750.086,"The fact is they were owned -- or partially owned by the producer of the boycotted product, weren't they?"
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,750.086,750.904,That is correct.
1979.79-672,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,821.641,833.459,"Would there be a difference -- Mr. Come, could there possibly be a difference between the branch which was 53% owned and the one on the other end of the spectrum of 17% owned?"
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,836.209,841.26,The Board did consider that one as well as the other as in found that that --
1979.79-672,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,841.26,842.433,"Well, but did it --"
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,842.433,842.49,-- it found --
1979.79-672,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,842.49,844.822,-- did it address itself to that distinction?
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,844.822,867.058,"Yes, it found that despite the -- the fact that there was more ownership in that case, there was still no showing that there was any -- that that additional amount of stock ownership had resulted in any greater interference or control by Safeco over the labor relations policies of the land title companies."
1979.79-672,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,900.865,919.075,"Well, what you're saying is that the title company could -- Safeco could control the five or six retailers as it were, but the retailers couldn't control Safeco?"
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,919.075,927.428,That is correct.
1979.79-672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.459,1066.766,"Well, does that go all the way back to Thornhill against Alabama that picketing is free speech plus?"
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1066.766,1082.937,"Well, I think -- I think that it -- it does -- Thornhill of course, held that a point had been, on all picketing, would be unconstitutional and --"
1979.79-672,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1082.937,1085.202,But it also recognized that picketing wasn't --
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1085.202,1111.498,"Well, first -- first, certainly, since Wohl, which came on a year or two after Thornhill and Ritter's Café which followed Wohl and then we move to the -- this was in the early 1940s and then we moved up to the early 1950s with -- with Hughes and Gazzam and -- and Henke."
1979.79-672,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1111.498,1114.55,Giboney -- Giboney is the one I seem to remember?
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1114.55,1116.763,"Well, Giboney --"
1979.79-672,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1116.763,1117.958,"It's the ice company, Mr. Come?"
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1117.958,1119.801,That is -- that is the ice company.
1979.79-672,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1143.749,1144.607,Right.
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1144.607,1182.579,"It's argued here that the objective sought by this picketing is not unlawful in that sense because there is nothing unlawful for a consumer to boycott a -- a title company or a retail store for reasons of his own, nor by virtue of the publicity proviso to 8 (b) (4) would've be unlawful for a union by publicity, other than picketing to seek to induce such a boycott."
1979.79-672,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1388.707,1399.547,"Mr. Come, in Safeco's brief here, there is a suggestion and indeed more than a suggestion that we -- we reconsider Tree Fruits."
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1402.578,1404.027,We do.
1979.79-672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1432.476,1455.98,"Well, Mr. Come, is there any question with what if in Tree Fruits, the picketing had said instead of don't buy apples, but don't deal with Safeway because they are buying apples from the bad person."
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1459.733,1462.779,"As I -- as I read the decision, I -- it would be."
1979.79-672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.779,1469.572,Is there some -- are there some -- are there some cases here that say that that would be?
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1476.199,1476.502,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1476.502,1482.786,Are there any cases here that say that it would be?
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1482.786,1482.83,Any --
1979.79-672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.83,1490.577,Except to -- except by negative inference from Tree Fruits?
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1490.577,1491.776,I don't --
1979.79-672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.776,1496.635,For Justice Harlan's dissent in Tree Fruits.
1979.79-672,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1496.635,1508.158,"Well, as to whether the dissent accurately interpreted the majority opinion of course is -- is the question that we have now."
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1633.034,1638.201,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-672,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.813,1697.574,"Mr. Gold, do you have any doubt that on the -- on the record before us, the Union in this case violated the literal language of the prohibition?"
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1697.574,1706.041,"If -- yes, I do have a doubt of that and for the reasons stated in -- in Tree Fruits."
1979.79-672,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.832,1744.593,"Well, but what -- what if Tree Fruits had never been decided?"
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1754.832,1761.204,"Obviously, the argument was made and accepted as an initial proposition."
1979.79-672,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.596,1807.201,Yes.
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1819.192,1841.338,"I -- I would answer that question by saying that the words restrain and coerced are not self-defining words and that if we had no legislative history, I would certainly agree with you that it's possible to include peaceful picketing by a single person asking a consumer not to buy a product."
1979.79-672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.194,1869.723,"What about the -- the question I asked Mr. Come, is there -- is there any question that -- that if in Tree Fruits, the picketing had been directed at Safeway generally saying -- saying to consumers, “Don't deal with Safeway because Safeway is dealing with the apple grower.”"
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1871.444,1872.073,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.272,1902.733,"Yes, but --"
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1902.733,1903.457,-- in the case.
1979.79-672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1903.457,1910.412,"-- your -- if -- you picket -- you picket Safeway, you're asking consumers, don't deal with Safeway."
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1924.681,1931.091,That -- that is the construction of the statute as I understand.
1979.79-672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1985.708,1992.385,Are you saying that and would you say that that kind of an application of the statute if it -- that I just proposed would be constitutional?
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1992.385,1993.675,No.
1979.79-672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1993.675,1994.37,I beg your pardon?
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1994.37,1995.094,No.
1979.79-672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.094,2007.882,"So, so your constitutional argument says that even you picketed Safeway generally and said, don't deal with Safeway generally because Safeway is dealing with the apple -- you say that's unconstitutional?"
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2007.882,2037.645,"Yes.I want to make it clear that I can imagine a path of a decision, very much like the common law which would distinguish between what was called, “fair persuasion limited to the goods.” And going beyond that, now, I've -- for the reasons, I'll express, we will suggest that such a line is unsound on a constitutional --"
1979.79-672,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2037.645,2038.244,How -- how --
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2038.244,2038.246,-- basis.
1979.79-672,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2038.246,2044.184,-- can you justify your answer to -- to Mr. Justice White's question in light of Giboney?
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2044.184,2047.438,"Well, there are several justifications."
1979.79-672,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2082.708,2085.009,But that just makes the tail follow the dog and I --
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2085.009,2085.081,I don't --
1979.79-672,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.081,2092.059,"-- believe the -- the State in effect, had -- decides what is protected and what isn't protected on the First Amendment."
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2092.059,2093.991,"Well, I -- I think that's always true."
1979.79-672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.173,2195.884,What about the -- what about the message to the employees of the secondary?
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2195.884,2196.286,Well --
1979.79-672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2196.286,2197.987,Picketing -- picketing for the employees --
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2197.987,2198.538,If --
1979.79-672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.538,2200.406,-- of the second -- of the secondary employer.
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2201.488,2201.883,Yes.
1979.79-672,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2318.085,2320.655,Where were -- where were this picket stationed?
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2322.876,2344.466,They were all on public thoroughfares which ever since Hague versus CIO has been recognized as a public forum in business areas where the problems of privacy and so on which you were discussing in this morning's case are -- are not present.
1979.79-672,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2344.466,2350.854,"Well, certainly not all public thorough -- public property is a public forum."
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2350.854,2351.767,"No, but --"
1979.79-672,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2351.767,2351.818,Are you (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2351.818,2353.634,"-- the streets, the parks --"
1979.79-672,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2353.634,2361.731,-- you say here -- here all -- all the pickets were stationed at places which were would be public forum under our cases?
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2361.731,2364.604,Yes.
1979.79-672,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2465.719,2484.556,"Where do we find Mr. Gold, the language that the customers are not very analytical when they see the picket sign to decide whether you're picketing particular brand of oleomargarine or apples or whether you're -- they're just picketing -- picketing generally."
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2484.556,2505.911,"I -- I believe on the next page, the Court dealt with that and said that be that as it may, if the Union is meeting its obligation namely, to fairly advise the public what its dispute is that it is within the statute."
1979.79-672,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2546.587,2565.81,"Now, for nearly 24 years, almost exactly 24 years, I have heard arguments including some of yours Mr. Gold at the Court of Appeals and here that on these fine shadings, the Court should rely on the Board."
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2575.937,2576.032,No.
1979.79-672,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2577.801,2580.438,"No, I -- I don't -- I didn't think it would, you know."
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2593.04,2601.85,There -- I -- I would argue that what has happened is Tree Fruits.
1979.79-672,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2636.933,2647.744,"Well, did I hear you earlier that suggest that -- the literal language of the statute that the Boards construction was consistent with the literal language of the statute here?"
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2647.744,2650.851,No more or less than it was in Tree Fruits.
1979.79-672,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2650.851,2653.126,Okay.
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2653.126,2672.828,"But certainly, whether it is your opinion in Catholic Archbishop of Chicago or the more recent opinion in the Yeshiva case, the Board's expertise as obviously never given complete sway."
1979.79-672,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2672.828,2673.269,No.
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2673.269,2673.317,And --
1979.79-672,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2673.317,2680.937,"Well, of course when you're dealing with the Catholic Bishop's case for example, you're dealing with what is or was -- not is or is not in the statute."
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2684.992,2695.236,"Well, but that is precisely what we are dealing with here and in Yeshiva, we were dealing with the nuances of -- of a term, managerial employees."
1979.79-672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2916.522,2920.073,"Mr. Gold, can I ask you a question?"
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,2951.488,2953.887,I -- I would consider it would be a different case.
1979.79-672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3014.247,3027.397,"But the problem is it, it seem to me you might have two cases in which the message is precisely the same in terms as addressed just a consumers who are around the stores, one of them might produce economic consequences that the other one did not."
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,3034.145,3048.022,"I -- I would argue that their constitutionality would turn, (a) on whether the conduct that they stimulated has been regulated and banned."
1979.79-672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3120.469,3125.862,"Well, but, it seem to me that the Cox's distinction didn't turn on the legality of the economic sanction."
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,3137.165,3145.315,"Well, I -- I don't read his -- his article to -- to get to that point."
1979.79-672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3217.248,3222.593,"Well, I -- I wonder if the Hughes case isn't pretty close to that."
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,3222.593,3228.741,"Well, the Hughes case -- can be read as being close to that."
1979.79-672,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3234.718,3238.673,The unlawful ultimate object there is to urge affirmative action as I remember it.
1979.79-672,1,34498,laurence_gold,,3238.673,3239.825,"Well, that's right."
1979.79-672,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3417.563,3427.381,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Come?"
1979.79-672,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3427.381,3447.916,I just wanted to make one point and that is that the distinction between signal picketing and publicity picketing was rejected by the Court in -- in Hughes.
1979.79-672,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3501.454,3502.096,"Thank you, gentlemen."
