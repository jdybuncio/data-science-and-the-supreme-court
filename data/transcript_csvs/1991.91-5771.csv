1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.22,"We'll hear argument next in Number 91-5771, Harold Ray Wade v. United States."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,64.385,67.109,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,156.525,171.155,"Well, I think the Government agrees that if a showing is made, it... the judge can certainly inquire into what the... what the prosecution's reasons were for not making a... making a motion."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,179.55,181.372,"--No, Your Honor, they don't."
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,189.738,193.03,"Well, did you make any sort of a proffer?"
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,193.03,196.192,I did make a brief proffer at the trial court--
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.192,198.112,And would... what did the proffer consist of?
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,198.112,206.938,"--Basically, the proffer consisted of a recitation of what Mr. Wade's assistance was up to that point."
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.938,216.075,"Well, did it consist of any showings, a prima facie showing that the Government was denying Mr. Wade his constitutional rights?"
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,216.075,219.227,"Not at that time, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,223.932,226.773,"Well, but putting on evidence is different from a proffer."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,238.45,240.3,--I believe that would be correct.
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,261.386,267.169,"Well, but there can be good reasons and bad reasons for denying a particular motion."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,280.257,291.605,"Well, the... at the trial court, the trial judge did not even think he had the authority to get to the point of making a proffer where he could hear any evidence."
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.457,295.787,What page are you on?
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,295.787,302.322,"--On page 9 of the joint appendix, the court says, and I quote: Well, I believe I'm going to let you make some law with that case."
1991.91-5771,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,329.63,336.143,"Well, Mr. Martin, it is true that the judge did allow you to state for the record, in the event you desired to appeal, what the evidence would be."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,336.143,338.516,"I do not disagree with that, Your Honor."
1991.91-5771,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,344.07,345.62,You knew you were going to lose.
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,351.063,354.705,"--Well, it was a very strange sentencing proceeding."
1991.91-5771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,374.707,376.37,But you did risk his ire.
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,389.347,390.399,"--Well, I did--"
1991.91-5771,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,390.399,395.332,"You just said this defendant provided a lot of assistance from the Government, they should have given him a break."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,395.332,398.483,"--Well, that is true."
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,403.976,405.589,"Well, did you try to proffer that?"
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,405.589,406.978,"I did not, Your Honor."
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,407.549,410.341,"Well, that's the end of the... I mean that's as far as we can go, isn't it?"
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,410.862,426.693,"--Well, there... there's a... you... there's a point in here, where, on page 10... or I suppose on page 9 and 10... where I'm going through this with the court."
1991.91-5771,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,452.499,463.606,"Well, are you saying that implicit in your proffer is an attempt to show that the Government was acting in bad faith?"
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,463.606,478.216,"Well, perhaps not in my proffer, itself, Justice Kennedy, but in... at the beginning of my discussion with the judge, I say it is again a question of that, as opposed to the prosecutorial function."
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.002,491.054,"Well, surely there are much more direct ways of bringing it up with him than the language you just quoted."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,493.506,498.619,"--I don't necessarily disagree with that characterization, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,522.755,526.047,"Well, I think you better argue on the record before us."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,526.047,528.988,"Well, I'm not trying to... I'm actually not trying to get off of it."
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,538.445,540.396,"Yeah, but that... is that why we took this case?"
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,545.699,547.732,"--Well, the--"
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,547.732,550.794,"I mean, I think you want to make a different case for us."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,550.794,559.31,"--Justice Souter, the Fourth Circuit held that the district court has no authority to entertain--"
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,559.31,562.611,"All right, and we're now at the point where it is conceded that there is some authority."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,608.411,610.802,--I don't believe so.
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,631.385,638.841,"Well, if you had not been allowed to make a proffer of your evidence, you know, I... I would probably agree with you."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,686.152,690.464,--I don't believe so.
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,713.959,720.995,"Well, does... is... I don't think we should go outside of the record, but let's be improper for a moment."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,730.12,745.121,"No, sir, not an agreement between... no, Your Honor, not an agreement between the prosecutor and myself, but agreements made between agents of the prosecutor and the uncounseled defendant on the night he was arrested."
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,750.234,753.396,"Well, why didn't you claim that when you were in front of the court?"
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,753.396,757.78,"Well, I had hoped to be able to call a special agent--"
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,757.78,759.66,"No, but I mean you wanted to call witnesses."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,767.865,786.358,"--Your Honor, the only thing I can do to explain that to you is to tell you that I felt very pressured by the judge to move on; he was giving me clear signals that he... what sentence he was going to impose, that he was going to impose the minimum; we had already been... I don't really want to go too far out of the record... but we had--"
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,786.358,787.618,"Right, and we shouldn't."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,805.528,807.09,--I do not--
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,807.09,809.001,Isn't that the only issue we could decide on this record?
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,809.001,810.663,--I do not believe so.
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,832.327,837.602,"Well, let me rephrase, if I may... and perhaps Justice Souter won't regard it as a rephrasing."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,847.597,854.622,I suppose that it could be looked at that way.
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,874.666,877.838,"Well, you've answered... you've said remand, remand, remand."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,886.682,887.423,Well--
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.423,891.535,"You know, we're not enlarging the record here."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,895.628,907.336,"--Your Honor, the authority of the judge was foremost in his mind."
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.484,940.308,"I think we've probably spent enough time on this particular aspect, but why don't you go on to the rest of your argument, Mr.--"
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,940.308,963.724,"Another question that remains is whether the scope of review in these circumstances would include the concepts of bad faith or arbitrariness, those motivations on the part of the prosecutor."
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,979.814,988.62,"--Do you take the position that arbitrariness is claimed, if you simply allege that there has been cooperation and a refusal on the part of the Government to move for a downward reduction?"
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,988.62,990.179,"No, Your Honor, we do not."
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,990.179,991.591,"Okay, what more do you have?"
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,991.591,1003.299,I think what you need is a motivation on the part of the prosecutor that is not related to a governmental interest.
1991.91-5771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1003.299,1003.64,Okay.
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1022.17,1047.347,"No, Your Honor, I believe that cross threshold showing that the Government agrees now must be made, that there must be evidence which satisfies the court that these conditions exist, by way of a supposed proffer, or by way of affidavits."
1991.91-5771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.423,1059.516,You say these conditions exist.
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1081.649,1095.47,"If the unreasonableness rises to the level of... of denying the defendant his... his fundamental rights at sentencing, the rights--"
1991.91-5771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1095.47,1098.362,"Well, but that's not very helpful."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1099.061,1100.032,"--Well, I--"
1991.91-5771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1100.032,1103.575,"--If we say it does, it does."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1120.795,1124.598,--And I believe that that's basically correct.
1991.91-5771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1125.828,1126.789,What do you mean it's correct?
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1131.271,1146.231,"--Well, it would be unreasonableness coupled with... with not just... not just, you treated this defendant this way, and you treated this defendant the other way."
1991.91-5771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.877,1155.307,How do you describe them?
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1174.101,1176.071,"Well, or bad faith."
1991.91-5771,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1176.071,1176.742,What's that?
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1179.183,1179.894,"Well, that's--"
1991.91-5771,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.894,1182.095,"I mean is... they're so wrong, they're obviously in bad faith?"
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1182.095,1189.432,"--I... I think that's... it's almost like a sort of a sniff test, Your Honor, that the district--"
1991.91-5771,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.432,1190.383,You know it when you see it?
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1190.593,1191.392,--I believe so.
1991.91-5771,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.557,1230.377,"Well, what if we... what if we said that, well, the court of appeals is obviously wrong if it said that the Government's... the Government's decision is never reviewable; and we said it's reviewable if there's a... if there's a con... if the Government violated a constitutional... it looks like the Government violated a constitutional right."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1246.178,1247.288,What we--
1991.91-5771,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1247.288,1248.279,Do you or not?
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1248.279,1253.532,"--Based upon the record before you, I have not."
1991.91-5771,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1253.532,1253.833,Well--
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1253.833,1255.443,And I admit that.
1991.91-5771,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1268.903,1271.845,"--Well, I take it from your brief you'd go even further."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1285.642,1287.715,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe so."
1991.91-5771,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1303.695,1305.976,"Well, suppose the Government is just plain wrong."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1329.223,1331.573,Well--
1991.91-5771,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1331.573,1334.196,Is that your position or isn't it?
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1336.026,1336.897,--It's... it's--
1991.91-5771,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1336.897,1338.697,That's the way I read your brief.
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1338.697,1339.599,--That is really not our position.
1991.91-5771,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1362.703,1364.804,"Well, isn't it your position that that's all you need?"
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1364.804,1369.428,"--Well, no, I think there needs to be one more step beyond that."
1991.91-5771,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1385.097,1390.042,"Well, I'm not sure why not."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1390.042,1413.657,"Well, questions... questions revolving around the nature and quality of the assistance of the Government, I believe we've agreed with the Government that those questions are uniquely... are unique questions that the Government, in its own wisdom, can decide on."
1991.91-5771,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1432.669,1438.862,So you disagree with the brief of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers?
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1438.862,1445.287,--The amicus in our case takes a broader perspective on this issue than we do.
1991.91-5771,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1445.287,1447.378,And so you disagree with it to that extent.
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1447.378,1448.99,"To that extent, that is correct."
1991.91-5771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.141,1505.428,"Why should there be any review of this at all, I mean for anything... bad faith, arbitrariness, outrageous unreasonableness, or even unconstitutionality?"
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1525.931,1539.279,"--Well, Your Honor, the... I think the simple answer to that question is when Congress created this provision, it gave this discretion to the Government."
1991.91-5771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.675,1553.808,"Well, I don't know... what about if the Government, you know, it has discretion to choose not to prosecute."
1991.91-5771,0,32007,j_matthew_martin,,1566.337,1571.78,At the... at the... at... I'm not sure I know the answer to that.
1991.91-5771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1631.52,1635.422,"Thank you, Mr. Martin."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1637.633,1645.298,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-5771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.982,1713.057,"Well, do you defend the court of appeals decision on its face?"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1713.057,1717.779,"Well, we think the court of appeals decision did not go far enough."
1991.91-5771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.413,1732.889,"So that the court was just wrong in saying under no circumstances, without a motion, does the court have power to go downward?"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1732.889,1738.132,"--Well, to the extent that the court didn't qualify its statement, it was... it incompletely--"
1991.91-5771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1738.132,1746.948,"Well, it did say under... they just said across the board, without the motion of the statute, isn't satisfied."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1746.948,1747.449,--Yes.
1991.91-5771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.449,1749.309,And that's the end of the story.
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1749.309,1751.392,"Well, it was... this case did not--"
1991.91-5771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.392,1751.773,Isn't that right?
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1753.172,1754.144,--That's what they said.
1991.91-5771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.144,1755.293,And you don't agree with that?
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1755.293,1757.917,We don't agree with that as an unqualified statement.
1991.91-5771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1761.17,1766.643,And how... when is the... when is the Government's decision not to file a motion reviewable?
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1766.643,1780.64,"--Well, we think it's subject to a very limited form of judicial challenge, if the defendant can make a substantial threshold showing that the prosecutor is exercising discretion in an unconstitutional manner."
1991.91-5771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.24,1788.655,Is that the... is that the only... is that the limit of the reviewability?
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1788.655,1790.538,"--Yes, we think that is the limit."
1991.91-5771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1790.538,1794.499,"Bad faith is... I don't know what bad faith, particularly is."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1800.483,1802.396,"Well, I think that's the problem."
1991.91-5771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1807.679,1809.64,Like equal protection.
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1809.64,1810.521,--Well--
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1825.39,1832.274,"Mr. Long, suppose the prosecutor knows that there has been substantial assistance."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1842.482,1853.698,"--No, our view of this section is that the prosecutor does not have any obligation to make this motion in any particular case, even if the defendant has provided a tremendous amount of assistance."
1991.91-5771,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1862.283,1873.47,"Well, if that's true, do you concede that defendants have a protected liberty interest sufficient to trigger the due process clause in having one of these motions made?"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1873.47,1876.642,"No, we do not concede that, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1890.714,1895.235,Is this... is the discretion the same as the discretion to prosecute or not to prosecute?
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1895.235,1903.182,We think it is very closely analogous to the discretion whether to bring a charge and the selection of charges to bring.
1991.91-5771,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1924.034,1932.141,"Well, now, what is the situation if the Government promises the defendant to file a motion under this section--"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1932.141,1932.669,Well--
1991.91-5771,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1932.669,1940.556,"--and induces the defendant's cooperation, and then reneges on filing any motion?"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1940.556,1940.886,--Well--
1991.91-5771,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1940.886,1943.388,"Is there any relief possible, and what?"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1943.388,1947.658,--We think it is a different situation if the Government makes a plea bargain.
1991.91-5771,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1950.15,1959.707,"No, the Government promises that if you will cooperate with us, I'll make a motion at sentencing, for reduction."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1963.931,1968.393,"--If the Government makes that promise, the Government can be held to it by the court."
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1968.393,1970.175,Because it's a plea bargain?
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1970.175,1970.826,Yes.
1991.91-5771,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.826,1973.368,But what if it's not in a plea bargain?
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1997.521,2010.862,"Well, as we read your... the Court's decision in Maybury against Johnson, as long as the defendant then goes ahead and pleads guilty, and it's a properly counseled guilty plea, there's no constitutional violation in that case."
1991.91-5771,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2018.445,2026.8,"Well, would it be redressable by some kind of an action for specific enforcement to compel the Government to make the motion pursuant to its promise, for which there was a consideration?"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2026.8,2028.573,We would say not.
1991.91-5771,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2039.459,2047.604,Would the answer... would the answer depend on whether or not the Government made it plain before the guilty plea that it was not going to honor the agreement?
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2047.604,2048.866,"--Oh, yes."
1991.91-5771,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2050.007,2053.766,"So if the Government says... the Government says we're not going to honor it, no problem at all."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2057.63,2068.928,"--If the... if the... if the guilty plea is induced by a misrepresentation of the Government, then under Santabello and other cases, then the guilty plea is invalid."
1991.91-5771,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2068.928,2083.447,"Well, is it induced when it's not made part of the formal plea agreement at the time the plea is entered, but nonetheless had been the subject of an informal agreement when the Government never indicates that it's going to renege on that agreement?"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2084.85,2086.841,"Well, I think it could be."
1991.91-5771,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2093.755,2100.34,So you're just saying in effect that that the plea bargain is not limited to a formal plea bargain immediately preceding the entry of the plea?
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2100.34,2105.173,"Well, I think... in a particular case, that would... that likely would be the Government's position."
1991.91-5771,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2108.245,2109.517,But not necessarily.
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2109.517,2116.76,"--and it says specifically that anything that's not written in this agreement is not part of the agreement, and you're not relying on any other promises."
1991.91-5771,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2116.76,2117.602,"Okay, that makes it clear."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2117.602,2125.185,"What about apart from plea bargain situation, what... what do you envision as constituting these constitutional violation exceptions?"
1991.91-5771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.666,2136.311,"Suppose in the instance that counsel posed, that you do have a prosecutor who seems to be more lenient towards women defendants than towards men."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2139.015,2139.934,"--Well, we think--"
1991.91-5771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.934,2140.856,--to the male defendants?
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2140.856,2142.028,--We think that it could be.
1991.91-5771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2201.808,2209.654,"Mr. Long, a couple of times you've mentioned the case of Maybury against Johnson, which I don't find cited in your brief."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2211.545,2216.019,"Yes, Your Honor, that's at 467 U.S. 504."
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2216.019,2232.418,"What is the theory that permits the court to inquire if there's a constitutional violation, that the processes of the court cannot be used to reach an unconstitutional result?"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2232.418,2233.32,I think that's it.
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2253.112,2260.455,"Well, if you can inquire under the supervisory powers to prevent a constitutional violation, why not to prevent a statutory violation?"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2260.455,2272.015,"Well, because it's established under the Bank of Nova Scotia and other decisions that the court cannot exercise its supervisory power to negate statutes."
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2292.14,2297.452,"Well, let's assume for the moment that there's a violation of the prosecutor's discretion, and therefore the statute."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2297.452,2301.854,--So there's been an unconstitutional exercise.
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2301.854,2308.519,"No, not unconstitutional, just an abuse of discretion... unless you're saying all abuses of discretion are unconstitutional."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2308.519,2315.535,"Well, no, our view of this is that it commits the decision to the prosecutor's discretion in the sense that--"
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2315.535,2318.948,But I'm assuming that this discretion has been abused.
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2318.948,2326.772,"--Well, our view of it is the only type of abuse that's created here is the... is the decision for unconstitutional reason."
1991.91-5771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.178,2348.317,"Well, I must say that's... we have a lot of statutes that commit things to the discretion of agents of the executive branch."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2360.796,2369.86,"Well, again, Justice Scalia, we don't think this is the typical case of agency action, where there's a strong presumption of judicial review."
1991.91-5771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.184,2378.384,"Oh, I don't deny that."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2390.693,2426.226,"--Well, I think the distinction, and we draw it from this Court's decision in cases such as Webster against Doe, is that if the Congress means to preclude review of constitutional questions, unless they say so extremely clearly... there's a kind of a plain statement requirement... and, of course, we also draw it from cases closer to this situation in prosecutorial discretion cases, such as Wayte, Bordenkircher, and Boiler against Bowles, where this Court has always assumed that that kind of violation would be subject to a judicial review."
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2437.085,2446.232,"Can a United States attorney, in your view properly, say that in this district we're not going to give any credit for cooperation, ever?"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2448.732,2465.642,"Yes, we think that would be proper if, for example, the U.S. Attorney decided that they were getting good cooperation from defendants in that district, and there was no particular reason to allow defendants to have less than the minimum sentence that Congress has established... or the sentencing commission has established."
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2468.394,2473.148,"And you think that this is consistent with the intent of the Congress, as expressed in the words of the statute?"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2473.148,2474.057,"Yes, we do."
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2527.484,2533.999,Suppose the United States attorney in the District said that you have to give credit for cooperation.
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2549.713,2554.706,"Well, first of all, let me say that we have internal guidelines--"
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2554.706,2556.776,"Well, just play with the hypothetical, if you could."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2556.776,2559.748,"--Well, we would think that that would not be unconstitutional."
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2565.122,2570.416,And there's no abuse of discretion in that instance?
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2570.416,2574.667,"Well, again, there might be abuse of discretion in a sort of ordinary, administrative law sense."
1991.91-5771,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2713.349,2721.066,"Of course we could... we wouldn't necessarily allow all that discovery, if we disagreed with your position."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2721.066,2721.546,"Well, that's right."
1991.91-5771,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2722.515,2724.928,"You could require him to just tell his own story, and see what--"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2724.928,2725.219,--That's right.
1991.91-5771,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2834.487,2841.352,"--Can you tell me, suppose the defendant thinks he can produce a very important result."
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2857.485,2861.616,I don't want to tell you something I'm not sure of.
1991.91-5771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2898.692,2901.514,"Which is a constitutional violation, is that right?"
1991.91-5771,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2901.514,2902.054,--Yes.
1991.91-5771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3123.787,3125.149,"Thank you, Mr. Long."
1991.91-5771,2,32007,j_matthew_martin,,3127.961,3131.193,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-5771,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3189.331,3192.873,I'm a little puzzled by it... how do you know that he's uncounseled at that time?
1991.91-5771,2,32007,j_matthew_martin,,3192.873,3205.131,"--I... I... I believe that it's clear from the record and from the court of appeals brief that immediately upon his arrest, he made this cooperation."
1991.91-5771,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3253.914,3255.997,"Thank you, Mr. Martin."
