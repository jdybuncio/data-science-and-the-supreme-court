1973.72-6902,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.048,We’ll hear arguments next in Gooding against the United States.
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,45.171,45.71,Thank you.
1973.72-6902,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,628.321,635.089,"Well, except -- doesn’t the government claim here that the search was not conducted in the nighttime?"
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,635.089,642.102,"Yes, the government for the first time in this entire case is saying that 9:30 at night, some-four hours after sunset, is not night."
1973.72-6902,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,642.102,647.496,"So, to that extent, I suppose the government would say that the conditions of the XXIII were complied with, wouldn’t it?"
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,647.496,647.968,Yes.
1973.72-6902,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,651.94,656.573,Right.
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,656.573,665.053,"Now, if the Court decides that Section 879 (a) is the standard, then we also believe that the warrant is defective."
1973.72-6902,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,704.688,723.395,"Are you, in effect, reading in 879 (a) the explicit provision of 522 (c) 1, namely the application must demonstrate that (a) it cannot be executed during the hours of daylight?"
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,723.395,730.692,"No, we’re not -- we did advocate that to the Court of Appeals, but as we’ve indicated in the reply brief, we’re not advancing that argument here."
1973.72-6902,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,738.73,740.5,"Well, what additional here."
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,740.5,746.142,An additional showing of why you need -- why the police needs to go into a man’s home at night.
1973.72-6902,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,752.49,762.28,"Well, if you have to show why you have to go in at night, doesn’t that imply that it can’t be executed during the hours of daylight?"
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,762.28,765.421,"Well, that may be one reason why you can’t do it."
1973.72-6902,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,785.733,793.198,Or some showing of probable cause to believe that grounds exists for the service in the nighttime?
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,793.198,793.902,That’s correct.
1973.72-6902,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,793.902,795.385,That’s way you read 879 (a)?
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,795.385,799.225,That’s correct.
1973.72-6902,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,825.317,834.529,I gather such warrants under 414 may be issued either by the Superior Court or by United States magistrate?
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,834.529,835.398,That is correct.
1973.72-6902,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,839.462,847.827,"And under 879, they may be obtained either from a District Court judge or a United States magistrate?"
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,847.827,850.4,Right.
1973.72-6902,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,850.4,857.37,"Although what it says is if the judge, is Judge Mino the District Court judge in 879 (a)?"
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,857.37,865.635,"No, I believe, and I’d have to double check, I believe there’s a definition that means a State Court judge too."
1973.72-6902,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,865.635,868.905,"Well, how about a Superior Court judge in the district?"
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,868.905,881.442,"Well, if it does say State Court judge, and I think it would have to include a District of Columbia Superior Court judge too because the District of Columbia is defined as a state in this Act."
1973.72-6902,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.596,962.647,"Under 879, under the plain language of the statute that you rely on, don’t you have to make the same showing for a daytime service as a nighttime service?"
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,962.647,964.951,One could construe that grammatically.
1973.72-6902,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.284,973.933,"Well I know, but we’re looking at the face of the statute."
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,978.252,980.451,"Right, I agree."
1973.72-6902,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.448,990.656,This is your crux --
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,990.656,990.816,No.
1973.72-6902,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,990.816,992.24,You say unless you have something at night.
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,992.24,992.55,"Yes, because night is --"
1973.72-6902,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,992.55,993.562,Nighttime search other than --
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,993.562,993.784,Night is always the --
1973.72-6902,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.784,995.577,What you have for a daytime search.
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,995.577,999.755,"Night is always the exception and, under the common law, you couldn’t serve search warrants at night so --"
1973.72-6902,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,999.755,1003.774,I’m just suggesting then that you are departing from nighttime search.
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,1003.774,1009.081,"To that extent, yes."
1973.72-6902,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.603,1065.159,"Well, wouldn’t that be a rather difficult thing for an informant or the officer making the affidavit to state in any case?"
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,1065.159,1076.208,"Well, the informant said Mr. Gooding is selling narcotics from his home, and you could say “it seems to me the informant could say, based on his knowledge, he’s selling a lot of narcotics or he’s selling only to close friends.”"
1973.72-6902,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1086.058,1088.058,Green?
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,1088.058,1089.598,Lady’s green handbag.[Laughter]
1973.72-6902,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1116.654,1120.587,"Well, that’s a good argument for a different statute, Mr. Rosenthal."
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,1140.796,1144.95,"I mean, as to -- well, one judge of the Court of Appeals thought so."
1973.72-6902,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1151.82,1154.731,"Then he went on to find that it was satisfied, didn’t he?"
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,1154.731,1169.444,"Yes, he did, and we think he erred there because there just weren’t sufficient findings below, plus the fact the government had conceded that this warrant did not have anything of a particularized nature justifying a nighttime search."
1973.72-6902,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1246.047,1249.739,"Of course those are both constitutional violations, weren’t they, ad valorem Spinelli?"
1973.72-6902,0,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,1249.739,1250.668,That’s correct.
1973.72-6902,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1332.459,1333.761,"Very well, Mr. Rosenthal."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1337.732,1341.321,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1441.6,1446.577,"But these were police officers, city police officers?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1446.577,1448.365,"Yes, they were, and --"
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1448.365,1450.78,"Well, how could they be executing a federal warrant?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1450.78,1474.662,"Well, Section 138 of Title IV of the D.C. Code expressly authorizes them to do so and Justice Douglas’ dissent from the denial of certiorari in the Thomas case, and which I believe you concurred, made that same conclusion that the D.C. police officers are, to that extent, federal agents with a duty to enforce federal as well as local law."
1973.72-6902,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1474.662,1483.85,But your -- is it your submission that Judge Gesell’s holding then was not even a possible alternative in this case?
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1483.85,1487.106,"Well, we submit that Title XXIII simply is inapplicable."
1973.72-6902,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1499.55,1501.593,Although Judge Gesell held that that was the applicable statute?
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1501.593,1505.757,Although Judge Gesell held that it was applicable to all searches by D.C. police officers.
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1507.646,1511.544,"Well, what did you tell the magistrate?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1517.646,1519.802,He was issuing a search warrant.
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1519.802,1521.529,Federal or state?
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1521.529,1527.889,"Well, our contention is that it was a warrant authorizing the D.C. police officers to search Mr. Gooding’s home and that it cannot --"
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1527.889,1537.01,"And if it was valid under one, it was good, and if it was valid in the other -- is that quite [Coughing] business?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1537.01,1553.947,"Well, I’m not sure and, indeed, in view of the way this case has developed I understand that it is now -- they are now, as a matter of course, reciting both the District of Columbia Code and the federal violation in the warrant application, but the cases have held that you need not --"
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1553.947,1566.199,"Can -- in a state, like the State of Maryland, could the State of Maryland issue a search warrant for a violation of a federal code?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1566.199,1570.556,I’m not clear whether Mary -- you mean -- there’s no question that a Maryland --
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1570.556,1572.219,Could a state magistrate --
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1572.219,1582.396,"A state judge may, under Rule 41 and I think under this provision of the US Code, may issue a warrant to a federal officer."
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1582.396,1584.989,"No, this is just state officer."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1584.989,1590.718,"Well, in the case of Maryland, I think only a federal officer may apply."
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1593.268,1599.695,"Well, you -- as I understand, it’s the government’s position that you’re making the District of Columbia stay."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1599.695,1599.836,"Well, the statute --"
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1599.836,1613.402,"Well, if the state -- I’m taking as a state like Maryland, and I have never heard of a state magistrate issuing a search warrant for the violation of a federal offense to a state officer."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1615.653,1631.259,"Well, I simply -- that analogy, I don’t think, is applicable to our case, Mr. Justice Marshall, because we are dealing with – we are dealing with a warrant that was issued by a federal magistrate to an officer who was, for these purposes, a federal and a local officer."
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1631.259,1635.392,Is the magistrate in Washington a federal magistrate?
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1635.392,1639.617,I think he’s in the United States Courthouse.
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1647.818,1650.17,Yes.
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1653.615,1663.311,"Our argument, Justice Marshall, is that on the face of the application for the search warrant certain facts were recited which the magistrate found to be the case."
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1696.802,1705.346,"Well, Mr. Frey, I gather that your position at least is that 521 and 523 are inapplicable?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1705.346,1706.746,Certainly.
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1706.746,1709.412,But you don’t claim that 414 is applicable?
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1709.412,1710.572,We do claim that 414 --
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1710.572,1712.758,"And you disagree with the Court of Appeals, apparently?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1712.758,1714.254,We do disagree with the Court of Appeals.
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1714.254,1715.261,"Oh, I see."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1733.952,1734.277,"Well, we --"
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1734.277,1741.737,"And, therefore, they go on to say that this requirement -- we will proceed on the assumption that 414 would not validate the search warrants involved."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1741.737,1755.721,We have argued in our brief that that -- this requirement is clearly met on the face of the record because the requirement to examine on oath and to have affidavits or deposition of the witnesses requires two things.
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1769.445,1787.701,"But tell me, Mr. Frey, even if all this is right, ordinarily, we don’t review interpretations by the Court of Appeals, either of the district or of the United States Court of Appeals, of the meaning of district code provisions, do we?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1787.701,1789.224,"Well, I think that would be true as to the --"
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1789.224,1790.726,I know.
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1791.118,1791.871,"No, you don’t ordinarily."
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1791.871,1798.494,"No, we don’t, and why should we in this case?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1798.494,1815.922,"Well, you would be deciding this case in a rather artificial context, I think if you ignored the fact, but you have to recognize the fact that the District of Columbia Code contains a provision for narcotics searches which requires the magistrate to authorize such searches at any time of the day or night."
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1851.701,1863.667,"Well, if we’re going to get into the business of second guessing, particularly under the new judicial instruction, the interpretation of D.C. Code provisions by the --"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1863.667,1864.047,"Well, you’re being asked to --"
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1864.047,1866.878,"Court of Appeals, we’re going to --"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1866.878,1867.085,To apply it.
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1867.085,1870.632,Then we’re going to have a lot more work than we have now to do.
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1870.632,1877.139,"[Attempt to Laughter] No, we contend that you should defer to the rulings of the local courts on questions of local law."
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1877.402,1878.943,Except when you disagree with it.
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1878.943,1881.054,No.
1973.72-6902,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1881.054,1887.49,"The question here is whether the D.C. Code provision is applicable or the general federal provision is applicable, that’s one of the questions?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1887.49,1889.138,That’s one of the questions that was passed on below.
1973.72-6902,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1889.138,1892.751,So it’s not the construction of a D.C. Code provision as such?
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1892.751,1901.572,"Well, there was a suggestion in the -- in Judge Fahy's opinion that we could not rely on Title XXXIII."
1973.72-6902,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1906.03,1922.303,I wonder if either of the United States Court of Appeals or the District Court anymore has the same authoritative mantle in construing the District of Columbia statute since the Court Reorganization Act and the enactment of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals?
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1922.303,1924.86,I think it would be the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1951.745,1953.082,"Well, there you are."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1963.849,1971.77,"Well, with all respect Justice Brennan, I don’t believe that was a holding by the D.C. Court of Appeals on the availability of 414."
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2338.847,2342.128,But they had a whole day?
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2342.128,2342.678,Excuse me?
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2342.678,2345.447,They had a whole day to execute it and they didn’t.
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2348.489,2352.595,"Well, I think there’s no suggestion here of any improper motive."
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2362.982,2370.692,"Well, I don’t know that’s one way or the other, but I’m saying you say that the officer has no responsibility at all, only the magistrate."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2378.461,2389.484,"Well -- but I think, Justice Marshall, that it’s unrealistic to suppose that when the police officer gets a command from the magistrate saying you are commanded forth with to serve this warrant within 10 days --"
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2389.484,2392.926,"Well, how can they serve it in the day and the night?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2406.61,2408.482,"Well, let me say this, Justice Marshall."
1973.72-6902,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2425.936,2437.273,"And didn’t Justice Harlan said that it’s difficult to have to enforce it during the day and, in the privacy of the nighttime, you can do a private arrest."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2437.273,2454.341,"Well, of course this brings us to the argument in the sense that, in this particular case, on these facts we’re talking about a kind of search which this court has, in October 1972, determined would not be considered a nighttime search."
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2508.351,2510.45,"What was Weeks, Mr. Frey?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2510.45,2512.013,Weeks was constitutional --
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2512.013,2512.457,It was?
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2512.457,2513.162,Violation. -- violation.
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2513.328,2515.719,Was there a warrant?
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2515.719,2519.043,Was there a warrant in Weeks?
1973.72-6902,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2570.451,2571.857,And by the officer.
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2571.857,2572.469,Excuse me?
1973.72-6902,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.469,2574.412,And by the officer.
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2574.412,2577.218,"Well, presumably in so far as he--"
1973.72-6902,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.218,2583.333,"Well, unless he thought that he was entitled to the warrant, I think he wouldn’t have made out that affidavit."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2583.333,2589.5,"I think he probably believed that he was entitled to the warrant, that’s true."
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2589.5,2592.866,"I just looked at Weeks, Mr. Frey, and you’re correct."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2600.911,2636.36,"We do believe that there is a policy that favors, encouraging the police to go for a warrant, and the Jones, and Willard, and Ventresca language which we’ve adverted to in our brief clearly shows that when the police go to the magistrate for a warrant, a search, which otherwise might not be considered a probable cause search and therefore a constitutional violation, will be considered a probable cause search in a sense to reward the police or alternatively at least not to punish them, not to hold them to stringent standards when they have gone to the magistrate."
1973.72-6902,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2636.36,2642.376,"Mr. Frey, although it might change your view, this is just exclusionary."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2642.376,2650.259,"Well, the -- I think the language in Ventresca suggests that it would change the determination of probable cause."
1973.72-6902,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2762.539,2770.776,Didn’t the Court’s opinion say in the Miller case that a few more words before the break in would have satisfied the statute?
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2770.776,2773.49,"Well, I think that’s right."
1973.72-6902,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2773.822,2780.956,"In other words, they hadn’t disclosed purpose and authority and identity as completely --"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2780.956,2781.221,That’s right.
1973.72-6902,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2781.221,2783.257,-- as the Court thought the statute required it.
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2783.257,2786.665,That’s right.
1973.72-6902,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2835.223,2850.722,"But no matter what the Courts would say in this particular case, you’re still going to get arguments before magistrates and in subsequent opinions as to whether there was or was not a proper showing of validity for a nighttime search if the Court should adopt that proposition."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2850.722,2857.893,"That’s true, and I suppose there could be other circumstances in which we would advance the same argument, if they got a warrant."
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2910.39,2915.317,"Again, shouldn’t we wait on Courts of the District of Columbia to tell us what they think their code means?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2915.317,2921.752,"Well, it’s also presumably an open question under the US Code provision, Section 879."
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2921.752,2926.424,Only if 879 (a) is interpreted as petitioner asks us to.
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2926.424,2926.673,Right.
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2932.464,2939.131,"You want us to interpret 521, for example, which certainly explicitly refers to nighttime."
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2939.131,2940.013,"Well, let me say this."
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2953.015,2956.702,"You do want us to interpret the D.C. Code, don't you?"
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2956.702,2957.434,Not at all.
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2957.434,2959.746,Before the judges there get a chance to interpret it?
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2959.746,2970.389,Not-- I simply suggest that we will withdraw the argument with respect to nighttime search under the D.C. Code if you find that it was a nighttime search under the Federal Code.
1973.72-6902,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2984.409,2987.511,I have no doubt either.
1973.72-6902,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2987.511,2996.149,But that’s an inevitable result of the role of this Court.
1973.72-6902,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3056.676,3059.008,"Mr. Rosenthal, do you have anything further?"
1973.72-6902,2,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,3059.008,3062.345,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-6902,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3183.779,3185.031,"Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal."
1973.72-6902,2,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,3190.695,3191.041,Yes.
1973.72-6902,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3191.041,3195.795,"On behalf of the Court, I thank you for your assistance to Mr. Gooding and your assistance to the Court."
1973.72-6902,2,27903,herbert_a_rosenthal,,3195.795,3196.888,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1973.72-6902,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3196.888,3198.891,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
