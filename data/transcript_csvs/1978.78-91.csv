1978.78-91,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,44.481,We'll hear arguments next in Jones against Wolf.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,47.597,50.609,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,151.51,152.558,May I ask Mr. Prettyman.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,156.201,156.825,I'm sorry.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,156.825,159.847,The session is the court of first instance?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,159.847,161.38,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,161.38,163.343,And that's composed of?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,163.343,169.623,That is composed of the minister and elected elders of the local church.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,340.248,350.141,"Mr. Prettyman, assume that the resolution had been adopted unanimously, the May resolution, what is your view as to what the status of the ownership of the church would have been then?"
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,350.141,360.734,The unanimous vote in my view Your Honor would have had no effect and it has been so held in various state courts.
1978.78-91,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,360.975,362.476,And who would have owned the church then?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,362.476,370.422,"Then the -- under the constitution, it would have reverted to the presbytery itself."
1978.78-91,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.422,377.614,"Mr. Prettyman, supposing that the commission appointed by the -- is it -- was the possession you're referring to that made these three findings?"
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,377.614,380.262,That -- that's the commission appointed by the presbytery.
1978.78-91,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.262,389.021,The commission appointed by the presbytery had a member who was financially interested in the outcome of this particular dispute.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,414.648,427.341,The question of where a -- what happens when a church commission acts improperly is one that is somewhat up in the air as a result of this Court's decision.
1978.78-91,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,436.382,438.106,That wasn't really my question.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,443.451,446.158,I thought you were suggesting that somebody had a financial interest in the outcome.
1978.78-91,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,446.158,450.062,"Well, but I'm also assuming that the Book of Order says that's no problem."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,450.062,458.795,"Well, if the Book of Order says that's no problem, I -- my own view is that a civil court cannot look into that under the ruling under the Serbian."
1978.78-91,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.795,468.033,Even though with respect to all other voluntary associations the state can apply its rule that says no voluntary association can afford that or can apply that sort of rule.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,468.033,470.084,That's correct but I must --
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,470.084,475.312,I gather that unless the situation falls within the Gonzales fraud or collusion.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,475.312,476.111,Exactly.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,476.111,476.779,Otherwise --
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,476.779,477.766,Exactly.
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,508.145,513.852,When you tell us what basis you have for saying it's the property follows the denomination.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,515.186,517.177,"I will tell you what Your Honor, I'm sorry."
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.177,523.096,What basis you have for saying that the property follows the true congregation.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,523.096,523.332,Yes.
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.927,539.69,"Well, I know the true congregation but you determine who the true congregation is but why does that determine the ownership of the property?"
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,539.69,556.522,Everyone in this case agrees Your Honor that the title to this property is in certain trustees who hold it for the benefit of the church which is made up of the congregation so that the congregation owns this property --
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.522,557.549,Would you think the --
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,557.549,560.73,"-- and consequently, the only question is who is the congregation?"
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,560.73,565.716,And then -- why did the Supreme Court of Georgia disagree there?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,565.716,571.323,"Well, the Supreme Court of Georgia quite frankly misunderstood the argument in this case and I'll be very candid."
1978.78-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,637.754,640.616,May I get to something perhaps more direct.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,640.616,640.952,Sure.
1978.78-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,640.952,643.977,"Now, what about the title documents?"
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,643.977,644.489,The title documents --
1978.78-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,644.489,645.802,But look it -- may I just ask.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,645.802,646.064,Sir?
1978.78-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,646.763,652.641,"Exhibit G, is that a sample of all the title documents involved here?"
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,652.641,660.142,All of the title documents except one place the property in the names of trustees.
1978.78-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,660.142,662.861,"Well, I'm reading here."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,668.479,668.557,Yes.
1978.78-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,668.557,669.289,Is that the way all the members --
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,669.289,670.653,That's typically except one.
1978.78-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,675.01,675.465,"Now, in other words --"
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,675.465,681.268,Of course the property directly to the church but the others all gave it to trustees and virtually all that immunes the word --
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.268,682.966,Who the trustees for?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,682.966,683.262,Pardon me.
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,683.262,687.108,Do any of the deed say who the trustees hold for?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,687.108,693.653,"Yes, the deed say normally say for the use, benefit and behoove of the congregation, of the church which of course --"
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.653,694.322,Of the church?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,694.322,697.536,Of the church which of course is the congregation.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,697.536,697.896,"Well, I don't find that permissible."
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,697.896,699.599,"Well, I don't know."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,712.293,724.036,"Well, under Section 2-3 of the Book of Church Order, it reads that visible church catholic includes the local congregations or particular churches."
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,745.586,761.577,What if that state law simply said that in churches in taking property shall take the property in the name of the religious corporation and that's the end of it and whoever controls a religious corporation controls the property.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,763.593,768.696,"No, not necessarily because here, that would follow what happens here."
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,769.854,779.634,"Yes, but you have to put in some power in them in the presbytery to overrule the majority -- the rule of majority rule inside of the corporation."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,779.634,791.343,"Well, Your Honor, there are all kinds of -- there are at least six different provisions in here that in my judgment gives the presbytery power to say who the congregation is."
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,791.343,793.197,But may I get back a moment bit Mr. Prettyman --
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,793.197,795.156,Sure.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,795.156,797.79,"There was a religious corporation organized here, was there not?"
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,797.79,798.001,Yes.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,800.952,801.743,A corporation.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,801.743,802.79,Organized in 1950.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,802.79,806.311,Now -- and it had a 35 year life.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,806.311,807.242,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,807.242,814.206,"And the -- it -- that 35 years expired in -- when was it, 19 --"
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,814.206,816.714,"Well, I forget the date but there a lapse of years because the church --"
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,816.714,816.825,Alright.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,816.825,817.516,-- I didn't realize it had --
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,817.516,823.355,"Right and the as I understand it, there was a petition for we incorporate."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,823.355,824.854,That's correct and that was granted.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,824.854,828.204,And it was granted and that gave it another 35 years.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,828.204,828.974,That's correct.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,828.974,833.001,And that expired in 1970.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,833.001,833.463,I --
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,833.463,833.842,As the entire
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,833.842,836.828,I was on the impression that the church is presently incorporated Your Honor.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,836.828,838.841,"Oh, that's -- so I can't find in the record."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,839.003,839.341,"Well, I --"
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,839.341,840.196,-- I've been looking for.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,840.196,840.93,I -- I can't account to that.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,840.93,846.2,"And my question was who does it on the title now, is there -- if there's no longer a corporation?"
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,846.2,849.434,"Oh, I understand that under Georgia law, corporations are not perpetual."
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,851.518,852.061,"Oh, I see."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,852.591,852.629,I've been advised by --
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,852.629,853.146,-- of --
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,853.146,854.687,-- the Georgia counsel.
1978.78-91,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,854.687,857.471,-- documented record indicate it had a 35 of your life.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,857.471,857.935,No.
1978.78-91,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,875.669,881.621,"Now, that petition for reincorporation, the 1938 one, wasn't it?"
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,898.986,899.231,Yes.
1978.78-91,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,901.984,913.879,In which has vested the legal supervision of the affairs of said church to make this application for a vital and renewal said charter as it will appear from the duly certified resolution of the session of the church.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,913.879,914.525,Yes.
1978.78-91,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,914.525,917.532,"Now, what I'm trying to get out is."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,926.064,926.603,Yes.
1978.78-91,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,938.708,944.421,But -- you're not suggesting that the session and the corporation wanted the same thing.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,944.421,947.352,"Well, I'm suggesting -- no, wait, no, I'm not."
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,968.61,995.027,"I take that your submission would be then that if the church -- if the church rule is that when a local congregation affiliates, it becomes bound by a set of hierarchical rules in the sense that -- in the sense that the presbytery has control of the -- has the decision making power over who the congregation is."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,995.027,996.371,There's no question about it.
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.371,1004.481,"If a state -- your submission, I take it is that a state may not disregard that once the affiliation has been made."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1004.481,1005.097,Absolutely.
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.097,1005.247,Yes.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1005.247,1008.641,There are at least 11 different O's set forth in the Book of Church --
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1008.641,1011.93,"Yes, well, I -- but -- more simply than that."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1025.623,1033.718,"Yes, I -- in view of the fact that the -- these -- the various deeds and so forth."
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1035.016,1044.46,"Well, really what I'm trying to get at if you would have make that argument now then why wouldn't you be making the argument that these were simply neutral principles dealing with the title of real estate."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1044.46,1047.729,"Well, I don't -- the reason that I don't have to make that argument is that everyone --"
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1047.729,1050.225,"Well, I think it's much simpler than the one you're making."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1050.225,1053.302,"Well, I'll be happy to make that one then Your Honor if you --"
1978.78-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1053.302,1061.869,But you're making a half of a neutral principles argument in the sense that right on the face of the documents you say titles in the congregation.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1061.869,1062.041,Neutral --
1978.78-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1062.041,1065.028,And -- then you just merely have to determine who the congregation is.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1065.028,1065.849,That's the point.
1978.78-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1079.194,1081.374,"I mean, (Voice Overlap) the congregation --"
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1081.374,1082.499,-- and therefore who is the congregation?
1978.78-91,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1082.499,1083.873,"-- which is the session, isn't it?"
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1083.873,1086.374,And the church has properly ruled on the question of who --
1978.78-91,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1086.374,1092.158,"Well, you used the neutral principles that suit you and the other ones that you pay from the church law."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1092.158,1093.995,I don't use any neutral principles at all.
1978.78-91,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1109.987,1110.354,But isn't the --
1978.78-91,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1110.354,1113.666,But why didn't the Supreme Court of Georgia rule in your favor?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1113.666,1127.654,"Because the Supreme Court of Georgia thought that this case was a Hull case in which we were trying to assert an implied trust in favor of the mother church and it said, since Hull, there is no implied trust in Georgia."
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1153.661,1167.745,"But the Georgia Court had said -- they realized -- they had looked at the book and said, “We know the book says the presbytery has this power but we under the Supreme Court's cases are privileged to disregard that and just to apply neutral -- so-called neutral principles."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1169.713,1176.81,"Oh, you ruled in Kedroff and Gonzales and Serbian and in all of these cases that of course they have to follow that."
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1220.071,1227.136,"Mr. Prettyman, when I asked you at the beginning if there were no -- if the vote had been unanimous, I asked you where would the title be and you said it would have been in the mother church."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1228.362,1229.073,That -- no.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1319.084,1319.367,You mean the Chaps --
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1319.367,1325.466,In Chaps versus -- and I'd like to make three points about that.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1403.166,1404.946,But assuming it's a hierarchical.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1404.946,1415.752,"Yes, assuming it's hierarchical and there is no question here that the trial court held were hierarchical that the state court can then turn to statutes or turn to neutral principles or whatever."
1978.78-91,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1495.839,1497.508,Isn't it a little more than deference?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1497.508,1497.746,Pardon me?
1978.78-91,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1497.746,1499.972,Is it a little more than deference?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1499.972,1503.375,It must absolutely abide by it and I use deference --
1978.78-91,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1503.375,1504.287,That is in deference.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1504.287,1505.397,-- and that you're absolutely right.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1515.921,1524.634,"Now, where did you find in Sharpsburg the suggestion that it's only where there isn't any church --"
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1524.634,1525.362,Because you said --
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1525.362,1526.046,-- court decision?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1526.046,1538.779,"-- or after you referred to neutral principles, you then said -- again, however, general principles of property law may not be relied upon if their application requires civil courts to resolve doctrinal issues."
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1608.995,1609.46,But Mr. Prettyman --
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1609.46,1611.167,I'd like to save --
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1611.167,1626.042,Suppose the church law was that the title to church property shall be in taking the name of the congregation or for the benefit of the congregation but the state law says --
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1626.042,1626.878,So long as this --
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.878,1638.574,"The state law says, title to property shall be taken in the name of the board of directors of a religious -- of the religious corporation or in the name of the corporation alone and that's the end of it."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1639.526,1647.96,There is nothing wrong with any state law that so long as it does not intrude upon the system setup within the hierarchical --
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.96,1654.715,"Yes, but the state -- under the state law, the -- under the state -- but according to the state law, the property is not held for the benefit of the congregation."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1660.368,1660.985,"Well, it --"
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1660.985,1665.408,"And that whoever the board of directors happens to convey it off to, that's the end of it."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1665.408,1672.268,"Well, the board of directors could do nothing under the PCUS constitution that is not reviewable under the PCUS constitutional --"
1978.78-91,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.268,1681.043,So you would say then -- you would say that the state law may not give that board of directors that church power to convey the property contrary to church law.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1681.043,1682.739,"Absolutely, sure."
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1683.635,1701.674,Mr. Prettyman before you sit down let me ask you probably a stupid question but you phrased the question as whether or not the decision that your clients are the con -- or the congregation is reviewable and they agree that who the congregation is.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1709.45,1713.183,They would say that it is -- if I understand them --
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1713.183,1713.88,What do you say?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1716.204,1716.686,Alright.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1716.686,1717.038,Once they've conceded --
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1717.038,1717.652,What I say --
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1717.652,1719.319,-- that if you can pick the congregation.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1719.319,1736.793,"I say the issue is the church -- this hierarchical church having properly decided who the congregation is and everybody agreeing that the congregation owns the property, we, the petitioners --"
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1736.793,1739.52,"Well, but they don't agree to that."
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1744.324,1744.543,No.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1752.861,1753.175,No.
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1754.879,1758.687,"Well, then they say that at least the Georgia Court is right."
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1761.869,1762.74,Decide what?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1762.74,1764.482,I have to be very candid with you Mr. Justice.
1978.78-91,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1781.603,1783.13,So you don't know what the issue is either?
1978.78-91,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1783.13,1796.638,But it -- I do know they say that the Watson rule is not the rule in Georgia and I do know that that's wrong so maybe that's the issue.
1978.78-91,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1796.638,1812.859,"Mr. Jones, before you continue, I think at this time it's clear that we will be occupied until three o'clock and Mr. Auberly and Mr. Lou Coff are free to retire and return at 10 in the morning if you wish."
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,1817.659,1821.023,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-91,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1868.48,1873.947,"Mr. Jones, you referred to Carnes that involved the Methodist church."
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,1873.947,1874.662,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-91,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1874.662,1883.593,Why do you think there is an amicus brief here by the appropriate body of a Methodist Church opposing your position?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,1883.593,1889.711,"Your Honor, I find that somewhat difficult to understand and I'd like to answer it in this way if I may."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1961.083,1965.107,But do you agree that the property is held for the benefit of the congregation?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,1965.107,1966.491,"No, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.517,1972.614,What if you did -- then would Mr. Prettyman's result follow or not?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,1972.614,1973.829,Let me answer it this way.
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.315,1979.066,"Well, is there a yes or no answer to that or not?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,1979.066,1981.684,"Your Honor, I disagree with the conclusion reached by Mr. Prettyman."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.684,1986.774,"I know but assume that the property were held for the congregation, would his result follow?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,1986.774,1989.27,"No, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2035.658,2040.962,"Mr. Jones, this is an argument in disagreement with Mr. Prettyman's reading of the Book of Church Orders?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2040.962,2043.084,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2043.084,2045.003,"While I have you interrupted, may I ask this question?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2045.003,2045.58,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2045.58,2054.063,"Oh, what are the title deeds which led the Supreme Court of Georgia to reach the result it did?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2054.063,2056.828,"Your Honor, the title deeds are -- there are three tracks."
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2056.828,2057.1,Yes.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2057.1,2060.456,Two of the tracks are to trustees of the local church --
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2060.456,2060.527,This is --
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2060.527,2061.678,-- and their successor.
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2061.678,2064.027,It's either I referred to earlier?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2064.733,2067.878,"Your Honor, there are actually a total of six deeds I believe and --"
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2067.878,2070.469,"Yes, well, I think -- I thought this was just a sample."
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2070.469,2072.725,They -- all six appear in the appendix.
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2072.725,2079.072,"Well, this one is a conveyance to the present trustees for Vineville Presbyterian Church and their successors enough?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2079.072,2080.047,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2080.047,2081.018,And is that the way the others --
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2081.018,2081.704,That's typical.
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2084.533,2087.016,Now the Supreme Court of Georgia relied on these deeds.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2087.016,2087.601,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2087.601,2088.956,And then what next?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2088.956,2090.755,They relied on four things Your Honor.
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2111.013,2116.072,"Now, where -- was there any definition of local church in any of these papers?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2116.072,2116.514,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2152.862,2154.106,"Now, before you get to that --"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2154.106,2154.77,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2154.77,2158.366,"-- at that point there is -- that's the beginning of the controversy, isn't it?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2158.366,2158.947,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2158.947,2165.64,"And under the Church orders, under the law of the church, who resolves disputes?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2165.64,2168.445,Solely the local congregation.
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2170.032,2191.626,"Well, may I -- I thought one thing that -- if anything, Hull and all the other cases stood for is that courts including this one, whatnot got into resolving controversies of the kind apparently exist between you and Mr. Prettyman over the meaning of the Book of Church Order that that's something that the church courts decide --"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2191.626,2192.087,Your Honor that is --
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2192.087,2194.699,"-- and just take whatever the courts -- church courts decide, don't they?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2194.699,2208.803,"That is certainly true if it involves an in depth analysis but as the Maryland Court of Appeals held in Sharpsburg and this Court approved, a facial or superficial examination is permitted under the application of mutual processes of law."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.803,2221.376,That's right but not in the -- not in the -- not in opposition to a contrary judgment of the -- if what everybody agrees is a higher authority in the church.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2221.376,2223.115,"Your Honor, I'm coming to that in just a moment."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.115,2226.373,The presbytery certainly doesn't agree with you --
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2226.373,2227.393,We take the position that this --
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.393,2232.007,-- as to what that book means.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2232.007,2234.654,"Your Honor, let me reply to that in some detail if I may."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.654,2235.235,"Oh, yes, alright, its alright."
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2235.235,2237.238,It's a terribly important question.
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.238,2238.392,I don't think it is.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2238.392,2248.914,"First of all, the Book of Church Order itself in Section 6.1 and 6.2, one deals with an unincorporated church, the other one is an incorporated church."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2266.548,2267.226,But who would --
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2267.226,2272.056,Then becomes important to define who or what is the local congregation.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2272.056,2276.287,"Well, Your Honor, this controversy when it arose of course resulted in two factions."
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2276.287,2276.773,Yes.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2276.773,2283.108,And this Court from the very outset has never or this case has never been concerned with the identity of the true congregation.
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2283.108,2294.127,"Well, if the local -- if under the law, the local congregation owns the property then it's vital to determine and define what or who was the local congregation."
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2294.127,2299.636,"Well, Your Honor, there was -- this is a typical local church property dispute where there are two factions and the question is --"
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2299.636,2300.072,"Well, I understand that fact --"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2300.072,2304.374,-- does this faction or that faction have title to the property under the neutral principles --
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2304.374,2304.609,And --
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2304.609,2306.066,"-- or formal title doctrine, --"
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2306.066,2306.896,And that --
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2306.896,2308.391,-- which this Court has approved in --
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2308.391,2313.452,And that depends upon who was the local or what is the local congregation.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2315.511,2318.438,"Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree."
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2320.11,2320.5,"Well, that is the issue, isn't it?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2320.5,2322.787,-- or the Supreme Court and it was not decided by this Court.
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2322.787,2331.787,If the local congregation owns that property then in order to determine who owns the property it's essential to determine who is the local congregation.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2334.81,2337.549,"Your Honor, may I answer it two ways."
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2337.549,2338.254,"Well, yes."
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2338.254,2343.178,I would respectfully say that's not the issue but I would like to give a full answer to it.
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.528,2414.26,"The presbytery thought otherwise, didn't they?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2414.26,2416.956,They are contending otherwise obviously Your Honor.
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.411,2420.965,So they disagree with you on the reading of the book.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2420.965,2426.19,"Your Honor, I -- no citation appears to the Book of Church Order that gives any such authority."
1978.78-91,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.167,2464.445,What page was that?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2464.445,2468.538,At pages -- beginning at page 6 Your Honor of the petitioners' replied brief.
1978.78-91,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.538,2470.015,Yes.
1978.78-91,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2598.438,2617.105,What if the Book of Order provided just as it did with respect to amendments to the Book of Order but had an additional provision that only a session of the general assembly shall be entitled the question of the validity of an amendment that's adopted?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2617.105,2620.624,"Your Honor, I suppose it would simply be a different amending process."
1978.78-91,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2628.62,2652.853,"Well, can a denomination prescribe a method for amending its fundamental charter which in this case I think is the Book of Order and say that challenges to the method by which the amend -- for a particular amendment was adopted may only be raised in the canonical church or before the canonical session?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2652.853,2653.788,Probably so.
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2669.475,2690.64,"Well, do I -- I want to be sure I understand your argument that -- and is it that we cannot consider in this case the fact that the presbytery made a final decision that the petitioners were the true congregation?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2690.64,2693.731,"Your Honor, we do not question the right of the presbytery to decide --"
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2693.731,2694.153,"Well, no."
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2712.053,2712.54,"Your Honor, that maybe considered --"
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2712.54,2717.275,"You're certainly -- since that's not within the stipulation, we may not consider it in this case."
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2717.275,2717.637,"No, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2747.941,2756.75,But it's the kind of a saying that the -- it's a -- that the commission was carrying out?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2756.75,2757.097,"No, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.386,2767.174,But did it -- do you say that it was powerless to do what it purported to do?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2767.174,2772.813,"Your Honor, we say it had full power to do everything that it did except for the final act."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2783.415,2786.168,And as to who the true congregation is?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2786.168,2793.618,They have the right to decide for themselves who will be recognized by the denomination as the loyal or true members of the denomination.
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2836.132,2836.951,But we just --
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2836.951,2837.805,-- to local church property?
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2837.805,2845.108,We just skipped over the point that -- we've done that several times here.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2871.079,2873.084,"Well, Your Honor, I don't mean to be evasive."
1978.78-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2884.431,2886.05,"Well, it's always going to be after the event, isn't it?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2886.05,2886.663,Yes.
1978.78-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2886.663,2890.619,As a lawsuit is always subsequent to the controversy --
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2890.619,2891.856,Certainly Your Honor.
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2916.379,2926.492,"Well, obviously, the presbytery and the commission read that church book differently than you do on the -- in terms of that last step you were talking about."
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2932.156,2932.648,"No, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2974.627,2984.877,"Mr. Jones, I gather that your position relies upon the same documents that the -- that Mr. Prettyman relies on, does he?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,2985.037,2990.643,"Your Honor, other than the documents that are outside the record to which I alluded a moment ago --"
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2990.643,2995.662,"Well, I -- yes, I mean -- but -- what I mean, the deeds, the Book of Church Order, correct?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3007.634,3011.23,They made no interpretation Your Honor as far as the record reveals.
1978.78-91,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3012.956,3015.548,But they reached a conclusion or did they not?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3015.548,3020.326,"Your Honor, they had reached the conclusion that the minority were true to the denomination."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3021.968,3025.163,"Well, didn't they order somebody to turnover some property?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3025.163,3027.271,"They declared -- no, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3027.471,3028.367,What did they declare?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3028.367,3033.863,This was an ex parte proceeding incidentally that was not participated in by the respondents.
1978.78-91,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3047.17,3054.755,"Mr. Jones, just before the resolution was adopted, is it correct that the property was owned for the benefit of the congregation?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3054.755,3056.525,"Yes, by a trustees --"
1978.78-91,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3056.525,3057.233,Did it in some point in time --
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3057.233,3058.006,-- and the corporation.
1978.78-91,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3058.006,3060.529,-- ceased to be owned for the benefit of the congregation?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3060.529,3061.405,"I'm sorry sir, I didn't hear that."
1978.78-91,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3061.405,3066.573,At some point in time did the property ceased to be owned for the benefit of the congregation?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3066.573,3066.933,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3085.174,3086.674,As a matter of state law did the property owned --
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3086.674,3088.011,A matter of state law.
1978.78-91,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3088.011,3091.043,Property ownership changed just by adopting a resolution.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3091.043,3094.48,Well there being nothing in the Book of Church Order to the contrary.
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3106.423,3108.825,But that's in the charity of the local congregation.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3113.774,3115.571,"Obviously, I'm certain."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.571,3115.829,What is the congregation --
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3115.829,3116.789,If I could answer --
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3116.789,3126.249,"-- and when they adopted the resolution and then immediately after they adopted the resolution, is it not true, I think you've conceded this that the 95 were then the local congregation."
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3126.249,3127.27,"No, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.27,3127.338,"Well, but you --"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3127.338,3128.666,The 95 at that point Your Honor --
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3128.666,3130.527,You said that in your brief.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3136.064,3136.519,Your Honor --
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3136.519,3139.745,Maybe you didn't mean it but you say it.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3139.745,3157.87,"I -- I don't think we answered it -- we stated in that word, what we -- I believe said and certainly intended to say is that the denomination has the unquestioned right to determine for itself who it will recognize as being true or loyal members in that denomination's eyes."
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3167.026,3167.416,Let me ask --
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3167.416,3170.15,-- a little more fundamentally to go back --
1978.78-91,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.15,3173.658,Would you tell me before you're through what you understand the issue to be.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3173.658,3174.827,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3329.49,3331.321,What church was it in Sharpsburg?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3331.321,3332.517,Church of God.
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3332.517,3342.901,And wasn't there a determination first that that was not a hierarchical church that it was a congregational church and was that an absolute key to the decision in that case?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3342.901,3345.322,"I would respectfully say, ""No, Your Honor""."
1978.78-91,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3367.561,3369.779,"And that was quite essential to the decision of that case, isn't it?"
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3369.779,3370.964,A very important fact.
1978.78-91,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3451.467,3458.711,But you still say in your own papers that the local congregation is the petitioners.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3458.711,3459.439,"No, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3462.984,3468.43,Do you -- and didn't you say repeatedly that they -- is the congregation?
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3468.43,3469.317,"No, sir."
1978.78-91,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3471.704,3476.1,You said so in Footnote 9 of your brief.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3476.1,3477.58,I'm afraid my time is running out.
1978.78-91,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3496.649,3504.524,Even if it's perfectly clear that the purpose for which they adopted this or made this decision was for the purpose of trying to decide who own the property.
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3506.921,3509.686,That obviously was the ultimate result that was solved.
1978.78-91,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3520.385,3532.191,"But you'd be -- if I read your brief correctly, you didn't challenge anything in the find -- in their finding except the ultimate conclusion that the ownership followed the congregation."
1978.78-91,1,24157,frank_c_jones,,3532.191,3546.296,"Your Honor, it's difficult for me to reply to that in the time that remains other than to say that our position we believe has consistently been that the petitioners represent only the minority of the local congregation."
1978.78-91,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3575.165,3576.514,Do I have any time to make --
1978.78-91,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3576.514,3578.919,You have three minutes.
1978.78-91,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3581.793,3583.036,Thank you very much.
1978.78-91,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3643.637,3644.237,"But Mr. Prettyman, --"
1978.78-91,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3644.237,3644.483,And finally --
1978.78-91,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3644.483,3651.302,-- would you not agree that on the date they adopted the resolution that the congregation -- majority of the congregation could have conveyed a good title to this property --
1978.78-91,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3651.302,3651.325,I agree.
1978.78-91,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3651.325,3654.089,-- without the consent of their people in the central church?
1978.78-91,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3654.089,3664.98,I agree that they could have sold it but the money would have been held in trust for the congregation of the church as determined by the mother church when the mother church reviewed that action.
1978.78-91,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3727.663,3728.33,Thank you gentlemen.
