2005.05-5966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,3.641,We'll hear argument next in Clark versus Arizona.
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,4.22,7.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-5966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,61.513,67.39,"It was excluded with respect to mens rea, but, of course, all of the evidence came in with respect to the insanity defense."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,67.39,76.063,"--It came in, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, as to the insanity defense, but could only be considered if Eric knew right from wrong."
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,87.769,88.614,Is--
2005.05-5966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,88.614,89.395,Well--
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,89.395,103.82,"--the State telling us... and we'll ask the State when they argue... but is the State telling us that it has defined ""intent"" in a particular way for this, so that ""intent"" is just having the purpose to cause the result--"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,103.82,105.835,If they were--
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,105.835,108.445,"--and, therefore, that this testimony is irrelevant?"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,111.149,125.622,"--As I understand the State's argument, they are adopting what Justice Ginsburg wrote in Montana v. Egelhoff, that the State, by enacting this rule, has made this a substantive choice to make evidence of mental illness irrelevant."
2005.05-5966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,223.064,223.798,"Well, what--"
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,223.798,225.595,"Well, do you take that... please."
2005.05-5966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,225.595,240.114,"--What do you make of the very name that the State gave, not acquitted by reason... not not guilty by reason of insanity, but guilty, except insane."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,261.853,263.525,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.05-5966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,272.464,273.074,--But--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,273.074,277.746,"--we offered 16 lay witnesses and their testimony, in addition to the experts."
2005.05-5966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,292.656,293.922,--But the lay... I'm sorry.
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,295.157,295.766,--These lay witnesses--
2005.05-5966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,295.766,298.064,"--witnesses still talked about his mental state, correct?"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,298.064,298.439,--That's correct.
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,339.167,339.432,No--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,339.432,339.511,--Arizona.
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,339.511,359.281,"--what they have here... the... what the SG says... which seems right to me, and I would like you to explain why it wasn't... is that as far as the insanity defense is concerned, that everyone in Arizona agrees that you consider whether he knows right from wrong in respect to this act."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,409.651,417.293,There is a distinction between nature and quality of one's acts and knowing whether an act is right or wrong.
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,429.593,431.343,"Yes, but I'm interested in Arizona, remember."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,471.288,471.758,No--
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,471.758,472.18,--in effect?
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,476.853,485.198,"--No, Justice... the trial judge ruled that we could offer the evidence, because we were not before a jury, and the judge was the trier of fact."
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,498.248,499.139,In this case.
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,499.139,499.935,In this case--
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,499.935,500.341,"Well, fine."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,510.407,514.376,"--But that is not the State's point, or... nor the United States Government's point in this case."
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,514.376,515.033,It isn't.
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,515.033,519.174,Their point is that the former is subsumed in the latter.
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,526.785,527.786,"No, but whether it--"
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,527.786,529.708,"Well, I guess maybe the question is, What is your point?"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,553.385,556.433,"It would, if Arizona allowed consideration of that evidence."
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,557.73,558.37,But let's--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,558.37,558.995,Now--
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,558.995,559.948,"Yes, but whether it does or--"
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,559.948,563.668,--let's assume that it can consider the evidence as to... on the right and wrong prong.
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,563.668,565.762,--The right and wrong prong--
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,565.762,566.794,Does the hypothetical state--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,566.794,569.029,--In a hypothetical--
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,569.029,569.451,"--that says, ""We'll let this evidence""--"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,569.451,570.061,--In a hypothetical--
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,570.061,575.279,"""# in under the right and wrong aspect of M'Naghten, but not under the nature and quality of the act. """
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,575.279,578.03,--And your question is whether--
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,578.03,587.83,Why that isn't sufficient to answer your contention that his intent is not... has not been subject to question.
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,587.83,599.848,"--Because, first of all, it is not offered and is not considered to specifically determine whether it rebuts an inference that the State has raised on factual point key to their case."
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,606.333,607.537,What they said--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,607.537,630.229,"And even if it was... and I would... can point this out by an example that gets to what Justice Breyer was saying... if a person is squeezing a lemon... and this is a common example in law school... and it turns out to be his sister... he knows, in the abstract, that a person... killing a person is right or wrong."
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,650.515,652.329,"--Well, I'll look at M'Naghten."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,659.689,660.127,--That is correct.
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,660.987,661.58,"--Then, what do you do--"
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,661.58,679.99,"--Then what you're saying, if I understand it, is that when the Arizona statute refers to whether or not the criminal act was wrong, the criminal act that they are referring to, on your view, is the act of intentional killing, period."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,722.719,723.094,Absolutely.
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,723.094,723.891,Okay.
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,723.891,724.344,--that's not--
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,724.344,725.641,"--All right, if that's--"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,725.641,726.235,"--the end of it, as well."
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,762.414,772.417,"--But the Arizona Court, the Court of Appeals, writes that it turns on the finding of criminal responsibility at the time of the criminal offense."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,806.877,808.033,That--
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,808.033,819.709,"And if that's what they wrote, then they don't adopt the test you're attacking; rather, they do let the very evidence that you want to come in, come in, and it is totally relevant."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,819.709,824.616,"--They would, if it was not inconsistent with previous pronouncements of this very same court."
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,836.978,837.306,"Well, but--"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,837.306,837.618,--But not--
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,837.618,838.243,--if Justice Breyer--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,838.243,840.524,"--but that it was error, because they are distinct."
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,850.901,851.652,--But if Justice--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,851.652,852.183,But--
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,852.183,862.499,"--Breyer's explanation is a correct statement of Arizona law, do you still have an argument that your proof should have been accepted, on the first prong?"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,862.499,863.062,--Yes.
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,863.062,864.687,And what is that argument?
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,864.687,869.922,"The argument is that the State proved, circumstantially, his mental state."
2005.05-5966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,917.245,921.356,And your evidence to the contrary that was excluded would have showed what?
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,921.356,928.763,"That it was equally plausible that he was driving around with his music playing loud because he was drowning out the voices in his head, which were--"
2005.05-5966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,928.763,931.92,"So, it went to diminished mental capacity."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,939.155,942.734,"--And that is unconstitutional, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,942.734,943.249,You mean--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,943.249,943.609,First of all--
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,943.609,944.046,--the Constitution--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,944.046,945.03,--these are facts--
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,945.03,947.202,--requires a diminished capacity defense?
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,947.202,948.922,"--No, not the defense."
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,963.535,976.318,"Well, if you're going to let the evidence of diminished capacity in, on mens rea, you've done, by... as it were, by the front door, what you can't do by the back door... i.e., by a diminished capacity defense... because you're making the same point."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,979.726,992.025,"--Well, the burdens of proof goes to whether, if we did not... if we did not prevail... or we did prevail on the second issue, the... whether M'Naghten allows consideration of this... whether it makes a difference."
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,995.402,998.464,"Do you... do you think it is unconstitutional for a State to say,"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1035.583,1037.253,"--No, it's not."
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1037.253,1037.645,Okay.
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1037.645,1037.911,But the--
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1037.911,1043.098,"Isn't that what the State does when it denies a diminished capacity... says,"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1045.615,1048.194,"--If it is framed as a defense, yes, but if--"
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1048.194,1048.506,Okay.
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1048.6,1049.084,--it is framed--
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1049.084,1049.709,--isn't--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1049.709,1050.006,--as simply--
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1050.006,1050.319,"--No, but isn't--"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1050.319,1051.116,--they... evidence--
2005.05-5966,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1051.116,1055.335,"--With respect, isn't that also what the State is getting at when it says,"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1083.404,1090.718,--The unconstitutionality of that... of that procedure is that the State's evidence goes uncontested.
2005.05-5966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1105.44,1105.878,"Well, but it only--"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1105.878,1106.456,--a psychiatrist get up there--
2005.05-5966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1106.456,1107.69,--goes uncontested--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1107.69,1108.128,--and--
2005.05-5966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1108.128,1113.801,--it only goes uncontested if the only way you're going to contest it is to show diminished capacity.
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1132.228,1136.978,"--But their justifications for this rule, Mr. Chief Justice, are that it's not reliable."
2005.05-5966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1152.968,1159.984,"Mr. Goldberg, may I ask you to clarify one thing about your argument?"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1192.569,1194.179,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2005.05-5966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1233.265,1234.718,And what would--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1234.718,1235.063,--sought--
2005.05-5966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1235.063,1235.344,--What--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1235.344,1238.953,--to preclude any consideration of evidence that indicated the contrary.
2005.05-5966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1238.953,1242.11,"--What was the second... the definition of ""second degree""?"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1242.11,1247.283,"""Second degree murder"" is defined as intentional murder, without premeditation."
2005.05-5966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1252.864,1254.317,"Well, what--"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1254.317,1254.661,--to get back to--
2005.05-5966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1254.661,1276.367,"--May I just ask, what... if the proof you'd like to introduce is that the defendant considered the police officer to be an alien, why would he have any intent?"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1279.649,1295.247,"--Because if he knew he was killing what he believed to be a alien who had taken over a human form, then he may have known that he was killing somebody, but not that it was a police officer, because, in his mind, he believed that the police officer was an alien."
2005.05-5966,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1295.247,1297.326,But it doesn't go to premeditation.
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1303.232,1306.374,"No, Justice Scalia, but he was not charged with a premeditated murder."
2005.05-5966,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.374,1310.796,"No, but you're saying... you're saying he could have been charged with second degree murder--"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1310.796,1312.672,As intentional murder.
2005.05-5966,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1312.672,1314.72,--because... what?
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1314.72,1319.393,Because the... because the crime of second degree murder... because this is a unique--
2005.05-5966,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1319.393,1320.596,Does not require premeditation.
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1321.097,1321.503,--Right.
2005.05-5966,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1321.503,1323.019,"--don't see how this goes to premeditation, anyway."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1323.019,1324.363,Does not go to premeditation.
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1361.589,1370.513,"All right, suppose he did, he believed there... it's an alien, which is not immoral, to kill an alien, let's say, if he comes from Mars."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1412.883,1415.681,"Not if it could be considered as to going to the element, no."

2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1428.651,1429.104,--whether we made the--
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1429.104,1429.479,--Mott--
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1429.479,1433.136,"--other than whether we meet our burden of proving he is insane, by clear and convincing evidence."
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1433.136,1440.779,"Is it your argument that it... under Arizona law, it goes to excuse the conduct, but not whether the conduct, in fact, occurred?"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1440.779,1441.732,It does.
2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1441.732,1443.06,"I mean, is that your argument?"

2005.05-5966,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1443.436,1443.701,Is that your argument?
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1443.701,1444.295,--Yes.
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1483.85,1486.241,"--Well, that's a different question."
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1494.383,1494.758,Correct.
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1494.758,1495.211,--that true?

2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1509.793,1510.84,--Absolutely.
2005.05-5966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1511.419,1511.903,"And so, the State--"
2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1511.903,1512.372,--shifts from the State.

2005.05-5966,0,20878,david_i_goldberg,,1517.497,1519.982,"In a technical sense, yes."
2005.05-5966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1571.385,1572.213,"Thank you, Mr. Goldberg."
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,1577.558,1596.906,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2005.05-5966,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1643.135,1663.201,"Well, to prevail, do you think you have to show that, under prong two of M'Naghten, the right and wrong prong, that the defendant can prove really everything, and, in fact, did have the opportunity to prove everything, that he seeks to prove under prong one?"
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,1668.875,1672.078,"I... no, Your Honor."
2005.05-5966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1702.82,1709.461,"But it's clear, Counsel, though, that the first prong of M'Naghten adds something different,"
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,1721.902,1729.028,"--Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-5966,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1821.267,1847.287,"But I am correct in assuming that it is... and tell me if I'm wrong... that it is your position, the State's position, that, under the right/wrong prong two part of M'Naghten, and under the evidence in this case, the court was able to consider, really, all of the evidence that's necessary in order to meet this defendant's defense as to... as to intent."
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,1847.287,1850.43,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-5966,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1851.258,1853.337,And I agree with you.

2005.05-5966,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1865.839,1875.778,"Well, wouldn't it make a difference in a case in which an individual understands, number one, as a general matter, that it is wrong to kill people intentionally?"
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,1907.097,1912.646,"No, Your Honor, for two reasons."
2005.05-5966,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1961.813,1964.532,"Counsel, I'm puzzled about one thing."
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,1983.099,2007.776,"My point, Your Honor, is, if he is not actually killing a space alien, there is grave doubt that he would understand his conduct, and that would make rather meaningless, at some practical level, asking the question,"
2005.05-5966,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2012.605,2015.261,I'm not sure I understand the answer.
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2019.747,2020.747,Sure.
2005.05-5966,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2020.747,2023.795,Does he have to think it's wrong to kill Martians?
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2023.795,2030.625,"No, Your Honor."
2005.05-5966,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2097.718,2112.032,"The thing that troubles me, just to... and then you can comment on it... I'm assuming it's possible they thought he didn't know whether it was a Martian or not, and that he thought he had a mission in life to kill Martians, that they're enemies, they're bad to come, and he wants to kill 'em."
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2117.518,2125.067,"That would raise serious eighth amendment concerns, Your Honor, and--"
2005.05-5966,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2125.067,2128.74,"Or could he just be found guilty of murder, or whatever, on those facts?"
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2128.74,2155.995,"--If he truly believed that he was shooting an alien when he was actually shooting a human being, he would... he would certainly have, you know, a very strong case for insanity."

2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2166.701,2167.28,--insufficient.
2005.05-5966,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2167.28,2167.842,--difference in the burden of proof.
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2172.108,2173.061,Surely.
2005.05-5966,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2173.061,2186.658,And I'm just wondering if he's... just raises a doubt as... so there's not proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew the person he was killing was either a human being or an... a kind of individual that it would be wrong to kill.
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2186.658,2187.83,Well--
2005.05-5966,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2187.83,2190.128,If there's just a reasonable doubt on the issue--
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2190.128,2190.628,--Well--
2005.05-5966,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2190.628,2192.269,"--would he be guilty, or not?"
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2192.269,2212.664,"--Well, Your Honor, that raises the second issue that we're... that we're discussing today, that, you know, the State, as I've argued, has the right to define ""insanity"" as it... as it sees fit."
2005.05-5966,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2256.596,2272.145,"But, as you say, it's... in a way, it's... in a sense, it comes in through the back door, as you say, but, even coming in through the back door, if it raises a reasonable doubt as to his intent to kill a... make a wrongful killing, why shouldn't it be admissible?"
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2272.145,2297.073,"--It should... it isn't... it isn't admissible, Your... a State can preclude it, Your Honor, because the State has the definite right to define the element of mens rea, and it is... again, as it sees fit."
2005.05-5966,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2297.463,2308.122,Does that mean that it could also exclude the testimony from the lay people or the friends who talked about this person's illness?
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2308.122,2310.013,--It--
2005.05-5966,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2310.013,2311.92,Or are we just talking about the expert testimony?
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2311.92,2327.672,"--Evidence of mental disease or defect, whether it's expert testimony or lay testimony, does not come in under Mott."
2005.05-5966,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2327.672,2345.959,"Mr. Howe, would you explain to me how the State has proved intentional... not intentional killing, but of a police officer?"
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2376.45,2400.142,"What the... what the State proved in this case, Your Honor, is that, at least, you know, 2 weeks prior to the murder, he indicated a desire to do... to do something extremely similar to what he... you know, to what he actually did."
2005.05-5966,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2428.945,2429.774,I see that on the--
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2429.774,2430.086,--pulled over.
2005.05-5966,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2430.086,2439.838,"--the State side, so the State has introduced evidence from which a trier could conclude he intended to kill a police officer."
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2459.576,2460.937,Yes--
2005.05-5966,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2460.937,2461.577,--to counter--
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2461.577,2462.265,--Your Honor.
2005.05-5966,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2462.265,2466.234,"--the State's proof, as I understand what the Arizona law is."
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2466.234,2466.922,Sure.
2005.05-5966,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2552.629,2566.96,"Is this an alternative argument, so that, if we accept this argument, we need not ask whether the evidence comes in under prong two, or is this complementary to the argument that the evidence comes in under prong two?"
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2566.96,2575.212,"--I... I'm not quite sure how to answer that, Your Honor."
2005.05-5966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2598.014,2599.108,"Why is that, Counsel?"
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2624.206,2627.207,"Surely, Your Honor."
2005.05-5966,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2770.658,2775.518,"Mr. Howe, one of the things that puzzled me about your position is, you said,"
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2807.353,2811.338,"Your Honor, my time is up."
2005.05-5966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2811.916,2812.682,You can... may answer.
2005.05-5966,1,39450,randall_m_howe,,2812.682,2813.229,--Surely.
2005.05-5966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2853.754,2854.005,"Thank you, Mr. Howe."
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2856.708,2872.336,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-5966,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2915.798,2919.894,Could the State say that it's the defendant's burden to show that it was not a police officer?
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2919.894,2925.864,I don't think the State... could the State do that?
2005.05-5966,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2926.301,2926.582,Yes.
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2926.582,2928.036,I don't think the State--
2005.05-5966,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2928.036,2930.678,"Because the next question is, Why didn't they... isn't that what happened here?"
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2930.678,2930.99,--Right.
2005.05-5966,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2973.983,2984.939,"It seems to me that you introduced the... my concern by saying that they... the State can put the burden of proof on the defendant, which we know is generally true in many States with reference to the insanity defense."
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2988.471,2997.817,"Well, I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, but you're absolutely right to say that there's this tradition with insanity, which is quite different than the tradition with respect to other elements of a crime."
2005.05-5966,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3059.08,3063.425,"It does seem as if the argument, that,"
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3075.115,3077.287,"Well, it... I think, Justice Kennedy, though--"
2005.05-5966,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3077.287,3078.037,"Kind of, the second class--"
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3078.037,3078.256,--Well--
2005.05-5966,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3078.256,3078.944,--sort of evidence.
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3078.944,3080.147,--I don't think it's second class.
2005.05-5966,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3127.421,3130.234,"That would present a serious constitutional question, wouldn't it?"
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3176.027,3180.293,"--But, Justice Breyer, they wouldn't convict him for murder, because he would qualify for an insanity defense."

2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3189.732,3190.951,"--Well, I mean--"
2005.05-5966,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3190.951,3192.966,"But that's not in this case, I agree with you."
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3192.966,3192.999,--But--
2005.05-5966,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3192.999,3200.844,"But is a variation of that in this case... namely, the variation... but we've discussed that at length, and I take it you think that's not in this case."
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3200.844,3213.409,"--I don't think it's in this case, but I don't want to mislead you, which is as... I think you can hypothesize a situation where somebody would be exonerated by one form of the insanity defense, and not exonerated by a narrow form of the insanity defense."
2005.05-5966,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3224.724,3227.397,"But we don't have to reach that question here, in your view."
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3227.397,3228.381,"--Well, I think you--"
2005.05-5966,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3228.381,3228.803,Or do we?
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3228.803,3230.319,--I would think that you might.
2005.05-5966,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3236.414,3245.76,"But if we have to reach it, this... they're arguing we do, because they're saying the person is so insane he doesn't know whether this is a human being or a sack of lemons."
2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3247.729,3248.448,But then he--
2005.05-5966,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3248.448,3250.933,--he said that they didn't consider that in the insanity defense.

2005.05-5966,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3258.747,3259.528,--assume that he's right on that?

2005.05-5966,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3407.28,3408.717,--I don't think so.
