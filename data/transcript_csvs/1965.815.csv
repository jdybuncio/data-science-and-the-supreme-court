1965.815,0,18438,charles_v_bell,,162.581,166.016,"Yes, he had -- he escaped from Haywood County prison camp."
1965.815,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,166.016,171.992,And he -- where he was under a sentence and where he still had some 15 years to serve.

1965.815,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,172.524,181.989,"So there's no question about that – no question for propriety of the locking him -- locking him up, keeping him locked up for the (Voice Overlap)"

1965.815,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,182.546,185.909,Continue -- and deserve that present sentence where -- from which he'd escape.
1965.815,0,18438,charles_v_bell,,185.909,217.729,"Well what we contend in this case that the Charlotte Police Department went to Belmont and the record where arrest sheet solely indicates it and arrested him in Belmont, North Carolina which is another county and brought him back into Gaston for the crime or killing and murdering the white lady, Mrs. Foy Bell Cooper."
1965.815,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,283.92,288.422,"Well, that could happen to anybody who has escaped from prison, isn't it?"
1965.815,0,18438,charles_v_bell,,288.422,288.781,No sir.
1965.815,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,288.781,292.055,"He was under -- he was under a long prison sentence, what?"
1965.815,0,18438,charles_v_bell,,292.055,292.232,By --
1965.815,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,292.232,305.611,-- 15 to 20 years and when he was recaptured I suppose it's – would he be surprised at least which is rather the normal thing you -- he's returned to prison and maybe in solitary confinement.
1965.815,0,18438,charles_v_bell,,310.866,312.067,No sir.
1965.815,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,312.067,312.332,That's not --

1965.815,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,314.666,315.173,What's the difference?
1965.815,0,18438,charles_v_bell,,315.173,322.867,"What's the difference -- the difference is Your Honor, when a man escapes from prison he violates the law there."
1965.815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,327.574,329.422,And when he's apprehended he is returned for confinement.
1965.815,0,18438,charles_v_bell,,329.422,331.114,Then he is returned to prison.
1965.815,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,331.114,332.075,To confinement.
1965.815,0,18438,charles_v_bell,,332.075,333.178,That's right.
1965.815,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,376.318,379.083,"Well, Mr. Bell he escaped from a prison camp, was that it?"

1965.815,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,379.716,383.786,"And ordinarily on -- being recaptured where would they return him, to the prison camp?"
1965.815,0,18438,charles_v_bell,,383.786,385.287,We would return --
1965.815,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,385.287,386.49,"Yes, in the prison camp?"

1965.815,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,390.247,398.748,"And your point is instead of doing that they took him to a police station or police county jail, was that in Charlotte?"
1965.815,0,18438,charles_v_bell,,398.748,400.132,Yes – police --
1965.815,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,400.132,404.045,That's where they kept him -- you say interrogated for 16 days?
