1977.77-262,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,78.915,We will hear arguments next in Duke Power v. Carolina Environmental Study and the consolidated case.
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,83.897,87.426,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,259.055,267.209,"Mr. Griffith, did the Price-Anderson Act supersede all state law governing recoverability of damages in this area?"
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,267.209,267.441,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,280.673,288.965,"I presume under North Carolina law, if an atomic plant blew up, it would have not taken a special North Carolina statute to permit recovery for damages?"
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,288.965,290.383,"No, sir, it would not have."
1977.77-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,290.383,298.406,Did the Price-Anderson Act in effect preempt state damage remedies in the situation?
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,298.406,305.518,"Yes sir, it removed the common law remedy of unlimited liability."
1977.77-262,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,305.518,310.296,Could each state do that on its own?
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,310.296,313.297,I do not think so in this particular case.
1977.77-262,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,313.297,328.915,"I am speaking of, I should have narrowed it, not as to atomic energy, but could each state on its own simply provide that there would be no actions for injuries of the described character?"
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,328.915,331.019,"Yes, sir, I think so."
1977.77-262,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,337.97,347.07,"Once the Price-Anderson Act had been enacted, then you indicate that there is preemption in this whole field?"
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,347.07,348.814,Yes sir.
1977.77-262,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,348.814,351.45,Does the Act say so in so many words?
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,351.45,351.779,Yes sir.
1977.77-262,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,363.013,373.009,"My question was, does the Price–Anderson Act say that the extent of this limitation, it preempts all state law?"
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,374.52,377.885,I do not recall any specific words with respect to that.
1977.77-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.48,398.792,"Certainly, it would not have materially advance the purpose that you say was intended to serve, if it simply provided for a limitation of liability and diversity actions in federal district courts, but place no limitation of liability on state courts, would it?"
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,398.792,399.835,"No, sir."
1977.77-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,418.555,420.782,"Well, in doing that, does it not have to preempt the state?"
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,420.782,425.406,"Yes, sir, I think it does, absolutely."
1977.77-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1009.454,1014.667,You say it needs a carefully tuned-balancing of competing consideration?
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,1014.667,1015.04,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1015.04,1018.811,That is for the nine of us to decide?
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,1018.811,1020.982,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1045.431,1050.062,"But when it comes to the fine-tuning test, then it is our decision rather than Congress?"
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,1050.062,1058.319,"Yes, sir and we submit that the Act does meet that fine-tuning."
1977.77-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.523,1330.162,"If a quid pro quo were under the constitutional law required in order to limit liability in this way, would you say that if all Congress had done was to say “we will take a careful look at this situation” after a catastrophic accident occurs would be enough?"
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,1330.162,1335.686,"Well sir, the quid pro quo would be provided if Congress acts after the fact."
1977.77-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1335.686,1337.467,But we will never know.
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,1337.467,1341.903,That is precisely the question we raised in our jurisdictional argument.
1977.77-262,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1341.903,1343.946,"Well, that in effect goes to standing too."
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,1343.946,1345.355,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-262,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1362.811,1369.936,Can this define (Inaudible) Congress?
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,1369.936,1370.175,"No, sir."
1977.77-262,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1374.156,1380.416,"You did not really answer my brother, Rehnquist’s, question as indicated by my brother Marshall."
1977.77-262,0,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,1400.502,1408.865,"The direct answer, in my opinion, is no."
1977.77-262,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1436.996,1440.737,We will not ask to fractionate the time.
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,2722.254,2726.846,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-262,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2758.539,2762.326,"Mr. Schultz, are you going to address the standing questions sometime during your argument?"
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,2762.326,2764.85,"Yes, I was and I will address it right now if you would like."
1977.77-262,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2764.85,2771.607,"No, you have 45 minutes to spend as you chose."
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,2771.607,2777.592,"With your permission, I will discuss the statute and then address standing before I reach the merits."
1977.77-262,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2928.972,2952.681,"What is your view on the question that the Solicitor General addressed if the government had maintained its own monopoly and had not licensed these plants, but had its self built all of these plans, could have it excluded all liability as a modification of the Federal Tort Claims Act?"
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,2952.681,2958.431,"In that situation, in the event of an accident, there would be a taking."
1977.77-262,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2969.122,2981.595,What about the great disasters that occurred before the Federal Tort Claims Act when sovereign immunity was absolute?
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,2981.595,2985.106,"Your Honor, it is true that even under the taking clause --"
1977.77-262,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2985.106,2998.746,Was anyone allowed to make a case on the taking concept before the Federal Tort Claims Act or injury of the kind we are talking about?
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,2998.746,3001.884,I do not know that anyone did make that case.
1977.77-262,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3006.944,3021.228,"The Texas City disaster case where the government was claimed to be liable for millions and millions of dollars in damage, the majority of the court held that it was within the discretionary exception, the government was not liable for anything, did it not?"
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,3021.228,3032.734,"Yes, under the Federal Torts Claims Act, but the decision was not on the taking issue."
1977.77-262,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3032.734,3034.927,Were you finished with your answer to Justice Rehnquist?
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,3034.927,3036.152,Yes sir.
1977.77-262,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3036.152,3057.018,"When the suits were brought against the United States for negligence arising out of the Kansas City flood disasters for something like $1 billion back in the late 40s or early 50s, no recovery was allowed?"
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,3057.018,3060.747,"Mr. Chief Justice, I am not familiar with the facts of that case."
1977.77-262,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3060.747,3073.821,The claim was that the Weather Bureau was negligent in predicting the rainfall and the engineers were negligent in not predicting the flood level?
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,3073.821,3098.093,"The argument for a taking here would be much stronger than it would in that case because here it is not simply a matter of government negligence, it is a matter of government promotion, regulation and licensing of nuclear power and the most important difference is the limitation of liability in the Price-Anderson Act."
1977.77-262,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3098.093,3116.675,"On your theory of taking, when the Kansas City floods came, it took hundreds of thousands of acres of land that were under cultivation and destroyed all the crops and destroyed all kinds of plants and homes."
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,3135.69,3175.344,"On our taking argument, assuming that the government were building and operating nuclear power plants or looking at this case, we are not arguing that simply because the government is a factor in damage that it is a taking every time, but in a situation where the government passes the limitation on liability in the Price-Anderson Act which was a precondition to nuclear power, then there the government involvement is much more substantial and Mr. Chief Justice, I would submit it is not dissimilar from two cases which we cite in our brief."
1977.77-262,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3322.902,3325.285,It had more than Duke Power had?
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,3325.285,3326.829,Yes.
1977.77-262,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3329.37,3334.697,"If you just had nobody else, it would be just Duke Power?"
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,3334.697,3343.144,"Mr. Justice Marshall, if we did not have the limitation on liability, we would not have nuclear power."
1977.77-262,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3375.684,3380.046,They could sue us too on the merits.
1977.77-262,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3380.046,3383.385,"Mr. Schultz, let me ask you a question about your basic theory."
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,3408.014,3413.294,It would be a more difficult case.
1977.77-262,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3417.736,3419.819,You just told us it was.
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,3419.819,3426.745,"It is necessary for nuclear power, but it is not the only alternative for promoting nuclear power."
1977.77-262,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3426.745,3428.884,What other alternative is there?
1977.77-262,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3428.884,3429.825,Excuse me.
1977.77-262,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3429.825,3431.286,I am sorry.
1977.77-262,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3431.286,3434.801,"I think your answer is inconsistent to Justice Steven’s question, is it not?"
1977.77-262,2,46316,william_b_schultz,,3443.375,3447.479,"If I said it that way, I was not as precise as I might have been."
1977.77-262,3,41385,steve_c_griffith_jr,,5485.639,5502.833,"It simply boils down as the plaintiffs suggest in their argument that there were alternatives available to Congress, which Congress considered such as writing a blank check on the treasury of the United States, but Congress decided that that was not in the public interest."
1977.77-262,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5570.122,5571.008,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
