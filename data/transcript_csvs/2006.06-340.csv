2006.06-340,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,13.665,"We'll hear argument first today in 06-340, National Association of Home Builders versus Defenders of Wildlife, and 06-549, Environmental Protection Agency versus Defenders of Wildlife."
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,15.041,17.79,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,81.325,95.959,"Do we take the case and... I'll ask the same question to your colleagues from the other side... on the assumption that if the nine... the factors in the statutes are met, that EPA has no discretion to withhold the transfer?"
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,95.959,96.583,Yes.
2006.06-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,125.588,129.32,How long has that been the government's... the EPA position?
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,133.835,142.879,"Well, until 1993 when the vast majority... by the time... by that time the vast majority of transfers or approvals had already taken place."
2006.06-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,208.772,210.789,Has that always been the EPA's position?
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,219.329,224.079,"Well, I'm... there may be two different things that, referring to it."
2006.06-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,251.426,252.771,--But your position was they didn't have to?
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,252.771,270.249,"--Our position now is that it did not have to, but... and more fundamentally our position is that because the transfer or the approval of the State application is mandatory if these nine legal authority criteria are satisfied, EPA could not withhold approval of--"
2006.06-340,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,270.249,272.433,So your position is the consultation is a waste of time?
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,272.433,274.651,"--Basically, yes."
2006.06-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,284.868,302.187,"Isn't there a difference between denying the application because the Endangered Species Act hasn't been attended to adequately, and saying you meet the nine criteria, you're going to get your application."
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,342.905,359.54,"--The memorandum, the memorandum of agreement, is called for under EPA's regulations as really a procedural mechanism for the EPA and the State agency to work out the practicalities of the State's administering the program."
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,384.481,386.587,"No, but the point is why can't it be?"
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,386.587,398.909,"Because we think that would been consistent with Section 402(b), which requires, which requires the EPA to approve the transfer."
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,414.34,419.712,Doesn't the ESA require something more than voluntary cooperation?
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,434.11,444.935,--It's unconditional with respect in our view to actions that are within the agency's discretion or consequences that the agency will cause.
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,455.089,457.819,I realize that that's your point.
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,520.855,525.713,"--Well, as to the latter, we don't believe that EPA can condition the transfer."
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,528.681,532.07,I know you say you don't think they can do it.
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,559.842,581.925,"--First of all, with respect to the Endangered Species Act, the memorandum of agreement that was entered into in 2001 between EPA and the two Federal wildlife services does furnish a way in which after the transfer EPA can take into account endangered species considerations within the scope of its--"
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,581.925,587.251,At which point EPA doesn't have any authority left under the Clean Water Act.
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,587.251,588.986,"--No, that's not correct."
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,605.65,610.287,That begs the question because the concern is the enforcement of the Endangered Species Act.
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,610.287,629.608,"--With respect to water quality issues that might affect an endangered species, EPA takes the position... and I think it's correct... that EPA can object to a State permit where that permit would not comply with State water quality standards that are necessary to protect the endangered species."
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,629.608,632.623,Why don't they get that in the memorandum of agreement up front?
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,632.623,638.869,EPA doesn't need the State's agreement to object to a State permit.
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,639.665,655.034,"Maybe it doesn't, but isn't it the case that if it's in the agreement up front the odds are better that the State will address it, as opposed to the State ignoring the problem, requiring EPA then to take affirmative action to object?"
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,655.034,661.519,--And I wanted to get to the further mechanisms that are in place under EPA regulations and the memorandum of agreement.
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,661.519,663.219,"No, but would you answer my question first?"
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,732.942,735.457,Those regulations do not because they are procedural.
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,779.393,789.839,"You are in effect saying that the, that the, that the enforcement of water quality standards is, in effect, the indirect answer to the problem that the other side raises?"
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,790.962,791.664,It is.
2006.06-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,792.885,808.097,"Except to the extent that a project may be endangering a species, not by reason of change in water quality but, for example, by destroying habitat, constructing a dam or that sort of thing."
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,808.097,811.906,"--Upland habitat, if it's water habitat, water quality standards."
2006.06-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,843.301,858.763,"Are you referring to, in what you just described about the cooperation among the Federal agencies, to what has been called in their brief, it's referred to as a coordination agreement?"
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,858.763,864.339,"Yes, the 2001, February 22, 2001, agreement between EPA and--"
2006.06-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,864.339,869.994,"And that agreement, I take it from what you just said, is in full force?"
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,877.863,878.955,--That is correct.
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,930.932,936.774,Which is the... the later act is the Endangered Species Act?
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,936.774,942.473,"Essentially, the Endangered Species... there was a subsequent amendment to 402(b), but for these purposes... but--"
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,942.473,944.365,Why doesn't that control?
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,944.365,950.3,--Because it is... we do not think it repeals... it's essentially a repeal by implication question.
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,950.3,959.391,"No, but you can just as well say that if it does not control then there is an exception by implication, the exception being based on the prior act."
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,964.951,978.245,"Beyond that, Section 7 of the ESA is a generally applicable statute, whereas Section 402(b) speaks specifically and comprehensively to the question of Federal approval of State programs."
2006.06-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1000.374,1012.821,"Well, but by that very reasoning you could say that if assurance are required that the Endangered Species Act is going to be honored, that does not in and of itself prevent any development program."
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1018.023,1038.796,"--Well, if I could go back to the point I was making earlier, that we think that the central thrust of the court of appeals' opinion and Respondent's position here is that EPA could not transfer the authority unless it and the State together replicated the sort of protections that were in place when EPA itself administered the Endangered Species Act."
2006.06-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1077.529,1088.76,"I understand very well your argument that if the EPA is going to transfer this, they transfer it to Arizona and the first thing they say is, we look at Arizona's laws and they protect everything."
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1153.156,1158.277,"Well, I think it would require a statute by statute evaluation."
2006.06-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1158.277,1158.857,"All right, fine."
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1158.857,1162.23,But we think this one is particularly clear.
2006.06-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1162.23,1167.336,"Now, my problem with saying it's clear is that they have nine criteria."
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1210.788,1214.13,"Several, several responses to that."
2006.06-340,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1260.144,1268.981,Of the states to whom a transfer has been made how many have agreed to comply with this provision of the Endangered Species Act?
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1268.981,1270.451,I'm not sure.
2006.06-340,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1271.449,1280.976,"In the memorandum of agreement with the states to whom transfers have been made, in some of them, is there not language in which the State has agreed that we'll consult with Fish and Wildlife--"
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1280.976,1293.204,"--There was, there was in the Louisiana memorandum of agreement that was involved in the Fifth Circuit's American Forestry decision, and it was that provision that the Fifth Circuit held was unlawful on two grounds."
2006.06-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1312.039,1339.511,"--You mentioned a whole string of states, I think, Texas, Florida, Maine were mentioned as states that... in connection with the transfer of the permitting authority had conditions that made the Endangered Species Act applicable."
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1339.511,1342.342,"That's not correct, Justice... Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1360.365,1363.131,"So what was done in Texas, Florida and Maine?"
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1363.131,1381.762,"They all provided what I've described to Justice Souter, that... that the pre-existing ESA, EPA regulations require that draft permits be furnished to the, to Fish and Wildlife and to NOAA, and that they take into account the comments by Fish and Wildlife and NOAA."
2006.06-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1390.338,1391.913,"So that, would that apply in this case?"
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1394.054,1394.491,--Yes.
2006.06-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1411.235,1413.158,"Mr. Kneedler, may I ask a question about the memorandum of agreement?"
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1422.824,1423.869,"--No, it is... no it is not."
2006.06-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1424.602,1428.572,"Is there not a regulation that issues, that requires the states--"
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1428.572,1428.978,--Yes.
2006.06-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1429.493,1431.336,--What's the statutory authority for the regulation?
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1431.336,1445.219,"--33 U.S.C. 1314(i) allows... provides... excuse me... for EPA to establish guidelines, basic guidelines, minimum standards for State programs and... part of that--"
2006.06-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1445.219,1448.593,What if... what if the State just refused to enter into a memorandum of agreement?
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1453.233,1463.009,"--If, if the, if its refusal was based on an objection to things that are within the, within the legitimate scope of a memorandum of agreement."
2006.06-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.12,1467.368,"Just says don't want... it just says we don't want to enter into a memorandum of agreement, period."
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1467.368,1467.79,--Yeah.
2006.06-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1480.845,1483.485,--that require the making of a memorandum of agreement.
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1483.485,1483.906,Yes.
2006.06-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.842,1492.637,But how can that be consistent with your shall argument?
2006.06-340,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1492.637,1505.291,"--Because there's a separate authority for the, for the, for EPA to issue guidelines for minimum, minimum standards for State programs, but those have to do with... with communications with EPA and sort of running a program."
2006.06-340,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1542.929,1543.916,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1553.583,1557.907,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1591.474,1592.41,Where is this?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1592.893,1594.017,--This is page 260.
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1594.017,1594.641,--Of--
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1594.641,1600.967,"Of the NAHB appendix, which is... there are two volumes of that appendix, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1613.882,1615.71,--270 you say?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1615.71,1617.504,"--260, I'm sorry."
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.504,1618.209,260.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1618.209,1619.395,"260, around."
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.395,1620.159,I got it.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1620.159,1624.269,And it's the first full paragraph and it says:
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.836,1699.752,"Can that be read just to apply to any, any State permits that... that violate Clean Water requirements?"
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1707.844,1709.95,There's certainly there's nothing in the memorandum of agreement that says that.
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.541,1757.617,"Well, how do you feel--"
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1757.617,1758.132,That's not quite right.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1762.504,1766.145,"Your Honor, and I think that's where we seem to have a little bit of a disconnect."
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1786.247,1797.868,"No, what he's suggesting is there isn't going to be any impact on any endangered species until a particular permit is issued by the State agency, and that those permits are submitted to the Fish and Wildlife Service for their review."
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1797.868,1798.663,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1873.866,1874.946,What does that have to do with the... I'm sorry.
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.946,1877.601,--I thought that those are in place.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1883.158,1884.207,"--Your Honor, and again--"
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1884.207,1895.891,"But that has nothing to do, as the Chief was about to say before I interrupted him, that has nothing to do with, with whether they have to issue the NPDES authorization."
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1895.891,1905.978,"--And I guess the point I'm trying to make, Your Honor, is that the Court's fundamental obligation when it has two statutes that have shall provisions, is to see if there's a way they can be reconciled and worked out."
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1932.25,1937.046,Could I get back to the memorandum of agreement that you've called our attention to on page 260?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1950.148,1950.71,Right.
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.71,1956.91,"The same kind of consultation with Fish and Wildlife that, that Mr. Kneedler described to us."
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1956.91,1958.345,"I think, Your Honor, and I think that's critical."
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.788,1988.207,But this is talking about consultation when the permit is... the permit application is issued.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,1993.893,1996.003,"With all deference, Your Honor, it says:"
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2027.725,2037.767,"But the point... the point is that it's the issuance of a permit under the program, whether administered by the Federal Government or the State government that has the potential for jeopardizing endangered species."
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2061.413,2069.659,"That's true, Your Honor, but again I think what the Court may be doing is assuming that this consultation process is somewhat more draconian than it frequently turns out to be."
2006.06-340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2087.293,2092.699,Are you... are you saying that the consultation does beyond the nine factors that are listed in the statute?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2092.699,2095.025,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2104.553,2106.85,But isn't that beyond the nine factors?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2106.85,2115.562,"--I don't think... I think what it is is an effort, as there's been discussion here, to reconcile two obligations, both of which Congress felt were important."
2006.06-340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2117.874,2118.829,I... I understand that.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2133.651,2146.114,"Well, and Your Honor, just on that point, I found the Government's reply brief a little bit odd, because I think consistent with the questioning from Justice Breyer, it acknowledges for the first time that these factors do encompass some consideration of wildlife impacts."
2006.06-340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2172.931,2181.786,But what is your position as to the propriety of the EPA's saying what I've said in my hypothetical instance?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2187.082,2202.247,"I think that my argument is that the Endangered Species Act on its face says that it prohibits jeopardy or the result of habitat destruction, critical habitat destruction, for any agency action that is authorized, funded or carried out."
2006.06-340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2207.274,2209.727,"Well, I think you are at issue with the government on that point."
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2209.727,2210.709,"--We are, Your Honor."
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2247.181,2248.491,So what is... is there any limitation?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2267.798,2273.733,"I think the line, Your Honor, is whether you've got another crosscutting obligation--"
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2273.733,2275.465,"Yeah, like the OSHA act."
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2281.996,2295.161,"--Again, Your Honor, I think the first problem is, with that question is that, I don't mean to be evasive, but I think the problem is you're assuming the outcome of the analysis, which is that they'll have to impose some new condition on the State."
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2306.045,2307.421,But sometimes states say no.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2312.963,2313.326,--Yeah.
2006.06-340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2324.755,2332.519,"That isn't the... what I'm trying to figure out with Justice Kennedy's questions and your answers is, is there really an issue here?"
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2378.092,2379.64,"--The answer is no, Your Honor."
2006.06-340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2379.64,2396.631,"And then I would have thought the same reasoning is true here, but what the Act tells you to do is read your existing authority, but read it in light of informed by the endangered species objectives language, et cetera."
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2419.919,2421.981,"Well, I think you can."
2006.06-340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2421.981,2422.668,All right.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2471.131,2476.411,"I think that's a good summary of what has happened with these consultations, and on the cactus--"
2006.06-340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2476.411,2481.675,So what's your view of an opinion that roughly wrote what I just said?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2481.675,2490.968,"--Well, I think the concern I would have is that I think it goes beyond what's necessary here because we're not dealing, everybody agrees, with some purely ministerial situation like that one."
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.447,2544.835,I don't know what you're talking about.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2545.99,2552.273,Funding of the NPDES program carried out by Arizona that had to be approved in order to allow--
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2552.273,2553.708,How does the government fund it?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2553.708,2564.937,"--They have to... there's a... Section 106 of the Clean Water Act provides the EPA with an opportunity, and it's certainly not mandatory, to provide funding to a State."
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.508,2591.771,"Well, you... you have other... let's assume that I disagree with you on whether they could withhold approval of the NPDES transfer."
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2633.644,2639.407,"Well, we suggest, Your Honor... and I think this goes back to Justice Stevens's question about the change in position."
2006.06-340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2662.32,2664.508,May I ask this question about changing position?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2670.287,2671.41,--We have--
2006.06-340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2671.41,2672.954,You shift back and forth on that point.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2672.954,2674.268,"--Your Honor, let me be clear about that."
2006.06-340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2677.36,2678.686,What is your view now?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2679.658,2686.357,"--I think that there are actually arguments that, especially with regard to the wildlife related parts of the criteria, that are not satisfied."
2006.06-340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2691.028,2701.6,"Before you say why you didn't argue it, it's exactly that point I sort of expected you might agree when I though maybe you have hooks to hang the NSA, the Endangered Species Act on."
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2730.557,2734.882,"If I can give Your Honor some citations to the record, I think it will help answer that."
2006.06-340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2756.345,2757.469,And how would that happen?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2780.226,2804.651,"--Your Honor, the concern that they had was that the mechanism that had been used to protect these wildlife species, and particularly plant species, which I want to get to in a moment, because I think actually the concern is even greater with plants, was that the consultation on federally issued permits had in effect been used, and this was not conjectural, they had been used to safeguard considerable habitat for these species."
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2809.308,2812.462,"I mean, that's not enough."
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2825.924,2828.377,"--Your Honor, it is not a question of trusting them."
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.941,2831.594,"Well then, you have to establish jeopardy."
2006.06-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2848.775,2852.476,"Just as a technical matter, don't they have to show there's no jeopardy?"
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2852.476,2853.462,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2862.693,2863.317,Yes.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2863.317,2866.299,We're not saying we don't trust the State.
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2946.857,2954.31,Jeopardy from the issuance of a prospective future issuance of a permit by Arizona if they get the delegated authority.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2962.412,2971.268,"With regard to the plant, Your Honor, EPA's position to date has been that they do not have the authority to protect that plant species under their Clean Water Act authorities."
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2974.8,2975.877,The position that EPA has taken.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2975.877,2976.61,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2976.61,2978.064,Under their authority.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2978.064,2981.407,"Under their Clean Water Act authority, which is what informs their oversight activities."
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2981.407,2985.903,So how does it matter whether they have it or if it's transferred to Arizona?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,2985.903,3010.317,"Because again, what the consultation process is designed to accomplish, either through the funding, discretionary decision that was made, other mechanisms that can come into play, the idea behind the consultation on the transfer... and I think this is critical to our position... is to say if we're not going to be able to protect the species through the State issuance of the permits and the other authorities we have, what understanding can we come to, consistent with our--"
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3010.317,3011.628,I don't understand--
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3011.628,3012.782,--other obligations to protect the plant species.
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.782,3013.737,--I don't understand that answer.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3029.339,3031.167,"Your Honor, what the--"
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3031.167,3040.585,"I mean, if you assume that EPA can't protect these plant species under its legislation, what harm is there in transferring the authority to somebody else who can't protect it?"
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3040.585,3044.067,"--Well, I should just first say that we disagree with the premise of that question."
2006.06-340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3076.055,3084.989,"If the EPA can protect the plants when the permit is under its own jurisdiction, why can't it use that same basis for objecting when it's under the State's jurisdiction?"
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3084.989,3086.361,"--Your Honor, that's an awfully good question."
2006.06-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3101.683,3105.606,What's the difference between Arizona's situation and all the other States that can issue permits?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3107.805,3109.462,--I believe that--
2006.06-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3109.462,3110.429,And where is--
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3110.429,3112.68,"--It's not the State's obligation to consult, Your Honor."
2006.06-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3120.097,3124.596,--You say it imposes an obligation on EPA to require the States to consult.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3124.596,3125.953,"We don't disagree with that either, Your Honor."
2006.06-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3141.071,3147.35,I still don't understand the difference between what you think is going to happen in Arizona and what is happening in all the other States that issue permits.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3147.35,3159.755,"--Your Honor, we're not saying that... particularly with regard to Texas, Florida, Oklahoma, Louisiana and other States that have gone through the consultation process, we're not saying that anything different should happen."
2006.06-340,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3165.097,3175.247,"No, in the issuance of a permit in any of these States, pick any State you like, what is the difference between what you envision would happen in Arizona, if Arizona can issue permits, and what's happening in these other States?"
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3175.247,3191.005,"Again, with regard to consultation with Arizona, all we're asking for and all we've ever asked for in this case, and this was what the service biologist said, was use the consultation process to agree on measures that can be put in place post-transfer that will prevent the species from going extinct."
2006.06-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3192.257,3194.019,May I ask you to follow up on that?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3222.836,3228.444,"--Well, the narrowest thing we need is simply a decision that the government changed its position and the case should be remanded."
2006.06-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3228.444,3229.96,"No, tell me substantively, what do you want?"
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3233.349,3243.485,"Your Honor, what we would like is a ruling that says that 7(a)(2) imposes obligations on Federal agencies just like the Clean Water Act does, that the agency should make a good faith... and this is the words of Congress..."
2006.06-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3250.2,3253.733,And how will they put those mechanisms in legal form?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3253.733,3262.287,"They would put those mechanisms in legal form either through memorandum of agreement, which is what's been used in the past, separate agreements between EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service--"
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3262.287,3268.944,"By coercing, by coercing the States to sign those agreements on pain of not getting NPDES authority?"
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3268.944,3270.129,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3270.831,3272.037,What do they do then?
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3278.299,3283.08,"--Your Honor, I think part of this, these agreements, wouldn't have to be signed by the State at all."
2006.06-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3283.08,3286.282,Justice Scalia's got a fair point.
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3306.036,3307.74,At the end of the day I think it is.
2006.06-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3310.661,3313.145,"It's your position, not the Federal Government's position."
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3316.846,3338.15,"--What I was trying to suggest was... I think if in the end of the day you look at all of these opportunities to protect species and you say there's nothing we can do about it and the State refuses to cooperate, you have what's called jeopardy or destruction of critical habitat, and Congress said that the mechanism for working out the conflict with another law is the endangered species committee, which we have not talked about very much."
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3363.734,3364.748,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.06-340,1,22325,eric_r_glitzenstein,,3364.748,3365.2,Thank you.
2006.06-340,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3365.2,3367.228,"Mr. Kneedler, you have four minutes remaining."
2006.06-340,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3367.228,3368.839,Mr. Chief Justice:
2006.06-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3439.072,3460.333,"Mr. Kneedler, I hate to eat up any of your rebuttal time, but would you state briefly what... how you would treat these other matters that were resolved by the agency and that were not mandatory, its decision to transfer prior certificate authority to the States, for example, and the other instance raised by opposing counsel?"
2006.06-340,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3472.467,3477.389,"There has been no challenge to that, so I'm not in a position to give a definitive answer."
2006.06-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3482.509,3483.511,Should we remand?
2006.06-340,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3483.511,3485.524,"No, because there was no challenge to that."
2006.06-340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3521.46,3527.427,"And it's in your discretion... your distinction to the snail darter case is that the decision to built the dam is discretionary, not mandatory?"
2006.06-340,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3527.427,3546.698,"Yes, and in fact this Court's decision in Hill can't be understood in any other day because the Court went out of its way to say that, while Congress committee reports indicated, for the appropriations bills, indicated an expectation that the dam would be built, the Court emphasized the fact that there was no mandate in the appropriations statute itself."
2006.06-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3547.665,3550.211,Do you mean the executive can ignore earmarks?
2006.06-340,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3550.211,3551.791,--Yes.
2006.06-340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3556.1,3558.148,What's a mandatory decision?
2006.06-340,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3573.079,3577.704,"But there are few statutes like this, that say the agency shall unless certain things happen."
2006.06-340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3577.704,3581.029,"You mean is it the word ""unless"", because here we have nine and they're broad."
2006.06-340,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3589.714,3602.224,"There may be particular applications of the standard, but that did not deter this Court in Public Citizen, where the Court applied the same principle and said where the agency has a mandatory duty and no discretion it is not the legal cause."
2006.06-340,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3649.591,3650.621,"Thank you, counsel."
