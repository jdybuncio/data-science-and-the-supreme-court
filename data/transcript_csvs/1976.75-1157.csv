1976.75-1157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.627,"We’ll hear arguments next in Number 75-1157, Town of Lockport against the Citizens Community Action."
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,51.359,54.496,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,236.752,237.427,Mr. Fuzak?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,237.427,237.717,Yes sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.717,243.494,"In New York State, are town simply geographical areas or are they small cities?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,243.494,249.553,"Well, they’re not small cities, they have different functions and they have different powers, but they do have internal government structures."
1976.75-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.226,262.123,But the whole State isn’t divided into towns in the way some New England States have.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,262.123,264.002,"Yes, I think it’s -- in point of fact, it is."
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,279.804,286.46,"Well, as you state -- does the county here was what was involved is a new county charter?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,286.46,287.364,"Yes sir, Mr. Justice White."
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,287.364,292.969,"Now, would the provisions of the county charter be equally applicable throughout the county?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,292.969,294.254,"Yes sir, that's right."
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,294.254,296.483,"Or, with respect to everybody."
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,296.483,297.42,"Yes sir, that's right."
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,297.42,298.82,Inside towns and outside?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,298.82,301.815,"Inside towns, inside cities, everyone residing within that county is to be covered --"
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,301.815,304.322,Are they subject to everything that there is -- that’s in the charter.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,304.322,305.678,"Precisely right, yes sir."
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,305.678,308.634,"How many towns are there, Mr. Fuzak, in this county?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,308.634,309.313,12.
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,309.313,310.326,And how many cities?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,310.326,311.192,There are three.
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,311.192,317.626,"And I gather, it is the aggregate, in other words, it must be a majority of the aggregate city vote and the majority of the aggregate county vote?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,317.626,318.829,Each taken as separate units.
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,318.829,319.278,Yes.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,319.278,319.517,That’s correct sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,319.517,323.544,"And there was a majority of the aggregate city, but not of the aggregate county?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,323.544,324.873,"Correct, and it was a majority --"
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,324.873,335.062,"Even though there maybe of the 12 towns, maybe nine of them, majority there may have voted in favor if the total was not a majority in favor then it was not?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,335.062,335.556,That’s correct sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,359.411,365.314,"And the county is either city or town, there’s nothing, no part of county that's neither city nor town, is that correct?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,365.314,369.959,"The County -- that’s correct sir, and then included on the towns, there are will be villages and there are villages."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,369.959,371.911,The town is what we call our township.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,371.911,374.681,"Yes sir, that is correct sir."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,456.539,457.947,This was in our Three-Judge Court?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,457.947,463.043,"Now, there Three-Judge Court was empaneled in this instance, yes sir and cross motions for summary judgment were made."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,463.043,474.343,Was there any reference in the course of empaneling a Three-Judge Court to the previous action in which a single judge had not even found it substantial enough to ask for the convention of a Three-Judge Court?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,474.343,483.199,"Yes sir, the County of Niagara and the State of New York both asserted as affirmative defenses in their answers, the defense of res judicata based on that ground."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,491.262,493.137,"Of course that would be part of the res judicata, isn’t it?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,493.137,493.505,Yes sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,493.505,498.306,The single judge had found it so and substantial is not even to warrant a request for the convention of a Three-Judge Court?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,498.306,501.519,Right sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,509.12,510.075,Affidavits?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,510.075,511.732,"Some affidavits, Your Honor."
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,563.024,566.095,"And the form of that government, did that differ from the 1972?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,566.095,569.202,"It differed in certain respects Your Honor, but not materially."
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,575.868,579.483,"But basically, it would’ve been an executive legislative part."
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,579.483,581.056,That is correct.
1976.75-1157,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,599.4,603.263,"Are the differences relevant to this decision, to this case at all?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,603.263,606.57,"No, I don’t think they -- I do -- I don’t think we can say that they are Your Honor."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,619.573,620.363,In the two charters?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,620.363,623.18,That’s right sir; that's right sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,625.112,634.475,"And then the two votes, regardless of the percentages of the non-precise numbers, the same, factually the two votes are identical?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,634.475,640.391,"The same result, exactly right, so the voters of the town did not give it majority of approval, the voters of the cities did."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,640.391,641.565,And there was an overall majority in this case.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,641.565,643.459,There was an overall majority.
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,804.257,805.767,Need to amend was denied?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,805.767,806.389,That’s right sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,806.389,806.895,Yes.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,806.895,815.551,The Court found in effect that it was empowered to make its previous judgment which related to the 1972 Charter applied to the 1974 Charter.
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,815.551,816.431,And did it.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,816.431,817.451,"It did do so, sir."
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,817.451,818.839,"Entered a new judgment, did it?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,818.839,823.464,It entered a new judgment in October -- in December of 1975.
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,823.464,826.623,So there is no mootness problem in this case?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,826.623,830.301,"Well, we claim there is a mootness problem and we raise that on this appeal, I would --"
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.301,834.039,Even with respect -- even after the remand and after the changes in judgment?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,834.039,846.054,"Yes sir, because we -- our position on that is that prior to that happening the actions of these parties, litigants in fact destroyed the subject matter of the initial lawsuit which was a 1972 Charter."
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.885,858.649,"But the Court has now -- so, you must say the Court was in error in having its judgment apply to 1974."
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,858.649,859.141,Yes sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,859.141,861.822,"As long as you accept that, it’s not moot?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,861.822,862.973,No.
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,863.745,871.848,"But the most -- you claim that the Court did follow procedures that were unusual, if not irregular?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,871.848,872.495,"Yes sir, I do."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,872.495,879.692,But they did -- we do have a decision before us affecting the 1974 Charter?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,879.692,880.506,Exactly right sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,880.506,882.117,Which is the existing charter?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,882.117,882.726,That’s right.
1976.75-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,882.726,892.374,"Well, isn’t your complaint with respect to that really that the New York officials without any Federal Court order had already put into effect the 1974 Charter?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,892.374,892.698,Yes sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,892.698,900.845,"And therefore, there was no need to litigate with respect to that since the plaintiffs had already obtained what they wanted, putting that charter into effect?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,900.845,901.129,Yes sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,914.666,918.16,"Well, I suppose you would have some relief if we reverse the District Court?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,918.16,919.788,"Yes sir, we certainly would."
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,919.788,927.562,"Well, let's see, you’re saying there’s simply no predicate for the order relating to the 1974 Charter?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,927.562,927.843,Yes sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,928.864,934.177,There is nothing and therefore it’s an utterly proper order?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,934.177,935.56,Correct sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,954.169,955.719,On the reasoning of its original judgment?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,955.719,957.226,"Correct sir, exactly on the same reason."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,957.226,960.052,"And, you’ve already conceded the two charters for these --"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,960.052,960.863,Essentially --
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,960.863,962.429,-- purposes of this case are identical?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,962.429,965.031,"Quite Right, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.977,1048.002,But do you think you could provide that in a referendum on an Amendment of a county charter that the people in the town get two votes and the people outside the town get one vote?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1048.002,1062.788,"I think that there are -- in all, as in all of these cases, there are points that you reach where the situation is so apparently irrational that it calls for and would require and would merit some judicial intervention."
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1069.646,1100.276,"And, you would say that suppose there is -- suppose the county charter provided for the maximum milady (ph), just suppose that and there was a proposal that was subject to referendum that the milady would be raised, and you would say this provision in New York the way it is would be proper, namely that the people in the cities would have -- people in the towns would have to have a majority in order to approve the --"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1100.276,1100.864,Yes sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.864,1103.712,Even though the provision applies to everybody equally?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1103.712,1124.792,"Yes sir, I would for this reason because unlike the other cases where this Court has applied the one vote -- “one person, one vote” doctrine, this case deals strictly and solely and purely with the question of the establishment or change of the structure or form of internal state government."
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.076,1139.138,"Oh! Yes, but just a while ago, you answered me and said that would even apply to milady change, that isn’t a structure?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1139.138,1139.634,No.
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1144.465,1145.03,Yes.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1145.03,1147.267,"I am sorry, I misunderstood you, I didn’t hear you properly."
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1151.015,1156.373,You would think that everybody would have to have an equal chance at defeating that law?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1156.373,1160.29,"No, that would not be an appropriate part of the charter."
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.284,1176.773,"And some charters have set maximum miladies, I hate to tell him, but they do?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1176.773,1181.639,"Well, those -- that is not in this case, that is not an issue in this case, and the only the -- what is the problem here --"
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1181.639,1183.729,All you’re talking about is the structure then?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1183.729,1184.668,Exactly right.
1976.75-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1204.199,1210.132,"So, the kinds of things that the New York law permits to be done, are those that the Court has done in Hunter against Pittsburgh?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1210.132,1211.707,"Yes sir, that’s right."
1976.75-1157,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1249.705,1253.196,Do you feel that Gordon against Lance gives you any support?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1253.196,1278.568,"Yes sir, I very definitely do because I think the Court there found that it was within the political process, political judgment, in effect, of the state to make a determination that instead of having a simple majority to approve additional municipal bond of indebtedness, there should be a requirement of a 60% majority, and the Court said that was perfectly alright, because in certain circumstances and situations, the “one person, one vote” rule does not apply."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1314.489,1327.043,"Originally, that doctrine originally arose of course in terms of what’s called Representative Democracy in the legislative area, and then it was expanded to include one?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1327.043,1333.248,It was expanded to some extent to include elections involving the incurring of public debt largely.
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1333.248,1334.707,Kolodziesjski against Phoenix.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1334.707,1341.978,"Phoenix City or Phoenix versus Kolodziejski, City of Cipriano, Cipriano versus City of Houma, and that line of cases."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1341.978,1345.131,"Well, and then also in the School District?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1345.131,1349.272,Like Kramer against the Union Preschool District where there was an election of a representatives --
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1349.272,1350.708,In the State of New York.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1350.708,1369.177,"State of New York, but where there was an election of a representative board, and again I think the overtones there were that the Board that was being elected was fulfilling the functions of representatives of the people and that, I think that clearly fell was in the Avery line of cases, Reynolds versus Sims, Baker, Carr and so on."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1369.177,1371.022,"And, of course, Avery involved the town --"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1371.022,1371.48,Yes sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1371.48,1372.307,-- or county.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1372.307,1372.739,County.
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1372.739,1377.412,And Hadley against the Junior College or whatever it was?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1377.412,1383.559,"Hadley against the Junior College was another case involving, I believe -- it escapes from me at the moment, I’m sorry to say --"
1976.75-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.559,1383.559,Junior College.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1384.554,1388.531,"Junior College, yes."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1388.531,1394.726,"You know that went pretty far away from legislative apportionment, didn’t it?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1394.726,1395.36,The Hadley case?
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1395.36,1397.12,Yes.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1397.12,1423.005,"Well, it did to an extent, Your Honor, and so do in fact, the cases where the one vote -- “one person, one vote” principle has been applied when the subject matter of the elective process is the incurring of public debt."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1423.005,1426.258,Rather than the structure of the governmental entity itself?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1426.258,1426.838,Quite right.
1976.75-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1426.838,1434.26,And Hadley and Kramer were both elections to representative bodies albeit of lesser stature than State Legislature?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1434.26,1436.245,"Yes sir, that's correct, and the Court as found --"
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1436.245,1444.873,And your whole point as I understand it is simply that we do not have here anything that smacks in the slightest of choice of representatives?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1444.873,1445.775,That’s correct sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1445.775,1450.962,You suggest whether or not the county may or may not have a particular structure of government?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1450.962,1451.615,That is right.
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1451.615,1461.477,"And whether it can say, even though there’s a majority overall, if it’s not a majority of the aggregate of the voters of the townships, then the county may not have that formed?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1461.477,1465.868,Whether the state has that sovereign authority to do that in terms of setting up its own form of government.
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1465.868,1478.754,"Well, apart from that the whole theory as I understand you of Reynolds and Sims and that line, whole line of cases simply is inapplicable?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1478.754,1479.702,Exactly right.
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1479.702,1489.541,"And is it clear, may I ask that the, that the new charter or charters affect the towns quite differently from the way they affect the cities?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1489.541,1513.507,I don’t think that’s exactly the case.
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1513.507,1515.159,At all.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1515.159,1515.59,No.
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1515.59,1516.007,So you have --
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1516.007,1555.378,"There is no certain -- Mr. Justice Stewart, in answer to your question, there is no transfer of functions as between any of the subsidiary forms of government involved in this particular charter."
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1555.378,1559.33,"But in this case that fact, it was not present?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1559.33,1560.306,That fact is not -- does not --
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1560.306,1564.146,"So there’s no real rationale behind this in this case, is that it?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1564.146,1564.926,Behind what sir?
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1564.926,1570.199,Behind requiring a majority of votes of the town and the majority of the cities separately?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1570.199,1572.132,Oh! I think there is a rationale behind it.
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1572.132,1572.52,What is it?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1572.52,1612.053,"Your Honor, the rationale is that I think that people have, in different areas of a particular county, have different interests and have different requirements in terms of their county government."
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1612.053,1620.877,"Even though under the new county charters, you’ve said earlier in your argument that the provisions will apply equally to everyone?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1620.877,1621.675,They apply equally to --
1976.75-1157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1621.675,1624.486,"I mean , then everyone is subject to them to the same extent?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1624.486,1633.786,"That's right, except insofar as cities and towns do have by State Law, General State Law, somewhat different authorities and powers."
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1633.786,1648.531,"Well, is it possible that if this is a valid system that the cities might override township interest because of the type of representation they get in county government?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1648.531,1696.87,"As in point of fact, what we have here in Niagara County what the situation is that there happened to be some more residents in the three cities than there are in the towns of the county."
1976.75-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.87,1704.411,"Do town functions -- what are town functions in your view, is there any law enforcement function, do you have JPs or elector on the township basis?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1704.411,1709.447,"Yes sir, they have JP’s, they have a town board, they have a supervisor."
1976.75-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1709.447,1710.815,They have the constable.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1710.815,1716.011,"They have constables, they have general governmental functions."
1976.75-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.011,1722.006,"Now is it possible that if the county develops an executive -- what do you have, a sheriff?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1722.006,1723.62,"There is a county sheriff, that’s correct."
1976.75-1157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.62,1730.447,"Now, if the sheriff’s department expands a great deal might be need or use of the town constable be diminished?"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1730.447,1733.749,Exactly right.
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1733.749,1737.097,"Well, you might end up with the county constabulary, is it a --"
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1737.097,1738.303,Yes.
1976.75-1157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1738.303,1738.478,"So, are you --"
1976.75-1157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.478,1745.104,Is it possible that the status quo might be more greatly altered with respect to the towns than with respect to the cities?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1745.104,1787.417,"Yes, I think that’s correct sir as a practical matter."
1976.75-1157,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1787.417,1791.951,Are your (Voice Overlap) taxes entirely separate from towns and cities?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1791.951,1792.436,Yes sir.
1976.75-1157,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1792.436,1796.203,They’re not coincidental in boundary or anything?
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1796.203,1812.478,"No, they are not."
1976.75-1157,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1812.478,1829.544,I was going to inquire whether there could be any adverse tax consequences to the residents of the towns.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1829.544,1841.045,"No, I don’t believe that’s true."
1976.75-1157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1841.045,1843.953,We’ll resume at this point tomorrow morning at 10 o’clock gentlemen.
1976.75-1157,0,43587,victor_t_fuzak,,1843.953,1846.072,"Thank you very much, Your Honor."
