1975.74-1563,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,24.158,"We will hear arguments next in 1563, City of Eastlake against Forest City Enterprises."
1975.74-1563,0,28875,j_melvin_andrews,,27.105,30.925,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1379.823,1384.295,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1563,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1436.787,1440.723,(Inaudible) in the referendum aspect?
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1440.723,1444.332,"In the referendum aspect, Your Honor, it does not differ."
1975.74-1563,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1488.093,1499.545,"(Inaudible) there has been no City Council ordinance, no referendum in this case that you should win because industrial zoning is unreasonable to this Court?"
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1499.545,1501.209,"No, it is not Your Honor."
1975.74-1563,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1501.991,1504.573,It is only is that you are left with industrial zoning?
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1504.573,1520.95,"The result is that we are left with industrial zoning, but with a deprivation of due process, because Your Honor, the essential issue in the case is exactly that the due process issue and I will explain to the Court why."
1975.74-1563,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.95,1526.289,"Well, it has to do with the fact that you are being unreasonably restrained in the use of your properties?"
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1526.289,1533.354,"It has to do, Your Honor, with the process by which our rights have been decided."
1975.74-1563,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1533.354,1536.962,Not by the use of reasonable restriction above the use of the property?
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1536.962,1538.005,On the use of the property.
1975.74-1563,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1557.508,1564.992,The way it is chosen to pass on application such as yours to change the zoning that existed on the property at the time you bought it?
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1564.992,1567.095,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1975.74-1563,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1620.282,1635.946,"Well, why do you not object on the grounds that once the Planning Commission has decided to recommend the change, it is unconstitutional to submit it to even a body derivative from the sovereignty of the people, such as the City Council?"
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1635.946,1639.134,"Because the Planning Commission only makes recommendations, Your Honor."
1975.74-1563,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.752,1648.025,"Well, that is the way the Eastlake ordinance has set up now that the City Council only makes referendum recommendations and it is ultimately the people who decide?"
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1648.025,1651.332,"Well, it is not --"
1975.74-1563,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1651.332,1659.288,"You said that every votes of the City Council once the Planning Commission acts, it goes to the people?"
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1659.288,1676.248,"Had that been true, Your Honor and if the people were exercising the right to control the use of my property, then that exercise with that right would have to be or would have to arise to the constitutional standards of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1975.74-1563,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1720.996,1729.037,"You, at least I understood you to say that they could not change the rules of the game after you acquired the property here."
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1749.69,1755.118,"No, I would not, Your Honor because I have no vested right in the zoning."
1975.74-1563,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1786.819,1801.768,"Having the city procedure amended by putting it to a referendum and increasing the size of the vote in the council, what is the fundamental difference there?"
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1801.768,1808.051,"Well, you may -- we may increase the size of the vote in council, Your Honor."
1975.74-1563,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.234,1874.066,"What if the City Council in this case had simply denied your application for rezoning without any reasons or giving simply a minute order denying it, would you say that is a procedurally defective under the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1874.066,1889.982,"No, I would not say it is procedural defect, Your Honor because there the decision by the real decision maker, the City Council arrived at through a due process system has determined that I shall not get the change."
1975.74-1563,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.353,1894.9,You said that the City Council is the real decision maker.
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1904.369,1916.704,"In making the people the real decision maker, that is where they have created the conflict under the Fourteenth Amendment because the -- yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1975.74-1563,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1916.704,1928.707,"Suppose this case, instead of coming up from Ohio, came up from a rural county in Massachusetts where everything is done by town meeting, would you be making the same arguments here?"
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1928.707,1960.0,"I think the question, the issue Mr. Justice Blackmun, in that circumstance would be whether the town meeting as a part of the process for rezoning had a sufficient procedural protection to it, so that we could ascertain whether the standards of due process were being applied by the decision maker so that we could examine into the basis of that decision through some legitimate judicial process."
1975.74-1563,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1960.0,1961.539,But you know what a town meeting is?
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1961.539,1961.971,I do Your Honor.
1975.74-1563,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1961.971,1970.321,"Town meeting and the decisions made that night are there standards ever, people can just vote?"
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,1970.321,1980.867,"I think in the sense what you are referring to, Your Honor, is that what does take place in a lot of zoning, even in Eastlake and that is that there are public hearings."
1975.74-1563,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.392,2016.965,"So you would, I guess you would see an argument that it is planning committee make a right decision, City Council (Inaudible) and in the middle of the night which comes out with the decision which announces the next morning without any reason at all."
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,2022.292,2023.651,"Well, the --"
1975.74-1563,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.651,2024.672,The City Council does it.
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,2033.865,2036.262,"Right, or to the litigant."
1975.74-1563,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.262,2037.215,Yes.
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,2037.215,2038.164,"Well, under those circum --"
1975.74-1563,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.164,2040.604,Litigant is the property owner.
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,2040.604,2041.221,Yes.
1975.74-1563,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2041.221,2048.485,"And they just said the City Council just announces, we think industrial zoning is just fine for this property."
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,2051.911,2071.272,"Well, no I would say there maybe deficiencies in the due process procedure under which that decision has been arrived at and those deficiencies maybe a matter of concern to the local community at large or there maybe a matter of concern to the property owner."
1975.74-1563,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2071.272,2077.384,Deficiencies in hypothesis just given to you?
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,2077.384,2081.17,That there is no public hearing and the --
1975.74-1563,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2081.17,2085.342,In that hypothesis before the Planning Commission?
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,2085.342,2090.601,"But we had no consideration, Your Honor in, you know, before the public."
1975.74-1563,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2090.601,2094.994,Your answer is the City Council cannot do what Justice White has hypothesized?
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,2094.994,2096.348,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-1563,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2096.348,2100.07,Would you extend that rule to legislation in general?
1975.74-1563,1,44791,william_d_ginn,,2116.332,2128.017,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think it is quite well established that in that type of referendum that you have spoken of, that there may not be a constitutional infirmity."
1975.74-1563,2,28875,j_melvin_andrews,,3575.983,3582.119,Just very briefly in answer to the question of Justice Stewart.
1975.74-1563,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3627.414,3630.962,"Mr. Andrews, let me just get the 55% requirement clear in my mind."
1975.74-1563,2,28875,j_melvin_andrews,,3646.436,3648.191,Let us get straight on this cost.
1975.74-1563,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3659.268,3668.844,"Well if that is true, no matter how small the parcel and no matter how minor the change in zoning, the property owner has the burden of getting a 55% of the electorate to agree to that particular change?"
1975.74-1563,2,28875,j_melvin_andrews,,3668.844,3670.214,That is correct.
1975.74-1563,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3686.032,3687.76,Unless you talk about the variance?
1975.74-1563,2,28875,j_melvin_andrews,,3687.76,3689.054,Variance is something else.
1975.74-1563,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3690.803,3697.31,And my brother's example might be no more than a variance?
1975.74-1563,2,28875,j_melvin_andrews,,3697.31,3697.683,That is right.
1975.74-1563,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3702.29,3702.948,Thank you gentlemen.
