1982.82-118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.826,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Crown, Cork & Seal against Parker."
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,13.449,18.446,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.82-118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,587.919,596.494,"Mr. Solter, do you think American Pipe requires reliance at least to the putative intervenors?"
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,596.494,597.244,"--No, I don't."
1982.82-118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,628.309,635.883,You say the very fact of their later intervention shows they probably relied on the existence prior to the refusal to certify?
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,635.883,655.423,"If they knew of it, but, of course, American Pipe extended to those inactive and unknown members as well who might subsequently learn of the class action and the fact that it was not certified and file in time."
1982.82-118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,765.861,778.107,"There would be no point to your third alternative, would there, to intervene in the class action after denial of class certification?"
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,778.107,781.512,"Oh, yes, I think that is the whole point."
1982.82-118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.252,811.562,"Well, as I understood your fourth alternative was to intervene in an appeal, appeal the denial."
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,819.027,823.917,"Well, I got my numbers mixed up."
1982.82-118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,834.381,837.771,"No, I meant after denial of certification."
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,837.771,839.692,--What he did in this case you mean?
1982.82-118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,839.692,840.41,Yes.
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,854.873,876.646,"Well, I did mean to make that distinction, because after denial of certification, he can... the statute starts to run again under American Pipe and he is provided the opportunity to then intervene provided he does it within the time left to him on whatever statute it is."
1982.82-118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,878.644,884.423,Then when he does that he is simply submitting his individual claim on the merits really?
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,884.423,885.064,Precisely.
1982.82-118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.127,1157.392,"Mr. Solter, may I ask you--"
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1157.392,1158.126,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.126,1181.569,"--what do you do with the plaintiff, prospective plaintiff who seeks to intervene not as a right but intervention in the discretion of the trial judge and the trial judge decides he won't allow intervention, not because of time bar but just because he doesn't think it is an appropriate case to... He doesn't want to complicate his own lawsuit with this group of intervenors?"
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1183.163,1192.908,"Well, I would say that if the judge granted it on the grounds that you suggest, it might be an abuse of discretion under the rule, but if he granted--"
1982.82-118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1192.908,1195.049,I am asking if he denied it.
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1195.049,1196.172,--If he denied it?
1982.82-118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.172,1196.86,Yes.
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1196.86,1208.761,If he denied intervention because he felt that the individual had failed to establish that he was a member of a class or that there was such a class--
1982.82-118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.761,1227.161,"Well, assume he was literally within the class described by the plaintiff, but when it came around to certifying the class, the judge decided the commonality or typicality reason for not certifying a class and then he also decided not to allow intervention because he thought it would delay the proceeding, allow too many people to come in."
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1230.941,1240.857,"--Well, the result, I think, would be that, first of all, the person would be time barred because he wouldn't be able to then claim the benefit of tolling."
1982.82-118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.355,1250.588,But that is his only right?
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1250.588,1251.166,Sir?
1982.82-118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1251.166,1253.43,The Fourth Circuit Rule would protect him though as I understand it.
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1253.43,1270.143,"I don't think any more so necessarily than the intervention rule would, because a defendant is going to raise the limitations issue in one way or another, even in the private action that the Fourt Circuit advocates."
1982.82-118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.674,1320.122,"Well, I should think we would always have a case in which the plaintiff would be within the description of the class representative, within the class described in the complaint, but not within the class the trial judge was willing to certify."
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1325.589,1338.662,"--Well, that is true, of course, but the purpose of the motion and hearing on certification is to narrow it and try to determine what the real class--"
1982.82-118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1338.662,1343.425,"And, if he doesn't get within the class that is actually certified, then he does not get the benefit of the tolling rule?"
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1343.425,1345.112,"--I would say that is correct, yes."
1982.82-118,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1345.112,1372.055,"Mr. Solter, in the category that you are talking to Justice Stevens about, doesn't your position encourage perhaps the unnecessary filing of a bunch of complaints in anticipation that this problem might arise and isn't that as burdensome or moreso than the protective motions to intervene that the court was concerned about in American Pipe?"
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1372.055,1377.24,"Well, obviously there is the risk of that being involved."
1982.82-118,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1505.812,1507.578,Mr. Solter--
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1507.578,1508.078,"--Yes, sir."
1982.82-118,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1508.078,1511.124,--Is that the reason that Hansberry and Lee doesn't apply here?
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1511.124,1513.701,"I am sorry, sir, I didn't understand."
1982.82-118,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1513.701,1516.153,The case of Hansberry against Lee.
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1519.714,1521.979,"I can't recall it, sir."
1982.82-118,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1521.979,1535.519,Chief Judge Stone said that where there is a class action case it does not bind a future class action case on the same properties.
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1535.519,1538.409,I think that... I don't... I have to be frank.
1982.82-118,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1544.047,1545.359,The reason for this.
1982.82-118,0,26139,george_d_solter,,1545.359,1553.903,--The problems that brought about amendments to Rule 23 in 1966.
1982.82-118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1560.354,1560.854,Very well.
1982.82-118,1,37274,norris_c_ramsey,,1564.353,1566.571,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court:
1982.82-118,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.616,1785.889,"Mr. Ramsey, as a practical matter, can you say, based on your experience, how much discovery usually takes place in a typical class action case before the class certification motion is ruled upon?"
1982.82-118,1,37274,norris_c_ramsey,,1785.889,1787.201,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1855.847,1862.125,"Mr. Ramsey, that also would have been true if they had certified the class, isn't it?"
1982.82-118,1,37274,norris_c_ramsey,,1865.295,1868.919,"Well, if the Court had certified a class, the--"
1982.82-118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1868.919,1871.448,And then denied discovery.
1982.82-118,1,37274,norris_c_ramsey,,1871.448,1890.723,"--And then denied discovery, then they would have been faced with that problem, although we believe the District Court would have been wrong in that Eisen versus Carlisle & Jacquelin teaches that the court should not go into the merits when determining whether or not a case should be certified as a class action."
1982.82-118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1890.723,1905.888,"No, but it seems to me you are arguing it is unfair to make the non-party accept the bad features of the litigation, but unless he files his own lawsuit, he is going to do that if the class is eventually certified."
1982.82-118,1,37274,norris_c_ramsey,,1912.323,1929.27,"Well, at that point, he may be able to move to intervene pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24A on the grounds of inadequacy of representation in that the main plaintiffs would not have sought sufficient discovery to have the case determined on its merits."
1982.82-118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1929.27,1933.924,It just seems to me there is a little inconsistency in your position.
1982.82-118,1,37274,norris_c_ramsey,,1935.627,1969.206,"Well, further, the other practical effects on the case would be that requiring a putative class member to intervene into an existing cause of action may not be financially feasible in that should the court have before it a nationwide class action individuals located in jurisdictions far from the original jurisdiction may not be able to financially afford to hire attorneys and litigate in a foreign jurisdiction."
1982.82-118,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2009.768,2024.513,"Mr. Ramsey, is it customary where motions to intervene in a class action have been filed and intervention has been granted that each of the intervenors keeps their own attorney who made the motion to intervene on their behalf?"
1982.82-118,1,37274,norris_c_ramsey,,2024.513,2026.886,--I believe that is discretionary with the court.
1982.82-118,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2319.207,2328.656,Was there any particular reason that you chose on behalf of your client to file separately and then move to consolidate rather than to intervene?
1982.82-118,1,37274,norris_c_ramsey,,2328.656,2372.638,"The reasons were because being experienced with that litigation and being counsel in both cases, I was aware of the pre-trial discovery and difficulties that had gone on in that particular case and not wanting my client to be bound by those difficulties, then I opted to file a separate lawsuit and then move to consolidate those lawsuits based on my experience in other cases where class actions had been filed and separate lawsuits had been filed and the District Court allowed the separate lawsuit to engage in his own discovery, to complete his own discovery for purposes of trial."
1982.82-118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2608.278,2612.808,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Solter?"
1982.82-118,2,26139,george_d_solter,,2612.808,2616.448,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.82-118,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2791.361,2792.486,"Thank you, gentlemen."
