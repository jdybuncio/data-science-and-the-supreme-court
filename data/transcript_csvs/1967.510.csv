1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,19.719,24.071,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.510,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,192.027,196.328,"May I ask, was he given a hearing of any kind, a trial or?"
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,196.328,197.596,Yes he was Your Honor.
1967.510,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,316.66,319.473,Would that have changed your case?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,319.473,320.56,I don't think so Your Honor.
1967.510,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,321.423,322.812,What's the materiality?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,322.812,324.319,I don't think it actually changes it.
1967.510,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,378.515,382.174,There are no evidence that their reputations have been damaged?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,382.174,386.427,"No, they said they were damaged, but there is no evidence whatever on that score."
1967.510,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,386.427,388.892,They said that in the order.
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,388.892,398.271,"I think they -- as I remember the order it was said there, it did and would say if -- that if the order sort of recited these charges that I just said."
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,400.928,403.41,Is the Board an elected or appointed?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,403.41,405.458,The Board is an elective Board.
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,414.565,415.533,(Inaudible)
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,415.533,424.402,"Yes, terms of three years and -- but they run alternately."
1967.510,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,428.269,439.114,"Before we get to that, may I ask you if he demanded the hearing before the Board that's mentioned in this order that you just read?"
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,439.114,448.423,"Yes, the Illinois school code provides that when charges are made against a teacher, those charges are heard by the employing Board."
1967.510,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,457.522,464.612,"That -- well, did he demand, did he demand a hearing, it says further take notice that if you desire a hearing upon such charges --"
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,464.612,464.771,Oh!
1967.510,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,464.771,466.168,-- caused and reason.
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,466.168,471.381,"Yes, he followed the statutory course which is to demand a hearing in 10 years or in 10 days."
1967.510,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,474.837,475.588,Yes.
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,475.588,484.695,"As to that part, there is no question of the conformity to the procedural rules applied to this case."
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,484.695,487.785,And was that hearing transcribed?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,487.785,489.335,"Yes Your Honor, and it's --"
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,489.335,490.527,It's what the -- all this (Inaudible)
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,490.527,508.487,"There -- it's a -- abstract in the appendix and I think the record is here in this --under the Administrative Review Act of Illinois, yes, its on â€“ it begins on page 37 Your Honor or 39."
1967.510,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,508.487,510.381,Of the appendix?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,510.381,518.253,"Of the abstract or appendix Volume 1, that's where it begins."
1967.510,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,627.73,631.875,(Inaudible) were there findings made?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,631.875,639.822,"Well, the finding of the Board of Education was that they were all -- all their charges were sustained."
1967.510,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,652.537,658.477,Do I understand you to say that the School Board held all of the charges were true?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,658.477,662.812,"Well, they held the charges are true and they said that letters in this -- the statements in the letter are false."
1967.510,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,662.812,664.407,The statements in the letter were false?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,664.407,669.307,"That's right, they have isolated I think some 16 statements that they said were false."
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,679.15,682.406,Was that a hearing de novo or was that just a --
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,682.406,684.968,"No Your Honor, it is not a hearing de novo."
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,684.968,687.962,Treated as if but were just a review of an administrative agency determination?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,687.962,691.604,"It goes up on the record, yes, on the transcript and on the documents."
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,691.604,693.596,But there's no hearing de novo on the record.
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,693.596,695.374,"No, there is not Your Honor, that -- the statute --"
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,695.374,700.427,Now did the -- the Supreme Court of Illinois file an opinion in this case?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,700.427,702.798,"Yes Your Honor, there were two opinions filed."
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,712.423,713.537,"Don't bother, I can find these?"
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,713.537,719.082,"They're on page 134, the first one is, and then the next one is just following."
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,905.981,909.398,You probably read some dissenting opinions have read like that --
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,909.398,914.147,"Well, I have read I think both in that regard.[Attempt to Laughter]"
1967.510,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,932.019,934.821,"I know, like judges.[Laughter]"
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,934.821,946.122,"Oh, well the Illinois --"
1967.510,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,946.122,951.512,Did the Supreme Court of Illinois applied the Times test?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,951.512,969.325,"The Supreme Court of Illinois recited at considerable length the evidence about the truth and falsity of the letter and it said in a couple of sentences or maybe even on one sentence, New York Times versus Sullivan and Garrison versus Louisiana don't apply, just like that."
1967.510,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,972.741,977.442,"That is because of the employer-employee relationship, isn't that right?"
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,982.286,991.331,"Yes, the court said in its opinion that in effect at least that when you enter into government employ, you give up so many of your rights."
1967.510,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1085.394,1087.295,Who's opinion?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,1087.295,1089.569,In the opinion of the Board of Education.
1967.510,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1096.35,1098.097,You did not mean that --
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,1098.097,1098.767,I beg your pardon.
1967.510,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1098.767,1106.757,You did not mean it what I thought you first to imply that if in the best -- and this opinion of the court?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,1106.757,1118.46,"No, I'm talking -- I said Board, I think throughout that -- anyway, I mean Board, the Board of Education under the statute may dismiss a teacher when in its opinion the best interest of the school require it."
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1123.781,1124.588,"Well, I want to be clear."
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,1135.866,1136.053,Yes --
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1136.053,1138.897,-- (Voice Overlap) is that it?
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,1138.897,1159.928,"The statute is on page 4, actually of the brief and it says what the scope of the review is and it says that there's no additional evidence to be presented, the tenure law itself in providing for hearings as the -- a court reporter must be present, that a transcript must be made."
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1173.556,1177.383,"Well, then its ordinary judicial review of an administrative nature?"
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,1177.383,1179.733,"Precisely, I think it (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1179.733,1183.817,"This is (Voice Overlap) the marriage is not a cause for removal, I see that's expressly stated?"
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,1183.817,1184.441,Pardon?
1967.510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1184.441,1185.071,Marriage is not of course --
1967.510,0,31503,john_ligtenberg,,1185.071,1186.421,"Oh, yes."
1967.510,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1201.11,1204.778,"You may, you may Mr. Ligtenberg."
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1208.414,1212.912,"Mr. Chief Justice, honorable members of the Court."
1967.510,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1245.435,1247.709,Did you say some teachers have written to the --
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1247.709,1248.307,Yes --
1967.510,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1248.307,1250.819,-- to the same paper in support of the program?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1250.819,1255.528,"Not of the athletic program, but in support of the tax rate increase."
1967.510,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1255.528,1256.828,Was anything done to them?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1256.828,1257.967,No.
1967.510,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1259.589,1262.252,Only this fellow who's opposed it?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1262.252,1263.494,Right.
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1408.395,1413.079,"Well, does it makes any difference -- does it make any difference whether he was right or wrong?"
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1413.079,1413.989,In what regard Your Honor?
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1413.989,1417.082,In terms of the First Amendment problem that's before us?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1417.082,1427.611,"Well, if you're going to apply the Sun Time -- New York Times rule, I suppose that the Board would have to show that the falsehoods were made in bad faith."
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1453.711,1456.384,Are you defending that standard?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1456.384,1457.753,I believe this is the only standard (Voice Overlap) Your Honor.
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1457.753,1471.93,"So what's your -- what you're presenting to us is a proposition that -- if Mr. Pickering was reasonably inaccurate, then his dismissal was justified?"
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1471.93,1472.085,Oh!
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1489.585,1495.591,"Well, suppose he had made this not in the form a written communication, let's suppose he had made a speech."
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1495.591,1497.161,Before whom Your Honor?
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1497.161,1501.296,"Well, just a speech outside to more than 10 people, let's say --"
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1501.296,1502.697,That -- are teachers?
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1506.73,1508.317,Where do you get that?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1508.317,1508.613,I beg your pardon.
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1508.613,1510.091,"Where do you get that, a little higher privilege?"
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1510.091,1513.333,"I think there's some of that effect, the local law."
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1513.333,1514.837,Is it cited in your brief?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1514.837,1515.71,"No, no Your Honor."
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1515.71,1523.725,You mean there is a local law saying that there is some kind of privilege if you address teachers -- if a teacher addresses other teachers?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1523.725,1528.83,"That -- the area of the debate in the freedom of speech is broader, yes sir."
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1528.83,1532.108,"There's a local law, you don't really mean that, do you?"
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1532.108,1533.625,I wish I could give you the citation Your Honor.
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1539.927,1546.261,Then I suppose -- suppose he made a speech at a Patent-Teachers Association meeting?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1546.261,1546.851,Then I think I would --
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1546.851,1551.344,"Suppose he was wrong, he had been carefully investigated -- wrong."
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1551.344,1556.37,I would think that the standard established by the Illinois Court is the applicable standard.
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1556.37,1558.386,"Even though, a speech at a Parent-Teachers meeting?"
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1558.386,1558.613,Yes.
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1576.355,1591.766,"Would you apply that, suppose some government employee, some employee of the state made criticisms of a Governor, an elected Governor of a state and they were wrong --"
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1591.766,1592.263,Well --
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1592.263,1597.151,"Would you say that that's ground for a dismissal constitutionally, that is all we're talking about?"
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1597.151,1603.126,"Again, you have to know the nature of the relationship of employee and employer."
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1628.215,1653.797,"Suppose a teacher, I just want you to address yourself to the specific questions if you will, suppose a teacher published in a paper, an open letter, send out an open letter to the public in Illinois in which he criticized the Governor for the Governor's alleged action or inaction with respect to the public school system."
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1653.797,1656.256,A teacher criticizing the Governor?
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1656.256,1656.68,Yes.
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1656.68,1661.824,I think he has a privilege that is equal to the general pubic to do that.
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1668.438,1673.184,"You, in other words, you think that this depends on the approximate."
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1682.02,1687.069,"Yes, yes and I think the federal civil service system adopts this position."
1967.510,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1696.124,1698.443,Well I'm not sure that I would agree with that.
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1698.443,1699.796,I -- that's the way I interpret it.
1967.510,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1699.796,1711.35,(Voice Overlap) I understood you to say that there was a difference in the standard of a teacher making a speech and writing a letter of this kind?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1711.35,1713.14,"Yes, I think the publication reaches far more people within the district."
1967.510,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1713.14,1716.682,"Yes, let me ask you this."
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1736.942,1743.04,I think under the Illinois standard he probably would lose his job and a -- even better Your Honor if the --
1967.510,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1743.04,1747.046,I thought you said there was a local law or something that --
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1747.046,1749.154,"You say, before teachers or parents?"
1967.510,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1749.154,1749.925,I beg your pardon?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1749.925,1751.897,"I thought you said before parents, Your Honor."
1967.510,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1751.897,1755.343,"No, I said before citizens and any group of citizens."
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1755.343,1756.829,Alright.
1967.510,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1756.829,1759.799,Would you say that that was privileged?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1759.799,1761.084,No.
1967.510,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1761.084,1769.359,"Well, what privilege does he have in making speeches then that he wouldn't have in writing a letter of this kind to the press?"
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1769.359,1774.67,"Number one, I think in debate many things are said hastily without research."
1967.510,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1807.32,1816.81,"You mean any teacher, any teacher reporting anything in the papers are required to submit it to the -- this officer that you speak of?"
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1816.81,1819.239,I don't believe the wording is mandatory Your Honor I think it's more of a direction.
1967.510,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1819.239,1820.271,What does it say?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1821.235,1833.416,"It says that before releasing a publication, a teacher should submit in triplicate the proposed publication to the building coordinator of the school district for the purposes of accuracy."
1967.510,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1834.472,1834.641,Well --
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1834.641,1836.859,That the word is should and I don't think it would be a --
1967.510,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1836.859,1839.891,Does the fact that he doesn't do it is that --
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1839.891,1840.486,Not a basis for discharge.
1967.510,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1840.486,1842.569,(Voice overlap) that he should be fired?
1967.510,1,29683,john_f_cirricione,,1842.569,1845.417,"No, no, we're not contending that."
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2319.27,2322.509,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2372.644,2380.152,"Well, why should the First Amendment protect false statements, just plain lies?"
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2380.152,2380.511,I think --
1967.510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.511,2383.844,"That isn't certainly the functions of the First Amendment, I would suppose --"
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2383.844,2385.607,The function of the First Amendment --
1967.510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.607,2390.589,"(Voice Overlap) to get accurate information around, so people can make it a reasonable decision."
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2390.589,2393.467,I think the exact points as stated by Your Honor.
1967.510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.749,2422.338,Not knowingly false statements?
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2422.338,2429.583,"Yes, they are, knowingly false statements unless they are malicious and unless they're done with the purpose of harming."
1967.510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2431.537,2441.798,Well I didn't know that this Court had held that with the -- that the First Amendment protects knowingly false statements.
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2441.798,2445.568,If malicious -- unless maliciously made as I understand but now --
1967.510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.568,2450.793,"I know, that isn't -- I didn't know that was in New York Times."
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2450.793,2452.262,"Well, as a matter -- in a corporate sense --"
1967.510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2452.262,2458.815,(Voice Overlap) I thought malice in the New York Times was -- whether the statement was knowingly false or recklessly made.
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2458.815,2463.099,"Well, I think I have to stand corrected on that because that is true."
1967.510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.766,2486.513,"Well, that maybe so, but explain to me why the First Amendment in this case, in this context should be held to protect a false statement."
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2495.334,2510.978,I think that if we cut the rule in that frame then we are getting into the question of constantly having to prove knowingly and that itself is the serious break on open public debate.
1967.510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.85,2535.661,"Well, do you think -- you think it ought to go so far in -- you don't think that -- in the context of employer-employee relationship that perhaps the employee at least should have to take -- to resort to some normal sources of information before he publishes a statement that is false."
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2535.661,2541.636,The -- that I think in the first place sounds very reasonable.
1967.510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.56,2557.065,That's quite a different situation I must say when somebody comes in and offers that --
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2557.065,2557.708,And now of course the --
1967.510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2557.708,2567.008,-- (Voice Overlap) people they know and things like that but if its -- but there's a routine source of information where you can check out whether or not you're telling the public lies.
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2573.506,2580.852,"Of course you limit it to your question as I understand it to the field of employment, public employment."
1967.510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.483,2596.105,But that was statutory test and that was --
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2596.105,2597.05,That was a statutory test --
1967.510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.05,2597.905,-- federal statute.
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2597.905,2607.674,But I don't believe that we could in the First Amendment situation relegate that entire matter to a statute.
1967.510,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2634.675,2637.622,Did the Board make any finding that they were knowingly false?
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2637.622,2639.702,"No, I don't think so Your Honor."
1967.510,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2639.702,2639.995,Why?
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2645.356,2659.175,"Except that -- yes, in the first instance except that I think in First Amendment cases the court will tend to examine the record for itself and come to it's own conclusion in matters of these kind, with that exception yes."
1967.510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2768.249,2769.822,"Mr. Ligtenberg, I assume you're --"
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2769.822,2770.878,I beg your pardon.
1967.510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2770.878,2781.547,"-- familiar with the federal cases cited by your Brother in opposition, cases like the Houston against the United States, Cramridge against the United States."
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2784.41,2787.175,"I haven't -- I'm not -- I can't, well recite."
1967.510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2787.175,2808.587,"Well, what it involves, a federal employee who made charges against his superiors which were unsubstantiated and the Court of Claims held that that was probably good grounds for dismissal from the federal service."
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2835.047,2840.881,I think they would have some relevance and I would say of course I'm -- in my conviction --
1967.510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2840.881,2841.109,Have you read them (Voice Overlap) --
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2841.109,2847.58,"-- that they're wrong, I read them quite some time ago and I would say that my conviction is around the rules that I expressed --"
1967.510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2847.58,2848.263,If those (Voice Overlap) --
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2848.263,2853.492,(Voice Overlap) the applications of the right of free speech.
1967.510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2862.154,2863.319,"She claimed it was true, what she had (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2863.319,2864.183,I know she would be (Voice Overlap) --
1967.510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2864.183,2865.568,(Voice Overlap) --
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2865.568,2870.428,She didn't -- I don't know whether the proof there was -- or there was any basis for her claims or not.
1967.510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2870.428,2873.255,They wouldn't permit her to show that it was --
1967.510,2,31503,john_ligtenberg,,2873.255,2875.62,This would be -- and I would argue for it certainly
