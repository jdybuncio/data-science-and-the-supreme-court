2008.08-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.996,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-108, Flores-Figueroa v. United States."
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,7.73,20.629,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In common usage, to say that somebody knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses something is to say that that person knows what it is that he is transferring, possessing, or using."
2008.08-108,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,45.964,47.668,Doesn't that depend on the context?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,57.132,59.257,--I haven't been able to think of one.
2008.08-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,61.597,66.97,"Well, how about so and so stole the car that belonged to Mr. Jones?"
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,66.97,67.579,I think--
2008.08-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,67.579,74.188,"I suppose you could say that -- that the person knew it was Mr. Jones's car, but more likely somebody stole the car that turned out to be Mr. Jones's."
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,74.188,79.231,--I do think that that formulation gives rise to a little bit more ambiguity in that context.
2008.08-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,89.354,92.415,He says he knowingly stole the car that belonged to Mr. Jones.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,93.772,96.037,"--Yes, I'm sorry if I left that part out."
2008.08-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,96.037,97.129,"You left out the ""knowingly""."
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,97.129,97.663,Yes.
2008.08-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,97.663,98.818,"Once you put in ""knowingly""--"
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,98.818,105.625,"I think if the statement is, you know, John knowingly stole the car of Mr. Jones, that strongly implies that John knew that the car belonged to Mr. Jones."
2008.08-108,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,105.625,108.109,"I repeat, doesn't that depend on the context?"
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,125.292,135.255,I do think that the formulation that John knowingly stole the car of Mr. Jones most naturally is understood to imply that John knew whose car it was he was stealing.
2008.08-108,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,151.391,152.654,Who did the mugger mug?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,162.762,165.071,--I think that that's a more ambiguous statement.
2008.08-108,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,165.071,166.494,Why is it more ambiguous?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,166.494,170.225,"Because I think the ""from"" preposition--"
2008.08-108,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,170.225,171.649,Why is it less unambiguous?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,174.242,178.8,"--I think the possessive form makes it, through common usage, unambiguous."
2008.08-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,185.92,186.969,"Well, so what if it isn't?"
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,206.506,207.961,--That -- that is correct.
2008.08-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,208.631,210.523,Whether -- even if it isn't ordinary usage.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,210.523,211.085,--That's right.
2008.08-108,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,215.631,218.189,I was slightly trying to push you on to the next argument.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,218.552,226.92,"--Well, we do think that, in a criminal statute, you ordinarily assume -- this Court has said that a conventional mens rea element extends to all of the elements of the offense."
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,264.952,287.487,"Mr. Russell, am I correct in understanding that the government goes with you almost all the way, and its only the last three words, ""of another person"", that -- they agree ""knowingly"" applies to ""without lawful authority"" and that it applies to ""a means of identification""?"
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,291.799,294.155,"As I understand it, that is not their position."
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,327.675,348.09,"Is the first -- this alien's first effort to get papers that would qualify for him, if I -- if I remember correctly, the first time around he used an assumed name, not his own name."
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,348.09,348.605,That's correct.
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.605,350.558,He used a false date of birth.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,358.787,359.96,Correct.
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,359.96,362.05,And -- and that would not have violated.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,365.474,366.565,That's right.
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,366.565,367.672,--this statute.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,387.869,388.477,Correct.
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,388.477,391.522,So that does make it a crime.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,399.38,408.033,"Just to be clear, the only reason the government alleges that there is a crime here is because it turned out that those numbers had been assigned to somebody else."
2008.08-108,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,423.557,439.83,What would happen if the -- the defendant doesn't -- doesn't act knowingly as to the question whether the identifying information belongs to a real person but is simply reckless as to whether the identifying information belongs to a real person?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,461.522,465.009,"--Ordinarily, recklessness doesn't satisfy a knowledge requirement."
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,470.207,475.066,Would it be enough to go to the jury on the hypothetical Justice Alito gives you?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,475.066,476.158,I think so.
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,478.86,499.071,You agree that you could go to the jury whenever there is an identity card that does reflect the identity of a real person but there's no other knowledge that the government's case has introduced that shows -- there's no other evidence that the government has introduced showing knowledge?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,499.071,502.397,If there's -- I think that could be a component of a circumstantial evidence case.
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,505.537,508.551,Suppose I had five different cards with five different real people.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,510.645,512.442,--I don't think so in itself.
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,521.627,522.204,"No, no."
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,540.554,542.679,"--No, I don't think so."
2008.08-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.131,548.692,"--You are making it very hard for me to vote with you, I must say."
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,550.693,551.208,Well--
2008.08-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.208,561.233,"I thought you had a pretty good -- a pretty good case, but if you are going to say somebody who has five identity cards, faces of individuals -- I mean, presumably they are real individuals."
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,561.233,561.889,--I'm sorry.
2008.08-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.529,565.531,That was -- that was the hypothetical.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,576.476,577.743,--Okay.
2008.08-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.883,581.273,Yes.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,581.273,581.928,--which is an unusual thing--
2008.08-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.928,582.599,Of course.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,582.599,591.189,"--to try to use, but if that's the case, then, yes, I think that -- you know, that if there would be -- affirms that that picture belongs to the person whose number is there, then they could do that."
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,591.876,592.394,"No, no."
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,595.143,607.044,"--I think that a jury could reasonably infer that the person wouldn't -- would know, that if you have an ID card with somebody else's name, somebody else's number, somebody else's picture, that that belongs to somebody else."
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,607.044,608.791,That's not -- that's not this case.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,620.895,622.97,I don't know the answer to that question.
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,624.97,626.14,That was going to be my next question.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,630.531,632.905,I would tend to think that that's not sufficient.
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,633.778,634.278,"Well, that--"
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.278,641.168,"Even if he had five different cards, all with his name, but all with the identification numbers of other real people?"
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,641.168,643.086,"--Again, I would think not."
2008.08-108,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,681.899,710.608,"What if the defendant chooses a name -- uses a name other than his or her own name -- gets an identification card made up with that -- and doesn't know for sure that the name that's chosen actually belongs to another person, but because it's not an extremely uncommon name, has -- knows that it's virtually certain that that name belongs to some other person who is unknown to him?"
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,710.608,711.622,I think--
2008.08-108,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,711.622,712.217,Is that a violation?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,712.217,716.354,"--Again, you have this issue of recklessness versus knowledge."
2008.08-108,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,748.14,752.714,"Well, what if it's not an extremely common name, but not an extremely uncommon name?"
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,760.305,764.677,You would have to show that he knew that that was a name belonging to a specific person.
2008.08-108,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,764.677,767.223,He had -- he would have to know that there is such a person?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,767.223,772.41,"He would have to know that there is such -- he wouldn't have to know me, but he would have to know that there is such a person."
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,773.611,776.158,Does he have to know it's that -- but suppose he uses John Smith.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,783.158,784.343,--I think so.
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,795.541,798.025,But I want an answer to the question.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,798.025,806.316,"--Well, I think the answer is the one that I gave you, which I think is disputable, but it's -- the answer is yes, he has to know that there is a specific person named John Smith."
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,806.316,809.677,And it can't be submitted to the jury on the ground that anybody knows there's a John Smith?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,809.677,811.331,I think--
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,811.331,820.141,"Can -- can it go to the jury without any other evidence, other than the fact of his possessing the card?"
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,820.141,831.386,"--If it's a sufficiently common name that he ought to know that there is somebody bearing that name, then yes, I would agree that it could go to the jury on that."
2008.08-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,831.386,835.976,"If the name were Anthony Kennedy, would that go to the jury?"
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,836.712,850.833,"I -- again -- it's hard to draw lines here, but I think the ultimate question is, you know, could a reasonable jury think that somebody using that name has to know that there is a person with that name, a specific person with that name?"
2008.08-108,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,852.798,853.707,Can you give me an example?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,855.626,857.267,An awful lot of name examples would.
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,881.381,887.005,"But if you say this goes to the jury, it doesn't leave very much to your knowledge argument."
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,887.005,888.471,--Well--
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,888.471,893.22,"I mean, I suppose that defense counsel could get up and say, the government hasn't shown that he knew this."
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,897.124,900.357,"--Well, it -- I think the jury still has to make the finding that he knew it."
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,911.682,914.322,--How do these operations work?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,926.955,929.954,"--The record doesn't disclose that, and I don't know."
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,929.954,931.798,These are--
2008.08-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,931.798,932.376,Can I--
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,932.376,939.672,--These are outfits that specialize in making false identifications?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,939.672,942.623,"Again, the record doesn't disclose how sophisticated the operation was."
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,950.79,975.262,"Do you have any sense of -- because there are many people with false identification papers -- how many times it turns out to be the number of a live person, and how many times it turns out like it was in the first instance in this case: It's just a number, a made-up number that doesn't belong to anybody?"
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,975.262,977.996,I'm afraid I don't have a good sense of that.
2008.08-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1120.796,1128.561,"--Well, but that's -- that doesn't help you much because it can't be ""knowingly manufacture"" something is the crime."
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1139.245,1142.883,I disagree as matter of common usage.
2008.08-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1158.875,1161.656,"No, I -- I guess maybe this was what I was trying to say earlier as well."
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1166.951,1168.105,--That's right.
2008.08-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1168.105,1176.524,So that means that it can stop at a lot more number of earlier places than can the statute that you were just citing in appendix D.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1176.524,1194.329,"Well, to answer that question -- and then I'd like to return to the school zone example -- the fact that Congress put in ""without lawful authority"" and enclosed it with commas I think simply reflects that Congress understood that, by inserting that phrase between transitive verbs and the direct object, it was interrupting the natural flow of the sentence."
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1256.429,1280.781,"What about the government's argument in this case that Congress was really going after people who have false identifications because of its concern to protect the victim, that is, the person whose number is misused?"
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1291.072,1296.929,"I do think it's a fair point, that this is a statute that's concerned with victims."
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1413.805,1414.975,It's not a clear statute.
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1423.488,1426.517,I think that's an open question in the circuits.
2008.08-108,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1434.999,1436.715,What is your view?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1436.715,1440.732,"My view -- I mean, the statute says ""of another person""."
2008.08-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1449.353,1458.068,"Well, it does, though, in a way, because I understand your theory is there are two basic kinds of crimes."
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1481.291,1482.183,That's true.
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1505.424,1516.48,This -- this conduct would amount to identity -- what did it say -- is there a crime of identity fraud?
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1516.48,1523.448,"Well, that's what we have been using to refer to the underlying predicate offense here, which is the misuse of the immigration document."
2008.08-108,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1555.167,1561.948,It would be equally false if the Social Security number were fictitious -- it didn't belong to--
2008.08-108,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1561.948,1562.447,--Didn't belong to anybody.
2008.08-108,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.915,1566.429,"Thank you, Mr. Russell."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1572.394,1591.483,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is common ground that there are at least three preconditions to liability under 18 U.S.C. section 1028A(a)(1): First and foremost, the defendant must commit one of the separate predicate felonies that are specifically enumerated in subsection (c)."
2008.08-108,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1628.325,1689.427,"Mr. Heytens, did the prosecutor give the right answer to Judge Friedman in the district court when Judge Friedman asked: Where I take two people and one of them gets a false Social Security card and it happens that the number belongs to no live person, and another person goes to the same outfit, but the card that he gets does belong to a live person -- he doesn't know in either case -- did the prosecutor give the right answer when he said, when it turns out to be a fictitious number, no two-year add-on; but if it turns out to be a real number, two years' mandatory addition?"
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1693.782,1694.91,"Yes, it was."
2008.08-108,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1716.665,1723.317,"If I could just interrupt you, why does ""of another individual"" -- why can't that be read to mean"
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1729.144,1737.937,"--Justice Alito, I think the answer to that relates to the definition of 4a."
2008.08-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1762.145,1764.972,"Mr. Heytens, this raises the question I was talking to your opponent about."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1780.278,1790.199,"Justice Stevens, I agree that a person who deliberately sets out to misappropriate the identity of a known individual is almost certainly more culpable than someone who does not do it but inadvertently does so."
2008.08-108,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1814.531,1820.513,"Yes, but I think -- I thought that argument cut against you, because what you are saying is everybody is on the hook."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1830.945,1842.127,"I understand how, from the defendant's perspective -- to use the Justice -- the example that Justice Ginsburg used as well, but it may seem from the defendant's perspective that he just so happened to take a real person's number."
2008.08-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1851.467,1852.2,Why?
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1875.833,1876.566,"Well, Justice--"
2008.08-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1876.566,1877.207,What's the problem?
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1877.207,1898.994,"--Justice Breyer, my answer to your question will probably be only of interest to those members of the Court who find legislative history probative, but I think for those who do, the very significant answer to that is that the one thing the legislative history makes very clear is that at least some members of Congress believed that judicially discretionary sentences before this statute were enacted were failing to adequately take into account the harm suffered by real victims."
2008.08-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1906.181,1912.179,Does the legislative history deal with people who are stealing identities of people who have been -- or bilking identities?
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1914.207,1915.973,"--I certainly agree, Justice Stevens."
2008.08-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1942.572,1944.665,"Why not just says ""means of identification"", then?"
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1964.919,1967.091,"--There are two responses to that, Justice Breyer."
2008.08-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1997.579,2015.325,"Give me one where what they've done is they have used ""knowingly"" at the beginning, and there are four elements of the crime, and -- I'm not saying there are none, but I'd like to know what they are where ""knowingly"" doesn't modify something there is strict liability for."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2015.325,2015.808,--Sure.
2008.08-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2016.417,2023.786,"That's going to be jurisdictional -- probably jurisdictional hooks, like Hobbs Act, and there could be -- there could be some."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2025.397,2026.193,--I'll give you two.
2008.08-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2085.262,2091.587,But the reason for that is it's an equally culpable act where you steal something off of a field as in Morissette.
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2113.94,2124.058,"Justice Stevens, I agree that Mr. Morissette's culpability, or the hypothetical defendant in standpoint of Mr. Morissette, doesn't really depend on whether he knows the property belongs to the Federal Government or he thinks he is stealing from his neighbor."
2008.08-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2132.384,2133.055,You can do it--
2008.08-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2133.055,2135.426,That's the point.
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2135.426,2136.128,--Sure.
2008.08-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2144.126,2149.11,"--Even that isn't -- I mean, here you're treating it as if it is a separate thing."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2159.903,2163.931,What they are doing there is -- this goes back to my point that this is a victim-focused statute.
2008.08-108,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2172.835,2181.019,"I can -- I can understand your argument if you're saying, look, you can't tell simply from the text what the answer is."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2207.149,2211.786,--We don't concede that the text of the statute alone unambiguously resolves the issue in our favor--
2008.08-108,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2211.786,2213.974,"Well, but does it -- does it even come close to supporting it?"
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2315.021,2323.436,"--Justice Souter, I -- I think, as I said before, we do not contend that this statutory text standing along unambiguously supports our position and thus terminates the inquiry."
2008.08-108,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2356.157,2358.08,But Is it worth two years?
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2358.08,2359.519,--I think -- I think it is.
2008.08-108,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2359.519,2368.312,The only thing that we know for sure is that Congress said it's not worth two years' extra unless that of another person was involved.
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2381.977,2390.865,"Well, I think, first of all, at that point the defendant already has two different culpable states of mind: He has the culpable state of mind to commit the underlying felony, and he has the culpable state of mind with regard to his crime."
2008.08-108,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2408.778,2411.621,"All Congress has got to do is to say ""recklessly""."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2411.621,2413.617,--It's certainly true that Congress--
2008.08-108,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2413.617,2415.681,It's an -- it's an accepted term.
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2431.438,2434.75,--I certainly agree there are other ways that Congress could have written the statute to make it clear.
2008.08-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2443.824,2446.197,"Well, I'll tell you what cuts one way or another."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2472.891,2476.279,"Well, under the rule of lenity, Justice Scalia, the tie does go to the defendant."
2008.08-108,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2487.462,2490.742,Should -- should it -- is it time to revisit the Court's decision in Hayes?
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2491.401,2500.74,--The Court -- what the Court said yesterday in Hayes is precisely what it had said before in Muscarello.
2008.08-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2509.8,2512.876,"All that is true, and that's actually where I was going."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2542.644,2543.799,--I think that is the effect.
2008.08-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2543.799,2547.219,And I don't think I can resolve that one way or the other from anything you have said.
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2608.741,2620.049,"Justice Breyer, I -- I guess what I would say first and foremost is I -- I think that would be a fairly significant reconceptualization of the purpose of the rule of lenity--"
2008.08-108,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2620.049,2621.001,That's why I raised it.
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2621.001,2621.458,--Right.
2008.08-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2623.844,2628.859,"You'd have to rename it the rule of, you know, who gets hurt the most or something."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2628.859,2630.547,--The rule of mandatory minimums--
2008.08-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.547,2631.218,Not lenity.
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2631.218,2643.525,--The Court has said over and over again that the two purposes of the rule of lenity are providing fair warning to people before their conduct subjects them to criminal punishment and to demonstrate a proper respect for the lawmaking powers of Congress.
2008.08-108,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2648.898,2656.677,"But what about the -- the even division -- I think it's an even division, 3/3 -- is it a 3/3 split?"
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2731.443,2734.785,"Well, again, if I could -- there are several things there."
2008.08-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.861,2790.607,"Yes, but in this particular case, if you talk about identity theft, it's inconceivable that the defendant would not know about fact that there's another person involved."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2802.695,2816.094,"--Well, I think I -- if I understand the question correctly, I think there are certainly many cases in which the manner in which the defendant uses the means of identification will, itself, provide powerful circumstantial evidence that he knows there is, in fact, another person."
2008.08-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2818.391,2823.199,And those are the category of cases in which Congress wanted to have a more severe penalty.
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2823.199,2826.404,I certainly agree that those are at least some of the category of cases.
2008.08-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2849.782,2853.393,And in any of those cases did they talk about unknowing identity theft?
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2853.393,2865.481,"--What I guess I am saying, Justice Stevens, is in none of those cases does Congress -- when it's trotting out those statistics -- does Congress distinguish between situations in which the victim was able to determine whether the defendant knew that he existed."
2008.08-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2865.917,2867.103,Is this in the statute?
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2867.103,2869.618,"--It is not in the text of the statute, Justice Scalia."
2008.08-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2869.618,2870.882,"Well, let's not say Congress, then."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2871.946,2874.384,"The Committee report, I apologize, Justice Scalia."
2008.08-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2875.304,2878.427,"You won't convince Justice Scalia of this, but you might convince me."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2878.786,2879.523,--Fair enough.
2008.08-108,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2928.891,2933.453,"Well, but in that case, you tell them, look, the person's got 10 years."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,2938.531,2940.574,"--He's going to face up to 10 years, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3021.088,3025.369,You could also say you get two years for knowing that there is a discrete victim.
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3028.617,3029.335,You certainly can.
2008.08-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3029.335,3030.898,And it makes sense either way.
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3030.898,3048.095,"You certainly can describe it either way, but I think in light of the concern that the harms to real victims are not being adequately taken into account, it doesn't seem to us to make sense to make the presence of that additional punishment turn on whether the defendant is specifically aware that the victim existed, and I think at the end of the--"
2008.08-108,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3048.095,3056.904,"You -- you gave earlier the felony murder example of the one who -- the gun goes off, he didn't mean to kill anybody."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3083.191,3090.295,"--We certainly do, Justice Ginsburg, and we don't make the extravagant claim that law doesn't look to relative moral culpability in assigning criminal punishment."
2008.08-108,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3207.733,3213.715,"Well, but the problem with that is the statute says ""identity theft""; it doesn't say anything about victims."
2008.08-108,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,3213.715,3224.459,"--It certainty does, Mr. Chief Justice, but it says ""identity theft""; it says -- not ""theft"", and I think the question is whether you refer to those people as having had -- if identity theft occurred in this case."
2008.08-108,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3236.001,3236.643,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-108,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3238.375,3240.376,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-108,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3306.345,3313.095,There aren't too many 15-year-olds who look like they're over 21?
2008.08-108,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3313.719,3313.095,That's right.
