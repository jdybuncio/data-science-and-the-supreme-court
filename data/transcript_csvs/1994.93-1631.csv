1994.93-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-1631, Lloyd Bentsen v. The Coors Brewing Company."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,13.308,16.01,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,68.244,69.16,Mr. Kneedler--
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,69.16,71.196,Yes.
1994.93-1631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,71.196,77.6,--there is both an advertising ban and a labeling ban--
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,77.6,78.016,Yes.
1994.93-1631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,78.016,78.816,--for malt beverages?
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,78.816,80.218,Yes.
1994.93-1631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,80.218,89.657,"But as I understand it, the advertising ban applies only in States that have imposed similar restrictions."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,89.657,90.373,That's correct.
1994.93-1631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,90.373,96.811,But the labeling ban applies unless States affirmatively require disclosure.
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,96.811,97.763,That's correct.
1994.93-1631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.004,135.286,"Well, that leads to a very curious result, because in a majority of States, then, it seems to me that the statute would leave the brewers free to advertise alcohol content on malt beverages but not to place that information on the labels, and that just seems a very odd scheme to me."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,135.286,135.702,"Well, I--"
1994.93-1631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,135.702,136.388,Am I correct?
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,136.388,155.95,"--There can be that difference in those States, but first of all, I... Congress could reasonably conclude that having the alcohol content on the bottle, on the very product that is the subject of the commercial transaction, would enable... facilitate impulse buying at the point of sale, so at the very time the consumer is going to buy--"
1994.93-1631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.95,169.026,"Well, I thought the defense was something about encouraging price wars, or something, and I would have thought that advertising it would be much more likely to result in the problem--"
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,169.026,169.393,--Right.
1994.93-1631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.393,174.679,--that the Government is concerned about than would putting a truthful piece of information on a label.
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,174.679,201.664,"Well, thus far, although I think the materials suggest that we're beginning to see some movement into traditional advertising, that has not been a problem, and perhaps because advertising is often at a national level, particularly media advertising, so that advertising, if it's not lawful everywhere, for instance, in network TV, that it wouldn't be placed because it wouldn't be lawful in a number of States into which it would go."
1994.93-1631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.901,214.054,But it certainly weakens the Government's position with regard to the justification for the labeling ban.
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,214.054,249.894,"No, I think it... first of all, the point you're raising I think would only go to the application, in any event, to the labeling ban in those States that allow advertising but don't require the labeling, and thus far in this case respondent has not challenged the application of the labeling requirement on a State-by-State basis in that manner, and again, the substantial governmental interest here includes the interest in accommodating State regulations, so the labeling restriction applies unless a State strikes a different balance."
1994.93-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,307.33,314.067,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, am I right in thinking that the advertising ban is not being challenged here?"
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,314.067,314.9,That is correct.
1994.93-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,366.249,369.201,"Of course, labeling isn't always for promotive purposes."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,375.938,381.342,"--That is one type of labeling, but that is not the sort of labeling that respondent is promoting here."
1994.93-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,382.142,382.709,"Well, they say it is."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,386.996,395.769,"--Well, with all respect, it seems quite clear from the record in this case that respondent's very purpose in challenging the labeling restriction was--"
1994.93-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,395.769,397.402,"Mr. Kneedler, are we to look at the purpose?"
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,413.896,414.23,--No.
1994.93-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.552,462.227,"Is it common sense to allow that to be put on billboards but not on the label, and is it common sense not to allow the percentage to be shown, but to allow it to be called on the label and in advertising malt liquor, or I suppose supermalt liquor?"
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,462.227,474.035,"--With respect to malt liquor, in particular, last... in the spring of 1993, ATF solicited public comments on precisely the use of malt liquor."
1994.93-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.4,501.268,Had it changed its meaning by the early sixties?
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,505.304,515.628,"--Apparently... apparently ATF does not have an explanation in its records for why they were approved, but this is now being considered."
1994.93-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.371,558.439,"--Well, one step at a time is a fine thing when you're not in the First Amendment area, but it seems to me we demand a higher level of rationality when you're prohibiting the conveying of information, and I think it is, it seems to me, quite irrational to allow the notion that this beverage contains a higher than ordinary alcoholic content to be conveyed in all other ways but not by saying it has 4 percent alcohol."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,558.439,567.045,"To reiterate, Justice Scalia, that rationale would apply only in those particular States where advertising was permitted and the labeling restriction applied."
1994.93-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.614,574.014,"Oh, I disagree."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,575.9,597.896,"--Oh, I'm sorry, but with respect to malt liquor, well, that... that was not the basis of the district court, or court of appeals judgment in this case, and I think there is a question whether, I suppose a legislative judgment for ATF to make in the first instance whether malt liquor in fact conveys that sense."
1994.93-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,597.896,601.598,Is it true that ATF itself is giving out the alcohol content?
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,608.418,620.476,"Yes, one of the ATF witnesses at trial said that, but again, that I think furthers... highlights that this is not a blanket prohibition on any public utterance or information about alcohol content."
1994.93-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,620.476,633.32,"--But if the Government is giving out the information for the asking, what sense does it make to prohibit that information on the label so that the consumer will be saved a telephone call?"
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,633.32,660.387,"Well, what it is, Justice Ginsburg, is the difference between making information available for consumers who want to look to that information if they should want to compare on the basis of selecting on the basis of low alcohol content, for example, on the one hand, and on the other hand making, not allowing brewers and others to use precisely the alcohol content of the beverage for purposes of promoting it, and this--"
1994.93-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,660.387,676.747,"It seems to me, Mr. Kneedler, that if you were to prevail in this case and one of us was assigned the majority opinion, we'd begin by saying, the Government has a legitimate interest in ensuring that consumers are not fully informed, and then after that the opinion would get rather difficult, it seems to me."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,677.313,701.011,"--Well, with all respect, Justice Kennedy, in 1935, when Congress looked at this precise question, and in fact before that in 1934, when the Federal Alcohol Control Administration looked at this question, there was virtually unanimous agreement among the brewing industry itself that competition on the basis of alcohol content specifically including the labeling was--"
1994.93-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,701.011,704.546,"Well, there probably was unanimous agreement that all competition was undesirable, too, in that time."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,704.546,704.963,"--Well, but... but--"
1994.93-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,705.663,708.498,That was a pretty rigid industry in 1933.
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,708.498,710.95,"Well, but first of all in the--"
1994.93-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,710.95,715.086,"One of the classic examples, the antitrust enforcement throughout this industry, at that period."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,715.086,733.297,"--Well, but the Twenty-First Amendment, which had just been adopted, recognizes that there can often be a very substantial governmental interest in not promoting competition on the basis of, in particular, alcohol--"
1994.93-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,733.297,741.986,"On the basis of alcohol content for this rather limited product, but what about everything else, like wine, and whiskey, and other alcoholic beverages?"
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,743.855,747.54,"--Well, the problem that Congress had before it in 1934--"
1994.93-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.54,748.909,As the industry presented it.
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,748.909,764.834,--was one specifically related to malt beverage and the behavior of brewers in the malt beverage industry that in fact had promoted beer as an intoxicant rather than as a beverage or as a food type beverage.
1994.93-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,783.23,795.204,"But Mr. Kneedler, one thing we know about Posadas is fairly recent, so the legislature could have taken into account that commercial advertising is subject to a First Amendment check."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,805.245,805.745,--I--
1994.93-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,805.745,811.499,--so that wasn't the attitude to this kind of legislation more or less anything goes?
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,811.499,814.101,"--Well, I think the point you're making in fact cuts the other way."
1994.93-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,839.4,856.576,"There was once a case in this Court of a statute that regulated the sale of, in fact, a malt beverage, and the law was defended... this was the law that said boys couldn't buy 3.2 beer until they are 21, girls could at 18."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,856.576,857.112,Right.
1994.93-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,857.112,862.313,"The defense was, boys drive more, drink more, commit more alcohol-related offenses."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,884.345,900.688,"I... our submission is not that the First Amendment is inapplicable in this context, and in the case you're speaking of, that was a situation where the State was operating in an area where class-based stereotypes were simply not... were not permissible."
1994.93-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,952.303,954.338,Even though you don't have a nude dancer.
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,954.921,967.498,"--But what we do have is, we think, something even more compelling, and that is that this Court has recognized that commercial speech is subject to regulation precisely because it is closely related to commercial transactions."
1994.93-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,967.498,992.363,"Mr. Kneedler, what do we do if we have a case in which Congress has a legitimate and sustainable interest in restricting commercial speech when it passes a statute, but then because of the passage of time and changes in marketing and changes in consumer habits, that interest is quite evidently, let's assume, no longer legitimate, no longer compelling?"
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1001.219,1032.154,"Oh, I think the statute carries with it a strong presumption that the circumstances that gave rise to it continue to obtain, and I do... and I think it's important that what is being alleged here are changes in the market, or changes in consumer preferences, which are themselves subject to change and, in fact, one thing that respondent doesn't acknowledge is that the very consumer preferences that respondent is suggesting are happening... a push toward low alcohol beer... are undoubtedly influenced in large part by the very restrictions that respondent is challenging in this case."
1994.93-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1032.154,1041.675,So you cast it something in terms of a presumption and indicate that perhaps consumer tastes being fickle would change in the near future and this statute would again--
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1041.675,1061.22,"Yes, but I also think that what... where the governmental regulation is directed to market influences, that the fact that the market might change doesn't alter the fact that there is an inherent possibility that a certain type of advertising will promote the conduct, and so--"
1994.93-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.22,1075.23,"--Mr. Kneedler, what evidence does the Government have, what hard evidence, that there will be a war of brewers fighting to put in more expensive alcohol into their beer when this... what hard evidence is there?"
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1075.23,1075.58,--Well--
1994.93-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.58,1087.038,"I have friends who consume hard whiskey, and they tell me that the alcoholic content of that has gone down over the years, to their great disappointment, from 90--"
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1092.359,1109.986,"--Well, first of all, even if some segments of the market, on average, the alcohol content is going down, that doesn't mean that the governmental purpose here is not directly advanced as to those portions of the market where there would be promotion on the basis of high content."
1994.93-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1109.986,1115.474,"If there's any evidence that there would be a price... that there would be a, you know, an alcoholic content war."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1115.474,1116.524,"Well, there is... there is--"
1994.93-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1116.524,1117.44,What evidence is there such a thing would happen?
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1117.44,1118.857,--Several things I would point to.
1994.93-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.825,1185.001,"Mr. Kneedler, supposing that the market is consumed of a variety of consumers, some of whom want to get drunk as fast as they can, and they're the people you're concerned about, and others of whom would like to be careful and moderate in their drinking and be able to drive without violating the statutes and so forth."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1206.629,1207.581,"For the most part, yes."
1994.93-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1244.27,1258.764,"Is there any other example in all of food and drug labeling law where knowledge is prohibited, knowledge of the content of what one is ingesting is prohibited on the label?"
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1258.764,1269.987,"Well, I suppose in this sense, that if the Food & Drug Administration prescribes a certain list of ingredients that shall be on there and nothing else--"
1994.93-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1269.987,1270.987,Is there a law?
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1281.962,1310.898,"--Not that I'm aware of, but again, going back to Justice Stevens' point, it really is a question of striking a balance, and what this statute does, for example, is to allow the States in the exercise of their Twenty-First Amendment power to strike a different balance and perhaps conclude that the interest in disclosure outweighs the concerns about promoting the product for the purposes of getting intoxicated, and in... on page 16a of--"
1994.93-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.898,1319.552,"But supposing the market is equally divided between the two kinds of people I described, does the First Amendment require us to give preference to one interest rather than the other?"
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1319.552,1320.37,--I don't believe so.
1994.93-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1321.787,1325.739,The First Amendment is neutral on whether there should be disclosure and public knowledge of important information.
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1325.739,1328.357,--I think as long as the legislature could reasonably conclude--
1994.93-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1328.357,1333.142,That half the people would benefit from a paternalistic denial of information--
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1333.142,1340.748,"--Well, half the people might benefit, but the risks associated with the other half getting the information might be far worse."
1994.93-1631,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1360.542,1371.35,"--Mr. Kneedler, what test or standard do you suggest that we apply in testing this ban on commercial speech?"
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1379.29,1383.758,We think the statute satisfies the Central Hudson test for the reasons I've explained.
1994.93-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1419.598,1431.304,"The Government can look over the vast range of activities that are lawful, that are not wicked enough to be made unlawful, and say, well, some of them are questionable enough that we don't want the people to have information about them."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1438.241,1439.574,"--No, we think that--"
1994.93-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1439.574,1442.176,Perhaps even how many horsepower the engine has.
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1442.176,1442.978,--We think the--
1994.93-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.978,1444.045,People tend to drive too fast.
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1444.045,1456.102,"--We think the activities identified in Posadas are ones in which there is a tradition in history of... of considerable social ill, of governmental concern, and a history of stringent regulation."
1994.93-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.102,1461.089,That's not so with driving automobiles?
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1461.089,1461.572,It may--
1994.93-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1461.572,1465.141,It's hard to think of what's more heavily regulated than that.
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1465.141,1479.068,"--But the... I suppose one could identify the categories associated with morality or vice, but in this case it's not even necessary to identify what the category might be in the abstract on the basis of Posadas."
1994.93-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1479.934,1485.122,"But even in Posadas, with gambling, that was advertising that was justified, not refusal of labeling."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1493.143,1500.964,"--But in this Court's decision in Kordel it recognized that labeling is a form of advertising, but what I--"
1994.93-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.964,1505.099,You think anything that you can prohibit in terms of advertising you can also prohibit in labeling.
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1505.566,1520.192,"--At least with respect to alcohol, and we think in this case there's no need to consider what the parameters of the Posadas category might be, because the Twenty-First Amendment embodies in the Constitution itself the compelling governmental interest in regulating that category of commercial activity."
1994.93-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1520.192,1524.996,"But the Twenty-First Amendment, Mr. Kneedler, conferred authority on the States, not on the Federal Government."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1524.996,1536.637,"Yes, but this statute among other things advances the State interest because States... a number of States, in fact almost every State, either by operation of this statute or their own statutes, have a restriction on labeling."
1994.93-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1547.926,1555.515,"Do you think that if we rule in favor of Coors that the State statutes would necessarily be invalid too, State antilabeling?"
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1555.515,1566.038,"It would at least call them into question, and it doesn't seem to us that the governmental interest in this should necessarily depend upon a State-by-State examination of the interest."
1994.93-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1566.038,1570.609,"Well, then it would seem to me to follow from that that the State statutes would be invalid as well."
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1570.609,1579.73,"Well, I think the States should not be precluded from demonstrating what their interests are and what information has been... has been gathered, and on what basis they acted."
1994.93-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1579.73,1585.701,What interests would the States have that you have not been able to identify and adduce in your brief?
1994.93-1631,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1585.701,1594.574,"Well, if the Court were to conclude, contrary to our submission, that there had to be broader factual findings, we wouldn't think that the States should be foreclosed from doing that."
1994.93-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1608.032,1609.434,"Very well, Mr. Kneedler."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1619.423,1622.292,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.692,1680.627,"Well, Mr. Ennis, how do we treat that here?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1694.387,1714.884,"Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, even if it were clear that Congress thought there would be strength wars, and I'll return to that in a moment, because there's no reason to think Congress did, it's still the requirement under the Central Hudson test for the Court to determine, based on the evidence, whether the means chosen by Congress would actually advance, directly and materially, that goal."
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.923,1728.442,And no deference is given to the congressional determination that it was?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1728.442,1749.723,"Your Honor, there could be some degree of deference to congressional findings that there would be strength wars, but in this case there were no congressional findings whatsoever, and if you look at the legislative history of the act, and even the legislative history of the precursor FACA regulations, you will find no reason to believe that Congress was the least bit concerned with strength wars."
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.723,1763.614,"I'm sorry, you think a statute survives judicial attack if Congress makes findings which it would not survive if Congress didn't, so we're telling Congress to legislate in a certain fashion?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1763.614,1765.066,"No, no, not at all, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1765.066,1770.101,Don't we assume that the necessary findings sustain any congressional statute?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1771.737,1773.103,"No, Justice Scalia, it's not."
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.063,1789.365,This would be valid if there were findings of fact--
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1789.365,1789.665,--No.
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.665,1792.716,--but since Congress did not make findings of fact it's invalid?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1792.716,1793.133,No.
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.706,1807.06,"But otherwise a statute could be valid, could be invalid, we don't assume that the findings were there?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1807.06,1808.626,--You simply apply the Central Hudson test.
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1811.412,1812.13,That's not my understanding.
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1826.557,1843.316,"That's why statutes are subjected to judicial review under the Central Hudson test, and on applying the Central Hudson test, the Court found there was no evidence... no evidence that in fact accurate disclosure of alcohol content on beer labels would result in strength wars."
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1855.993,1865.015,That's the sort of finding just as if two lower courts had made a finding in a diversity accident case that the stop light was green rather than red?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1865.015,1868.051,"Your Honor, essentially the answer to that question is yes."
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.524,1887.262,Is this truly a finding of fact when you're challenging what is thought to be a legislative premise?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1887.262,1888.897,"--It is truly a finding of fact, Your Honor."
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1897.653,1899.22,As of 1934?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1899.22,1901.47,"--As of the present time, Your Honor."
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1901.47,1906.224,"Well, how could that contradict a congressional determination as of 1934?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1906.224,1908.742,There was no congressional determination in 1934.
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1908.742,1911.944,"Well, how could it contradict a congressional presumption?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1911.944,1914.896,There was no congressional presumption in 1934.
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1915.296,1919.966,"What if... just to isolate this particular issue, what if there had been?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1939.695,1941.147,"--Yes, absolutely, Your Honor, it could."
1994.93-1631,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1996.883,2005.822,"So Mr. Ennis, you are conceding that in 1934, '35, there was a legitimate documented purpose for this statute."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2010.957,2019.713,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, we do concede that, but the Government conceded in this case that the information at issue in this case is accurate."
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.995,2045.964,"Mr. Ennis, surely there are different classes of consumers of liquor, wine, and beer."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2063.389,2068.194,"Well, Your Honor, first of all, hopefully the high school students wouldn't be drinking anything."
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.579,2077.05,"But that happens, and that is the kind of thing that the law may well be concerned with."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2077.05,2087.322,"There was actually evidence in this case, Your Honor, and the agency itself agrees, that there is a substantial market overlap in the markets for beer, wine, and spirits."
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2121.162,2123.613,Are you reading from somewhere that we can look at?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2123.613,2124.03,--Yes.
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2128.851,2131.467,"Is that somewhere in the briefs, or--"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2135.255,2142.992,"The House report states, quote, malt beverages... malt beverages should not be sold on the basis of alcohol content because"
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.851,2189.203,"--Well, he may not have meant that."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2193.255,2195.357,"He surely meant that, Your Honor, because--"
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2195.357,2197.657,Was it... do we know how many people were there when he said that?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2200.342,2212.818,"--We don't even need to know how many people were there when he said that, Your Honor, because the House report itself, and the Senate report itself, say that the purpose of the bill is to prevent fraud and deception."
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2233.296,2251.693,"When, between 1934 and the present, did it become possible to measure the alcoholic content of beer, because I remember in the service, all you could buy in PX's was something called 3.2 beer, so apparently by 1943 they at least thought they had learned to measure the content of beer."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2251.693,2253.276,"Well, that's a good question, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1994.93-1631,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2263.982,2274.44,"I take it the Government could defend its statute on the grounds that even though there was no legitimate purpose at the time of its enactment, a legitimate purpose has arisen since."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2274.44,2287.348,"Well, that's correct, Justice Kennedy, and the Government has attempted to do that by asserting in the lower courts the strength wars interest, and now asserting in this Court the Twenty-First Amendment interest, and let me turn to those."
1994.93-1631,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2294.936,2308.827,"But you concede that at least as an interest on the first prong, or, I guess, the second prong, Central Hudson, that's a perfectly legitimate interest for the Government to have, so your attack here goes simply to whether it furthers, and whether it fits?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2308.827,2321.671,"Your Honor, I do not dispute for purposes of this case that the Government could have a legitimate interest in deterring strength wars if that means deterring people from continually increasing the alcoholic content of their benefits."
1994.93-1631,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2322.421,2329.491,"But the way you pose your... put your answer, I assume you are implicitly claiming that the Government doesn't really entertain that interest."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2329.491,2333.193,"--I think it clearly doesn't really entertain that interest, because if it did--"
1994.93-1631,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2333.193,2345.333,"Well, why don't we take the Government's statement, the statement of the Government's lawyer, as representing the Government's position on its interest and then see whether in fact there is a furtherance and there is a fit?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2345.333,2358.574,"--Well, the reason we don't, Your Honor, is that structurally, if that were the Government's interest, why would Congress not have prevented disclosure of alcohol content on wines and spirits, which are much higher content?"
1994.93-1631,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2360.843,2367.764,"Well, maybe the Government doesn't have a good argument in support of its interest in the sense that it should have had an interest in doing more than it did."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2367.764,2369.516,"--Oh, I understand your question now, Justice Souter."
1994.93-1631,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2384.058,2401.087,"Oh, agreed, but your answer to Justice Kennedy, I thought, was that in fact the Government interest could change over time, and I thought it was implicit in what you said that the Government doesn't have to reenact the statute for the purpose of manifesting a new interest that could legitimately be considered under Central Hudson."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2401.087,2401.687,I agree with that--
1994.93-1631,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2401.687,2402.07,Okay.
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2402.07,2402.62,--Justice Souter.
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.863,2423.147,Isn't that a strange determination for judges to make?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2442.478,2457.238,"Your Honor, I think that's what district judges are required to do under the Central Hudson test, and appropriately so, because we're talking about a ban on speech which is concededly truthful, accurate, not misleading, and important to consumers."
1994.93-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2529.917,2531.219,Can I go back for a second?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2601.363,2603.215,"Well, Justice Breyer, you've asked two questions."
1994.93-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.215,2604.948,Probably about four.
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2604.948,2610.552,"First, the Government has described the first question you asked basically as its border-crossing argument."
1994.93-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2632.817,2634.817,"All right, so that I'm thinking of those 11."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2654.731,2655.098,Your Honor--
1994.93-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2655.098,2657.933,Because there certainly is strong language supporting that.
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2679.613,2684.315,"--Justice Breyer, we have not challenged the interpretation of the statute."
1994.93-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2684.315,2684.715,I know.
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2690.633,2691.152,We... we--
1994.93-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2691.152,2696.387,"--and that's why I'm uncertain, as a technical matter, what one is supposed to do in this case--"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2696.387,2696.637,--We--
1994.93-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2696.637,2698.889,--if... with that kind of an argument.
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2699.739,2715.767,"--We do agree, however, with Your Honor, and we said in our brief, that in our view the proper interpretation of the statute is that both the labeling ban and the advertising ban only apply in States that themselves independently prohibit labeling or prohibit advertising."
1994.93-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2727.158,2727.542,Why?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2727.542,2741.752,"Because if the State wanted to prohibit accurate, truthful information on beer labels for the same strength war objective, then on the record in this case, because it would not advance that objective whatsoever, that would violate the First Amendment."
1994.93-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2741.752,2763.098,"Or they have much more power, I take it, a State, under the Twenty-First Amendment, or some more power than if that Twenty-First Amendment weren't there, and suppose that we thought, or I thought, suppose I thought that it just squeaks within that, therefore a State can ban this, then what happens?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2763.098,2772.537,"Well first, Justice Breyer, as Chief Justice Rehnquist noted in one of his questions, this is a Federal law, and the Twenty-First Amendment gives no affirmative power whatsoever."
1994.93-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2772.537,2773.504,But does it not give power?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2787.297,2787.731,Let me turn--
1994.93-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2787.731,2789.148,--to make that State ban effective?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2789.148,2789.682,--Let me turn to that.
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2857.127,2857.51,Well--
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2857.51,2861.679,--and there's no reason why it should lower the standard of review under the Free Speech Clause of the same First Amendment.
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2861.679,2868.934,"--Well, Mr. Ennis, perhaps conceding that, could a State simply ban liquor advertising?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2868.934,2874.254,"Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, that raises a much more difficult and quite different question."
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2894.133,2901.22,"But I think you should respond to hypothetical questions, even though they're not necessarily involved in your case."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2901.22,2901.82,--I'm happy to do that.
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2934.159,2936.595,"Well, my question was not what you're answering."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2938.378,2938.745,I'm sorry.
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2938.745,2945.701,"My question was, could a State ban liquor advertising, ban all advertising for alcoholic beverages?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2945.701,2947.801,"I don't know the answer to that question, Your Honor."
1994.93-1631,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2999.419,3025.569,"If a State wanted to encourage drinking wine instead of, say, distilled spirits, could it say, we have a flat advertising ban on distilled spirits, but we'll allow you, indeed encourage you, to advertise wine so as to get the consumers to shift their preferences?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3025.569,3029.521,"Your Honor, that's a question that I haven't, frankly, thought about, and I don't know the answer to."
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3108.223,3109.489,What is ale?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3111.405,3117.309,"Well, to the best of my knowledge, Justice Scalia, ale is a malt beverage, but it is produced quite differently from beer."
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3123.547,3124.415,"Ah, that explains it."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3126.265,3132.568,"Well, I guess it's something... I guess... I'm not sure, but I think it's something like milk in the old days before it was homogenized."
1994.93-1631,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3137.389,3139.155,"Which is malt liquor, top or bottom?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3139.155,3140.022,Pardon?
1994.93-1631,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3140.022,3141.524,Is malt liquor top or bottom?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3141.524,3145.209,"Well, malt liquor is the highest strength--"
1994.93-1631,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3145.209,3146.345,"I know it's the highest strength, but--"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3146.345,3146.878,--malt beverage.
1994.93-1631,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3146.878,3153.332,"--Is that the only difference between it and... ale and beer, that it's got more alcohol in it?"
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3153.332,3153.665,No.
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3210.901,3215.055,"Well, light beer doesn't mean... has nothing to do with alcoholic content."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3215.055,3219.591,"It does have a great deal to do with alcohol content, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3232.534,3234.803,So your typical light beer will have less alcohol content?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3234.803,3237.253,Your typical light beer will have less alcohol content.
1994.93-1631,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3242.839,3255.097,But is it a fact that in the Tenth Circuit argument Coors disclosed that its reason for this litigation was to dispel the notion that Coors is a weak beer?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3255.097,3256.43,--Your Honor--
1994.93-1631,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3256.43,3258.049,Was that part of the argument?
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3258.049,3262.001,"--I was not there, but that's apparently what the transcript reflects, Your Honor."
1994.93-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3296.924,3301.642,"4.1 is the low end of beers, but not the low end of lights, I gather."
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3301.642,3306.446,"--I think it's probably about in the middle of lights, Your Honor."
1994.93-1631,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3306.446,3308.612,But we can't know any of this by looking at the label.
1994.93-1631,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3310.331,3311.164,You can't.
1994.93-1631,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3359.245,3360.597,"Thank you, Mr. Ennis."

1994.93-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3387.497,3388.413,The highest light?
1994.93-1631,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3388.413,3405.359,"--Well, the advertisement it asked ATF to include lists both lights, on page 65 lists both light beers and full-bodied beers, and it lists itself as one of the highest content light beers, and also within the mid-to-high range of the regular beer."
1994.93-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3414.798,3422.285,The purpose served... the purpose served by this labeling reg in those 33 States that allow you to advertise is?
1994.93-1631,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3422.285,3427.105,--The purpose is to prohibit... it's a balance of the interest in labeling.
1994.93-1631,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3452.554,3471.967,"In this evidence of wars, was there anything about substitution of consumers who are looking for higher alcohol content to wine, to something with... or to the bitterer beverage, the malt liquor?"
1994.93-1631,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3471.967,3481.757,"--It was a discussion primarily within the malt beverage industry, because that's where the abuse was, and it was identified as an abuse, and I call the Court's attention to the House report on page 16-A."
1994.93-1631,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3481.757,3484.025,Couldn't this regulation make it worse?
