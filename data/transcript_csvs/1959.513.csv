1959.513,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,393.624,394.719,Gross -- gross --
1959.513,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,394.719,395.485,Gross receipt.
1959.513,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,395.485,396.861,Gross receipt.
1959.513,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,396.861,403.397,"Yes, Your Honor, yield an allowance of a little over $4 per ton."
1959.513,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,426.296,428.042,That was just raw material.
1959.513,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,428.042,430.569,The raw clay and shale.
1959.513,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,467.132,469.038,You mean under the free enterprise system?
1959.513,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,469.038,471.757,"Yes, sir.[Laughs]"
1959.513,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4046.376,4050.18,May it please the Court.
1959.513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4557.307,4560.79,That just shows my ignorance.
1959.513,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4560.79,4565.918,Then we come to Section 114 (b).
1959.513,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4707.652,4708.722,Where is it?
1959.513,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4710.476,4711.825,There is no finding on that.
1959.513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4771.682,4778.362,May I ask in the -- are the integrated brick manufacturers using this process?
1959.513,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4778.362,4780.526,"Yes, this is -- these are the same processes."
1959.513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4782.509,4787.438,"And it's something the integrated fellow who, I take this on the end product basis."
1959.513,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4787.438,4796.409,The -- all the cases have decided so far that everyone who makes brick may take depletion based on the value of the brick produced.
1959.513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4796.409,4798.433,Even the fellow who buys the raw material (Voice Overlap) --
1959.513,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4798.433,4803.429,There seem to be few or none who buy the raw material in the case of brick.
1959.513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4805.569,4811.244,But even -- are they -- permitted it on the -- a depletion based on brick if they buy the minerals --
1959.513,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4811.244,4818.789,"As far as I know, there -- I know of none who buy raw materials to make brick."
1959.513,2,28250,howard_p_travis,,4818.789,4820.085,72 and 73.
1959.513,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4820.085,4822.567,"Yes, this is on page 72 and 73."
1959.513,4,28250,howard_p_travis,,4823.929,4824.467,74.
1959.513,5,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4824.467,4826.406,-- so clumsy in finding it.
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8533.868,8542.542,Mr. Chief Justice.
1959.513,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8561.722,8568.694,"Well, tell me, Mr. Spritzer, is it the fact that the brick manufacturer gets his allowance based on --"
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8568.694,8592.573,"The brick and tile manufacturers has been held in cases in which the Government sought certiorari, that they may take depletion on brick on an expressed determination that the Government could not show and had not shown that brick and tile clay was --"
1959.513,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8592.573,8592.741,This is Merry Brother.
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8592.741,8595.458,-- sufficiently valuable to be sold.
1959.513,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8595.458,8596.157,Is that the Merry Brothers?
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8596.157,8597.213,That is the Merry Brothers line of case.
1959.513,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8597.213,8599.494,Has the Commissioner acquiesced in those?
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8599.494,8602.784,We petitioned for certiorari after we lost them.
1959.513,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,8609.98,8610.242,Did you mean that --
1959.513,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8610.242,8611.487,Did you -- did you -- excuse me.
1959.513,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,8611.487,8611.723,All right.
1959.513,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8611.723,8620.028,Did you assume that denial of a certiorari meant nothing or not?[Laughter]
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8620.028,8637.82,"That misfortune had been compounded by the fact that we'd lost it in several Circuits, Your Honor, and the -- the Commissioner did not feel that he would continue to attempt to apply it in some of the Circuits whereas the way was already barred in others."
1959.513,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,8637.82,8642.965,"What I want to know if whether it was assumed that it was determined, you said it was determined."
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8649.683,8652.084,It was assumed on the pleadings.
1959.513,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,8652.084,8653.458,"No, but -- but -- well --"
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8653.458,8653.639,That it was not --
1959.513,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,8653.639,8654.703,"Therefore, you --"
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8654.703,8658.246,-- marketable in the sense that there was any proof of actual sale.
1959.513,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,8658.246,8665.864,But you weren't foreclosed by the pleadings to start a case in which you could prove the fact for you in some other case.
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8665.864,8673.897,We were -- we concluded in that the lawyers who handled that litigation concluded that they could not show sales of brick clay.
1959.513,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8758.696,8759.216,"Well, what's --"
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8759.216,8759.286,-- in that --
1959.513,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,8759.286,8759.805,-- in Brazil?
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8759.805,8760.913,-- is already sold.
1959.513,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,8760.913,8773.225,"You have it in Brazil but are the Bureau of Mines' figures in this case as to this product, as to this mine, as to this mineral too, were dependable?"
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8773.225,8778.887,The Bureau of Mines' figures show that it's sold in substantial quantities on a national scale.
1959.513,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,8778.887,8786.117,"But was it substantial in volume or in percentage of the industry, what is the prevailing things?"
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8786.117,8789.378,We have the figures fully set out and it is --
1959.513,6,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,8789.378,8789.529,(Voice Overlap) --
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8789.529,8798.729,"-- certainly substantial, very substantial in volume though it would be less than half as I recall the figures for the -- of the total production."
1959.513,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8804.293,8809.374,But what's the dollar price to which you would apply the allowance in this case?
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8809.374,8816.698,"This has always been taken care of in regulations, Your Honor, and I have to go through several steps."
1959.513,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8820.515,8821.226,I'm thinking of this case.
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8821.226,8822.871,-- as to the integrated producer.
1959.513,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8822.871,8823.811,Of this case?
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8823.811,8825.515,Yes.
1959.513,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8836.155,8837.282,"Well, I gather, the record is (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8837.282,8839.693,But they don't sell.
1959.513,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8943.806,8944.19,(Inaudible)
1959.513,6,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,8944.19,8949.846,-- then you'd apply the statutory percentage and you'd get 44 cents.
