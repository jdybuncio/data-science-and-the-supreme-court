1985.85-225,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.908,"Mr. Kneedler, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,12.908,16.093,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,137.369,153.147,"Mr. Kneedler, do you think that constitutional challenges to the application of the Secretary's guidelines concerning Part B can be challenged in court?"
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,153.147,160.151,"Well, as we pointed out in our brief, of course we think that issue is not presented here because the particular--"
1985.85-225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.151,162.753,"Well, they've certainly made a constitutional claim."
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,162.753,176.41,"--They have made a constitutional claim, but it is our submission, for the reasons we have stated in the brief, that it is so insubstantial as not to vest the Court with subject matter jurisdiction under the rationale that the Court disposed of the constitutional claim in Ringer itself."
1985.85-225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.215,216.137,"Well, it did... it did appear to me, anyway, that the plaintiffs below made three different kinds of challenges."
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,253.513,254.945,"--Well, yes."
1985.85-225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.73,266.567,"What about an allegation, that the regulations of the Secretary simply don't conform to the statute?"
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,266.567,270.805,"On that question, we think the judicial review is plainly foreclosed."
1985.85-225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,280.41,285.464,The language in Erika doesn't make too clear that that was intended.
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,285.464,312.282,"--But the Court of Claims decision in Erika, however, at pages 590 to 591 of 634 F. 2d do discuss the carrier's challenge to the intermediary letter upon which the carrier relied and also several additional letters implementing that, and the Court of Claims did review the carrier's... the question of the carrier's reliance on those letters and held that they were not a valid basis for the carrier to deny claims."
1985.85-225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,312.282,327.391,"Well, why would a challenge to the regulation as not meeting the statutory requirement be a burden to the Court such as review of the typical Part B benefit claim?"
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,327.391,339.615,"Well, the typical Part B benefit claim might well often include a challenge to a regulation or instruction or legal principles upon which the carrier relied, and it would not be difficult for a claimant to allege that."
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,471.685,477.089,What if the Secretary promulgated a regulation abolishing carrier review entirely?
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,481.474,491.349,"Well, I guess at some point the Secretary's actions would be so far removed from the administration of the program and--"
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,491.349,494.801,Do you think that would be reviewable?
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,494.801,505.59,"--I would hesitate to give definitive answer, but I would think it might well be because for one thing it doesn't really concern the amount of benefits or--"
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,505.59,513.263,"Well, let's say he just abolished carrier reviews for certain kinds of injuries, broken legs or something, no carrier review in certain kinds of injuries."
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,514.163,525.57,"--Well, it may well be, but because the Secretary would not be giving directions on how to adjudicate particular claims--"
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,525.57,527.272,"The argument would be, he's not complying with the statute?"
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,527.272,530.324,"--No, it would be beyond that."
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,537.794,540.596,But the particular claimant wouldn't get his broken leg paid for.
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,545.15,553.922,"It will effect the claim, but what we have here is something that goes directly to the amount of benefits which is at the core of what Congress has precluded."
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,575.253,583.609,"In other words, the scope of your position is that whatever is authorized under A is necessarily forbidden under B, but something that's forbidden under both, you could review under B?"
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,583.609,589.428,"Well, that is essentially our position."
1985.85-225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,631.505,636.825,"Mr. Kneedler, Erika said it didn't rely on 405-H."
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,636.825,638.442,That's correct.
1985.85-225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,638.442,650.733,Does that mean it's open to us to hold that 405-H just precludes review of claims for which review is available under 405-G?
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,650.733,652.084,"No, I think not."
1985.85-225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,726.382,739.19,"Mr. Kneedler, in Ringer it seemed to me the claimants could obtain judicial review as provided under 405-G, and that just isn't the case here so I suppose we haven't technically answered that."
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,739.19,758.936,"Well, the one claimant had not filed a claim and therefore was not within the judicial review... the administrative review process that would culminate in Section 405-G, and he was saying that because 405-G was not available, that federal question jurisdiction should be available."
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.936,760.503,"Well, he hadn't, had the operation, either."
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,760.503,763.738,"He hadn't had the operation, but that was simply--"
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,763.738,767.375,"All he had to do was get the operation, file a claim, and he would have review."
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,770.058,788.621,"--Well, that's right, but the Court made the point that a court cannot essentially issue a declaratory judgment under the 1331 jurisdiction to expound on a legal issue arising under the Medicare program."
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.391,819.858,--Excuse me.
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,823.712,825.278,--Before the carrier.
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.278,827.414,--But how can these doctors assert that claim?
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,827.414,844.375,"A doctor can assert a claim before the carrier if he accepts assignment from the Part B beneficiary, The doctor's rights are then entirely derivative of those of the patient and he can submit a Part B claim to the carrier."
1985.85-225,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,844.375,851.945,"Mr. Kneedler, will you clarify for me why the difference between Part A and Part B review is so significant?"
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,856.599,857.916,It does.
1985.85-225,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,857.916,864.872,"Judicial review, and my understanding is, Part A provides for reimbursement of hospitals."
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,864.872,865.855,That's correct.
1985.85-225,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,865.855,867.99,Why the difference?
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,867.99,876.762,"Well, it was Congress's judgment in enacting the Medicare program that Part A was typically going to involve much greater amounts of money in a typical claim."
1985.85-225,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,876.762,878.962,Part B would involve greater amounts of money?
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,878.962,879.479,"No, Part A."
1985.85-225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,945.222,954.327,Do you think it's open for the Secretary to provide by regulation for administrative review of claims like this under Part B?
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,954.327,959.314,It may well be.
1985.85-225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,972.806,988.049,What is the mechanism in place now to review a carrier's development of guidelines or rules to govern how physicians' services are going to be compensated?
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,988.049,989.918,There are several.
1985.85-225,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1110.594,1113.045,But the question here is so basic.
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1133.626,1145.517,"Well, what the statute says is that the reasonable charge cannot exceed 75 percent of the customary charges for similar services."
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1352.347,1359.267,"May I just ask, Erika was a suit for monetary judgment though, was it not?"
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1359.267,1360.619,It was brought in the Court of claims.
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1360.619,1364.321,Whereas this is a suit for an injunction against enforcement of regulation?
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1364.321,1367.04,"That's correct, but the--"
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1367.04,1370.724,"The Court of Claims could not have granted injunctive relief, could it?"
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1370.724,1376.212,"--It could not have, although in a sense it granted the equivalent by a remand to the carrier."
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1392.674,1397.226,"Well, but they might conceivably be reformulated without their getting any more money."
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1399.661,1412.219,"Well, that would be unlikely to happen because if there appears to be on average... the nonspecialists are reimbursed at a lower level, so if they're put in one screen presumably--"
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1412.219,1413.92,"Well, presumably but not necessarily?"
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1413.92,1415.57,--In individual cases it--
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1415.57,1422.693,"It would be possible, would it not, to grant all the relief that they're entitled to, claiming this uniformity principle, without giving them any money?"
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1422.693,1430.613,"--Well, this lawsuit wouldn't give them money, but the consequence of the judgment would in most cases, particularly--"
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.613,1432.549,"Not if you reduced to the lowest level, would it?"
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1432.549,1435.501,--But the Secretary isn't authorized to reduce it to the lowest level.
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1496.157,1502.661,"Yes, and I of course thought that argument was persuasive there, but the holding of the Court still is, there is another avenue of review."
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1523.909,1551.809,"--I'm not aware of the situation but analytically it's no different from precluding judicial review of any administrative action, because in administering a program an executive agency relies on law, statute, and implementing regulations, and if Congress can preclude judicial review even where someone's alleging that there's a statutory violation, as was true in Erika."
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1551.809,1561.017,"Yes, that's true, but in the vast majority of the cases that come up through the Social Security system, and their particular factual controversies, and you've got findings and the formal things that--"
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1561.017,1566.486,"Well, there are quite a few of them that involve... quite a few of the cases that involve challenges to regulations."
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1566.486,1571.806,"--Well, sure, and I think your position would be, then, in Ringer there could have been a challenge to the regulation if you followed the statute?"
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1571.806,1572.673,That's exactly right.
1985.85-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1578.376,1578.978,Right.
1985.85-225,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1578.978,1594.071,"And that seems to us to be clear, that Congress views 405-G as the avenue not only for review of factual issues but review of regulations and the legislative history expressly says that a court can review questions of law on review."
1985.85-225,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1611.117,1618.853,Mr. Gilchrist.
1985.85-225,1,16061,alan_g_gilchrist,,1618.853,1622.155,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-225,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2009.404,2017.724,Are these hypotheticals of yours based on a decision without a hearing of any kind?
1985.85-225,1,16061,alan_g_gilchrist,,2017.724,2039.423,"That's precisely the point, Your Honor, that this issue in this case, several issues of statutory construction, but the reality of this case is, there is no hearing, The carrier has expertise and authority, expertise and experiencer, rather, as well a authority to make the decision on issues such as the issues that I've set forth."
1985.85-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2479.725,2498.186,"Before you do, Mr. Gilchrist, I'm not sure you've completely answered Mr. Kneedler's argument that the doctor, if he takes an assignment of a claim and he doesn't like the two tier or three tiers, whatever it is, is really asking for recovery that relates solely to the amount of benefit that he can get."
1985.85-225,1,16061,alan_g_gilchrist,,2501.154,2508.91,"First of all, there's a serious question here as to whether this could be an amount of benefit case at all, and let me give you some examples."
1985.85-225,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2807.187,2821.53,"Has anyone, authoritatively or otherwise, made any guess or estimate as to how many such claims for judicial review are in the offing?"
1985.85-225,1,16061,alan_g_gilchrist,,2821.53,2828.117,I find that very... I'm glad you asked that question because I meant to talk about the court case.
1985.85-225,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2918.707,2926.11,Do you agree with Mr. Kneedler's statistics of 300 million claims and 30 million are in Part B?
1985.85-225,1,16061,alan_g_gilchrist,,2926.11,2927.96,--I don't quarrel with that.
1985.85-225,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2936.649,2943.822,"My question is not as to how many have been filed, How many potentially could be filed if you prevail?"
1985.85-225,1,16061,alan_g_gilchrist,,2943.822,2945.255,I'm sorry.
1985.85-225,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3027.238,3030.956,When it's put in those terms it's pretty difficult to argue with it.
1985.85-225,1,16061,alan_g_gilchrist,,3030.956,3034.177,"--That's right, but that is those are the terms."
1985.85-225,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3142.963,3146.267,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Kneedler?"
1985.85-225,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3146.267,3149.117,"Yes, several points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.85-225,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3170.316,3176.619,"May I ask for clarification, are you simply stating that the equal protection question is not before us at all?"
1985.85-225,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3176.619,3180.587,"--Well, there's several points."
1985.85-225,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3195.581,3201.584,Did the lower court say that the equal protection issue was so insubstantial?
1985.85-225,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3201.584,3205.036,"No, the lower courts did not resolve the equal protection question."
1985.85-225,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3205.036,3205.902,What is the AG's position?
1985.85-225,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3205.902,3214.725,"Our position is that the equal protection argument is insubstantial, so insubstantial as to not vest the Court with--"
1985.85-225,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3214.725,3217.244,Is it your position that the construction of the statute is not here either?
1985.85-225,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3217.244,3225.498,--The construction of the statute is not here because we believe Congress has precluded judicial review of the question of the construction of the statute.
1985.85-225,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3227.683,3234.17,"So, you would leave the construction of the statute to somebody engaged by Blue Cross-Blue Shield who may not be a lawyer at all?"
1985.85-225,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3234.17,3234.42,No.
1985.85-225,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3244.859,3253.482,But you're still going to leave the construction of the regulation to someone... to Blue Cross-Blue Shield to make that decision with no appeal?
1985.85-225,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3253.482,3258.35,"--Well, there's oversight by the Secretary, as I pointed out earlier, annually."
1985.85-225,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3258.35,3259.533,What sort of oversight?
1985.85-225,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3259.533,3266.854,There's an annual review of the carrier's performance by the Secretary's agents to make sure that the regulation is being properly implemented.
1985.85-225,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3269.372,3282.065,Has that sort of annual oversight ever been accepted as satisfactory in terms of providing some sort of appropriate administrative or judicial review of a major issue?
1985.85-225,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3282.065,3287.35,"--Well, the Congress has frequently foreclosed judicial review of questions of law."
1985.85-225,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3300.427,3305.914,"Basically, Erika simply involved the question of whether or not individual claimants could argue about the amount of benefits?"
1985.85-225,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3305.914,3327.827,"But the basis for their claim was that the approach the carrier took to computing the prevailing charge was inconsistent with the statute, inconsistent with the same sentence of the statute upon which the respondents in this case relied, and similarly in Ringer there was a regulation issued by the Secretary, of nationwide scope, that could not be appealed to the Secretary."
