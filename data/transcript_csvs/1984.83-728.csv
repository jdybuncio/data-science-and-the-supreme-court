1984.83-728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.522,We will hear arguments next in Herb's Welding against Gray.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,113.589,118.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is the case of Herb's Welding versus Gray."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.555,264.322,Mr. Brown?
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,264.322,265.088,"Yes, ma'am."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.088,274.093,Did Mr. Gray spend some time doing work on movable platforms as well?
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,274.093,275.612,The record does not establish that.
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,285.768,300.578,"If he did spend time doing this kind of work also on movable platforms, would he be covered because of the Caputo doctrine and holding?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,300.578,300.945,"--No, ma'am."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.952,311.952,A movable--
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,311.952,321.558,"--a movable rig, which is usually a vessel... the fact of the matter is, it is all the time a vessel in the offshore... he would stand a very good chance to be a seaman."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.558,327.228,"--And probably it would be maritime coverage, even if he were doing the same type of work?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,327.228,327.83,"Yes, ma'am."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.151,336.853,"Well, how are the hazards different--"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,336.853,338.77,"Your Honor, the hazards are no different--"
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,338.77,340.738,--in working on a movable rig and a fixed platform?
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,340.738,341.922,--There are no difference at all.
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,350.677,355.747,"Well, then, why isn't it logical to assume that Congress intended coverage here?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,355.747,375.061,"Because, Your Honor, in the case of a person more or less permanently attached to a vessel, Congress had before it in the Tower bill in... in consideration of the Tower bill in 1972 if... whether or not to cover that person under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act, and deliberately chose not to."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.061,383.149,"Well, I think that the nonaction by Congress doesn't either help you or hurt you in this particular regard."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,394.939,404.162,"The State of Louisiana thinks, and I have called the Department of Natural Resources, they think that there are 20,000 workers working on inshore platforms."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.388,418.088,"But you would estimate 20,000?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,418.088,418.655,"Yes, ma'am."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,433.164,441.837,"Well, if they were working on a fixed platform on the Outer Continental Shelf, presumably coverage would be extended by the OCSLA."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,441.837,442.537,OCSLA.
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,442.537,442.872,OCSLA.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,442.872,443.255,"Yes, ma'am."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,443.255,444.072,However you want to pronounce it.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,444.505,444.805,"Yes, ma'am."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,444.805,445.422,They would be covered.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,445.824,446.374,No question about them.
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,467.405,475.058,"Mr. Brown, Congress has just in the last few days enacted an amendment--"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,475.058,475.593,"Yes, ma'am."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,475.593,480.962,"--to the statute, has it not, to define employees, and who is covered and who isn't?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,480.962,481.164,"Yes, ma'am."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,483.364,493.472,"Now, would you plan to address yourself to the effect, if any, on this case of those amendments?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,493.472,498.34,"Those amendments, as I read them, Justice, I don't believe they have any effect whatever on this case at all."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,498.34,511.516,"Certainly this was filed earlier, but assuming that it applied, would it affect in any way the resolution of a case like this in the future?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,511.516,519.705,"I don't believe that those amendments... I have read them carefully, and I don't believe those amendments have anything to do with the issues before the Court in this case."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,625.123,639.281,"Well, except for those covered by the Outer Continental Lands Act, prior to '72, none of these workers on these drilling platforms were covered by the Longshoremen's Act."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,639.547,641.733,"The ores offshore were, Justice."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.733,643.335,"--Yes, offshore because of the--"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,643.335,646.036,"Because of OCSLA, which was passed in 1953."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,646.036,652.856,"--Yes, that's what I say, but aside from that, it is agreed that you either... they are either covered by the '72 amendments or not at all."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,652.856,653.906,That's correct.
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.906,660.194,"And the question is, then, what did Congress intend by the amendments in '72."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,660.194,660.546,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.085,672.787,It has to be changed by '72.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,672.787,673.537,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.07,677.972,Because it is agreed that there weren't any coverage before that except under OSHA.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,677.972,682.96,--That's what the difference between this case and the Director versus Perini case is.
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,692.631,703.889,"Well, the '72 Act at least extended coverage to those people who would have been covered if they were working on the ship, but they were working on the shore, too, and they certainly extended the coverage to them."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,703.889,705.075,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,707.86,711.062,"Well, even if he is working on a beach."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,711.062,713.212,"Well, he is not covered under Director versus Perini."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,713.212,715.264,"No, no, I mean under the '72 amendments."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,715.264,715.647,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,720.935,721.368,Exactly.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,721.368,722.953,And that is the key to this case.
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.61,749.104,"Wouldn't... if work on these platforms had been maritime in nature, wouldn't there have been coverage before 1972--"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,749.104,749.437,Absolutely.
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.437,752.889,--wholly aside from OSHA?
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,752.889,754.156,Absolutely.
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.172,756.789,OCSLA.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,757.691,758.791,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,771.432,783.905,"Well, Mr. Brown, I guess even before '72 there might have been coverage for any injury received if he had been working on a movable rig, right?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,783.905,787.191,"Well, Your Honor, I have to qualify the answer."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,790.476,790.928,Right.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,790.928,794.713,"But if a man is a seaman, then of course by definition there is no coverage under the Harbor Workers Act."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,794.713,801.134,"Yes, right, but we are assuming he is not a seaman, he is a welder on a movable rig."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,801.134,801.451,Yes.
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,801.767,802.217,"Well, all right."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,804.303,805.036,At least not in the Fifth Circuit.
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,805.036,814.461,And he also would have been covered had he been injured going over the water to and from the platform before '72.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,814.461,826.018,"Well, Your Honor, perhaps this is not the case, because the facts don't support it, but perhaps you are going to have to write us a postcript to Director versus Perini, because that particular thing is left over."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,841.828,842.211,It may.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,845.563,866.576,"The question to be answered is whether or not this Court agrees with what the Fifth Circuit said in Pippin versus Shell, Pudrough versus American Workover, and Thornton versus Brown and Foot, all of which are cited, and that is whether or not there is any support in the jurisprudence or otherwise for the proposition that oilfield work is inherently maritime."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.957,928.967,"Of course, Rodrigue might raise some question even about your concession about situs, because Rodrigue said that... at least it recited that these were islands."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,928.967,929.502,"Yes, sir, but--"
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.502,930.636,Not piers.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,930.636,943.393,"--in that particular point, Judge, you've got to remember that Rodrigue was decided pre-1972, when situs wasn't an issue, and when piers and wharves weren't covered under Victory Carriers versus Law and Nacirema versus Johnson."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.393,949.147,"I know, but just extending the coverage to piers and wharves doesn't extend coverage to Iowa."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,949.147,949.999,Exactly.
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,950.532,954.634,"So I don't know why you want to concede situs, but nevertheless you have."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,954.634,955.667,"Well, yes, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.746,974.281,I don't want to have to deal with things you don't want us to deal with.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,974.281,975.548,"--Well, I don't think you need to deal with it."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.317,979.017,I don't know.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,980.368,980.651,"Yes, sir?"
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,980.651,982.47,I don't know at all.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,983.203,984.403,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,984.403,988.624,"The respondent here has recovered under the Louisiana Workmens Compensation Act, has he?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,988.624,989.99,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,989.99,994.076,"What is the amount of that recovery, or what is the nature of it, in the first place?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,994.076,1005.817,"Well, the nature of the recovery is exactly the same as the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act when Mr. Gray was injured in 1972, the benefits were substantially less than the Longshoremen and Harbor Worker Act benefits."
1984.83-728,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1040.323,1043.509,"I ought to know the answer to my next question, but I don't recall it."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1053.85,1054.4,"No, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1054.4,1055.867,Would there be a double recovery?
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1055.867,1056.852,"No, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1056.852,1058.235,What would happen?
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1058.235,1071.209,"If he wins this case, the only thing currently at issue is whether or not we get some money back which we paid him in response to the BRB's decision, and his attorney would get paid, because we haven't paid the attorney's fees."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1081.85,1083.966,"I thought you said 20,000."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1085.552,1109.418,"Yes, ma'am, 20,000 working in the offshore Louisiana area alone, but the secondary and tertiary employment... in other words, once you get on the beach, as I appreciate what the government is talking about when it gives these figures, it is talking about people in the transmission areas onshore, the refinery areas, in other words, as far out as you get, and you are talking about a lot of people."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1109.418,1111.953,"That is not what this case involves, is it?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1111.953,1113.22,"No, ma'am."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1120.308,1127.379,We are talking about movable rigs and not the CA5's decision having to do with building a platform onshore.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1127.379,1128.445,We are not talking about that.
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1128.445,1128.929,No.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1128.929,1153.547,"No, ma'am, except that if the maritime worker is not... except that if a maritime worker is not... excuse me, an oilfield worker is not inherently maritime, then the underpinning of the Thornton case falls, too, because Thornton is the one that said... it postulated from Pippin and Budrough that an oilfield worker is maritime, and it said when you are building a platform where you are going to do this maritime work, that is maritime work."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1159.683,1162.302,"Well, suppose you are wrong in this case."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1162.302,1162.818,Then I lose.
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1162.818,1168.722,Does that necessarily affect the other situation of building platforms on the shore?
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1168.722,1169.972,"No, ma'am."
1984.83-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1276.442,1277.411,"Mr. Brown, may I ask you a question?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1279.796,1280.096,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1280.096,1283.014,You are primarily arguing status rather than situs--
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1283.014,1283.381,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.381,1298.441,"--if I understand your dialogue with Justice White, and do I also understand that you would not think your case would... your situs case, you would also take the same general position if this man never went out on the Outer Continental Shelf, but he was always within state waters."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1301.626,1306.863,"Your Honor, intellectually... I am trying to be intellectually honest with myself."
1984.83-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1315.719,1316.536,Right.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1316.536,1332.478,"And as soon as you say that if maritime work is performed in a particular identifiable area, which I think you have to do on a platform, you have to say that, and once you say that, then they are situs, if oilfield work is inherently maritime."
1984.83-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1333.464,1334.647,"Yes, I see."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1343.286,1343.836,Absolutely.
1984.83-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1343.836,1344.336,"--Yes, okay."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1345.338,1365.818,"To focus the situs argument, Judge, we all know that where longshoring work is done and it is done on a wharf, on a wharf... get away from the platform business for a second... it is done on a wharf, that is a maritime situs, but not everybody on the wharf is covered by the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act because he is not doing maritime work."
1984.83-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1380.511,1383.197,I understand.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1383.197,1384.63,One other thing that I would like to mention.
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1441.2,1444.502,"Mr. Brown, may I just ask you one more question before you do?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1444.502,1444.937,"--Yes, ma'am."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1444.937,1463.482,Some of the oil and gas lines that Mr. Gray was working on presumably were lines that were used to transfer oil or gas from under the bed of the water into whatever vehicle is going to take the oil away.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1465.015,1477.409,"You would have a hard time, Justice, in delving that out of this record, but I have to admit to you that some of the lines which fed into this platform were in fact coming from offshore."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.882,1492.251,You mean lines?
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1492.251,1492.984,"Lines, yes, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1507.594,1511.313,Presumably he would be working on it part of the time.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1511.313,1512.363,Presumably.
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1512.363,1528.257,And I just wonder if that doesn't bring this individual pretty close to the business of being really involved in loading or transferring oil and gas.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1528.257,1529.007,"Well, Your Honor--"
1984.83-728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1529.007,1532.126,For the purpose of maritime employment.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1532.126,1547.886,"--Well, in one sense I guess you could say that, but in the same sense you would have to say that a railroad worker is in the same business as a barge worker with a barge going down the Mississippi River because they are both transporting goods from Minneapolis to New Orleans."
1984.83-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.557,1558.711,"Mr. Brown, is there anything in the record that shows this particular respondent was in fact working on two-inch line?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1558.711,1559.677,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.62,1574.822,That shows he was working on two-inch line?
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1574.822,1575.938,It says he was working on a two-inch line.
1984.83-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1576.388,1577.155,Not four-inch line?
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1577.155,1582.659,"Yes, sir, and it is a particularly good quote, because it is not... nobody led him into it."
1984.83-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1584.811,1588.046,Is there anything in the record that shows he was working on four-inch line?
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1588.046,1588.63,"No, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1588.63,1593.384,"Well, then, why do you say presumably he was... we are talking about a record, not what you may know outside the record."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1593.384,1598.438,"I said that, Judge, and perhaps it was a concession that I shouldn't have made."
1984.83-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1612.428,1615.38,Did any of the fact finders below draw that conclusion?
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1615.38,1620.098,"Yes, sir, the board... Benefits Review Board drew it, and I don't know where they got it from."
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1631.473,1642.28,"If we agree with you, I suppose we would remand for the Court of Appeals to reach the other possible ground."
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1642.28,1649.517,"Well, sir, you would... I would suggest to the Court that... I know the Court is in the business sometimes of--"
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1649.517,1650.601,That is a possibility.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1650.601,1651.103,--I understand that.
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.483,1682.588,"That may be right, but wouldn't we want the judgment of the Court of Appeals first on the issue that... on the ground that the Benefits Review Board reached?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1682.588,1688.076,--I suspect that there could be some... if the Court found that there was any merit to that issue.
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1697.348,1699.781,"Well, you suggest we would decide that issue on the merits here?"
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1701.531,1702.147,It has not been briefed.
1984.83-728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.733,1705.851,I don't know why we would want to just do it on our own.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1709.387,1709.687,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1709.687,1715.374,You mentioned the new statute that was just passed does change one of our decisions and there may be a question of its retroactivity.
1984.83-728,0,43880,wood_brown_iii,,1716.657,1717.993,"Washington Metropolitan, Judge."
1984.83-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.993,1718.759,Thank you.
1984.83-728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1723.044,1735.37,Ms. Corwin.
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,1735.37,1738.656,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1984.83-728,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1748.928,1753.749,Didn't it also contract the coverage in some areas?
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,1753.749,1760.986,Perhaps you are referring to the status requirement that was imposed in connection with the expansion of coverage.
1984.83-728,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1778.864,1787.303,Weren't the '72 amendments supposed to be kind of a compromise that gave some things to the plaintiff's side and some things to the defendant's side?
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,1787.303,1789.172,"Overall, I am sure that is the case."
1984.83-728,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.489,1798.128,"We have had about half a dozen rather close cases here since then, haven't we, involving the '72 amendments?"
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,1798.128,1801.897,"In terms of the scope of coverage, there were a lot more provisions in the '72 amendments--"
1984.83-728,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.897,1804.58,"Yes, and we have decided every one of them in favor of the plaintiff."
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,1808.316,1809.2,--I would suggest not.
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.289,1847.575,Why would he?
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,1847.575,1852.86,"He would have for several reasons, and this is true of many offshore oil workers."
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.86,1854.562,"You have to establish that, I take it."
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,1864.001,1873.44,"Well, I think Congress's intent in expanding the coverage was to solve the problem of the amphibious worker, the worker who is sometimes--"
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.44,1874.023,Walking in and out.
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,1874.023,1897.139,"--Right, sometimes on navigable waters in the course of his employment, sometimes in these areas adjoining the waters, and I think you have in Mr. Gray a prime example of someone like that, and Mr. Brown himself has suggested that the entire offshore oil industry involves people who are walking in and out of different working situations, different locales, different sorts of structures."
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1932.145,1935.531,Even if he was walking in and out of coverage or anything else.
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,1935.531,1937.316,Even if he had been walking in and out of coverage.
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1949.024,1954.409,"I know, but the problem was not just situs."
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,1954.409,1960.313,"Well, I am not sure that is so, but I think Congress was concerned about the sort of--"
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1960.313,1962.165,"Well, let's assume it is."
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,1969.853,1971.003,"--Well, there was not--"
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.003,1972.639,Let's just assume that.
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,1979.209,1984.447,"--Well, there was not a requirement that someone be in maritime employment prior to 1972."
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.447,1985.73,I understand that.
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2012.53,2013.064,"Well, I--"
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2013.064,2015.482,"That is all right with me, if you don't--"
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2015.482,2030.159,"--Well, I don't want to really assume anything, but I am suggesting that when Congress spoke of maritime employment in 1972, you have to look at what it was trying to accomplish, and you have to look at kind of a common sense understanding of what they would have meant."
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2033.344,2034.128,--I will just put it to you this way.
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2042.967,2048.104,"Well, I just don't think there was some immutable definition of maritime employment."
1984.83-728,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2049.238,2053.091,"Well, I guess nobody had to define it before 1975."
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2055.057,2056.059,"--Well, before 1970--"
1984.83-728,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2056.059,2058.093,So nobody had to decide that question.
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2060.811,2077.54,"--Prior to 1972, the term maritime employment showed up only in the definition of employer, not employee, and it was an issue the courts rarely reached, because if something happened on navigable waters, it almost always turned out to be maritime in nature."
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2087.329,2100.822,Your adversary says that the prior cases in this Court and others indicate that this is not maritime employment prior to '72 and afterwards.
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2100.822,2107.892,"Well, I think those cases simply don't relate to what Congress was talking about in 1972 when it amended the Longshoremen's Act."
1984.83-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2143.499,2152.005,"Ms. Corwin, may I ask, your opponent suggests, and I think he is probably right on this, that even under your view you will still have a problem of walking in and out of coverage."
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2155.373,2156.075,Well--
1984.83-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2156.075,2164.146,"Because there are a lot of welders who do some welding on shorebased oil wells, and some who do them out on these rigs, and aren't they walking in and out of coverage?"
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2164.146,2177.322,"--Well, I suppose to some extent you can never completely solve the walking in and out of coverage problem, because coverage determinations under compensation systems by their nature are always going to have these fringe areas."
1984.83-728,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2215.713,2216.663,The 1984.
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2216.663,2219.332,"Excuse me, the 1984 amendments."
1984.83-728,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2257.457,2258.976,What is your view on that?
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2275.152,2290.679,"Well, I don't... I think that there is a pretty consistent line of cases that deals with marine construction workers and finds that to be within the maritme area, but... but I really don't think you have to reach that in this case."
1984.83-728,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2291.864,2300.653,"But if you adopt the substantial relationship test, that is precisely the test which CA5 has used to reach that kind of worker as well."
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2300.653,2317.479,"Well that... that's so, although I think then you get into the question of whether they have correctly applied the substantial relationship test, and I think clearly as to the body of offshore oil workers that we're talking about in this case, there's really no question that they have properly applied that test."
1984.83-728,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2645.99,2653.345,"May I ask you, are there any words, any language in the 1972 amendment that supports your position?"
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2653.345,2663.951,"Well, we think that this Court has noted that Congress used some broad language in amending the statute in 1972, and we do think it is clearly broad enough to encompass a situation like this one."
1984.83-728,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2663.951,2665.57,Which specific words?
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2665.57,2674.442,"Well, since we are focusing on the status requirement here, I guess, maritime employment is the category that we have to define."
1984.83-728,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2731.429,2737.849,Is there anything specific in the legislative history relating to offshore platforms?
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2737.849,2742.07,"Well, not with respect to the statute that was finally enacted."
1984.83-728,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2774.792,2783.647,"Do you think it was just sort of oversight that there was no mention made of workers in this category, even though there were apparently 20,000?"
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2783.647,2790.467,"--Well, I am not sure, I am not sure it was oversight, and the number 20,000 was used in the hearings, at least."
1984.83-728,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2840.567,2849.606,Is it fair to say that your argument is based on broad principles of common sense rather than any specific language either in the legislative history or the statute?
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2849.606,2867.801,"Well, I think to the extent we would rely on the legislative history, I would go back to the language in the reports in both Houses, in which Congress said, the purpose of this amendment is to provide a uniform compensation system for those employees who were covered for part of their activity under the old Act."
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.955,2875.507,"Well, this fellow wouldn't have been covered prior to '72."
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2875.507,2887.715,"He wouldn't have been covered in this particular fact circumstance when he was injured on a fixed drilling platform, but during the course of his employment there were a number of different situations in which he would be covered."
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2906.026,2916.567,"Isn't the heart of the... don't you think the heart of the Fifth Circuit's holding in this case is their statement that offshore drilling, the discovery, recovery, and sale of oil and natural gas from the sea bottom is maritime commerce?"
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2923.388,2927.375,"Well, yes, I think that is what the Fifth Circuit said."
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2927.375,2934.779,"If they had come out the other way, that offshore drilling is not maritime commerce at all, the result would have been different in this case, I suppose."
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2934.779,2935.696,I suppose that is so.
1984.83-728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.015,2946.919,"But we don't have any cases that are addressed to this, I don't suppose."
1984.83-728,1,18637,carolyn_p_corwin,,2946.919,2947.803,"Well, I don't think so."
1984.83-728,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2961.944,2968.882,Mr. Henderson?
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,2968.882,2987.761,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Robert Gray was injured, as has been noted, on a fixed gas and oil production platform located in the Bay Marshan Field, which is divided by the three-mile line separating Louisiana territorial waters from the OCS waters."
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3250.516,3252.133,"Mr. Henderson, could I ask this question?"
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3265.925,3273.431,Under OCSLA they brought coverage to the OCS worker.
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3273.431,3276.05,But wouldn't he have been covered anyway under your approach to the case?
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3276.05,3276.966,"Yes, I think he would."
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3276.966,3280.668,So really they were wasting their time when they enacted that statute?
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3281.618,3283.287,That was in 1953.
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3283.287,3283.854,Pardon me?

1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3289.791,3290.141,I understand.
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3290.141,3291.56,--to the offshore oil worker.
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3291.56,3297.796,"But you would... do you agree that he would not have been covered prior to 1972, your client?"
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3297.796,3299.563,My client would not have been covered.
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3299.563,3300.248,And nobody even on the--
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3300.248,3302.867,Not at the time of that particular injury.
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3304.367,3311.104,--Supposing we were talking about an injury to a person on the Outer Continental Shelf doing exactly the same kind of work.
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3315.491,3316.691,"--Oh, on the OC... if he--"
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3316.691,3317.543,Under your view.
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3317.543,3320.661,--You are saying he is injured on the OCS without OCSLA?
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3320.661,3321.178,Yes.
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3321.178,3322.828,There would be--
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3322.828,3327.582,Wouldn't you still argue there was a substantial relation to maritime employment and all the rest of it?
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3327.582,3333.236,"--Well, yes, but given the case of Rodrigue, if he were injured on the platform, he wouldn't be covered, but for the--"
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3333.236,3334.836,"Of course, Rodrigue didn't construe the statute."
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3339.056,3340.406,"--Which is that, Your Honor?"
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3340.406,3344.776,"Well, Rodrigue didn't say a word about the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act."
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3344.776,3345.343,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3351.93,3353.382,Right.
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3370.928,3372.728,Without the provisions of OCSLA--
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3372.728,3373.044,Yes.
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3373.044,3373.63,--he would not have.
1984.83-728,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3373.63,3374.013,Okay.
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3376.965,3377.931,Rodrigue--
1984.83-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3377.931,3382.869,Just like he wouldn't have had if he was in state waters.
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3382.869,3387.487,"--If he were injured on the fixed platform, that's correct, without the exception of OCSLA."
1984.83-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3456.381,3473.093,"Do you think to recover Gray has to... you have to hold that Gray was injured in an area that is customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel?"
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3473.093,3474.628,On the situs requirement?
1984.83-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3476.461,3477.179,Well--
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3477.179,3479.963,He has to be injured on an area--
1984.83-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3479.963,3481.598,--That is used by his employer.
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3481.598,3483.834,--Customarily used for loading and unloading a vessel.
1984.83-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3483.834,3485.167,"Well, what vessel?"
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3496.392,3497.442,It is done by pipes.
1984.83-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3497.808,3499.11,They don't load it on the ships.
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3499.11,3501.629,I don't believe there is any evidence in this case of that.
1984.83-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3501.629,3507.1,"Well, what... is this area customarily used in loading and unloading or repairing a vessel?"

1984.83-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3514.77,3521.073,But he doesn't have to be engaged in any activity that is related to loading or unloading a vessel?
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3521.073,3522.109,No.
1984.83-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3522.109,3523.159,Because he certainly wasn't.
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3523.159,3524.009,"Well, he was."
1984.83-728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.009,3527.627,Was he repairing a pipe?
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3527.627,3532.413,He was loading and unloading his equipment in and out of the crew boat.

1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3536.067,3537.167,Not when the accident occurred.
1984.83-728,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3537.167,3541.971,"I mean, this is something that he did in the ordinary course of events, every day."
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3549.04,3549.724,On a gas line.
1984.83-728,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3549.724,3550.157,Yes.
1984.83-728,2,42765,t_gerald_henderson,,3550.157,3552.426,That is correct.
1984.83-728,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3553.359,3555.228,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Brown?"

1984.83-728,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3601.675,3606.746,"And before '72, for coverage, the employer had to be in a maritime activity."
1984.83-728,3,43880,wood_brown_iii,,3606.746,3608.929,That's correct.
1984.83-728,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3661.264,3661.664,"Thank you, gentlemen."
