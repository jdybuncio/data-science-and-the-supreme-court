1961.59,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.579,"Number 59, Suzanne Thomas Richards, etcetera, Petitioners, versus United States."
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,11.012,16.831,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,86.783,89.763,"Maybe narrow but it's pertinent, isn't it?"
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,89.763,94.413,"Yes, sir."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,178.999,181.42,Under the Missouri law --
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,181.42,181.912,"Yes, sir."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,181.912,183.446,"-- which is $15,000."
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,183.446,184.986,"Yes, sir, that is correct."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,184.986,186.594,But there's no limit in the Oklahoma law.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,186.594,188.108,"Yes, that is correct."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,188.108,190.019,Am I right?
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,190.019,239.718,"Now, within the time limitation set by the Federal Tort Claim Act, there were lawsuits filed in the District Court, United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, alleging that under the Oklahoma Wrongful Death Act that the people that we represented were entitled to damages against the Government, we made no records to the law of Missouri, against the Government because of an alleged and for this argument admitted, negligent act of the Government in the State of Oklahoma."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,252.752,256.276,I wonder if you don't have to (Inaudible) involved.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,270.345,307.617,"With this very notable exception which was decided in the Union Trust case and which really gets to the crux of the argument because it reads, the Section reads where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law or the place where the act or omission occurred and our problem here, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said, is basically to determine what those words, if anything, mean."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,555.708,557.396,That's not your question.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,557.396,596.585,"If that -- that's just exactly the point Judge and we -- for some reason, for which I assume our inability that you must confess our lack of success up to this point and that's the reason I'm following -- ultimately, we'll follow the Government's argument in the Union Trust case, for some reason, we have been unable to get pass the mental block of -- when the act is read, where the United States, if a private person would be liable to the claimant and for some reason, we can't get by that."
1961.59,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,708.585,720.262,"Is there any indication in the legislative history that the phrase that you rely on so heavily here, the Congress was advertent to this what you call the conflicts of laws probably?"
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,720.262,727.25,"There are two things, of course one which is unfavorable and one which is favorable."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,812.577,821.188,Do you think -- do you think it helps analyzing or understanding the problem when we talk about extraterritorial effects?
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,824.487,828.821,"Well, it is of course involved here."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,828.821,831.741,I know that is involved.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,831.741,838.061,"Well, of course, Mr. Justice Frankfurter if --"
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,838.061,840.062,I know it's used in these cases but --
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,840.062,841.828,"Well, I would be --"
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,841.828,844.153,(Voice Overlap) it confuses me instead of helping me.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,844.153,847.727,"Well, I think that --"
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,847.727,849.906,The statute doesn't say anything about extraterritorial.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,849.906,853.275,"No, sir, and it likewise confuses me."
1961.59,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,873.428,876.226,"Now, does that mean all the law of Oklahoma or just some of it?"
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,876.226,882.561,"Well, in other words that means the law of Oklahoma except the general conflicts rule."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,882.561,883.026,So where do you get that --
1961.59,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,883.026,884.676,Why -- why do you accept that?
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,884.676,887.147,Because of this fact.
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,960.659,977.676,"That is because -- because Congress didn't write out and say, it would be liable to say in accordance of the law of the place where the acts or omission occurred, but not to the extent that the laws of the place deals with conflicts of the law problems."
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,980.854,981.531,It is --
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,981.531,982.148,Isn't that right?
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,982.148,982.17,Yes.
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,982.17,982.778,That's our argument.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,982.778,984.899,(Voice Overlap) condition or limitation.
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,984.899,1009.419,"But wasn't the -- wasn't the central -- the central rationale, the long driving force behind that was originally became to Federal Tort Act, that it's fundamentally immoral with the United States as an employer not to be subject to the kind of responsibility for which a comparable employer in the same state is liable."
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,1009.419,1009.643,Yes.
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1009.643,1010.567,Isn't that the heart of that statute?
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,1010.567,1011.903,Yes sir.
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1015.201,1015.703,In other words --
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,1015.703,1016.47,-- and conditions.
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1016.47,1020.488,-- Uncle Sam was less liable than the ordinary employer.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,1020.488,1020.624,Yes.
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1020.624,1021.559,That's an exemption.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,1021.559,1023.958,"Alright, let's just name some of them."
1961.59,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1159.815,1163.603,"Well, the Government says -- agrees it is that the law of the place should govern."
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,1166.18,1167.842,Yes.
1961.59,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1341.412,1344.282,Hess came from the Supreme Court of Oregon?
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,1344.282,1344.972,"Yes, sir."
1961.59,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1344.972,1346.819,Not the Ninth Circuit.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,1346.819,1349.952,"I beg your pardon, you're right."
1961.59,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1718.864,1726.437,We'll recess now Mr. --
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,1726.437,1743.546,"After the District Court of -- the District of Columbia had rendered this judgment for $50,000 against the Government, the Government appealed to the Court, which has to do with our conflicts of law problem."
1961.59,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1863.553,1866.255,"Where were you reading from earlier, the Government's brief?"
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,1866.255,1869.714,"First, the Government's brief and this second was page --"
1961.59,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1869.714,1872.204,-- from the opinion of the law.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,1872.204,1875.974,-- 80 of 221 F.2d.
1961.59,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1875.974,1879.268,(Inaudible)
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,1879.268,1881.09,In this instance sir --
1961.59,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1881.09,1883.4,(Inaudible)
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,1883.4,1895.307,"Our Eastern -- the fact as I say briefly, the Government's negligent act occurred in Virginia."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2128.567,2131.776,You regard the Department of Justice as infallible?
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2131.776,2148.411,"Well, in this particular instance, if Your Honor please, they are -- may I say to -- back home, we'd say they're somewhat ingenious."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2148.411,2150.594,"Like other lawyers, they try to win a case."
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2150.594,2152.608,"Yes, sir."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2152.608,2157.156,As long as conscience doesn't stand in the way?
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2157.156,2168.327,"Well, I guess so Judge, but as I say, I can only adopt their argument for two reasons."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2183.519,2200.79,"Mr. Rucker, one of the great English judges of the 19th Century, who introduces measures for the Government, of course, in the House of Lords, they said the man who grabs the measure is about the worst person to tell you subsequently what he intended."
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2200.79,2232.077,"Well, I will -- I follow that in this case but in the Union Trust case Judge, I would disagree because I consider them to be honest and when they knew the meaning of this phrase which they were responsible and had something to do at least given the Government legal -- I mean the Congress legal advice, they certainly knew what he was doing at that time and certainly knew what he's doing when they took the position that they did."
1961.59,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2232.077,2233.732,And besides they're on your side.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2233.732,2234.398,Sir?
1961.59,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2234.398,2239.622,"And besides of all that, they're on your side at this time, aren't they at that point?"
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2239.622,2240.472,"Yes, sir."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2257.763,2259.181,Well --
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2259.181,2263.395,"But basically, we're down to this Judge with seriousness."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2290.132,2304.069,What you're really saying is conceding the honesty they had the change of heart between the time they wrote in the Union Trust case and in this case.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2304.069,2312.264,"Judge, let me say this, Mr. Chief -- I mean Mr. Justice, may I say this in all seriousness?"
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2333.324,2335.547,"Now, you mean that --"
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2335.547,2335.767,Yes.
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2335.767,2338.315,-- not the death but the negligence had occurred in Missouri.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2338.315,2339.143,Yes.
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2339.143,2339.353,Alright.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2339.353,2344.206,Then we would have an identical situation.
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2344.206,2347.698,"Well, I wouldn't -- we would --"
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2347.698,2349.49,As we had in the Union Trust.
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2358.663,2365.581,"Well, if the negligence here had happened in Missouri, the same state as in which the death occurred, there would be that."
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2365.581,2365.9,"Yes, sir."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2365.9,2369.186,"No doubt with that, the Missouri Act would control."
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2369.186,2370.658,"Yes, sir."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2370.658,2380.068,But we have this question because the negligence occurred in Oklahoma and its effect was brought about in Missouri.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2380.068,2381.432,"Yes, sir."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2381.432,2384.061,"Now, you sue in Oklahoma."
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2384.061,2384.551,Yes sir.
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2384.551,2394.837,And you are required under this Act to rely upon the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2394.837,2395.359,Yes sir.
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2395.359,2396.525,That you say was Oklahoma.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2396.525,2397.669,Yes sir.
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2399.051,2399.417,Yes.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2399.678,2400.909,Because that's where it all was.
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2400.909,2439.24,"Now, Oklahoma says giving effect, I mean the Tenth Circuit, giving effect to this Act, this language of this Act, we apply the Oklahoma law, but we apply all of the Oklahoma law, not just part of it and the Oklahoma rule of conflicts requires us to apply the limitations of the death statute of Missouri, but we apply it not as Missouri law but as Oklahoma law under our rule of conflicts, isn't that what they say?"
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2439.24,2439.888,"Yes, sir."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2561.182,2562.158,"Mr. Rucker, may I put this --"
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2562.158,2563.026,Yes sir.
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2563.026,2567.404,-- may I put the other converse case.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2573.611,2575.043,"Yes, sir."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2575.043,2604.853,"And the death had occurred in Oklahoma and Missouri law was such a situation but Oklahoma law is with reference to ordinary litigants (Inaudible) to place of death and Oklahoma law is much more favorable than Missouri law, I take it you would feel bound not to take that client's case and say that Oklahoma law governs because it's -- Oklahoma rule govern because it's part of Missouri law."
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2612.719,2618.276,"Well, if I can understand Your Honor's question, I'll answer it as fairly as I can."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2618.276,2620.012,I want to leave no doubt about it.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2620.012,2620.751,"Yes, sir."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2620.751,2625.266,The negligent act or omission is in Missouri and the death in Oklahoma.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2655.232,2656.701,"Oh, yes, yes."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2656.701,2659.285,But you'd be enforcing Missouri law.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2659.285,2664.152,"But here, that would involve a situation other than Federal Tort Claims Act."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2664.152,2664.952,I'm assuming the Government.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2664.952,2665.808,"Yes, sir."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2665.808,2666.827,The Government.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2675.043,2676.695,"Well, yes, sir."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2676.695,2683.227,And I'm supposing everything the same except the states relationship reversed.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2683.227,2689.132,"Well, then I see that we would have no choice under the reading of this act."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2693.106,2718.322,But the reading of the Act has to be construed namely whether you'd merely take Missouri law in both negligence and death occurred in Missouri or Missouri law if negligence began in Missouri but the consequences resulting death in Oklahoma and Missouri says the reverse of what Oklahoma says.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2718.322,2722.412,"Of course, that's the same situation we had in Union Trust."
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2755.223,2771.442,"And so you would -- so you would tell your client that you restricted to the penurious basis of recovery of Missouri although Missouri says, “Since your client has died in Oklahoma, you have the benefit of a more favorable, a more generous Oklahoma law.”"
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2771.442,2771.926,Yes.
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2771.926,2774.161,You would that?
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2774.161,2775.007,I –
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2775.007,2775.705,I hope not.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2775.705,2783.471,If -- if I was being intellectually honest and in following what I determine the law and --
1961.59,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2783.471,2786.739,I think no lawyers did that except for partisan purposes.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2786.739,2788.618,Well --
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2788.618,2789.489,Mr. Rucker.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2821.457,2822.115,Yes.
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2822.115,2833.895,"Alright, now does not this Tort Claims Act require the same judgment against the Government as it would against the private party?"
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2833.895,2836.149,"Yes, sir, to a point."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2836.149,2836.786,Alright.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2837.358,2840.632,-- here -- excuse me.
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2840.632,2844.05,If I may go just one step further.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2845.38,2845.718,Yes sir.
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2845.718,2853.168,"-- in Oklahoma for this very thing, this death in Missouri for negligence occurring in Oklahoma."
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2853.168,2855.741,Yes sir.
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2855.741,2864.162,What law then would Oklahoma apply to American Airlines?
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2864.162,2871.315,"Alright sir, now, I think that is an appropriate illustration and I will answer to the best I can."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2915.412,2917.45,"Yes, we're talking about what law applies?"
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2917.45,2938.032,"Yes, alright, the law of Oklahoma as far as the Government is concerned, the law of Missouri as far as the Government is concerned, the identical situation, except in reverse, that you had in the Union Trust case."
1961.59,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2972.373,2978.114,"Then you'd have a different result, would you, as to one over the other?"
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,2978.114,2979.56,You did in Union Trust.
1961.59,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2996.282,2999.362,It's rather difficult to get to anyone rule (Inaudible).
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,3011.164,3011.343,Yes.
1961.59,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3011.343,3014.713,-- what law was governed.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,3014.713,3018.103,Yes sir.
1961.59,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3018.706,3020.797,What was governed (Voice Overlap)
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,3020.797,3033.1,"-- as you say, when you're in to the hypothetical -- it was -- after answering this, I would like to save the time which I apparently --"
1961.59,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3033.1,3033.54,That's alright.
1961.59,0,43243,truman_b_rucker,,3034.853,3036.645,"Alright, thank you very much."
1961.59,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3036.645,3053.185,I can't read the complication -- the illustration -- complications we have at this point.
1961.59,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3053.185,3054.567,Mr. Medalie.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,3054.567,3059.498,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1961.59,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3544.034,3546.56,"Well if they were, Mr. Medalie."
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,3546.56,3547.321,Yes.
1961.59,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3547.321,3550.015,What are the -- what if they were not.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,3572.742,3575.986,"Well, Government interprets it to mean the whole law."
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3781.12,3781.767,Mr. Medalie --
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,3781.767,3782.046,Yes.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3782.046,3791.559,"-- throughout the years that this legislation was being urged on Congress except for committees that the board just fighting, et cetera --"
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,3791.559,3791.819,"Yes, sir."
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3791.819,3808.114,"-- et cetera, et cetera, was there ever a thought of having an independent tort law in which the Government would be responsible over the idea throughout that the Government has been employer on the same basis of the local employer?"
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,3808.114,3809.042,No.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3829.374,3831.687,That was very early.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,3831.687,3833.247,"The very early, yes."
1961.59,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4000.041,4010.683,"That would mean in your view that -- in answer to the question that I asked Mr. Rucker that if American Airlines and the Government were sued jointly, the same result, the same judgment --"
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4010.683,4012.496,Precisely this.
1961.59,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4208.381,4215.731,Would that -- would this really avoid the kind of trouble that you very interestingly just told us about that you ran into in Eastern Air Lines case.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4228.962,4229.323,That's right.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4389.712,4405.75,"But in any event -- in any event, if you have -- if the locale of the negligent act is in a different state, then you have no problem with confusion for this harmony so far as the federal statute is concerned."
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4405.75,4406.17,"No, that --"
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4406.17,4413.857,Because the federal statute makes the equation between the Government and a private employer in the same territory.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4413.857,4416.142,"Precisely the point, that's right."
1961.59,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4422.771,4446.389,"There are some of the states, are they not or I am mistaken which under their own wrongful death statutes provide that if death has occurred -- death is inflicted somewhere else by negligence -- by negligent act occurring within the State then the law of the home state should prevail."
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4447.997,4450.542,"Well, certain elements (Voice Overlap)."
1961.59,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4577.259,4584.165,I don't -- I -- I certainly agree with what you've just implied that the desirable thing is to have these questions settled.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4584.165,4584.24,Yes.
1961.59,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4584.24,4586.381,There seemed three points of view at least.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4586.381,4587.601,That's right.
1961.59,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4587.601,4592.719,But I don't quite understand why just in the abstract quite apart from the --
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4592.719,4593.451,Yes.
1961.59,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4593.451,4594.847,-- matter in this lawsuit.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4609.878,4614.402,"Well, I think that -- well, I think this -- this raises two questions."
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4646.969,4652.911,"When you say similar, that's a loose term for me in reading the statute."
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4652.911,4653.811,"Well, I've seen that --"
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4653.811,4665.484,"(Voice Overlap) the one thing you could say is that Congress didn't want the United States to be liable when the private owner isn't or vice versa, the United States to go free when the private owner has to pay."
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4665.484,4666.224,"Well, that's right."
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4666.224,4673.752,"I should think it as one thing clear about the whole pressure and momentum in history of this legislation, that's clear."
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4673.752,4674.835,That's right.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4691.575,4694.941,"Well, in the language of the -- of the statute doesn't leave us free --"
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4694.941,4695.464,No.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4695.464,4698.406,"-- to exercise our preference, does it?"
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4698.406,4699.992,"In our view, it doesn't."
1961.59,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4699.992,4702.723,"Well, some fairly respectable judges have deferred about this."
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4702.723,4703.843,That's -- that's quite true.
1961.59,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4722.703,4726.274,The only trouble with that is it would require us to rewrite the statute.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4726.274,4726.921,That's right.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4811.168,4811.903,Mr. Medalie.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4811.903,4812.141,Yes.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4812.141,4815.291,I don't mean to suggest that there is no problem of statutory construction.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4815.291,4816.045,No.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4816.045,4829.184,I did mean to suggest that we're confined within what Congress has told us and not our own philosophic preferences and they're particularly confined by the underlying basis of this legislation.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4829.184,4829.857,I agree wholeheartedly.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4829.857,4854.126,"And I can -- I say again that I should imagine Congress would be startled to be told that in the same Court, in the District Court, one sitting with the jury and one sitting not with the jury, a different law applies under the Federal Tort Act as against the relevant federal -- state law to be enforced depending on what the Government or a private person."
1961.59,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4857.674,4861.028,"Well, except to the case like defamation then the law will be quite different, wouldn't it?"
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4861.028,4863.785,"Yes, but that's because there is a specific exception in Section 2680."
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4863.785,4865.968,That's because the statute doesn't deal with it.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4865.968,4866.534,That's right.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4866.534,4868.076,And it causes the doubt.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4868.076,4868.127,That's right.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4868.127,4885.456,"But as to the torts with which it does deal, the thing you can be completely dogmatic about is that Congress didn't mean to impose a liability from which the private employer is free or withdraw liability to which the private employer is subjected."
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4885.456,4885.858,Yes.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4888.813,4891.412,That made no rule for flexibility.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4891.412,4892.818,That's right.
1961.59,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4982.557,4985.163,(Inaudible) please.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4985.163,4987.348,Yes sir.
1961.59,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4987.348,4993.968,"You said that each of these parties settled with American Airlines in full and received $15,000."
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,4993.968,4995.412,That's right.
1961.59,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4995.412,4998.272,Did that extinguish the whole cause of action?
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,5000.197,5013.225,"Well, I -- it's a moot case as far as the Government is concerned under the Missouri wrongful death statute or -- well, by way of the whole law of Oklahoma."
1961.59,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5021.002,5025.987,Did it expressly reserve the cause of action against the Government in the release assigned?
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,5025.987,5042.783,"I believe in some instances they did and some instances they didn't, but the fact is that Missouri goes -- Missouri law and Oklahoma law are one on this problem that when you release one tortfeasor, you nevertheless have a claim against the other tortfeasor so that --"
1961.59,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5042.783,5043.615,(Inaudible)
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,5043.615,5044.536,Yes?
1961.59,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5044.536,5053.022,(Inaudible)
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,5053.022,5054.026,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1961.59,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5057.868,5059.077,(Inaudible)
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,5059.077,5059.493,That's right.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5108.405,5110.903,But not if your -- if the petitioner is right.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,5110.903,5111.612,Not --
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5111.612,5113.949,"And if the petitioner is right, I should think --"
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,5113.949,5115.087,Quite true.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5115.087,5116.939,-- Oklahoma release to apply.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,5116.939,5117.766,Quite true.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5117.766,5119.203,He can -- he can appeal to that.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,5119.203,5119.926,I should think so.
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5119.926,5121.138,So that we got more problems (Voice Overlap)
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,5121.138,5121.896,"Well, we do have more --"
1961.59,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5121.896,5125.566,You're not going for finding out what the release law of every state are.
1961.59,1,40001,richard_j_medalie,,5125.566,5126.858,That's right.
1961.59,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5190.116,5191.569,Mr. Patterson.
1961.59,2,45825,w_b_patterson,,5191.569,5194.149,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1961.59,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5218.895,5221.744,(Inaudible)
1961.59,2,45825,w_b_patterson,,5221.744,5222.823,That's right.
1961.59,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5345.463,5347.683,But why do you say strict construction?
1961.59,2,45825,w_b_patterson,,5361.088,5363.763,"That's true, Your Honor."
1961.59,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5364.502,5370.936,I'm not suggesting that -- that all the scholars think and agreed to the wisdom of that decision --
1961.59,2,45825,w_b_patterson,,5370.936,5372.677,"Well, we -- we're certain at all --"
1961.59,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5372.677,5374.59,There it is and we've acted on it.
1961.59,2,45825,w_b_patterson,,5407.97,5410.553,"Well, that's precisely what I was trying to say."
1961.59,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5414.99,5418.306,"As I understand you, you are shearing off from there --"
1961.59,2,45825,w_b_patterson,,5418.306,5418.897,No.
1961.59,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5434.293,5441.75,And that which -- and that which they absorb is there -- what maybe the pronouncement of another state to which they wouldn't have to yield but in fact do.
1961.59,2,45825,w_b_patterson,,5441.75,5442.692,That's right.
1961.59,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5447.195,5451.616,"MWell, that's precisely the Government's position and -- and you're saying you have no quarrel with it."
1961.59,2,45825,w_b_patterson,,5451.616,5452.182,That's right.
1961.59,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5452.182,5453.423,But you have an alternative position?
1961.59,2,45825,w_b_patterson,,5453.423,5466.709,"I have an alternative position because I say I want to present my clients from having stayed here and as my (Inaudible) have been here, I have no altruistic motives really in that regard. [Laughter]"
1961.59,3,43243,truman_b_rucker,,6252.693,6253.636,Few minutes I have left Mr. --
1961.59,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6253.636,6255.244,"Yes, Mr. Rucker."
