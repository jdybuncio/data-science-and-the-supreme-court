1986.85-1329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,16.426,"We will hear argument now in No. 85-1329, Young versus United States, consolidated with 85-6207, Klayminc against the United States, et cetera."
1986.85-1329,0,29674,james_a_cohen,,17.926,19.378,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1273.925,1282.331,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.103,1370.305,"Mr. Bryson, could I ask about number two?"
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1376.725,1379.41,"Well, I think there are two answers to that, Your Honor."
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.109,1403.375,"Well, let's--"
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1403.375,1408.561,"But in any event, contemplates the participation of a private attorney in some respect."
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1408.561,1409.144,--But doesn't that--
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1409.144,1410.544,Our second answer... I'm sorry.
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1410.544,1411.513,--Go ahead.
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1415.131,1424.754,"Well, I don't think so, because my second answer is that I think criminal contempt is a different animal in some important respects from the typical criminal offense."
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.698,1442.498,--Isn't this person an officer?
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1444.15,1445.916,--We don't believe he is an officer.
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1454.256,1456.641,Is a regular prosecutor not an officer?
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1456.641,1460.326,"--Well, we believe he is not an officer but an employee."
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1464.98,1466.48,A United States Attorney is--
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1466.48,1467.047,I'm sorry.
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.516,1469.849,--He is an officer?
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1469.849,1470.299,That's right.
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.299,1472.217,But this individual who does the same thing is not?
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1472.217,1478.371,"Well, he does, Your Honor, I think do the same thing, because he is limited in several very important respects."
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1500.534,1504.605,"Well, I'm glad you haven't made the argument that your brief made."
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1520.614,1530.755,"Well, that, I think, Your Honor, would only be so if we accept that Rule 42(b) is a legislative delegation to the courts of the authority to--"
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1530.755,1535.707,"Well, Rule 43(b) I don't think helps you, because Rules 43(b) was never passed by the Congress."
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1535.707,1536.157,"--Well, that's right."
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1536.823,1542.644,The Constitution requires that the Congress may by law vest appointment in the court.
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1542.644,1543.811,"--That's correct, and that's one of the problems."
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1543.811,1545.811,And Rules 43(b) has never been enacted by the Congress.
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1545.811,1546.244,That's correct.
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.244,1547.929,So that argument's wrong?
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1547.929,1548.729,Pardon?
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1548.729,1550.231,So that argument's wrong?
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1550.231,1554.333,"Well, I think, Your Honor, the... there is some force to the argument."
1986.85-1329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1692.574,1695.543,"xxx addressed to this situation, Mr. Bryson?"
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1695.543,1698.978,"Well, I think it would be addressed, Your Honor, to a situation where, for example--"
1986.85-1329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.978,1703.763,"He's in the ABA, or the ABA has an interest in the outcome; that's what that sounds like."
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1703.763,1720.891,"--Well, I think it would clearly apply, Your Honor, to a case where, for example, if I continued to represent a private party, and that private party had an interest in the outcome of a lawsuit in which I was the prosecutor, that would clearly be covered."
1986.85-1329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.139,1805.608,"Well, Mr. Bryson, what you say I don't doubt makes a good deal of sense in the abstract."
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1825.504,1827.956,"Well, Your Honor, I have a couple of answers."
1986.85-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.101,1901.302,"Mr. Bryson, what's the oldest case you have that gives the courts authorities to cite for criminal contempt without a statute and on... with their own appointment of a prosecutor for violation of one of their orders, as opposed to for, you know, contempt that occurs in front of them, an insult to their dignity, an obstruction of their processes, but just disobeying one of their judgments?"
1986.85-1329,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1907.389,1911.526,"--Well, the McCann case would fall into that category."
1986.85-1329,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1944.632,1946.082,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,1947.634,1955.989,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1984.74,1986.442,How does Congress enforce its orders?
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,1986.442,1989.211,"Through the executive branch, Your Honor."
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.342,2018.925,How long have we consistently held that?
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2018.925,2020.294,"--1911, Your Honor."
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.294,2020.827,Older than the thirties?
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2020.827,2025.012,"1911 is the oldest I have, which is Gompers, Your Honor."
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2254.874,2256.476,Mr. Bainton--
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2256.476,2257.042,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.042,2272.236,"--let's take a very important and massive court decree, like the old AT&T decree, which was essentially the structure for our telecommunications industry for decades."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2294.9,2299.636,"Your Honor, if I'm not mistaken, I believe that case was brought by the Justice Department, wasn't it?"
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2299.636,2300.303,"Well, that's right."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2300.303,2307.825,"What you're saying is, by analogy, if a private party had sought the same sort of relief, and obtained it?"
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2307.825,2308.575,"That's right, that's right."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2324.918,2326.953,"Your Honor, I don't know that--"
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.953,2329.904,You're saying that we have the right to make the judgment and to enforce it.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2329.904,2331.606,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2395.678,2403.834,"Mr. Bainton, with your very good example of Blackacre, wasn't the remedy one of ejectment, which was enforceable by an executive officer?"
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2408.071,2426.699,"Your Honor... Your Honor, when... when the executive branch declines to enforce a court order, rightfully or wrongfully, a court must be able to see that that order is given force and effect."
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2441.542,2444.244,Mr. Bainton--
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2444.244,2448.363,Surely the District Court must be able to compel the production of those tapes under those circumstances.
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2448.363,2454.449,--Suppose either you or the judge asked the prosecutor to appoint somebody here.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2461.286,2463.388,"The Attorney General could have, Your Honor, yes."
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2466.94,2468.29,What are you... what is he going to do with that conflict of interest statute?
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2468.29,2469.625,"Oh, I'm sorry, I see your question."
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2469.625,2470.791,Yes.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2472.291,2473.993,"I don't think, Your Honor--"
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.993,2474.943,He couldn't have.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2475.779,2478.295,"--No, I don't agree, Your Honor."
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2478.295,2481.683,"Well, how could he, and... and just... violate the statute?"
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2481.683,2489.42,"Your Honor... Your Honor, I don't think that the... that there is a conflict of interest."
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2499.858,2505.512,"xxx against the court, not the individual."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2505.512,2506.645,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2506.645,2508.978,Contempt is against the court.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2508.978,2510.597,"Yes, but the--"
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2510.597,2511.513,Not the individual.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2511.513,2513.632,"--we're talking about interests, though, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2514.565,2516.251,And you only had one interest?
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2516.251,2518.536,"--I had one interest, and that is that the court order be obeyed."
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2518.536,2519.019,Your client.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2519.019,2519.769,"Pardon me, sir?"
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2519.769,2520.519,Your client.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2520.519,2522.071,"No, that is not correct, sir."
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2528.641,2530.86,You still had the same client.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2530.86,2532.326,"That's correct, sir."
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2532.326,2535.128,But you're arguing for the client now or the court?
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2535.128,2536.33,"No, Your Honor, I--"
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2536.33,2540.282,"Well, I just want to know which hat you have on."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2540.282,2542.568,"--Your Honor, there is no question--"
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2542.568,2543.368,You're wearing two hats.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2543.368,2543.934,--as to which hat I'm wearing.
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2553.14,2554.542,xxx pristine.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2554.542,2560.946,"--Your Honor, as to who I appeared for, I'm sorry, I respectfully disagree; that is the word I chose to use."
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.42,2587.43,"Mr. Bainton, would the case be different if your client had both a claim for damages, because of a lot of trademark infringement and the like, which would be enforceable by a civil contempt, as well as the criminal proceeding?"
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2588.613,2589.13,"No, sir."
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2599.404,2614.163,"No, but in that case, if you represented both the court's interest in enforcement and your client's interest in obtaining money, would it be proper for you to agree to dismiss the criminal charges if there were full payment of all damage claims?"
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2614.163,2616.73,"--Your Honor, I couldn't agree to do that."
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.484,2631.542,"Well, agreed, maybe... enter into an agreement by which you, in exchange for the payment of whatever the amount the damages were or alleged to be, you agreed to recommend to the court that they would be... the criminal charges would be dismissed."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2631.542,2634.66,"You're saying, would that create... potentially create a conflict of interest?"
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2634.66,2635.044,Yes.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2635.044,2635.544,Yes.
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2673.733,2675.483,"Well, let me change the example a little bit."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2684.723,2685.475,--I couldn't do that.
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.475,2687.827,That would be a conflict of interest.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2687.827,2688.81,That would be unethical.
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.112,2696.33,You think you have an obligation to the judge to disclose all evidence that you have in your possession?
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2696.33,2704.919,--I think I have an... had and continue to have an unqualified obligation to the United States of America to give it the best representation of which I am capable.
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2704.919,2709.34,"What if your client said, I really think you're being too hard on this particular adversary."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2718.393,2720.679,"Well, then, I'd have to make a decision."
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2764.541,2766.141,"Let me ask you one other question, if I may."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2773.73,2781.383,"Your Honor, once accepting the engagement, I think I'm bound to see it through to its conclusion unless excused by the District Court judge."
1986.85-1329,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2795.477,2813.522,"What in your view would be the objection to saying, the private attorney should not be appointed, especially for one of the parties, unless the United States Attorney refuses the case?"
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2813.522,2816.557,"I have no... utterly no problem with that, sir."
1986.85-1329,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2818.425,2821.46,That it should first be presented to the United States--
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2821.46,2825.246,"--As a matter of good practice, not necessarily of constitutional law."
1986.85-1329,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.028,2849.295,--So you think--
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2849.295,2850.311,--I had at the time--
1986.85-1329,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2850.311,2856.598,"--So the United States Attorney, you think, in effect if not expressly, in effect declined prosecution?"
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2856.598,2860.585,"--No, sir, I think he expressly declined the prosecution not once but twice."
1986.85-1329,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2878.297,2879.847,Prior to your appointment?
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2879.847,2881.916,"--No, sir."
1986.85-1329,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.382,2886.201,Was it ever offered to him prior to your appointment?
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2886.201,2890.438,"No, sir, it was offered to him on the day of my appointment; literally on the day."
1986.85-1329,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2890.438,2891.205,On the day.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2891.855,2903.912,"At Judge Brieant's request, I delivered to the U.S. Attorney the affidavit submitted in support of my... in support of the application for my appointment."
1986.85-1329,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.185,2911.801,Had you already been appointed?
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2911.801,2912.801,"--Yes, sir, I had."
1986.85-1329,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.657,2933.714,"But you would have no objection if the judge had said, well, I... we should give the U.S. Attorney first crack before you're even appointed?"
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2933.714,2935.18,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2965.436,2973.023,"Just to keep the record straight, did you give those records to the U.S. Attorney or to his assistant?"
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2973.023,2976.557,I gave them to the head of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's office.
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2976.557,2978.376,That's what I thought.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2978.376,2980.461,Which I thought was the appropriate.
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2980.461,2984.08,"Well, you did say you gave them to the U.S. Attorney."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2985.48,2986.182,"No, that's correct, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-1329,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2986.182,2986.932,Not that it matters.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2986.932,2987.499,That's correct.
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2998.09,2998.94,Mr. Bainton.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,2998.94,2999.656,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2999.656,3005.744,I like the notion that we have the power not just to render judgments but to enforce them as well.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3015.885,3018.002,Who's we?
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.169,3019.953,Judges.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3019.953,3020.869,Okay.
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3020.869,3021.586,A Federal court.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3056.093,3061.83,"In that example, I think as a practical matter, you're absolutely correct."
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3081.927,3084.029,I understand that.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3084.029,3085.195,"So... so, you know, but it's--"
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3085.195,3093.885,"But the notion that somehow the effectiveness of the courts, the notion that somehow it's dependent upon the other branches is not inconceivable, is it?"
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3093.885,3098.789,"--But your example, sir, I most respectfully suggest, is largely speculative."
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3124.487,3125.522,"Well, maybe that's because--"
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3125.522,3128.641,--I think the real problem you've got to deal with is the one that was dealt with by the Second Circuit.
1986.85-1329,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3132.26,3146.519,"--Maybe that's because the United States Attorney thinks that of all the violations of law out there, the flouting of this particular court order is not the most serious that should engage the time of either his people or the courts."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3163.112,3178.991,"Because the interests of the judiciary, and the enforcement of its orders, are different, Justice Scalia, than the legitimate and proper interests of the justice... of the executive branch."
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3238.195,3239.579,"Mr. Bainton, may I--"
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3239.579,3240.079,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.079,3250.337,"--What if you had a different kind of crime, shortage of U.S. Attorneys to prosecute, and the prosecutor tells a victim, we just don't have enough lawyers to keep this case on the docket."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3256.957,3263.245,"Yes, if the judge is going to appoint him."
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3263.245,3264.578,"No, the--"
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3264.578,3280.021,"I think that... I think that the... and there is provision, happens all the time in securities fraud cases when representatives of the SEC are specially appointed by the Attorney General to prosecute criminal securities cases or criminal anti-trust cases."
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3280.021,3280.721,"--Well, stick with my hypothetical."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3280.721,3281.457,So that provision is there.
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3281.457,3282.923,Stick with my hypothetical.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3282.923,3285.924,"It's never been used in the way you suggest, sir, but it could be."
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3285.924,3287.776,But stick with my hypothetical for a minute.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3292.328,3293.597,Who is doing it?
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3293.597,3298.399,"Well, either the judge or the U.S. Attorney says, we don't have enough lawyers to go around."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3309.69,3313.928,"Well, the answer to the question really depends... depends in large part on who does it."
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3317.213,3320.415,"Well, assuming power, would there be any ethical objection to such an arrangement?"
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3320.415,3321.948,If the Attorney General were to do it.
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3321.948,3327.151,Because it seems to me it's quite a close parallel.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3336.924,3347.796,I think... I think under the statute cited by the Attorney General there might... it would be unlawful for the Attorney General to make such an appointment--
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3347.796,3348.096,"Well, let me put it differently."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3348.096,3350.232,--because it would be a violation of the statute.
1986.85-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3350.232,3354.284,"What if Congress passed a law and said, we think this is a good way to get a lot of backlog out."
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3360.337,3366.609,"The... the... there are two parts to the answer to that question, sir."
1986.85-1329,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3392.392,3397.546,xxx was the way crimes were prosecuted at the time of the Constitution.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3397.546,3398.479,"That's correct, sir."
1986.85-1329,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3398.479,3401.08,There weren't a lot of U.S. Attorneys around.
1986.85-1329,2,29022,j_joseph_bainton,,3404.382,3404.984,That's correct.
1986.85-1329,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3599.975,3603.227,"Thank you, Mr. Bainton."
1986.85-1329,3,29674,james_a_cohen,,3606.029,3607.131,Thank you.
1986.85-1329,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3683.529,3686.029,"Your time has expired, Mr. Cohen."
1986.85-1329,3,29674,james_a_cohen,,3686.029,3686.295,--Thank you.
1986.85-1329,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3686.295,3688.408,The case is submitted.
