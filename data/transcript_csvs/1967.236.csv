1967.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,16.581,"No. 236, Miles Edward Haynes, Petitioner, versus United States."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,18.358,21.489,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,272.52,281.535,"Professor Wright, I have a -- and I had a difficulty with your argument in this respect perhaps because I don't understand it."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,329.172,337.725,"I don't understand, Mr. Justice Fortas how buying a new license would be an admission that you had driven the car at the time when your old license had expired."
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,337.725,350.299,"Well, under this -- under the Firearms Act, all you're saying as I understand it, when you register as I am now in possession of the firearm, is that right?"
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,350.299,351.596,"Yes, that's right."
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,351.596,364.196,"Just as when I buy a new automobile license, what I'm saying is that I'm in possession of an automobile and I intend to drive it on the streets of the District of Columbia."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,364.196,364.277,I should --
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,364.277,393.686,"But that's where I have -- had a difficulty in understanding what I believe is the -- your basic argument, that is to say that if I register a firearm and say that I now possess the firearm, what respect does that imply that I have been in possession of it unlawfully here before you."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,431.12,441.341,"I suggest, Mr. Justice Fortas, that a closer analogy would be if you had a local statute providing that everyone who has stolen a car shall be required to buy a licensed plate for it."
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,441.341,444.847,"Well, you like that better and I like mine better."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,444.847,452.221,"Well, but mine, I -- with great respect, it seems to me to come closer to the statutory pattern of the National Firearms Act."
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,452.221,467.579,"That's exactly the point of difference, I -- you'd have to show me a little more clearly than I now see it that that is in fact the pattern in the Firearms Act."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,483.918,501.981,"I think, fairly read, it does with one minor exception because it says that if you acquire this lawful, if the transfer provisions of the law were complied with when it was transferred to you or if you made it and you complied with the making provisions of the law, then you do not have to register."
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,501.981,525.286,"And you're saying, because of the negative implication or the negative effect of that that the law has to be read as if it meant that you register only if it's in your possession unlawfully that is to say that previous owners have not register yet."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,577.837,588.197,"Oh, I'm glad if I could pull you back on my bicycle by endeavoring to analyze the statutory scheme as I have said."
1967.236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.877,607.768,"Why, why not?"
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,619.099,620.551,And to collect the tax that's involved.
1967.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,620.551,625.462,"Yes, but at least the Secretary knows then where the gun is and who has it."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,625.462,628.312,Right.
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,707.034,710.41,"Let's see, what's the crime?"
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,726.372,727.829,How did you acquire the firearms sir?
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,727.829,734.402,Let's suppose that I have registered it myself to see or I have filed registration.
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,752.291,755.569,"It seems to me that if you register it, perhaps you have not committed the crime of -- in possession --"
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,755.569,758.37,"Well, isn't that what we're talking -- and isn't that what we're talking about here."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,780.26,781.772,"I think that's the issue, surely, sir."
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,781.772,807.633,"And what I want to know is, if I acquire either by gift or by purchase a firearm that ought to be registered and I register it, and I have no knowledge or let's assume that I have no knowledge whether it has been transferred or purchased by a prior owner in violation of the Act."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,809.509,820.888,I think you've committed a crime of possession of a firearm that is at anytime been transferred in violation of a long line of the sections or which has at anytime been made in violation of Section 5821.
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,820.888,827.916,And your point is that by registering I incriminate myself in that respect?
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,827.916,828.942,Yes sir.
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,828.942,831.431,Because of possession of this which is not (Voice Overlap) --
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,831.431,835.038,Because you don't have to register if these other provisions were complied with.
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,835.038,840.262,"Even though I have registered immediately, it comes into my possession."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,858.322,869.177,"But even without unwrapping the package, if you got it lawfully, you don't have to register; if you got it unlawfully, when you register, you were admitting that you got it unlawfully."
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,869.177,877.745,"I'm asking you, what if -- what do those words mean in the context of the statute, lawfully and unlawfully."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,877.745,884.803,They mean whether or not you complied with all the detailed provisions as to transfer or making.
1967.236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.726,986.394,"Mr. Wright, I think you said at the outset that we're dealing here preliminarily perhaps with a question of statutory construction?"
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,986.394,986.851,"Yes, sir."
1967.236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.851,1001.255,"And If I understood you correctly, you said that the -- you understand the Government to concede that if you are correct in your interpretation of the meaning of the statute that you are also right in your Fifth Amendment claim that you are --?"
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1001.255,1002.849,Except the use restriction --
1967.236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.849,1004.873,Putting aside the use restriction?
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1004.873,1005.723,No.
1967.236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.723,1009.166,But this is also -- major correct in your major correct in your Fifth Amendment claim.
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1017.872,1020.417,"No, sir."
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1094.777,1098.319,Can I ask you another hypothetical question?
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1139.515,1155.798,"I'm hesitant about answering that question without knowing more than I do, Mr. Justice Fortas about what the substantive law is with regard to receive stolen goods by an innocent person whether he unknowingly receives stolen goods but definitely not (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1155.798,1163.203,Why would that makes any difference on the -- as an analogy of your argument?
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1200.524,1203.703,"No, I'm certainly not suggesting that."
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1249.952,1263.595,What you're saying is that a person in possession of a firearms covered by the Act can be convicted as you read the statute even though it's an innocent receipt?
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1263.595,1265.153,Yes.
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1265.153,1277.814,And is that the basic point on which our construction as to which you say that Government has made this concession?
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1290.785,1296.032,I don't know if the Government conceded the -- this particular question.
1967.236,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1298.19,1303.652,I don't think they did.
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1303.652,1312.593,"What they have conceded is that, if I'm right, that registration under 5841 isn't applicably incriminating."
1967.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1336.451,1366.812,"Professor, may I ask you if in the anti-smuggling under the anti-smuggling laws that the man is arrested, prosecuted for having goods in his possession that were not declared when he brought them into this country, when he's prosecuted for having them under those conditions, is it open to him to say, Well, I didn't declare those things because I was a smuggler."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1378.687,1380.81,I do not think it would be open to the person to say that.
1967.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1380.81,1381.663,I beg your pardon?
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1381.663,1384.098,I do not think it would be open to him to say that because --
1967.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1384.098,1384.975,And in what --
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1384.975,1385.762,-- of the law offers him --
1967.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1385.762,1389.781,-- what constitutional respect is that different from yours?
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1389.781,1401.127,"Because the law offers him a perfectly easy alternative and that is not to be a smuggler and I'm not here making the voluntary argument that we heard yesterday but it says to him when you come in, declare your goods."
1967.236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.966,1416.963,"Similarly on the transfer of a gun, doesn't the law require in this case that if you want to transfer a gun that you're suppose to do it on an order?"
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1416.963,1418.147,"Yes, sir."
1967.236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.147,1421.001,Made out by the transferee?
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1421.001,1422.373,"Yes, sir."
1967.236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.373,1428.093,"Well, isn't this the perfectly good alternative that the fellow has when he receives the gun."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1436.967,1438.08,"Nothing, not a thing, Mr. Justice White."
1967.236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.08,1449.936,"But why didn't -- why doesn't the fellow then -- when he gets the gun, make out his order and make sure that the transfer requirements to complied with?"
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1449.936,1456.024,"Oh, I think your question points up the very narrow issue that is involved here."
1967.236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.042,1460.062,"Well, I understand that."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1460.062,1460.785,And by the transfer requirements --
1967.236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.785,1471.926,"But you did say on the fact that if he doesn't go through that procedure, the transferee doesn't go through that procedure, that is incriminating him to require him to register the gun."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1471.926,1473.393,Yes.
1967.236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1473.393,1482.765,But you asked the Chief Justice that the fellow could be prosecuted for failure to declare.
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1482.765,1495.728,The analogy would be if you had a statute that any person who has already smuggled goods into the country must report the fact and the prosecution were not for smuggling but for not reporting.
1967.236,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1565.899,1584.641,"Do I understand, as you read these statutes that the upshot of it is that you have to confess to the violation of one criminal offense in order to have a defense to the violation of another."
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1599.159,1599.891,Yes.
1967.236,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1599.891,1600.579,Is that?
1967.236,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1601.189,1603.527,That's my position.
1967.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1608.335,1610.994,Mr. Weinstien.
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,1610.994,1617.418,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2045.234,2049.954,What would that kind of a maker be who is not a manufacturer?
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2049.954,2050.581,It would --
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2050.581,2061.344,"If that -- if I bought an ordinary shotgun, a bird-shooting shotgun and -- or a larger gauge, 12 gauge and then decided a sawed-off but I have to -- would I be a maker?"
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2061.344,2071.353,"Mr. Justice Stewart, you would be if the end result was a gun that was under 26 inches in overall length whether you took off part of the stock or part of the barrel."
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2071.353,2074.686,"But if it were 26 and 1/8 inches, I wouldn't be (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2074.686,2075.174,That's right.
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2084.129,2085.34,But I would be a maker then?
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2085.34,2088.806,You would be a maker and since you wouldn't be a manufacturer --
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2088.806,2089.764,I have to register it then?
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2089.764,2090.467,That's right.
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2097.627,2098.1,"Oh, I'm not --"
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2098.1,2103.774,-- for official use.
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2147.847,2148.993,Suppose I ?
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2148.993,2149.136,"Yes, sir."
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2149.136,2150.386,Excuse me.
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2200.929,2203.163,This is one of the charges that was brought?
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2203.163,2204.357,"Yes, it was brought but --"
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2204.357,2204.682,Yes.
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2204.682,2211.553,"-- those in the circumstance of the case, I understand it and alleged them, right?"
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2231.99,2232.487,I would think in the --
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2232.487,2234.828,-- for violation of law?
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2234.828,2239.603,"I would think in the circumstances of a gift, no."
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2239.603,2240.251,What did you say?
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2240.251,2243.619,"In the circumstances of a gift, you would not."
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2243.619,2243.925,"Well, that's --"
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2243.925,2244.158,In the --
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2244.158,2245.71,-- a transfer.
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2245.71,2251.753,It's a transfer but I don't think that you at that point at the moment of receiving it.
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2283.633,2286.646,"Well, I think that's Professor Wright's point."
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2316.239,2321.131,Where you received the gun and transfer that you participated in --
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2321.131,2321.373,"Now, but that's --"
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2321.373,2321.873,I would --
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2321.873,2323.34,-- Professor Wright's point.
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2323.34,2323.36,Yes.
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2323.36,2342.932,"Professor Wright says that therefore this is an incriminating act on the count of what I do, the mere -- by the mere fact of possession of the gun, if I register it then I am incriminating myself?"
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2357.54,2370.797,"Oh, while we recognize that statute applies to that, we -- I think there are two crimes in question here and I think we've got to distinguish which we're talking about."
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2411.7,2419.972,But isn't that smack of the old Kahriger and Lewis arguments that you don't have to commit a crime.
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2422.671,2422.912,I think it's --
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2422.912,2429.365,"-- and therefore, that takes any force at all out of Fifth Amendment, that argument."
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2429.513,2430.102,I don't --
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2430.102,2432.143,"-- if you do, then you waive the Fifth Amendment."
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2434.836,2444.274,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I don't think it's a waiver argument because if you make the inquiry in advance, there should be lawful means of acquiring a gun."
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2459.768,2481.347,"Well, as I understand the argument that Mr. Wright at least to give this that the statute makes it as Justice Fortas' question illustrate it, makes it an offense to possess a firearm as defined if anywhere back in the manufacturer or the chain of title there has not been a registration."
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2508.285,2509.192,"Well, if we're talking about --"
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2509.192,2510.589,You're guilty of a different offense.
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2510.589,2535.421,"If we're talking about the non-registration by some prior possessor, again, I would analogize that to the receipt of goods where that person receiving it has some reason to believe that it had been stolen, I think this statute puts on the person who's going to get the gun the obligation of inquiry when he knows he's going to get it."
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2543.622,2545.543,And he has the option of not buying it.
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2545.543,2545.84,He has an option --
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2545.84,2549.454,"That the man has an option of not committing a rape, I suppose assuming he's a (Inaudible) man."
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2549.454,2556.009,"Well, I prefer to say this man has the option not taking goods that he knows has been stolen."
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2556.009,2569.432,"The other crime, burglary, receiving stolen good, assault and battery, any of these things, and the argument leads to the fact that he -- since you have an option to do or not to do this criminal conduct, if you do it, you waive the Fifth Amendment."
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2576.388,2585.817,"As I understand it, this crime is different from the others that you listed because it goes to possession."
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2627.798,2674.679,"But I wonder if that really is the only argument that you've got to support this and I suppose that people have gone to the store and let's assume that these weapons can be purchased via mail or at the grocery store or something like that and I assume that a person who purchases one of these or takes a gift, it could be said and what could be argued that a person who puts his wallet, takes a gift doesn't have the same reason to know that it's taking some hot merchandise, doesn't have the same basic -- the knowing that he is taking a hot merchandise."
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2691.314,2692.534,"I think I do, and I think I (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2692.534,2709.906,"Oh, does that make a difference here or to put it in the more erudite language, perhaps this -- it's arguable in a way that this is not a situation permeated with illegality."
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2709.906,2715.852,That is exactly our position that it is permeated with the illegality and I think (Voice Overlap) --
1967.236,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2715.852,2730.224,"Unless if separate and apart from this business that you are discussing with my Brother Stewart about the option and choice and all that stuff, is that right?"
1967.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2730.224,2731.313,"Mr. Weinstein, may I ask you --"
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2731.313,2732.151,Yes Your Honor.
1967.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2732.151,2763.574,-- if there is in your any constitutional difference between the prosecution under 5851 as we have in this case and the prosecution of a defendant for having in his possession a gun that was imported into this country without having and declared it and paid the taxes under the custom laws.
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2763.574,2773.714,I'll have to confess I'm not sufficiently familiar to know what the elements of crime would be in that case but it -- I would say that that's in indistinguishable where it would be --
1967.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2773.714,2774.592,It's indistinguishable?
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2774.592,2789.64,Indistinguishable where the element of the -- where the claim of Fifth Amendment right is a -- that to declare the item coming through customs -- whether to confess the crime --
1967.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2789.64,2801.441,"Well, is he -- as a gambler, it says here, you make me register as a gambler and therefore, you violate my Fifth Amendment rights."
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2820.634,2828.724,I'm afraid that I would be (Inaudible) as if I try to compare a gamblers and smugglers when I'm not as familiar as I perhaps ought to be with --
1967.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2828.724,2829.16,Yes.
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2829.16,2829.993,-- both courts of the statute.
1967.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2829.993,2844.108,"Well in -- as then Mr. Justice Fortas would ask you about the pawnshops and that there've been other questions asked along the line, I just want to know what the implications of deciding this would be."
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2892.383,2902.955,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that I would start by saying that each statute of course has differences in drafting and I would hesitate to be too sweeping."
1967.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2902.955,2903.888,That's right.
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2903.888,2919.092,"But I do think that if this kind of registration is nullified, the pawnbroker requirement, the automobile registration requirement would have serious questions."
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2940.088,2953.625,"Wouldn't there be an extra-ordinary potential impact upon a -- what seems to be in the area of federal criminal law and much larger, a quantitative problem that is the narcotics laws."
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2953.625,2953.94,Yes sir.
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2953.94,2966.595,"Those are all drafted in terms of many, many of that -- much of that legislation and the only original legislation was drafted in terms of paying a tax, paying a duty, a possession of something on which the duty hadn't been paid."
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2966.595,2967.037,I think you'd say in --
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2967.037,2971.46,"You didn't have it -- this on, isn't that correct?"
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2971.46,2971.666,"Yes, (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2971.666,2981.873,"I mean, without again getting into the specific wording of the statute, certainly this would have quite an impact on that issue (Voice Overlap)"
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,2981.873,3003.484,"I think in -- say in the narcotics area for example, a person who is supposed to register and had made an illegal transaction beforehand would be able to claim that by registering it, he would be incriminating himself of the prior transaction."
1967.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3029.913,3031.749,Would you speak a little louder please?
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,3031.749,3048.937,We would first disagree with that legal proposition because it would be putting Mr. Haynes in the position of resting on the supposed rights of some people whom we don't know and in situations we know nothing about.
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3062.249,3063.284,I'm not -- I didn't quite (Voice Overlap) --
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,3063.284,3071.613,"Well, we would be letting him take advantage of somebody else's failure to comply with the Act for re -- for an --"
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3071.613,3075.246,"This -- is this a matter of standing or what is this, some --"
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,3075.246,3075.637,I think --
1967.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3075.637,3085.232,Is this a matter of standing or is it -- or is your point that the Fifth Amendment prohibits compulsory self-incrimination not compulsory incrimination of somebody else.
1967.236,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,3086.798,3092.329,I think it is essentially that it prohibits self-compulsory -- self-incrimination.
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3698.459,3703.361,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.236,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3821.406,3823.179,Now where do you say that?
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3829.639,3830.52,Yes.
1967.236,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3830.52,3833.755,Now show me where you said that.
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3833.755,3843.341,"I don't fill out the form, sir, unless I felt to comply with the transfer provisions when -- unless there has been a failure of complying the transfer provisions."
1967.236,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3843.341,3849.428,"I'm taking this intriguing transaction between you and Mr. Weinstein, now, you've got the gun."
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3849.428,3850.031,I have the gun.
1967.236,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3850.031,3852.604,And you go to the -- do you go register it?
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3852.604,3852.729,"Yes, sir."
1967.236,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3852.729,3853.36,Is that right?
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3877.726,3879.079,I don't believe it does.
1967.236,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3879.079,3883.945,"So all you have to do, you don't even have to say you got it from Mr. Weinstein, do you?"
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3883.945,3885.957,I have to state the name and address of the manufacturer.
1967.236,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3887.083,3890.355,So that would be shown on -- that would be shown on the gun used.
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3890.355,3891.74,"No, no because these are all guns --"
1967.236,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3891.74,3892.075,"Well, alright."
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3892.075,3893.744,-- that somebody's made at home.
1967.236,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3893.744,3897.688,"Well, some of them are and some of them are guns that has been altered at home."
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3897.688,3898.561,Yes.
1967.236,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3898.561,3900.996,But -- and I don't know what these means.
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3908.298,3909.199,That's right.
1967.236,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3909.199,3921.253,"All you have to do is to fill out this form and say that you own it, and you possess it and you acquired it and tell him where you usually keep it and when you were born and stuff like that."
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3921.253,3936.68,"And don't you think, Mr. Justice Fortas, that when the United States undertakes to prosecute me for a possession of a gun that has been made or transferred in violation of making a transfer provisions that it is going to be powerful evidence on behalf of the Government."
1967.236,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3953.025,3965.02,"Well, you mean the fact, the mere -- the fact that you went up there and registered and you say from that and there'll be a permissible inference that you had a guilty conscience."
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3965.02,3973.706,"There is at minimum a permissible inference and on the reading the Ninth Circuit gives to 5851, the Government has now made a prima facie case."
1967.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3973.706,3983.896,"Yes, but do you read there, it sound like, (Inaudible)?"
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3983.896,3985.476,"That's right, I can see that."
1967.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3985.476,4000.113,"And so, you still think the Government though, when it sees a registration to come in, its going to say to itself, ""Well, this must has been in an unlawful acquisition rather than a lawful acquisition"", although we know there are some lawful acquisition."
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4000.113,4016.396,The Government has gone to think that this isn't a transaction that bears very close investigation and even if it happens that minus one of those rare cases in which the acquisition was lawful and I'm there for registering only because I'm a law abiding citizen.
1967.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4023.584,4030.469,"But this is measurably different than refusing, taking a privilege on showing the source of your income on income tax returns, doesn't it?"
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4030.469,4033.807,I do not understand how that can be used an evidence against me.
1967.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4033.807,4041.369,"It's a quite the -- but if this is quite a tipoff to the Government, the Government might say this is very, very -- that this bears very close to scrutiny --"
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4041.369,4041.547,Yes it might.
1967.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4041.547,4049.377,"-- just like your -- just like the registration of a gun, where some of what -- even though the acquisition might be legal."
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4049.377,4051.047,I grant that it would.
1967.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4064.866,4072.031,"Well, he has prepared -- you see we are at a stage of the case where you object to the introduction of the registration point."
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4101.468,4103.587,That is just what I'm saying.
1967.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4103.587,4105.83,"Yes, you're saying the statute is unconstitutional on its face."
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4105.83,4121.461,I'm saying the statute is unconstitutional on its face that a constitutional statute could be drafted to require a registration of lawfully acquired guns and that there are already enough statutes on the books that penalize the unlawful acquisition of guns.
1967.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4122.002,4147.938,"Mr. Wright, just to -- (Inaudible) as required to the applicant permitted to (Inaudible) -- is that the only application forms, do you know --"
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4147.938,4148.219,So far as I know --
1967.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4148.219,4152.259,Of course they're 5841 or 5851?
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4152.259,4155.133,"If it's not on the registration form, I don't believe --"
1967.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4155.133,4155.542,It's not.
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4159.183,4160.24,When you're making a transfer.
1967.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4160.24,4170.207,"That's form for firearms and then there's a declaration of intent to make a firearm, form 1A firearm, requires fingerprint from the applicant."
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4170.207,4173.629,Fingerprints and photograph too.
1967.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4173.629,4177.491,"But the registration form does not, you're telling me?"
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4177.491,4178.88,"Yes, that's correct."
1967.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4178.88,4190.663,Have you thought of the -- or looked into at all the impact of the argument you are making to us today in the Federal Narcotic Laws?
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4190.663,4212.104,"I have thought about it of course and then anticipated that the -- that would be a matter of concern to the Court and I finally concluded that Justice, I see a significant differences between the wagering scheme and the Firearms Act so the Narcotic Statutes are such a different statutory scheme and I think they would have to stand on our own bottom."
1967.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4237.393,4249.604,"Well, there is a presumption that a possessor of narcotics is in possession of narcotics upon which the tax had not been paid and it's up to him to rebut that presumption."
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4265.716,4266.385,I think if (Voice Overlap) --
1967.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4266.385,4268.117,"-- or not, I don't have the .(Voice Overlap) --"
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4268.117,4270.42,I've prefer really not to answer that question.
1967.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4274.082,4289.637,"But there, it's pretty clear that this, at least briefly, would get pretty close to some of those narcotic laws which are on the same general area of the Fifth Amendment concern, is it not?"
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4289.637,4300.335,Only if the Congress in adopting the Narcotics Laws indulge in this unnecessary -- a form of legislation as I did in my submissions here.
1967.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4300.335,4303.621,But it can be argued as someone know it did.
1967.236,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4303.621,4311.2,Perhaps so and if so then I would not flinch from making of it in the argument against them.
1967.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4311.2,4316.661,We recess now.
