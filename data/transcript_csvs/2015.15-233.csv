2015.15-233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.12,"We'll hear argument next in Case 15-233, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust and the consolidated case. Mr. Landau."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,11.12,58.165,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents the question whether Congress has stripped Puerto Rico of access to any legal mechanism to restructure the debts of its public utilities which provide essential services to its citizens, like electricity and water. Respondents contend that Congress denied Puerto Rico access to Chapter 9 altogether, but left Puerto Rico subject to Chapter 9's preemption provision. That anomalous result can't be squared with the statute's text and structure. Congress, in 1984, defined the word ""State"" in the Bankruptcy Code generally to include Puerto Rico, except for the purposes of determining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9."
2015.15-233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,87.745,135.38,"Mr. Landau, that's true. Don't you run up against, with respect to the Puerto Rico -- Puerto Rico's legislation, the Contract Clause, the -- the bar against impairing contracts; that Puerto Rico can't impair the lenders' contracts? So apart from -- so if there's -- if we're dealing only with the Puerto Rico legislation, doesn't that, in -- in requiring nonconsenting lenders to give up or have their claims reduced, Puerto Rico is violating the Contract Clause?"
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,135.38,141.025,"Your Honor, the Respondents here have certainly brought Contract Clause claims."
2015.15-233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,192.845,200.135,"Why would Congress preclude Puerto Rico from Chapter 9? In other words, what -- what is the background of this provision?"
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,200.135,200.73,"Sure, Your Honor."
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,324.09,333.09,Is there any compact with those other Territories that precludes them from using their Territorial power to reorganize their debts?
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,333.09,334.005,"There is not, Your Honor."
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,361.19,364.35,I know that Guam and the Virgin Islands have Federal courts.
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,364.35,364.72,Yes.
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,364.72,366.11,And they have Federal judges.
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,376.995,379.02,"I think that, yes, Your Honor, it is."
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,393.39,394.91,"Well, that's the open issue that --"
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,394.91,395.33,"Yes, that is --"
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,395.33,396.11,-- has to go on remand.
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,396.11,396.73,-- an open issue.
2015.15-233,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,431.92,440.69,"Mr. Landau, could I ask you to focus on the text here a little bit? Because this gateway theory of yours, I'm not sure it matches up with the text very well."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,470.855,477.96,"That is an absolutely critical point, Your Honor, and that goes to an interesting point of the structure of the Code."
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,528.775,533.9,"Mr. Landau, I'm not sure I understand that argument, so you're going to have to back up a minute."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,533.9,534.19,Okay.
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,537.16,556.03,"It's, I think, critical to your point, which is, Justice Kagan asked a direct question: Why couldn't Congress have said much more directly, under 101, the term ""State"" includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico except for Chapter 9?"
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,556.03,556.75,Because --
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,556.75,565.74,"If Puerto Rico is not a State for Chapter 9, then it couldn't have authorized its municipality to file under 109."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,570.99,575.99,That 109 provision that Your Honor just referenced is not located in Chapter 9.
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,722.63,725.43,But then it has two other clauses which are the key clauses.
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,725.43,726.06,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,726.06,731.255,And the trouble that I have is where it says -- the same problem that Justice Kagan raised.
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,743.925,744.73,"No -- but, Your Honor --"
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,744.73,752.495,"Let -- let me show you. The term ""State,"" just as she said it, includes the District of -- of Columbia and Puerto Rico."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,752.495,753.0,Right.
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,753.0,758.265,"Where do we find that? In the first part of Title 11, which has to do with bankruptcy."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,792.23,799.375,"Again, Your Honor, if you look at this as the decision tree, you're already looking down here at the third -- at the third --"
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,799.375,809.715,"What the first part of the tree says is, State, nothing we say really stops you from controlling your municipality, except in one important respect."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,809.715,810.28,Right.
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,810.28,814.13,And the important respect is that you cannot have your own bankruptcy law.
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,814.13,818.6,"But logically, that 903(1) part that you were referring to --"
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,818.6,818.945,Yeah.
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,818.945,820.09,-- doesn't make any sense.
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,820.09,821.37,But I read it as a decision tree.
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,822.3,822.6,Okay.
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,855.79,856.14,I know that.
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,856.14,856.32,Okay.
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,858.08,858.85,They can't be a debtor.
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,858.85,859.14,Okay.
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,904.94,925.135,"So -- so then where -- where -- where in the Code, except for this provision -- are there dozens of places? 20? A thousand? -- where the word ""State"" is used outside of Chapter 9's debtor provisions where then it makes sense to read Puerto Rico into it?"
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,925.135,926.0,There's about 40.
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,926.0,926.29,About 40?
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,926.29,927.38,"And in fact, if you look at the legislation --"
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,927.38,928.42,And you have them in your brief?
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,928.42,931.06,I don't know that we have tallied them up in our --
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,931.06,933.005,"No, no, but I -- is there some reference? I can get them?"
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,933.005,935.85,"I -- I believe, yes, Your Honor, they -- they -- we --"
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,935.85,946.91,"But in all those provisions, debtor, creditor, State play active roles in implementing the provisions of those chapters."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,946.91,947.555,Correct.
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,947.555,951.435,"So in all the other 40 places, the State is involved --"
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,951.435,952.245,Correct.
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,952.245,961.885,"-- by -- inherent in the definition of what a debtor and what a creditoror is, the State has rights and responsibilities under those provisions."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,961.885,962.58,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,962.58,969.78,"What you -- what I'm understanding you to say is, Puerto Rico has been kicked out of Chapter 9 altogether."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,971.56,972.73,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,973.14,978.95,"And so to read it as being involved as a State, the only other place that's used is here."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,978.95,979.805,Correct.
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,979.805,983.925,"In 903, you have to be part of it in some way."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,983.925,985.01,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1026.77,1038.44,"Mr. Landau, this is not very different from what we did in -- last year in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. the EPA."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1060.695,1061.92,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1062.13,1063.745,But you didn't cite Utility Air.
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1065.395,1086.93,"Well, Your Honor, I think we cited King v. Burwell, and there -- there are many cases for the proposition that you can't just look at one isolated provision in context and not understand -- excuse me, one isolated provision and not understand how that fits into the context. Again, I think Respondents are asking you to just pick up this case, read 903(1) and say, here it is."
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1086.93,1092.89,All I have to do is to get myself to do the following thing: I could dress it up so people couldn't understand it.
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1103.665,1104.25,Right.
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1104.25,1108.65,"Now, all I have to say is that word ""State"" right there does not include Puerto Rico."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1108.65,1109.35,Because Puerto --
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1109.35,1121.62,"My only problem with writing those words is somebody is going to direct me to the provision a little bit later where it says the word ""State"" in Title 11, of which this is part, means Puerto Rico."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1122.115,1123.265,"Well, Your Honor --"
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1123.265,1130.1,"Now, that -- that's hard for me to do because of that language."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1130.1,1136.88,"But, Your Honor, I would -- Your Honor has always been so sensitive to the contextual approach to --"
2015.15-233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1136.88,1141.11,"That may be, but I can't say that an ""airplane"" means a horse. (Laughter.)"
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1141.11,1161.75,"And I totally -- no, but, Your Honor, if -- if somebody is saying this doesn't apply to driving, and then this one is about a -- a subsequent provision is about a right turn on red regulation, you'd say, no, but driving has been taken completely out of the statute. In other words, you are in a position -- by the time you get to -- this is kind of a truism."
2015.15-233,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1204.03,1207.76,"So, Mr. Landau, I -- I think I get what you're saying now, which I didn't when I started with."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1227.35,1228.255,"Precisely, Your Honor."
2015.15-233,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1228.255,1239.245,"So -- but before 1984, before this amendment, this 903(1) did apply to Puerto Rico; wasn't that right?"
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1239.245,1241.515,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
2015.15-233,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1241.515,1274.395,"So you're saying that the really super significant change, which is 903(1) applies to Puerto Rico before 1984, and then doesn't apply after 1984 because of this definitional move that they made here in 101(52). What you have to admit is -- I'm not quite sure what the -- the word -- I mean, it's a -- it would be a mysterious way, it would be an extremely kind of cryptic odd way to make such a major change."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1274.395,1279.39,"Your Honor, but the major -- let me just -- I -- I would say --"
2015.15-233,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1279.39,1285.01,"I mean, it's almost like somebody doesn't want everybody to recognize what a major change is being made --"
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1285.01,1285.47,Your Honor --
2015.15-233,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1285.47,1293.415,"-- and figured out this way that is -- where nobody would understand that that was happening, including the judges who would have to decide what this meant. (Laughter.)"
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1293.415,1304.66,"The major -- Your Honor, the major changes work both ways because the major -- the one point I would just compliment what Your Honor said, which is prior to 1984 --"
2015.15-233,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1304.66,1304.81,Please.
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1304.81,1305.405,-- of course -- (Laughter.)
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1305.405,1309.86,-- Puerto Rico was within the remedial scope of Chapter 9.
2015.15-233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1364.285,1368.925,"Well, that's -- I mean, that's your basic policy argument, and I'm not sure it carries much weight."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1385.385,1386.46,"Well, again, Your Honor --"
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1386.46,1390.08,Why not treat it like -- why not treat it like every other Territory?
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1390.08,1391.1,"Well, exactly right."
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1391.41,1394.93,That's the mouse in -- that's the mouse in -- in the hole --
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1394.93,1395.48,It is.
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1395.655,1402.41,"-- which is if you're going to treat it differently, wouldn't you expect them to say that? We're going to treat it not like a State and not like a Territory."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1402.41,1402.91,Absolutely.
2015.15-233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1411.63,1415.76,"And that's a very -- you came up with a very good answer, Mr. Landau, to my question."
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1430.735,1433.83,"Well, again, Your Honor, Congress made this decision."
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1517.985,1537.955,Have you given up the Government Development Bank's position and that of some of the amici that the provision of 903(1) applies to States only when a debtor is in a Chapter 9 proceeding because of that provision's use of creditor?
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1537.955,1540.88,"Your Honor, we have not advanced that argument."
2015.15-233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1545.94,1547.4,Are you rejecting the argument?
2015.15-233,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1547.4,1550.0,We just didn't reach it because we don't need to get there.
2015.15-233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.625,1577.345,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. McGill."
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1577.345,1608.09,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Everyone here agrees that in 1984, Congress withdrew from Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia the power to put their municipalities into Chapter 9 bankruptcy. Petitioners' position is that by the same enactment, Congress impliedly gave Puerto Rico and the District a much greater power that no State has possessed since 1946, the power to write its own municipal laws."
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1608.09,1615.805,"Well, no State has possessed the power to impair contract rights under the Constitution."
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1626.015,1626.47,Justice --
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1626.47,1627.77,"-- in a meaningful way, correct?"
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1627.77,1629.63,"Yes, but Justice Sotomayor --"
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1629.63,1629.85,All right.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1647.535,1648.155,And they were.
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1648.155,1648.75,Exactly.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1648.75,1653.46,The Contract Clause applied directly to Puerto Rico by dint of the Jones Act from 1917.
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1653.46,1683.335,"So you think Congress intended to stop Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia from passing emergency legislation that said don't shut off the lights tonight; that -- that Congress intended that that kind of temporary provision could only be subject to Congress, who may be on recess, who might be wherever it is, that it could not do that?"
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1683.335,1694.18,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor, because in 1946 that was precisely the decision Congress made when it decided to overrule this Court's decision in Faitoute."
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1694.18,1701.44,"Well, it decided to overrule it by giving States the opportunity to go into bankruptcy, and that would be a temporary state to start with."
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1701.44,1715.4,"So -- so the question is, as I understand it, Justice Sotomayor, is what was Congress doing in 1984? Was it -- we all know that it removed from the District and from Puerto Rico the opportunity to put its municipalities into Chapter 9 --"
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1715.4,1715.86,And it never gave --
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1715.86,1716.56,-- everyone agrees --
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1716.56,1718.725,And it never gave the Territories that.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1730.05,1733.02,"Justice Sotomayor, that's not correct, I don't believe."
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1820.33,1835.8,"Doesn't the definitional section of the Code tell you who qualifies as a debtor, who qualifies as a creditor, who can go into what chapter or not? It tells you if you're this kind of creditor, you go into that chapter."
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1853.08,1873.26,"Today that's true, but it wasn't true when Chapter 9 was first enacted in 1934 and 1937. In 1934, the gateway provision was Section 83 -- I mean Section 81 of the '34 Act, which was then known as Chapter X or Chapter 10, and it was Section 83(a) again in 1937."
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1886.18,1890.85,"Oh, but it is, because it tells you what kind of debtors can make use of what kind of provision."
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1890.85,1892.19,But that was always true.
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1892.58,1893.23,It is always.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1895.31,1901.52,"But -- no, no, but it was true when it was part of Chapter 9 -- old Chapter X and old Chapter IX."
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1934.96,1960.575,"So if the -- if the definitional section defines ""State"" to include Puerto Rico, and you say even though it's not a part of Chapter 9 by definition in 109, it still remains a State for purposes of this reservation of State powers? Why aren't we using ""creditor"" in 903 as it's used in the Bankruptcy Code?"
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1960.575,1961.15,As --
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1961.15,1966.385,"If you're going to be literal as to ""State,"" why aren't you literal as to ""creditor""?"
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1966.385,1971.025,"As the Commonwealth, I think, here has acknowledged, it -- it has abandoned that argument."
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1988.3,1988.95,But let's go back.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,1995.16,2009.92,"Because we are applying a principle that this Court laid down in Lawson and that it unanimously reaffirmed in Northwest Austin that when a statutory definition mechanically applied will annihilate a major purpose of the statute, then you don't apply it."
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2012.74,2015.22,So how do I read into the statute?
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2015.22,2027.14,"It would annihilate the major purpose of the 1946 Act, which was to -- which was to prevent States from enacting their own bankruptcy laws. And that is your --"
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2027.14,2035.49,"Well, you actually can't do that, meaning you can't do that according to our prior precedent."
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2066.07,2066.74,Yes.
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2069.64,2093.225,"Actually, so why do so many major commentators, bankruptcy writers, district and circuit courts, the Sixth Circuit included, have said that that's impossible; that you can't rob a State of the power to regulate its municipalities if you're offering it nothing in return?"
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2093.225,2106.28,"In 1946, the preemptive scope of what is now Section 903(1) embraced any municipality. It barred States from enacting -- it's essentially the same language that exists today."
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2113.21,2117.78,And then we said in Faitoute that you can't force States --
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2117.78,2118.295,This was --
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2118.295,2120.625,-- to go into bankruptcy.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2120.625,2131.22,"I believe that was Ashton. And -- and -- and it was -- and of course, Bekins subsequently readdresses Ashton, and -- and at least narrows Ashton."
2015.15-233,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2172.11,2172.64,Mr. McGill --
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2172.64,2178.215,Sturges v. Crowninshield said that -- that Congress's power under the Bankruptcy Code is unlimited and supreme. I'm sorry.
2015.15-233,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2178.215,2185.94,Can I talk to you about Mr. Landau's textual argument? Because I came in here thinking that your best argument is straight on the text.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2253.67,2264.97,It's -- it starts -- I think the fundamental fallacy of the argument is that the gateway requirement somehow excludes you from the scope of Chapter 9 entirely.
2015.15-233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2297.56,2299.155,But it doesn't have to be just that.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2447.995,2449.62,I have two --
2015.15-233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2449.62,2451.49,You got it? Do you see what I'm saying?
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2451.49,2453.15,Two -- two responses.
2015.15-233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2453.15,2453.24,Good.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2453.5,2464.14,"The first is the -- the textual response that you yourself, Justice Breyer, elaborated, that Congress spoke with remarkable precision here in 101(52)"
2015.15-233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2482.64,2484.255,But not -- no.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2493.99,2495.04,But States are not debtors.
2015.15-233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2495.04,2497.1,"-- whoa, whoa, whoa -- municipalities."
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2528.255,2532.42,So that misapprehends what Section 903 does.
2015.15-233,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2633.45,2648.92,"Mr. McGill, why would Congress put Puerto Rico in this never-never land? That is, it can't use Chapter 9, and it can't use a Puerto Rican substitute for Chapter 9."
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2670.68,2674.53,"There are a few reasons, I think."
2015.15-233,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2817.315,2850.295,"Well, Mr. -- Mr. McGill, if I could go back to Justice Breyer's question, because Justice Breyer gave you a view of the way to read this text, which is built on Mr. Landau's view, and said, what's wrong with that? And you -- you go with the gateway provision, and then even if not all of Chapter 9 follows in its wake, at least all the provisions in Chapter 9 that refer to debtors follow in its wake. And Justice Breyer said, what's wrong with that, as a way to read this text."
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2890.045,2897.585,Because 101(52) is an unmistakable textual reference to 109(c)
2015.15-233,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2908.68,2914.38,But that's -- that's a purpose that tells you whether you're now in Chapter 9 as a debtor.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2914.38,2914.765,But -- but --
2015.15-233,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2914.765,2935.83,"So what Mr. Landau is saying is once you say you're -- you're -- you're not a State, when it comes to who may be a debtor under Chapter 9, that it's a pretty natural thing to say, and that means that any provisions about being a debtor under Chapter 9 don't apply to you."
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2935.83,2942.2,"Let's be clear that States cannot be debtors, right? So it -- under Chapter 9."
2015.15-233,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2988.42,2990.55,But that's up to the State.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,2995.685,2998.39,"Well, that -- that is, of course, true."
2015.15-233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3018.1,3018.56,All right.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,3065.8,3066.31,It would have been --
2015.15-233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3066.31,3067.59,"And you say, well, there is a good reason."
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,3075.33,3089.51,"Well, it -- it certainly would have been a momentous change in -- in the policy of preemption that had existed uninterrupted since 1946 that had been reaffirmed in 1976 and in 1978."
2015.15-233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3100.18,3113.345,"Referencing that, can you give me one more thing? Give me your best either Law Review article, treatise, legislative history, whatever it is, that will -- that will show me that, in your view, look, these are separate things."
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,3123.05,3129.045,"I would look at this Court's cases in Iraq v. Beaty, Alaska v. United States, and Whitridge."
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3191.37,3221.48,"So you believe that the States that don't permit their municipality to become debtors are limited in what they can do by 903? In other words, their -- their municipalities are not debtors? Their sovereign powers have been cut off? They cannot reorganize the debt except through Chapter 9? Then we're talking about a coercive provision."
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,3258.355,3275.65,"You have, in your hypothetical, Justice Sotomayor, I believe, supposed that the -- that the composition does not violate the contract clause. And the question then would be one of statutory construction whether the composition you have hypothesized fits within the term of 901."
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3275.65,3277.165,Assume -- I assume it doesn't.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,3309.67,3311.56,Except under Chapter 9.
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3312.52,3312.91,All right.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,3319.19,3325.145,The -- the choice for States for -- that -- is Chapter 9 or nothing.
2015.15-233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3331.22,3337.775,It's like the Tenth Amendment right of States to deal with their municipalities consistent with the Constitution.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,3348.575,3357.39,"Well, the contract clause, I think, stands as an independent bar to any -- to any impairment of the obligation of contracts."
2015.15-233,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3379.09,3386.41,Isn't there also legislation to put Puerto Rico back in Chapter 9?
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,3386.41,3388.69,May -- may I answer?
2015.15-233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3388.69,3389.72,Yes.
2015.15-233,1,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,3389.72,3412.39,"Yes, there is, Justice Ginsburg, just like in -- Puerto Rico is -- Congress is considering a range of options for Puerto Rico, including Chapter 9, just as Congress considered a range of options for the District of Columbia during its own financial crisis in the 1990s, which resulted in a financial control board rather than Chapter 9."
2015.15-233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3412.39,3416.05,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Landau, you have four minutes remaining."
