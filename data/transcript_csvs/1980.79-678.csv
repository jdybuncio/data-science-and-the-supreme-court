1980.79-678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.779,We will hear arguments in San Diego Gas & Electric Company v. City of San Diego.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,62.302,64.505,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,100.131,104.724,But your premise is that there was a taking in this case?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,104.724,105.459,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,107.113,109.799,"But that's disputed, I suppose?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,109.799,110.643,It is disputed.
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,111.221,115.329,And if we agreed with your opposition we wouldn't reach the question again.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,115.673,118.015,"--That's possible, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,127.777,136.632,"Well, am I wrong that the latest order of the intermediate appellate court leaves open the question whether there was a taking?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,136.632,137.164,I don't believe--
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,137.164,144.271,"Initially, there was a finding, you know, that there was a taking, both by the initial court and by the appellate division, was there not?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,144.271,144.863,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,144.863,152.642,"But then I thought, when... what's this strange practice of a transfer by your Supreme Court to the appellate court?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,154.079,158.03,"It's a... it is, in effect, a remand of the same case, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,158.03,159.873,"Well, does it vacate the judgment clause?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,165.027,168.275,"That's correct, Your Honor, but under California practice it would have been vacated anyway."
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,180.77,185.612,"Well, and then, doesn't the appellate court send it back leaving still open the question of taking?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,185.612,188.955,They sent it back for reconsideration in light of their Agins decision.
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,197.437,199.811,"See, what I'm reaching at, is there a final judgment here?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,202.654,204.855,"--Well, I think you do, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,204.855,205.949,On the taking question?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,205.949,218.412,"In regard to this taking away this judgment, the California Court of Appeal specifically stated that a local agency's arbitrary, unconstitutional exercise of the police power does not require compensation."
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,227.377,230.453,"Well, this is an appeal from the Court of Appeal's judgment?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,230.453,231.609,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,231.609,235.578,Because any further appeal was refused?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,235.578,243.137,"The second time around, so to speak, the California Supreme Court denied hearing, and therefore we brought this appeal to this Court."
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,243.137,248.681,"Mr. Goebel, your client, as I understand it, wants to build a power plant on this land."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,249.056,254.334,"Your Honor, that was the original intention at the time of acquisition of this property in 1966."
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,254.678,258.818,"The taking, the theory of the taking, is that you're denied the right to build the plant you planned on building?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,258.818,261.457,--Build the plant or some other industrial use.
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,262.644,270.609,"Well, supposing, when the case goes back to the trial court, the trial court enters an order that says, let them build either a power plant or some other industrial use."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,273.78,277.202,"--As it happens... I'll answer that on two levels, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,284.526,286.384,What do you want to use the land for?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,286.384,293.381,"To devote the property to a use that was perfectly consistent with the zoning and planning at the time they acquired it, some industrial use."
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,293.381,294.802,Give me an example of what you'd like to use the land for?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,294.802,297.88,"A well-planned, designed industrial park."
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,297.88,298.207,All right.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,312.109,315.514,"That's not the California practice as I understand it, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,337.003,339.315,You don't think you get any relief at all on remand?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,339.315,340.831,We'd have an opportunity--
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,340.831,349.39,"Would you have an opportunity on remand to ask the judge to say, please enter an order that will allow us to develop this as an industrial park?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,349.39,352.842,--That is not the practice under administrative relief.
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,352.842,355.544,"I know it's not the practice, but you've claimed your constitutional rights have been denied you."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,363.228,368.759,"I assume there is power and jurisdiction to grant that relief, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,369.163,370.288,How do we know he's not going to do it?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,370.288,384.391,"--I think that in light of the decision in the Agins case and in our case when it was previously before the courts, that that's not likely to happen."
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,384.391,389.343,"Well, Mr. Goebel, what's the significance of that sentence in the second opinion of the appellate court,"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,399.463,400.088,Well--
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,400.088,403.088,It sounds like you didn't exhaust your administrative remedies.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,403.088,411.833,"--Your Honor, it is correct that the property owner has not submitted a specific development proposal to the City and been denied."
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,423.407,425.454,"Well, why does the Court of Appeal throw this in in the second opinion?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,425.454,429.327,"I'm not certain, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,449.803,451.74,Let me be a little more specific.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,457.113,460.268,"It would have been in the early '70s, Your Honor, prior to the--"
1980.79-678,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,460.268,462.08,Do you know what the basis of that decision was?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,462.08,476.294,"--A number of changing concerns by the Company, and also the changing regulatory climate in California in terms of environmental constraints, building power plants near the ocean, and so forth."
1980.79-678,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,476.294,479.354,Have you ever tried to sell any of the property in question?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,479.354,483.807,"Not prior to the trial of this action, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,494.864,495.958,Have you had any offers to purchase?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,495.958,497.239,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,497.239,504.861,"But, in any event, the appellant never sought approval for a nuclear plant?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,504.861,506.533,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,540.877,547.719,And yet they purported to bring within the possibility a nuclear power plant.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,547.719,554.044,We believe that was a cynical--
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,554.044,560.149,"Well, tell me, Mr. Goebel, could the City, I take it, repeal this ordinance?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,561.009,563.727,"--It could repeal it and modify it; yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,563.727,565.024,"Well, suppose it repealed it."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,589.607,592.856,"Since that was not the case before the Court, we can't say for sure, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,604.586,607.211,Isn't Agins itself a precedent?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,612.255,618.784,"Agins is the controlling precedent, and in our view that's the precedent that caused the Court of Appeal to do a 180 and--"
1980.79-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,618.784,620.612,"But Agins is not before us, is it?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,620.612,621.018,--Pardon me?
1980.79-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,621.018,622.626,"Agins is not before us, is it?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,622.626,623.58,"No, Your Honor, you disposed--"
1980.79-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,623.58,625.735,Don't you really want us to reverse Agins?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,625.735,628.468,--I want you to declare--
1980.79-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,628.468,629.843,"We can't do it, I don't think."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,629.843,631.748,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think that's true."
1980.79-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,632.092,633.295,"Well, isn't that really what you want?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,633.295,646.382,"--In Agins, this Court, as I understand the opinion, found that there was no taking, and therefore did not reach the question of whether a state could limit a property owner whose property has been taken by regulatory conduct to equitable remedies only."
1980.79-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,659.143,660.096,"Well, you want us to write an essay?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,660.096,671.342,"No, Your Honor, we'd simply like to have the money judgment affirmed on the basis of the Fifth Amendment and settle precedent of this Court from Pennsylvania Coal to Penn Central."
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.342,680.729,Suppose you agreed with me that... or agreed with the suggestion that there is no final decision on taking in the California courts.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,700.142,701.611,"Well, that's a possibility, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.611,711.311,"Well, then, where do you... where do you put your finger on a final decision that there is a taking, in the California courts?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,711.311,719.729,I can't put my finger on the fact that there is a final decision of the California courts that there is a taking.
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,732.724,735.442,"Well, that finding was never disavowed or reversed, was it?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,735.442,747.453,"--In effect it was, because the consequence of that taking, that is, the flowing of money damages under the Fifth Amendment, was taken away by the Court of Appeal."
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,747.453,768.788,"Well, your California court has held that when a taking is the result of the unconstitutional and arbitrary use of the exercise of the police power, there is no condemnation, although I expect that it would hold that when the taking is the result of the wholly legitimate use of the taking power, there is."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,771.443,777.972,"That's correct, Your Honor, and we think it is totally in violation with the Fifth Amendment and the settled precedents of this Court--"
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,777.972,786.734,"In other words, you don't have to claim, it seems to me, under the Just Compensation Clause that this taking was wrongful in any way."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,805.992,806.6,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,806.6,817.222,"But your California court has held, presumably, that while you are entitled to compensation when the taking is wholly rightful, you're not entitled to it when the taking is wrongful."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,817.222,819.674,We view that as a very bizarre--
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,819.674,821.204,"It is bizarre, if that's the--"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,821.204,824.063,"--position, Your Honor, and furthermore, I want to--"
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,824.063,825.125,--Does that correctly characterize it?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,825.125,825.625,--I think so.
1980.79-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,836.074,838.978,"Mr. Goebel, will you give me in the record exactly what you're appealing from?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,838.978,841.025,We're appealing from the--
1980.79-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,841.025,844.772,I'm speaking of an order or... or something that looks like an order.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,847.786,854.472,"--Judgment of the Court of Appeal on the second occasion, Your Honor, which is found in the Joint Appendix."
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,854.472,856.939,G1 of your jurisdictional statement.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,856.939,858.189,Of the jurisdictional statement.
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,884.772,886.802,"Well, it seems to me that you're mixing up two things."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,910.574,917.728,"Well, I won't... if I was not faced with the bizarre position of the California Supreme Court, I wouldn't have to take that position."
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,931.254,933.596,"Well, you're suggesting its wrongful only in the sense they didn't give you any money?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,933.596,934.377,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,934.377,934.736,"Well, that's all right."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,937.829,942.655,"That's the essence of it, Your Honor, whatever label we put on it, it--"
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,942.655,956.025,"But assume that it was perfectly clear in the California courts that the courts had decided, (a) there is a taking; (b) that you're not entitled to any money, however; you're entitled only to an injunction."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,969.769,980.827,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor, because the sole question that's open in California courts as I understand it is the question of whether declaratory or equitable relief might be available."
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,980.827,988.528,"Yes, but we don't need to accept the California court's holding that there is a taking for Fifth Amendment purposes, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment purposes?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,988.528,989.746,No.
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.746,1000.445,"And so, isn't the other side entitled to insist on an affirmance based on the ground that there is not a taking?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1000.445,1012.674,"If you don't accept the California court's position on taking, it's my position that we proved in the trial court... and you can examine the record and affirm... that there was a taking."
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1016.204,1016.766,But you lost below?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1016.766,1018.172,"No, we won below."
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1019.266,1021.686,"No, but you lost... you're an appellant here."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1021.686,1022.061,--Yes.
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.061,1023.951,No matter how far below you go.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1027.653,1028.168,That's correct.
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1028.168,1029.277,So you were a loser.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1029.277,1033.104,"Only in that court, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1033.104,1034.479,"Yes, where you were a loser."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1046.725,1052.238,"I don't understand that to be the proper result, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1058.907,1061.25,"Yes, but isn't that question open here?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1062.671,1071.074,The only question that remains for the California courts to decide is whether or not they will choose on the basis of these facts to grant equitable relief.
1980.79-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1078.18,1079.258,You need more money?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1079.258,1080.367,"We want money, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1080.367,1082.069,"That's what you want, money."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1104.17,1105.279,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1105.279,1108.839,"Now, if they grant that relief, how could there then have been a taking?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1112.635,1121.35,"Yes, Your Honor, but it's our position that the first cause of action established that a taking occurred and that we were entitled to litigate that--"
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.35,1122.913,"You're making sort of a law of the case, are you?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1122.913,1132.205,"--In state court, even... well, regardless of state law, we're entitled to litigate the federal constitutional tort aspect of those facts in state court."
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.205,1135.609,Let me put it more simply.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1141.591,1142.107,Yes.
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.107,1143.748,Of what?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1147.636,1151.588,But we have seven years after that--
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1151.588,1158.617,"Well, you might have a damage action for the loss of the use of the property in the seven years, but you have not alleged any intent to use the property in this period of time."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1171.61,1185.668,"--Well, Your Honor, it's our position that the so-called set-aside, those equitable remedies are constitutionally inadequate to remedy the nexus of combination of facts which result in what we allege to be a taking."
1980.79-678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1188.308,1202.786,"But if, when this case goes back, if it goes back, the trial court can find that you can build whatever you could have built initially, before the zoning change, haven't you got all the relief that you are entitled to?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1202.786,1203.582,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1204.895,1206.831,The interim damages too?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1206.831,1208.315,--Interim damages.
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1213.124,1220.201,"Yes, but are you entitled to the interim damages as the consequence of a taking, or just of deprivation of use for the seven or eight years?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1220.201,1232.743,"--If we are to accept the California Supreme Court's dichotomy between these two concepts, I think we're left with the interim damages as a result of the interim deprivation of use."
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1232.743,1238.757,"It's not consequent upon a taking if the ordinance that caused all the trouble, the difficulty for you."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1245.753,1254.623,"When that finally becomes a fact, it'll be ten to fifteen years after the fact of the events that--"
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1254.623,1256.701,You may have a claim for damages in ten or fifteen years.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1256.701,1262.808,"--But, as possible, I would hope that the Fifth Amendment--"
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1262.808,1271.977,"I thought a taking usually meant, as my brother Stewart suggested earlier, the government, whatever the unit may be, ends up with the property and you end up with money."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1285.128,1292.061,"--Your Honor, if you get a chance to go through the facts of this case, it's our position that we're not dealing with a single ordinance or even two or three ordinances."
1980.79-678,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.062,1382.104,"Mr. Goebel, let me ask you one question about the last paragraph of the opinion of the supreme court of California, F14 in the blue brief, where it says,"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1429.631,1434.63,"That's my understanding, Your Honor, and that certainly was the understanding of the California Court of Appeal."
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.59,1467.76,"But it... to be complete, it should have said, but of course he can get his property back."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1470.524,1472.976,--That's true.
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1474.726,1475.273,Yes.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1475.273,1477.304,It offers the property owners--
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1477.304,1480.77,But it doesn't leave the property owner without any remedy whatsoever.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1482.347,1483.597,--That's correct.
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1487.735,1488.391,"Well, it isn't illusory."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1491.375,1491.843,--It's not fully--
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.843,1495.795,"Which is a substantial matter, but it doesn't mean you can't use it forever."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1495.795,1505.166,"--It's not the full equivalent of the property taken, that this Court has repeatedly held is required under the Fifth Amendment from the Monongahela case on down."
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.166,1513.882,"Well, did the Court of Appeal just right out, as you say, indicate that there are no interim damages either?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1513.882,1516.195,They didn't deal with that question.
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.195,1519.365,"Well, that's... so your answer is, no, they did not say that?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1519.365,1520.708,They did not say one way or the other.
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.708,1537.794,"So that, let's assume that the California courts would say, you can't get... make us buy the property at the fair market value, but we'll give you an injunction against further enforcement of the restrictions and we'll give you interim damages."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1546.494,1556.943,On the basis of an ad hoc case-by-case determination we think there is still a category of cases where the only satisfactory remedy is money damages.
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.787,1559.333,"But you mean, for the whole property?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1560.646,1561.302,--For the property.
1980.79-678,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1561.302,1564.127,They would have to take title to the property and pay you for it?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1564.127,1574.358,"When you have, as in this case, a combination of four or five factors which through their own synergy come together and have the impact that we claim was present in this case."
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1574.358,1581.886,"Well, I gather, Mr. Goebel, your client's no longer interested in building the plant; let the City keep the property; it wants the money."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1581.886,1582.198,That's correct.
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1584.744,1586.978,"Well, can't the City back out if it wants to?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1586.978,1591.57,--That question really hasn't been dealt with in California.
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1591.57,1591.913,"Well, I know, but can't it?"
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1591.913,1592.851,I would think that--
1980.79-678,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1592.851,1600.629,"It would be compelled to, I take it, if the courts were to invalidate this synergistic combination that you have."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1600.629,1603.174,"--If you could do such a thing, Your Honor; if such a thing were possible."
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1628.133,1643.939,"It's not clear to me, and maybe I'm repeating myself, but it's not clear to me whether you argue that your client's entitled to money damages for a wrongful act of San Diego, or whether you're simply entitled to compensation because San Diego has taken your real property."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1645.205,1649.281,"--Let me try to address that without getting bound up in semantics, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1653.264,1653.764,Yes.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1653.764,1656.965,Whether it's by reason of constitutional or unconstitutional acts.
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1656.965,1660.604,"There is a difference, but compensation results from a perfectly rightful taking of property."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1660.604,1668.788,"In our view, the combination of the facts and circumstances of this case led to in June of 1973 a taking of this property."
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1668.788,1679.206,"So if it had been a perfectly valid exercise of the police power that would have taken your property, you would not have questioned the exercise of the police power, you would have simply said, please pay me for the property you've taken."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1679.206,1679.627,That's correct.
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1679.627,1686.672,"Not for any wrongful action on the part of San Diego, except insofar as it was wrong to not pay you."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1686.672,1687.406,Wrong to not pay.
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1687.875,1688.39,Right.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1693.608,1694.357,Right.
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1694.357,1695.185,If he takes it rightfully.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1711.897,1713.27,Owen--
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1713.27,1714.098,Owen isn't such a case.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1716.051,1716.363,--That's right.
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1718.893,1722.033,But this Court has never held there's any such obligation?
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1722.033,1724.829,It's stated the principle in a number of cases from Pennsylvania Coal to--
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.829,1732.185,"No, no, those are all rightful... those are all cases where it's held that the sovereign had the power to do what it sought to do."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1747.43,1752.442,"--Well, I think that's implicit in the Fifth Amendment."
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1752.442,1755.77,"Well, the Fifth Amendment deals with rightful taking, for the moment."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1766.671,1771.233,"Well, I think that's implicit in the Kaiser Aetna decision."
1980.79-678,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1771.233,1787.725,"We used to have cases like that quite frequently in the Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, where the claim was made that the government exceeded its authorized power in exercising its power of eminent domain for the purpose of taking something, not for a post office but for some marginal purpose."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1812.684,1820.025,"Well, the U.S. v. Causby is a similar case, except, of course, the appellants would say that involved aspects of physical invasion."
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1827.521,1837.222,"No, in Causby it was held that the government was within its rights in flying the airplanes over the property, and that what it did was rightful but it caused harm, and therefore was a taking and it had to pay for it."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1837.222,1847.389,"Well, I don't want to be led into the position that we're asserting by reason of your interpretation, the interpretation we're leading to here on the Fifth Amendment, that we're asserting this is a wrongful taking."
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1851.715,1855.838,"Well, in the second and third counts of your complaint you do, you allege... in your petition for mandate you allege it was wrongful."
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1855.838,1859.461,--Wrongful in the sense that they did it and they didn't pay for it.
1980.79-678,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1869.365,1871.222,You have an action for rent.
1980.79-678,0,34521,louis_e_goebel,,1871.222,1873.503,I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.
1980.79-678,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.503,1877.611,"Your time is entirely used up, counsel."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,1881.704,1885.217,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1891.277,1900.991,"At some point will you tell us what is the scope of the authority of the trial court, assuming this case went back?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,1906.302,1906.74,"--All right, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1910.238,1910.895,We'll bring it up again.
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,1910.895,1928.404,"I think the facts are crucial to get a grasp of what this case is all about, because we've got a number of confusing facts and a number of shifting and conflicting theories of liability and seeking of relief against the City of San Diego."
1980.79-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1966.982,1977.741,Does the plan forbid the owner to make anything of an open space without the approval of the municipal plan?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,1977.741,1979.788,"That's one of the issues that's in contention, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2026.879,2031.08,"Well, that's a factual issue, and this Court isn't here to decide factual issues."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2031.08,2071.22,"Yes, Your Honor, except in the circumstance of this case and the way it's come up, the City of San Diego appealed the trial court's findings of fact in the Court of Appeal and on up on the basis that there was no substantial evidence to support them, and the question, the findings on a taking, and the question of whether or not the Gas & Electric Company was excused from applying for some relief to avoid the problem that this Court saw in the Agins case, are really so intertwined and mixed with legal questions that I don't think you can completely separate them out from factual findings."
1980.79-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2071.22,2089.447,"Well, it's certainly not a factual question to say that if the City says that the 214 acres of the San Diego power company land that's presently open is hereafter a park with access to everybody, and no compensation is to be paid."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2089.447,2098.786,"The plan does not say that, and nothing the City of San Diego did or said contemplated that public use could be made of this property designated for open space."
1980.79-678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2100.224,2103.941,"Isn't that the definition of open space, isn't that a public--"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2103.941,2108.47,--It's to preserve land from being developed or overdeveloped and lost forever.
1980.79-678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2110.688,2115.655,--What's the difference if they declared it a park and put a lot of park benches in it and let the public use it?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2115.655,2117.984,The difference would be that the public is then actually using the property.
1980.79-678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2128.525,2131.821,But are you telling us now that the public is not using it by--
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2131.821,2134.117,"The public is not using it in any physical, sense."
1980.79-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2147.972,2155.53,--Are you saying that any members of the public who came on this land after it had been declared open land would have been trespassers?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2155.53,2156.42,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2156.42,2159.295,Against whom the electric company should proceed?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2159.295,2159.842,Absolutely right.
1980.79-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2174.195,2190.486,What would the City have done had the utility attempted to develop the 214 acres in a way you would normally expect a utility to normally develop such acreage?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2190.486,2222.27,"Your Honor, that's something that from this record we don't know and we will never know until the Gas & Electric Company comes to the City and gives it the opportunity to interpret its own actions, its own open space plan, to weigh and balance the important public interest versus the private property interest of this landowner to determine what is a reasonable use of the property, whether or not we want to preclude all use of it by purchasing it so that it's now in the public domain and we can do with it what we want, or whether we will allow some use that we consider to be consistent with open spaces."
1980.79-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2222.27,2222.691,Including construction of a nuclear plant?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2222.691,2226.096,Including... especially including the construction of a nuclear plant.
1980.79-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2307.735,2313.389,"Well, your brother is shaking his head, and these are factual controversies that it's no business of this Court to try to resolve."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2317.324,2318.167,"--Yes, Your Honor?"
1980.79-678,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2318.167,2326.055,"You commenced your brief, as I recall, by saying that the findings of fact made by the trial court had been rejected."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2332.396,2348.5,"The only place, Your Honor, where... well, first of all, from a procedural standpoint in California law, when the case... the first opinion was decided by the California Court of Appeal, we sought further appeal by way of a hearing in the California Supreme Court."
1980.79-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2361.197,2363.165,But not the Superior Court opinion?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2363.165,2366.305,"Yes, Your Honor, that is gone."
1980.79-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2366.305,2380.846,"I thought the Supreme Court of California in ordinary proceedings vacated the intermediate appellate court opinion, but left standing, reversed, or affirmed the Superior Court opinion?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2380.846,2384.001,I don't believe that's so.
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.001,2389.623,"Well, just a granting of a hearing doesn't vacate the findings of the Superior Court."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2392.966,2395.246,"Well, it vacates the Court of Appeal opinion."
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2396.215,2402.087,"Yes, that's... suppose that it had set aside the findings?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2402.087,2406.21,--I'm sorry.
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.991,2411.053,Suppose the intermediate court had set aside the findings of the trial court?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2411.053,2411.973,Yes; which we had asked them to do.
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.973,2426.25,"And suppose it had... and then there's a grant of a hearing by the California Supreme Court, which vacates the judgment of the intermediate appellate court, doesn't that reinstate the findings of the trial court?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2426.25,2440.057,"Perhaps there's a semantical difference, but it doesn't... my understanding is it does not reinstate them, the court is still open to determine from the record whether there is evidence to support those findings of fact."
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2440.963,2446.772,"Well, they aren't vacated until and unless they reinstate them, are they?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2446.772,2447.6,"--Well, that could be, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2462.735,2466.795,"Now, is transfer a peculiar procedure in California?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2466.795,2471.294,"--Your Honor, I think transfer and remand, as far as I can tell, are one and the same."
1980.79-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2471.294,2472.278,Same thing?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2472.278,2478.182,"I don't know why they use the different terminology, because the California Supreme Court, I think, does use ""remand"" as well."
1980.79-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2509.074,2510.402,Was that the sentence quoted earlier?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2510.402,2510.84,--Yes.
1980.79-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2567.035,2573.689,And what then do you understand the Court of Appeal required the Superior Court now to do?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2573.689,2588.355,"They go on to say that if the Gas & Electric Company wants to pursue its equitable remedies, to set aside these land use and planning decisions, that they... because there's not sufficient evidence in the existing record... they can retry that issue."
1980.79-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2588.355,2589.574,Retry the taking issue?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2589.574,2590.839,Retry the taking issue.
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.839,2595.915,"In court, or do they have to dismiss the case and start with the City?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2595.915,2599.039,I don't know that they have to dismiss the case.
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.473,2607.269,"So they have exhausted their administrative remedies, so to speak?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2607.269,2607.988,--They had not.
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.439,2612.86,"Well, I would think you would have dismissed the case until they had."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2612.86,2616.187,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2652.47,2665.527,"Mr. Sumption, let's come back to the facts that were found by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of Appeal, one of which was that it would be perfectly futile to do what you call exhaust administrative remedies."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2675.57,2677.647,"Not in those specific words, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2678.553,2692.406,"Well, aren't you relying on an inference when there were originally two findings, or rather finding by the trial court and acceptance of that finding by the California intermediate appellate court, that it would have been futile?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2697.935,2701.293,"--Well, the California Supreme Court never really answered any question."
1980.79-678,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2707.197,2710.962,Are you saying that all findings have been vacated in this case?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2710.962,2719.849,"As far as the taking question which in... a subsidiary question of whether there was a taking and the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the futility--"
1980.79-678,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2719.849,2723.441,Could you identify by number the findings that have been vacated?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2723.441,2729.454,--It would take me a few minutes to flip through the pages to find the specific--
1980.79-678,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2729.454,2733.874,"Everything relevant to this case has been vacated, is that your position?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2733.874,2740.637,"--It would be the finding that there was a denial of all reasonable use of the property, and that it would have been futile for the Gas & Electric Company to have applied for any development."
1980.79-678,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2741.215,2752.93,"The only basis for your argument, I judge from what you have said, is the final paragraph in the four-page opinion of the Court of Appeal on its second consideration of this case?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2752.93,2762.238,"--Yes, Your Honor, I can see no reason why the court would have said that they have not applied for any relief or found out what they could do with the property, unless they meant--"
1980.79-678,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2762.238,2776.622,"There's nothing in that paragraph as I read it that rejects Finding No. 29, which in substance says that the owner already has been deprived of all practical use of his property."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2780.184,2782.339,"--No, there's nothing specific that says that."
1980.79-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2788.415,2802.878,"I thought, Mr.... in reading these briefs, under California law, everything that the trial court says is wiped out, as thought it hadn't been said at all, and everything that the Court of Appeal said in its first opinion is wiped out."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2807.564,2809.297,"Everything that the Court of Appeal said is wiped out, in its first opinion."
1980.79-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2810.376,2811.594,It's gone as though it had never been written.
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2811.594,2811.922,--That's right.
1980.79-678,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2823.728,2833.162,What I don't understand is that the California Supreme Court decision in Agins didn't deal at all with these factual findings.
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2865.602,2866.384,"I realize that, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2866.384,2871.585,But you are now arguing that inferentially this is entirely a new ball game?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2871.585,2875.927,I think Agins applies and is controlling precedent in this case.
1980.79-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2875.927,2886.548,"Well, here's what your Court of Appeal said in the opinion supporting the judgment that is appealed from here, at the end of its penultimate paragraph:"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2903.729,2909.819,"I don't think the Court can get to that issue without finding that there was a taking, and--"
1980.79-678,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2909.819,2912.817,"Well, the Court of Appeal certainly got to it, and disposed of it."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2933.326,2934.169,--I realize that.
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2934.169,2934.794,They said there was a taking.
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2934.794,2935.965,"I realize that, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.965,2938.792,Or at least a full deprivation of the use of the property.
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2938.792,2940.48,And I think they were dead wrong--
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.48,2941.198,I know you do.
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2941.198,2943.76,"--on that, and there's no evidence to support that finding."
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2943.76,2944.93,"I know you do, but you lost that in the state courts."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2944.93,2952.27,"But now, with the Court of Appeal's second opinion, they seem to be retracting from that position--"
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.27,2954.16,"Well, it doesn't sound like it from what Justice Stewart read."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,2981.916,2984.775,--Interim damages were not raised at all.
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2984.775,2987.211,"Nobody ever raised or argued about it at all, and so all of the language is broad."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3004.656,3011.638,"No, I don't believe that interim damages would necessarily be awarded under the taking clause if--"
1980.79-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3011.638,3037.316,"You mean, you think the City could announce that as of January 1, 1973, this particular 215 acres is a park to which all of the citizens of California shall have access, and then on January 1, 1978, five years later, pay the company the fair value of the park?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3037.316,3048.188,"--That's my understanding of the law in California, plus seven percent interest per annum from the date of the taking, plus attorneys' fees and expert witness fees, if they have to go to court to prove that there was a taking."
1980.79-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3054.857,3058.277,"Well, then don't you have to disavow part of the Court of Appeal's opinion?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3058.277,3060.886,On what issue or aspect?
1980.79-678,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3060.886,3066.93,"Well, because the Court of Appeal had no hesitation reaching the takings question."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3066.93,3068.788,I don't think--
1980.79-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3068.788,3078.144,"Well, wouldn't you have a reason to disavow the finding that an effort to exhaust administrative remedies would be futile?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3087.11,3087.344,--That's right.
1980.79-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3087.344,3092.999,"But surely, earlier they said, didn't have to because it'd be futile to do it."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3092.999,3097.356,"Well, they said earlier in a decision that it's wiped off the books and no longer exists."
1980.79-678,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3097.356,3104.134,"But you have to... you really have to build everything on that one sentence, don't you?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3104.134,3112.443,"As far as interpreting what the Court of Appeal, was the basis of its ruling, that's all we have, and it's not entirely clear."
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.443,3118.394,"Now, you think that the complaint in this case challenged the constitutionality of a local ordinance?"
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3118.394,3119.628,Of a local ordinance?
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3122.47,3125.251,So that you think this is a proper appeal here?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3137.919,3148.117,I don't think it's a proper appeal from the standpoint that I think the taking question can't be answered until there is an #.
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3148.117,3155.473,"I understand that, but that's just that there isn't any final judgment on the taking issue."
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3155.473,3156.067,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-678,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3156.067,3164.969,But there was a straightforward challenge to a local ordinance on the constitutional grounds?
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3164.969,3166.282,"Yes, there was."
1980.79-678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3166.282,3168.172,Are you suggesting that they can do--
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3169.531,3173.716,I don't recall specifically if the complaint mentions--
1980.79-678,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3173.716,3174.451,I don't think it does.
1980.79-678,1,20018,c_alan_sumption,,3174.451,3175.576,--mentions the Federal Constitution.
