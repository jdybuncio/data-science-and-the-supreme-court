1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.78,"We'll hear argument now on No. 89-5120, Michael Owen Perry v. Louisiana."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,63.733,65.483,Thank you.
1990.89-5120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.244,212.351,"Mr. Nordyke, there is a Louisiana statute, is there not, that deals with forcible medication of prisoners?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,212.351,216.602,"Yes, ma'am, title XV, section 830.1."
1990.89-5120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.602,220.556,Was that section called to the attention of the trial court?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,220.556,238.627,"Your Honor, we briefed that section consistently throughout and the only time the trial court used the word was in an August 26th hearing where he ordered forcible medication and he just simply said, in accordance with 830.1, I order the forcible medication."
1990.89-5120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.183,255.608,"Well, do you take the position that that statute governs in this situation, or should govern?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,255.608,259.361,"Your Honor, from day 1 in this case we have taken that precise position."
1990.89-5120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,259.361,268.948,Your position being that medication is not permitted under the statute because he's not a danger to himself or others?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,268.948,275.513,"Your Honor, I think there are two prongs to that and it's the same two prongs that Your Honor wrote about in Harper last term."
1990.89-5120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,291.071,297.065,And you took this position consistently throughout all the proceedings to this Court?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,297.065,297.906,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,297.906,308.913,"Well, is it your contention that the Louisiana trial court which authorized the medication is acting in violation of Louisiana law?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,308.913,311.014,"Your Honor, it's--"
1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.014,314.055,That's not one we would be likely to entertain.
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,314.055,316.707,"--If we're asking about the Pennhurst problem, the answer is no."
1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,335.64,337.911,Did you argue that in the trial court?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,337.911,340.533,"--Yes, Your Honor, we have briefed those issues--"
1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,340.533,349.048,You briefed the argument that the Louisiana statute set up a liberty interest which gave you a right under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,349.048,350.1,"--I believe we did, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.1,351.602,You say you believe we did.
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,353.392,354.323,"I am, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,359.316,367.882,"Yes, but that's quite different than briefing the argument that 830.1 creates a liberty interest which would in turn give you a right under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,374.015,376.467,"We will file that with the Court, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,376.467,385.763,And I would like to know if you... if the issue came up before the supreme court.
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,385.763,388.956,"Definitely it came up before the Supreme Court of Louisiana, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.87,465.145,And you're arguing that the Louisiana court did not follow the Louisiana law?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,466.236,467.347,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.812,476.264,You're talking now about some sort of a liberty interest?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,476.264,476.884,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,487.232,496.058,"You're not making any argument that we should review this as a decision based on Louisiana law, that the court interpreted the statute incorrectly?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,496.058,498.258,"Oh, no, Your Honor, not at all."
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,499.099,505.144,"Well, the predicate for your argument, though, is what Louisiana does."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,511.709,513.249,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.259,532.713,Did the trial court enter more than... what was its very final order about medication?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,532.713,536.074,"The precise wording, Your Honor, was--"
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.074,541.009,"I mean one of the orders was stayed, but--"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,541.009,542.509,"--Okay, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,544.171,545.811,--What does the last one say?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,545.811,548.383,The last order is fairly lengthy.
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,548.383,555.329,Right at the end it says about... doesn't it say that--
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,555.329,557.629,To be prescribed by the medical staff--
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,557.629,566.084,"--It says this order, the one that stayed in existence... to maintain treatment as prescribed by medical staff."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,566.084,567.436,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.66,574.989,"Oh, I didn't... do you think that requires a medical staff to prescribe treatment?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,574.989,578.722,--I think it orders them to prescribe treatment as opposed to use medical judgment.
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,578.722,585.548,"Well, I know, but they wouldn't be in violation of the order if they said... if they decided that the patient didn't need it."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,585.548,589.85,"I'm not sure, Your Honor, because the preceding two sentences--"
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.85,590.441,"Well, it doesn't say so."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,602.209,608.874,"--Well, that still denies the liberty interest that the statute that we've been discussing sets up."
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,635.802,645.589,--Is it clear on the face of this statute that there's no exception to that when a prisoner has been condemned to execution--
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,645.589,645.829,"None whatsoever, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,645.829,650.872,--and which exception can be made by the State's supreme court?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,650.872,654.863,There is no exception whatsoever on the face of the statute.
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.329,670.783,"But, you know, we have interpreted Federal statutes to permit some exceptions."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,709.229,712.752,"The State supreme court perhaps could, but they have not."
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.19,727.312,I don't--
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,727.312,730.324,A writ denial under Louisiana law has no--
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.324,731.596,--What... the court of appeals couldn't make it?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,734.556,743.641,"--Your Honor, I guess they could say that, but I'm not sure that it would be a valid expression of Louisiana law particularly coming out of the trial court."
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.665,755.528,"Well, why couldn't the trial court make it and the supreme court agree with it and simply turn down the appeal?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,755.528,762.203,"Because Louisiana law, as I say, Your Honor, does not consider a writ denial to be an expression of the law at all."
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,762.203,768.598,And district courts in Louisiana have no power to pronounce the law?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,768.598,788.881,"Your Honor, under our civilian system of law in Louisiana... and I realize this is a criminal constitutional issue... but under our general proposition of how courts make law in Louisiana, we are a civilian system and we generally follow statutes, and if there is no statute, the court generally does not go forth and make law on it."
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.771,826.796,It depends upon your reading of the court's order... what Justice White was asking you about as prescribed.
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,849.141,861.567,"No, Your Honor, I don't, because the preceding two paragraphs... I guess two paragraphs back in the order... the trial court said that he doesn't waive Mr. Perry's interest, doesn't look at Mr. Perry's interest."
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,869.224,876.778,"I think he's talking about what Mr. Perry was arguing, and that is a right to turn down even beneficial treatment because he didn't want to get well."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,895.209,898.291,"Yes, sir, it is."
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.291,905.267,And I think... and I understood it to be the position below and I understood that to be what the district judge was addressing.
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,905.267,907.348,But I have to qualify that.
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.186,923.927,"Well, there's no indication of any finding that he would be of danger to himself or others?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,923.927,925.129,"--The record is barren of that, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.054,945.803,"So you think... why don't you win the case just on that basis, that the judge ordered treatment which was against his will without the proper findings?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,945.803,946.745,"Your Honor, we could."
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,947.494,949.396,"Well, you just... forget about the State statute."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,949.396,956.5,"--If you're talking about the substantive Fourteenth Amendment due process, absolutely we could."
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,956.5,957.812,"Well, do you?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,958.533,959.272,"I think so, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.357,972.731,"Do you think there was a duty under Louisiana law or any other law, including the constitutional law, for the doctors to treat this man?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,972.731,988.57,"If Your Honor is asking about what the State has raised, the Estelle v. Gamble 1983 problem, I think that there is a statutory duty under Louisiana revised statutes where physicians... for the State Penitentiary to provide proper care for Mr. Perry."
1990.89-5120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,996.567,1007.663,Isn't it a fair... Isn't it a fair inference from the record that the only reason the medication was turned down was so that he could not be well enough to be executed?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1007.663,1008.805,Your Honor--
1990.89-5120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1008.805,1013.317,"In fact, isn't that the reason that counsel ordered him not to take the medication?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1013.317,1014.719,"--Not the first time, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1069.754,1075.357,"Well, there's nothing in this record to indicate that medication is against his medical best interest, is there?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1075.357,1086.574,"Yes, there... well, yes, there is, if you consider the fact that if he takes the medication under the trial court's findings, that it will kill him, that will inevitably and inexorably lead to his death."
1990.89-5120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1086.574,1089.856,I'm talking about his condition prior to his execution.
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1089.856,1095.139,"We don't know, because his best interests were not a focus of any of the hearings."
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1129.894,1137.318,"Do you think under this order, the physician said, boy, we have to pump the medication into this fellow no matter what it does to him?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1137.318,1137.949,I think--
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.949,1141.482,Do you really think that that's how that order would have read by a medical doctor?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1141.482,1146.758,"--Your Honor, I don't know how a medical doctor would have read it, but the import of the order--"
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1146.758,1159.895,"But don't you have to know to base your argument on that, and to assert as you've asserted in your brief that the whole purpose of treatment was not at all to make him well, although that would kill him as you say, because if he got well, he could be executed."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1179.471,1180.65,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1180.65,1183.802,"Well, I don't see that it reads,"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1193.9,1194.789,"I agree, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.332,1221.656,To be... as to be prescribed means as to be prescribed contrary to all sound medical practice if necessary.
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1222.758,1236.116,"I can't read it any other way simply because the trial court, knowing about 830.1, having had it briefed to him, didn't go through any of the things that one needs to go through under 830.1."
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.609,1245.302,--Was there testimony that any doctor treating him interpreted the order that way?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1245.302,1252.227,"Well, Your Honor, the trial court... excuse me, the trial court stayed his order after entry, so we don't know."
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1261.213,1270.039,So the medical staff is probably doing what they thought they should be doing to him.
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1270.039,1272.042,I don't know.
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1272.46,1274.701,And he hasn't been refusing them?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1274.701,1276.844,"--They are forcibly injecting him, we understand."
1990.89-5120,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1276.844,1284.418,"Of course, Mr. Nordyke, it never really makes much sense, does it, in some respects, to cure a man only to execute him."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1284.418,1286.611,"Your Honor, we claim it's fundamentally wrong."
1990.89-5120,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1286.611,1292.493,"And the problem, of course, is the old rule that you don't execute a man when he's incompetent."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1292.493,1294.376,It goes back to Ford.
1990.89-5120,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1317.059,1319.72,The trouble may be with the old rule.
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1327.016,1330.817,"--Well, the answers to that are varied."
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1365.542,1376.288,"When a case comes to us, don't we judge it on the basis that this treatment would make him at least temporarily competent?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1380.462,1387.234,"Your Honor, I agree that we have to pay due deference to the findings of fact to the trial court and I cannot tell you that's not the law."
1990.89-5120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1387.975,1391.118,--But that's just the beginning of the argument.
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1391.118,1392.659,"The very, very beginning."
1990.89-5120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.884,1419.018,"Mr. Nordyke, before you go to the Eighth Amendment--"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1419.018,1419.346,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1419.346,1420.778,--I want to be sure I understand your position.
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1431.444,1432.405,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1434.156,1435.998,You didn't seem to mention it and I was--
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1435.998,1439.612,"I apologize, but we do believe it's the Harper interest of last term."
1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.612,1442.264,--Did you make that argument in the trial court?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1442.264,1444.584,Harper was not decided at the time.
1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1444.584,1447.416,Did you make the argument even though Harper was not decided?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1447.416,1448.308,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1448.308,1450.418,And will you furnish us a transcript?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1450.418,1450.869,We'll furnish it.
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1508.726,1512.499,"You know, there's a consensus against killing people, too."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1539.767,1545.401,"Your Honor, I'm not sure it is outrageous and my position is not as far as the amicus position on this point."
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.067,1572.599,"Well, what do you mean by handled under the medical model?"
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1582.006,1590.972,"I may have missed your hypothet, Your Honor, but the hypothet that I understood you to give me was that we not medicate him outside of the realm of the Harper best interest--"
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1590.972,1619.299,"I'm saying that if the State makes a determination on the basis of expert medical advice that it is in the interest of this patient because of his mental condition to be medicated, and that they would normally advise an individual in private life outside of prison to obtain medication, that thereafter that medication may be forcibly administered to someone who is under sentence of death, whether or not he wants to turn it down."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1632.419,1638.403,"--Your Honor, that would make the medicine, then, effectually working towards the purposes of punishment."
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1638.992,1641.195,"Of course, but he's been condemned to punishment."
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1641.615,1642.465,--That's right.
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.639,1655.383,--It's not doing to him anything except what normal medical advice would justify being done.
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1655.383,1658.235,And people ignore medical advice all day.
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1659.665,1667.261,I guess the issue is whether someone who's been condemned to death continues to have that luxury.
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1667.261,1671.102,--I think that's probably the bottom issue in this case.
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.102,1674.836,Do you agree it's a luxury?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1674.836,1680.131,Do I agree it's a luxury to be able to refuse medication?
1990.89-5120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.384,1689.535,Refuse healthful medication?
1990.89-5120,0,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,1695.428,1696.519,My answer remains the same.
1990.89-5120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1701.652,1702.994,"Very well, Mr. Nordyke."
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1705.035,1710.518,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-5120,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1749.465,1750.636,Did you draw the order?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1750.636,1752.337,"No, sir, I did not."
1990.89-5120,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1752.337,1752.958,Who did?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1752.958,1754.187,Pardon me?
1990.89-5120,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1754.187,1754.978,Who did?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1754.978,1755.769,The court.
1990.89-5120,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1755.769,1757.52,Himself?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1757.52,1758.491,The judge himself.
1990.89-5120,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1759.182,1761.272,That is your Louisiana practice?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1761.272,1762.662,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1762.662,1764.976,Attorneys never draw an order?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1764.976,1769.588,"On criminal cases they occasionally do, but it was not done on this particular case."
1990.89-5120,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1769.588,1772.8,You know that of your own knowledge?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1772.8,1773.411,Certainly.
1990.89-5120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1778.723,1801.458,"Was there ever a finding here that the forcible medication was in the best interest of the prisoner, and was there ever a finding here to the effect that the prisoner would be a danger to himself or others without it?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1801.458,1812.557,"The court did specifically find, by asking questions of the individual doctors, whether this medication was good for him."
1990.89-5120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1824.534,1827.945,Where do I find the court's determination?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1827.945,1838.563,I think that it would be found in the court's order itself where the judge recognizes that Mr. Perry has an interest in refusing the medication.
1990.89-5120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1838.563,1841.305,You can't point to any specific language?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1841.305,1847.98,It would be the language on the second-to-last page of the court's order where the court recognized--
1990.89-5120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1847.98,1848.848,Second order?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1848.848,1858.185,"--The order of October 21st, 1988, where the court basically found an interest of the inmate, an interest of the State, and the inmate's interest was overridden."
1990.89-5120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1858.185,1864.689,And it's the finding that the defendant would be a danger to himself or others without the medication?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1864.689,1870.363,I don't think there was a finding that he will be a danger without the medication.
1990.89-5120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1914.632,1919.327,So it is your position that the statute 830.1 is inapplicable?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1919.327,1920.316,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1920.316,1932.425,"Is it your position also that the court's findings in all respects comply with the case handed down by this Court last term, the Harper case?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1932.425,1940.879,"Well, I believe that it does comply with Harper and in the State's view, Harper indicates the appropriate result in this case."
1990.89-5120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.462,1964.144,But there's no specific finding that he would be dangerous to himself or others?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1964.144,1966.625,"--That's correct, Your Honor, there is not--"
1990.89-5120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.625,1979.945,"But you are saying that even if there isn't, the State's interest in executing him is sufficient to override his denial of the medication?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1979.945,1980.676,--That's correct.
1990.89-5120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1980.676,1982.926,"That's certainly what the judge said, isn't it?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,1982.926,1983.607,Absolutely.
1990.89-5120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.734,2048.219,"Mr. Salomon, did the court specifically hold that as a matter of Louisiana law, 830.1 was inapplicable?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2048.219,2050.481,It did not.
1990.89-5120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2076.367,2088.996,Do you appoint that the only purpose of this medication is to put him in condition to be killed?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2088.996,2091.06,I would say there are two purposes.
1990.89-5120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2112.134,2114.545,But the primary purpose is to kill him?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2114.545,2116.465,"--I would say, yes sir, that's correct."
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.578,2123.751,"In your second purpose, let me be sure I have it correct."
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2127.943,2129.195,That's correct.
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.195,2133.757,And that while he was competent he did indicate a desire not to receive further medication?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2133.757,2135.369,That is in dispute.
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2160.174,2174.124,"The finding in October of whatever it was, the 18th or 21st, that he was competent to understand the punishment, of course, execution, is not equivalent of a finding he was competent to decide whether or not he wanted further treatment in your view?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2174.124,2177.595,Perhaps I'm misunderstanding.
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2178.486,2182.63,"Well, I had the impression that there were times when he was competent to make rational decisions."
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2198.218,2200.251,I think in some circumstances that's correct.
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.196,2214.781,"But is it not correct that during one of these periods of competency under medication, he made it clear that he did not want further medication?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2214.781,2217.452,--I'm not certain of that.
1990.89-5120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.918,2226.338,I don't know.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2235.704,2236.754,"--Well, I agree with you in basic--"
1990.89-5120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.754,2240.487,At least I would think that's the way we would judge this case.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2240.487,2241.969,"--I think you're correct, Justice White."
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2266.144,2284.196,"If we assume that we take the case as we've discussed in acknowledging that maybe the record isn't as clear as it should be, would it be your view that at that time he had the kind of liberty interest independent of Louisiana law that was discussed in Harper to say no unless sufficient overriding State interests are present?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2284.196,2287.749,--I believe that he does.
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2321.634,2330.778,"So you're prepared, really, to have us judge the case on the assumption that there is a constitutionally protected liberty interest at stake, but that it's overcome by the countervailing interest that you rely on?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2330.778,2331.87,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.842,2338.154,Then why do you say 830.1 isn't applicable?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2340.246,2352.734,"--Well, basically for the same reason that the statute in Kentucky v. Thompson didn't mandate that visitation privileges were some protected liberty interest."
1990.89-5120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.293,2372.176,But the 830.1 sort of conditions involuntary treatment on--
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2372.176,2375.308,--dangerousness.
1990.89-5120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.308,2376.67,--the basis of dangerousness.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2376.67,2378.44,"Well, I would suggest to you that that--"
1990.89-5120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.44,2382.324,And is quite consistent with the constitutional rule.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2382.324,2394.062,--And I think that is correct to the extent that 830.1 is a statutory expression of what the State can do and that is a sufficient basis on which the State may involuntarily treat.
1990.89-5120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.634,2399.475,At least that's your submission?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2399.475,2401.007,"That's my submission, Your Honor."
1990.89-5120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2420.568,2427.381,"Mr. Attorney General, is this medicine given by injection or by the mouth?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2427.381,2428.383,Both.
1990.89-5120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2430.704,2441.172,"Well, if all you say is true in the interest of Louisiana, while you're giving him the injection, why don't give him enough to kill him then?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2441.172,2442.061,"--Well, because I think--"
1990.89-5120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2442.061,2443.874,It would be cheaper for the State.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2443.874,2452.889,"--Right, but I think the State of Louisiana is limited by the Eighth Amendment and other provisions that we can't do things that are cruel or unusual or excessive in nature."
1990.89-5120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2504.653,2520.283,You say that a prisoner who isn't dangerous involuntarily be treated in order to make him competent to go to trial?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2520.283,2534.381,"I have no cases, but I think Appendix J, which sets forth the statutes of 20-some-odd States, does indicate that at least in Louisiana you don't need the element of dangerousness in order to treat someone to establish competency to go trial."
1990.89-5120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2534.381,2547.321,"Well, are there any decisions under Federal law that... are there any decisions saying that this is consistent with Federal and constitutional law?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2547.321,2556.127,"I'm not able to answer your question, because I have not researched the Federal aspect of what a Federal court could order an incompetent defendant to undergo."
1990.89-5120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2560.449,2568.426,You don't think that the Harper case is applicable in the pretrial situation?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2568.426,2574.707,I don't think Harper said that it is applicable in the pretrial situation.
1990.89-5120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2574.707,2576.74,You don't think it is logically?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2576.74,2594.683,"Well, I think that it may be, to be very candid, Justice O'Connor, but I don't think that you always have to establish dangerousness in order to justify the involuntary or some other administration of medication in order to establish competency."
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.62,2619.787,"Isn't it true that in that situation one of the factors that would be considered would be, if appropriate in the case, the potential permanent side effects of the first medication?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2633.288,2637.87,"Well, I think as it stands in Louisiana you can make that argument."
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2641.683,2642.074,Right.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2642.074,2662.056,"And that is not the case here, but I'm citing it as a premise of sorts to say that we have done it in this particular case, and because we have done it... that is, an involuntary administration of medication to establish competency to go to trial... we can do it for competency to exact our sentence."
1990.89-5120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2670.211,2674.505,"In a way competency to go to trial is harder, isn't it."
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2691.514,2698.36,"--Absolutely, I mean because the punishment... the whether determination has already been made what his sentence will be."
1990.89-5120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2709.837,2714.399,"Saying, likewise is reduced his ability to turn down beneficial medical treatment."
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2714.399,2715.721,That's exactly right.
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2787.957,2789.299,"Let me just interrupt, if I may."
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2789.299,2789.639,Fine.
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.639,2793.761,You seem to make a point earlier that it was relevant that this treatment was beneficial to him.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2797.664,2798.265,Right.
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2808.22,2811.502,I can understand your argument if you don't rely on the benefit.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2816.497,2819.96,"Well, but there are medical benefits."
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2819.96,2823.601,He's not particularly interested in those when he is weighing the various alternatives.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2823.931,2825.133,I understand that.
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2839.292,2844.625,"I know medication to go to trial, Justice Scalia has already demonstrated, that's a harder case than this one."
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2844.625,2845.667,--Correct.
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2845.667,2848.288,"You're relying on one that hasn't been decided yet, at least by this Court."
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2848.288,2864.146,"That's true, but I still say that even though the State might have an interest in seeing its penalty satisfied, that a Turner v. Safley analysis says that you have to have a legitimate penalogical interest."
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2884.63,2887.364,It isn't the State's interest is heightened.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2909.667,2910.338,Correct.
1990.89-5120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.338,2919.104,And not any other physical torture or harm beyond execution or prior to execution.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2919.795,2921.155,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-5120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2921.155,2930.962,And if you medicated him against his will in a way that was harmful to him that could be considered to be something beyond the judgment of execution that had been pronounced.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2930.962,2931.871,That is correct.
1990.89-5120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2931.871,2937.955,The State's sole interest was to kill him?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2937.955,2940.518,"Well, the State's primary interest is just that."
1990.89-5120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2940.518,2946.482,"Well, it seems... for example, if he had been sentenced to life, the State wouldn't be interested, would they?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2946.482,2950.863,"Well, the State would still be interested to the extent of providing beneficial medical treatment to a person that's ill."
1990.89-5120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2950.863,2951.564,They would?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2953.295,2956.227,"Well, I think that the State could insist on it if you--"
1990.89-5120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2956.227,2958.628,Do you think they would?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2958.628,2961.142,"--Well, you asked me to predict, and I think that they may."
1990.89-5120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2961.6,2963.673,In this case it's solely to kill him?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2963.673,2965.053,--That's correct.
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2969.307,2970.777,I don't mean to be a pest here.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,2981.004,2983.195,"--October 21, '88."
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2983.195,2984.046,--October 21.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,3003.749,3004.62,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3005.669,3007.442,You think that's implicit in the order?
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,3007.442,3008.193,"Yes, sir, I do."
1990.89-5120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3008.193,3009.382,Thank you.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,3009.382,3026.014,"Beyond the trial court's analysis in this particular case, the trial court did not conduct any national consensus search, but we submit to this Court today that there is no State legislation that exists anywhere prohibiting involuntary medication for a competency to execute."
1990.89-5120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.436,3080.308,You don't really know that.
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,3089.345,3091.077,"No, I do not."
1990.89-5120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3144.379,3148.893,"Is the defendant being forcibly medicated now, Mr. Salomon?"
1990.89-5120,1,40572,rene_i_salomon,,3148.893,3152.566,Difficult question.
1990.89-5120,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3202.669,3205.35,"Thank you, Mr. Salomon."
1990.89-5120,2,33927,keith_b_nordyre,,3208.365,3212.365,First let me address the Maryland statute that counsel addressed.
1990.89-5120,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3313.742,3315.014,"Thank you, Mr. Nordyke."
