1988.88-389,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.856,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-389, Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. June Betts."
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,17.443,20.562,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-389,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,276.545,283.385,"What precise language in 4(f)(2) are you relying on, Mr. Sutter?"
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,283.385,295.359,"Mr. Chief Justice, we are relying on the language that says quite clearly, any bona fide employee benefit plan, such as a retirement, pension or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the Act."
1988.88-389,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,300.061,303.597,"But then, how about the proviso that comes afterwards?"
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,303.597,307.166,"In respect to involuntary retirement, Your Honor, or the subterfuge language?"
1988.88-389,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,307.166,313.404,"Well, where in says, and no such employee benefit plan shall require or permit the involved, et cetera, et cetera."
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,315.337,320.891,"Your Honor, the Sixth Circuit did not reach the question of involuntary retirement."
1988.88-389,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,347.141,356.814,"So you say all we have before us is whether or not PERS has a bona fide employee benefit plan, such as a retirement, pension or insurance plan?"
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,356.814,359.349,Which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the Act.
1988.88-389,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,359.349,360.468,Which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes...?
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,360.468,361.051,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,366.622,367.139,Mr. Sutter.
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,367.139,369.157,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.157,372.876,May I ask about the operation of this plan?
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,382.965,389.904,"In 1976 the Ohio General Assembly instituted a minimum benefit under disability retirement benefits, a 30 percent minimum."
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,389.904,390.887,"Well, they were the same until then."
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,397.991,399.61,"Well, not a 30 percent increase."
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,410.668,414.52,"Well, this discrepancy arose by action in '76?"
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,414.52,415.853,That is correct.
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,415.853,419.488,And that was post-Act action?
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,419.488,430.261,"It was post-Act action, however, Your Honor, it distinguished between disability and age... between disability retirants and age and service retirants."
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,457.346,465.75,"Well, do you... it seems to me that it could be viewed as an attempt to use a pre-Act plan as a... a subterfuge."
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,465.75,479.859,"Your Honor, the... the only sort of impact that the provision would have in respect to age Is that It could have had a residual impact, because as you have noted, prior to 1976 the benefit was calculated the same."
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,479.859,480.409,Right--
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,480.409,488.199,"But the provision itself is neutral on its face and, was intended to enhance the benefits of disability retirants."
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,525.74,530.442,"--Well the... the... the plan, viewed as a whole, is not age-neutral, is it?"
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,530.442,533.394,"--Your Honor, the... that particular provision was, and therefore--"
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,533.394,536.882,You are just saying the... the addition in 1976 was?
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,536.882,537.665,--That is correct.
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,537.665,544.786,"But if you look... If you look at the whole plan as amended, it is difficult to see how it is age-neutral."
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,544.786,549.44,"But, we are not suggesting that the whole plan is age-neutral."
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,565.432,569.519,"Well, you can't just make any subsequent changes with impunity, can you?"
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,569.519,570.053,"--No, Your Honor."
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,570.053,574.655,Do we have to look at the subsequent changes and their effect to see if it's subterfuge?
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,574.655,586.363,"Your Honor, PERS's assertion is that under 4(f)(2), one must look to see whether the plan as a whole serves as a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the Act."
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,653.757,661.613,"But as you look at it in its effect now, as amended, it appears to be facially discriminatory."
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,661.613,668.183,"Yes, Your Honor, the fact that the age 60 cutoff was there made it facially discriminatory."
1988.88-389,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,713.796,720.151,"Well, all... all retirement plans are... are discriminatory on... on the basis of age, aren't they?"
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,720.151,721.034,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-389,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,725.971,729.423,"Well, didn't... the Court of Appeals didn't say this was a subterfuge, did they?"
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,729.423,730.073,"--No, Your Honor."
1988.88-389,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,730.073,734.827,They... they... they went on the other... they went on the cost differences.
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,734.827,735.194,Yes.
1988.88-389,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.942,769.632,"What... what... what do the... what... what do the guidelines, so called guidelines rely on in... in requiring this cost justification?"
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,772.667,773.969,"--No, Your Honor, they don't."
1988.88-389,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,807.59,816.796,"Well, it may be, but... but... but, isn't it an argument that it's a subterfuge if there isn't an age cost justification?"
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,816.796,818.398,"First, Your Honor, I would point the Court--"
1988.88-389,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.398,820.783,"Isn't... isn't... at least it's an argument, isn't it?"
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,820.783,826.421,--That's the argument posed: the question is: Is it reasonable in light of the language of the statute?
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,840.93,852.202,"Well, what evidence other than cost justification would ever be relevant in determining... or proving that a facially discriminatory plan is not a subterfuge?"
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,852.202,862.51,"I think, Your Honor, that the evidence that a court would have to scrutinize is whether the plan as a whole is intended to evade the purposes of the Act."
1988.88-389,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,893.947,899.783,"Well, what would the employer intend or point to other than cost justifications?"
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,899.783,911.258,--I think what the Court would require an employer to demonstrate is that his plan is not conceived with the intention of frustrating the employment of older workers.
1988.88-389,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,988.291,993.812,Isn't there some indication that Congress intended to overrule part of our McMann decision?
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,993.812,997.364,"--Your Honor, Congress did overrule part of the McMann decision."
1988.88-389,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1291.337,1292.82,How many votes did that get?
1988.88-389,0,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,1292.82,1295.086,"--It got one vote, but I thought it was a very good vote."
1988.88-389,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1550.821,1552.288,"Very well, Mr. Sutter."
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1561.611,1565.08,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may I' please the Court:"
1988.88-389,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1660.59,1665.494,"Was this point passed on by the Court of Appeals, Mr. Laufman?"
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1665.494,1674.699,"Your Honor, the Court of Appeals did not address this issue because it ruled that Congress had overturned McMann, and therefore it was unnecessary to reach that particular--"
1988.88-389,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.699,1677.301,So you're arguing this as an alternative basis for affirming?
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1677.301,1678.586,--This is... that is correct.
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1686.423,1690.025,May I ask on your point that it was new plan when they amended it?
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1694.91,1716.473,"It was in the plan from the start, but when you take the age 6O and the only putting in a 30 percent floor for disability because it denies employees who become disabled after age 60, it discriminates between employees who are disabled before age 60 and employees who are disabled after age 60."
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1716.473,1720.044,"But, that discrimination, although not as dramatic, was in the plan before though?"
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1720.044,1720.71,That is correct.
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1720.71,1725.698,And was it also true that... I mean the discrimination between pre-60 and post-60 people?
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1725.698,1726.331,That is correct.
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1726.331,1736.137,Was it also true before the change that disability retirees received a larger benefit than a... a person with the amount of seniority that your client had?
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1736.137,1743.743,"With the same amount of seniority, an employee who was disabled at the age of 59 would receive 30 percent."
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.147,1751.597,"Well, wait a minute."
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1751.597,1752.181,Yes.
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1752.181,1753.448,Just... I just want to be sure I understand.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1753.448,1753.798,Go ahead.
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.798,1770.643,"Right before the '76 amendment, if your client had had the same age and the same seniority that she did have when she retired, if she had done that in 1976, would she have... would the same discrimination have been present?"
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1775.362,1777.714,"I think I understand the question, but basically--"
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1777.714,1782.868,"Well, the question is, now she gets three hundred... she would have gotten $350; she gets about 160 now."
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1782.868,1783.501,--Right.
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1785.503,1786.17,Yeah.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1786.17,1789.789,--she would have received approximately the same income under either plan.
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1789.789,1790.474,I see.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1798.31,1799.16,That is correct.
1988.88-389,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.285,1875.193,"If we agreed with your submission that, because of the amendment this is not a pre-Act plan, we wouldn't have to deal with the question of whether the '78 amendment is limited, as your opponent suggests, or more broad as you suggest?"
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1875.193,1878.16,--That is absolutely correct.
1988.88-389,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.16,1882.714,But... but we would have to deal with the question in the future as to how much of an amendment is too much?
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1882.714,1884.75,That is correct also.
1988.88-389,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1884.75,1888.618,Do you have some suggestion as to... as to how we would answer that in the future?
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1888.618,1889.468,I think it's going to--
1988.88-389,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.468,1896.974,Or how the people who run these plans are going... are going to figure out... figure it out before they go making any amendments?
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1896.974,1899.041,--You're talking about the amendments to the plans--
1988.88-389,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.041,1899.593,The states.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1900.01,1901.11,--not the amendment to the statute?
1988.88-389,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.11,1901.593,Right.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1915.52,1916.02,That is correct.
1988.88-389,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.883,1942.152,Uh-huh.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1942.152,1957.244,"But when you start changing things that directly affect... impact on the age discrimination factor, then I submit that it is a significant and relevant factor, and clearly is in this case."
1988.88-389,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.396,1993.417,"Suppose you're right on that, the '78 amendment, does... then, that just destroys the argument that... that because it's an old plan, it's not a subterfuge?"
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1993.417,1994.017,--That is correct.
1988.88-389,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.017,1996.453,"Well, but, you'd still have to show it's a subterfuge."
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1996.453,1997.569,"You'd still have to show it's a subterfuge,--"
1988.88-389,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.569,1999.655,And then you'd do that by... on the cost benefit basis.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,1999.655,2001.357,--You'd do that in the cost benefit basis.
1988.88-389,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.823,2003.207,So you have to get to that eventually.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2003.207,2008.344,--And I submit that that's there's a... there's a basis for that.
1988.88-389,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2031.51,2043.017,"Is... is this the language you rely on in 4(f)(2) that... that there has to be a cost justification, otherwise it's a subterfuge?"
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2043.017,2044.934,--There's two different ways of approaching--
1988.88-389,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2044.934,2045.317,Yes.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2045.317,2046.552,--the cost justification.
1988.88-389,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.302,2048.588,But that's one of them.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2048.588,2049.804,That's one of them.
1988.88-389,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.418,2082.975,"I don't know, all he has to do is convince a court that it's just contrary to the words of the Act to... to... to require a cost-benefit."
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2082.975,2083.559,"Well, that is... that is--"
1988.88-389,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.559,2084.344,I mean a cost justification.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2084.344,2090.081,"--That is precisely why the... the EEOC regulations, which provide--"
1988.88-389,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.081,2092.031,Aren't they just guidelines?
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2092.031,2093.033,--They are just guidelines.
1988.88-389,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.979,2113.28,Have they changed?
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2113.28,2116.898,"The regulations have changed, but they have been totally consistent."
1988.88-389,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.694,2175.169,"Mr. Laufman, what the... what the Appellant says to that, and I think the language seems to me to support him, is... is that those regulations were safe harbors."
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2198.55,2199.302,That's true.
1988.88-389,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.702,2200.769,"If you did this, you could get it for sure."
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2202.504,2203.121,--That's true.
1988.88-389,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.688,2204.79,"Well, if that's so, then what--"
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2204.79,2210.944,"--But... but, at this point, and I think it's important to note that PERS produced absolutely no evidence of any kind of a justification."
1988.88-389,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.9,2260.156,"--Under the EEOC regulations, if you can produce a cost justification, does that take out the question of intent?"
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2260.156,2262.608,"Well, I don't think we really get into intent."
1988.88-389,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2276.535,2287.758,"So you couldn't go behind the cost justification and say, well, really at a conference committee in the Ohio Legislature, someone said let's pass this because we don't like old people?"
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2287.758,2289.575,That's correct.
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2289.575,2290.71,"May I ask, Mr. Laufman?"
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2300.983,2310.689,"I believe this Court said that in Thurston that the Section 4(f)(1) and 4(f)(2) are affirmative defenses, and that the burden would always be on the defendant."
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.689,2322.931,"Well, I... it can still be an affirmative defense to show that it's a bona fide seniority system and then, say, the president of the company gets on the stand and says it's not a subterfuge, we didn't adopt it for any... any age-related reason; we like old people."
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2325.8,2326.417,"Well, I think--"
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2326.417,2333.387,"I mean, what I'm really asking, suppose is, assuming the cost is an issue, who has to get into proving costs are non-costs?"
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2333.387,2340.727,"--In our position and in the regulation position, it's the employers, because they're the only one that have the... the evidence of cost considerations."
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.493,2349.047,"Well, but you just a moment ago said that it's only going to cost them a penny to... I mean that there's... you said in this case, it's perfectly obvious that there's no cost defense."
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2350.749,2355.237,--I said that there is no cost defense because they made no effort to put on any evidence to suggest a cost justification.
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2355.237,2363.473,"Oh, I thought you indicated that that... that there really wasn't any cost here because the 60... 60 age thing was perfectly obviously an arbitrary--"
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2363.473,2364.092,I'm sorry?
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2364.092,2365.942,--I thought you... I may have misunderstood you.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2374.364,2374.748,Oh.
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2379.018,2379.502,Right.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2379.502,2399.681,"--is that if this Court ruled that the plan was in violation of the Act, there are so few employees who fit into this very narrow window where it has any effect, that the 50 to 100 employees that would be added to a plan that pays something like $400 million a year in benefits, would be insignificant."
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.132,2406.002,I see.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2411.656,2434.003,"The court below essentially quoted Judge Posner in Karlen, who said that where an employer cannot produce actuarial costs to justify age discrimination in employee benefits, he'd better be able to prove a close correlation between age and cost if he wants the shelter of the safe harbor of Section 4(f)(2)."
1988.88-389,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2434.003,2441.675,"And so, is that equivalent to saying, without costs, it's a subterfuge or no?"
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2441.675,2443.225,That is... I believe is the--
1988.88-389,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.225,2445.294,Is that what the Court of Appeals meant to say?
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2445.294,2451.448,"--is the position that the court has taken, yes."
1988.88-389,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2579.428,2580.63,Why didn't they say that?
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2598.508,2601.81,"--Justice Scalla, I will admit that this is a poorly drafted statute."
1988.88-389,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2603.91,2607.031,"If... if they meant to say what you say they meant to say, it's poorly drafted."
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2607.031,2617.82,"--It... if you want what I think, I think at the time they recognized there was a problem, and there is absolutely nothing in the legislative history that indicates that they considered how to resolve the problem."
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.48,2662.082,May I ask another question about the language that I find very puzzling?
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2670.187,2671.67,I don't have the answer to that.
1988.88-389,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2675.639,2676.507,It's baffling to me... that.
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2676.507,2683.428,--It's a poorly written statute; we all agree on that.
1988.88-389,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2683.428,2691.517,You don't... do you... what do you do about the language in McMann that you don't need a business purpose or any economic justification?
1988.88-389,1,39821,robert_f_laufman,,2691.517,2710.729,"I believe that McMann is limited to involuntary retirement, because it's clear that there was no cost-based justification in the intent of Congress when it was talking about permitting involuntary retirement; nor did the EEOC regulations... or the ADEA... I'll try it again... the Department of Labor regulations."
1988.88-389,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2723.072,2724.372,"Thank you, Mr. Laufman."
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2742.784,2745.486,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-389,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2786.663,2796.018,"Well, you don't now take the position that the employer's defense is absolutely limited to cost-based justifications?"
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2796.018,2798.97,Not in the sense of the life insurance example.
1988.88-389,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2882.04,2909.373,"Well, if you just look at the language of 4(f)(2), together with the basic prohibitions of (a)(1) and (a)(2) of the section 623, it looks more logical, doesn't it, to think that Congress just wanted to eliminate bona fide pension and benefit plans from... from the scope of the prohibitions of the Act?"
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2909.373,2912.309,"We don't agree with that, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-389,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2913.844,2914.761,It certainly reads that way--
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2914.761,2915.211,"--Well, what--"
1988.88-389,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2915.211,2917.463,--unless there is a subterfuge.
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2917.463,2929.104,"--Well, let me... let me point out that... that the way Ohio reads it and the way you just paraphrased it, it end... It... the statute would have ended it, bona fide employee benefit plans."
1988.88-389,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2992.844,2993.944,That... that's true.
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3034.421,3042.091,"I think Congress just wanted to make absolutely clear that neither refusals to hire, nor involuntary retirements were permissible."
1988.88-389,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3044.193,3049.947,"But, why would they even worry about that if... if they thought they were enacting a cost... cost justification thing?"
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3054.133,3056.001,--That's correct.
1988.88-389,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3128.394,3129.679,A post-Act plan--
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3129.679,3130.196,--Excuse me?
1988.88-389,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3130.196,3131.465,--A post-Act plan.
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3131.465,3131.981,Yes.
1988.88-389,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3146.49,3149.859,"If they got they same amount, I don't understand what the purpose or the cutoff was."
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3152.711,3153.294,"In fact, there's no--"
1988.88-389,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3153.294,3155.33,"--they just... somebody Just dreamed it up, do you think?"
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3155.33,3155.846,--Well?
1988.88-389,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3168.971,3177.344,"But if their benefits would be the same under the retirement plan or the disability plan, there is no reason to cutoff the disability benefit... Tweedie Dum and Tweedie Dee."
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3177.344,3179.427,"Well, before 1976, It didn't matter."
1988.88-389,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3180.712,3186.466,"But I'm... I'm just suggest... it seems improbable that it did not matter before 1976, if they had that cutoff."
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3188.466,3191.902,"--It's undisputed that, in terms of amount of benefits, It didn't matter."
1988.88-389,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.902,3194.154,"--Well, except... except the e benefit of being rehired."
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3194.154,3194.57,That is correct.
1988.88-389,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3194.57,3203.508,"I think they are saying, once you're over 60, you can't come back even if the collective bargaining agreement might... might have provided that people who are out for illness automatically come back."
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3205.908,3217.499,"Well, there was that discrimination against employees here, and Mr. Laufman has made that argument that... that, in fact, June Betts was involuntarily retired as a result."
1988.88-389,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.041,3259.512,"Well, I think they conceded if this plan here adopted today, it would be illegal."
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3260.662,3262.714,"No, they do not concede that."
1988.88-389,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3262.714,3263.514,"Oh, they don't?"
1988.88-389,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3263.514,3266.666,"But, of course, that's correct; that if it were adopted today, it would be illegal."
1988.88-389,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3306.191,3307.659,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1988.88-389,3,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,3311.178,3313.397,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.88-389,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3348.403,3352.605,"Well, it isn't just the employment, it also is to insure them equal treatment when they... after they get employed."
1988.88-389,3,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,3353.738,3354.474,--It insures them--
1988.88-389,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3354.474,3359.109,--You can' t put them all... all the older people in the closet and say it's just because you're not being hired now--
1988.88-389,3,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,3359.109,3359.659,"--No, Your Honor."
1988.88-389,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3476.252,3478.788,--Tell us what... what can make it a subterfuge then?
1988.88-389,3,16981,andrew_l_sutter,,3479.454,3493.344,"--If... if, for instance, in the Karlen case, we had a plan there that certainly was designed to provide retirement benefits, but the Circuit Court unearthed the possibility that it was designed to force older workers to leave their jobs."
1988.88-389,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3528.35,3529.3,"Thank you, Mr. Sutter."
