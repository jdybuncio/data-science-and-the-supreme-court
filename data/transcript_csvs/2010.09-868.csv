2010.09-868,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.557,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-868, Wall v. Kholi."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,8.836,14.835,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,75.436,82.806,"But Mr. Weisman, the phrase is ""post-conviction or other"" -- ""or other collateral review""."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,97.535,107.938,"Well, I think both parties are in agreement, Your Honor, that the post-conviction review is a parcel of the other collateral review."
2010.09-868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,108.219,111.358,"""Or"" usually means it's something in addition."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,111.358,125.182,"--Yes, but it's -- but with respect, Your Honor, it is ""or other collateral review"", and the ""or other"" -- and I think both parties are in agreement as to this -- ""or other"" embraces that State post-conviction review must also be, quote/unquote, ""collateral review""."
2010.09-868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,148.142,150.61,Can you go back to the -- this is -- you said prior to.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,155.107,159.104,"--Well, it can be made -- it can be made prior to when the conviction becomes final."
2010.09-868,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,177.131,188.576,"But isn't that true regardless of whether the Rule 35 motion seeks legal relief or discretionary relief alone, that both can be made prior to the finality of the judgment?"
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,188.576,190.03,"That is true, Your Honor."
2010.09-868,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,190.03,201.448,"And -- and if I understand your argument, your argument is that Rule 35 motions that seek legal review do fall within the 2244(d)(2) language."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,205.618,207.525,"Well, I'm not sure we conceded that point, Your Honor."
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,238.728,245.977,Would Rule 35 permit a challenge for a Federal violation?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,253.348,253.987,--Not--
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,253.987,259.72,But does Rule 35(a) permit a legal challenge of the kind that Justice Kagan was asking?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,259.72,260.425,--Correct.
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,267.982,268.092,All right.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,269.979,271.527,"--A pure legal challenge, correct."
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,271.527,278.258,"Would Rule 35(a) be other collateral relief, as designated by the statute?"
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,278.258,281.88,We would suggest that this Court doesn't have to answer that question here.
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,289.971,292.86,So explain again why you don't think this is collateral?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,292.86,298.625,"--Well, certainly when all you're doing, as the First Circuit recognized, is making a pure plea for leniency, sentence leniency, you're not--"
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,298.625,299.452,"No, no, no."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,306.744,307.555,"--Well, it could be argued--"
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,307.555,310.18,--Why would it not be collateral review?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,310.18,321.535,"--Well, it could be argued that we are talking about vehicles that challenge the validity of a judgment that has already survived scrutiny under direct review."
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,330.219,332.843,I don't -- I don't understand your argument at all.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,356.642,365.969,"Well, we would suggest, Your Honor, that the collateral review as explained by this Court is referring to the difference between collateral review and direct review."
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.999,368.485,That's fine.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,370.31,374.978,--This is not -- this is clearly not -- this is not in the direct review process.
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,375.15,376.039,So it's collateral review?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,378.756,394.299,"This Court, though, Your Honor, has said that, speaking about when Congress enacted 2255, it simplified the procedure for making a collateral attack on a final judgment entered in a Federal criminal case, but it did not purport to modify the distinction, again, between collateral review and direct review."
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,394.299,406.872,"I would think that if -- if there is anything to the point you are making, it hinges not on the ""post-conviction or other collateral"" phrase, but rather on the word ""review""."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,423.57,437.873,"Well, we go forward and use that -- even -- we would suggest, Your Honor, even more strongly that the phrase ""collateral review"", as that phrase has been used by this Court consistently, recognizes that this is a procedure that occurs after the completion of a direct review process."
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.873,439.546,"Well, that's only because all the cases we've had involved that."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,453.588,462.678,"But, Your Honor, respectfully, in State v. Addonizio itself, it contrasted the Rule 35 motion, for example."
2010.09-868,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,479.999,500.913,"Mr. Weisman, I think that that's not right, that the -- as you say, that the Rule 35 motion that Rhode Island has is based on the Federal Rule 35 motion that existed prior to 1987, and that on a couple of occasions this Court talked about that prior Federal Rule 35 as collateral review."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,501.927,503.066,"--We don't believe so, Your Honor."
2010.09-868,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,503.066,506.738,"U.S. v. Robinson, Barton v. United States."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,508.673,518.639,"We don't believe it ever referred to a sentence, a plea for sentence leniency, Your Honor, no, not as a plea, a pure plea for leniency under Rule 35."
2010.09-868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,518.639,522.855,And the current Federal rule provides for--
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,522.855,522.995,Yes.
2010.09-868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,522.995,527.808,"--It's Rule 35 also, but it doesn't have the pure leniency?"
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,529.227,530.275,"That's correct -- correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-868,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,534.257,556.453,"Let's assume that we adopt your formulation generally, that it has to be for legal error, collateral review has to be for legal error, and we can even add what the Ninth Circuit has found, that it has to be by a court in order to avoid clemency parole review boards, and so forth."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,577.553,582.736,"--I think, Your Honor, we have to differentiate between a legal ground and the vehicle."
2010.09-868,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,589.923,594.937,"It's a motion made in a court, reviewable by the appellate courts of the State."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,594.937,596.169,--But what it--
2010.09-868,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,596.169,598.654,It's a little odd to say it's not legal.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,606.589,620.051,"--Well, to the extent it's abuse of discretion, it's really shorthand for the appellate court takes a look if the sentence is within the proper bounds and if there was, quote, ""some justification"" for the imposition of the sentence, then it's affirmed."
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,622.02,623.923,"And if there is no justification, what do they do?"
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,623.923,632.358,"--If there is no justification -- I can say it hasn't happened so far in our State, and I think -- I don't know what happens in other States."
2010.09-868,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,649.227,653.317,Are those different than the characteristics that the sentencing judge looks at in the first instance?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,653.317,654.07,--They could be the same.
2010.09-868,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,656.819,671.766,"In other words, how these -- you've obviously seen a lot of these and I haven't seen any, but I mean, do the Rule 35 motions typically say -- do they typically concede the legal validity of the sentence and then simply say -- what?"
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,681.573,682.727,--Correct.
2010.09-868,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,682.727,687.008,In what sense is Rule 35 different from the arguments that are made at sentencing?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,687.008,688.225,"It's not much different at all, Your Honor."
2010.09-868,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,690.709,694.738,"But that's bad for you, isn't it, for the very point that Justice Kennedy was raising?"
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,706.156,709.544,"--Because we don't believe they are legal matters, Your Honor."
2010.09-868,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,723.398,729.412,Are those issues that can be -- that are typically raised on direct -- direct review?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,729.412,731.643,"--No, they are not, Your Honor."
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,742.203,748.965,"Do you quarrel with a statement in Mallacone, a Rhode Island 2000 decision that says:"
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,767.581,768.068,--No.
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,768.068,769.768,Is that the review standard?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,769.768,770.673,"Correct, correct."
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,771.114,772.19,That is the standard of review.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,772.19,772.565,--Yes.
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,772.565,784.466,So please explain to me why that is not what Justice Kennedy described as a review for abuse of discretion and why a review for abuse of discretion is not a legal challenge?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,784.466,790.401,"Well, what we suggest is the abuse of discretion that that is talking about is if there is no justification."
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,805.535,806.174,I'm sorry.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,815.733,817.437,We have not.
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,817.437,820.529,Or are you saying that they do find some lack of justification?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,820.529,820.747,No.
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.149,839.13,"Well, then -- then think you are saying that it only gets reversed for abuse of discretion, right?"
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,858.464,863.962,"Because the inquiry is simply -- I understand the words ""abuse of discretion"" are used, but the"
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,875.55,888.669,"I don't want to have to figure this out case by case, or even jurisdiction by jurisdiction, as to whether it's an abuse of discretion review or leniency review or this or that."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,909.925,910.299,I understand.
2010.09-868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,920.376,925.106,Can you read the relevant provision of the Rule 35?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,933.026,933.603,Yes.
2010.09-868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,933.603,936.353,--Read the relevant part of Rule 35.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,936.353,937.869,"Yes, certainly, Your Honor:"
2010.09-868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,953.626,955.923,And you are talking about reducing.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,955.923,959.765,We're talking -- this case involves only a motion to reduce sentence.
2010.09-868,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,962.872,964.732,"Mr. Weisman, I'm sorry."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,993.627,994.002,--It might.
2010.09-868,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,994.002,997.578,"If he had put in that word ""illegal"", would that have made the difference?"
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,997.578,998.421,"It might, Your Honor."
2010.09-868,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1009.105,1024.724,"So but that does suggest the difficulty that Justice Scalia raises, is that we are going to have to look at the particular rule of the State, we are going to have to look at the particular motion, we are going to look at any -- we're going to have to look at any State law regarding how motions are construed."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1027.956,1028.362,Sure.
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1088.02,1099.56,"So a petitioner in the future in Rhode Island should file a petition that says: I'm filing a motion pursuant to 35(a) for an illegal sentence, make something up?"
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1099.56,1099.84,Right.
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1099.84,1101.884,Or for leniency.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1110.46,1111.758,Well--
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1111.758,1121.3,--and then decide whether they would toll or not toll based on that now side trial on what's an illegal sentence and what's just a plea for leniency?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1122.563,1125.094,"--Well, what we suggest actually is very straightforward, Your Honor."
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1134.788,1135.693,So what if they say
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1147.31,1155.039,"--Well, it's may not so much be the magic words, but it's what the -- as this Court has said, it's what the substance of the motion seeks, and that will already have been determined in State court."
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1155.039,1164.724,Either -- either your victory will give you absolutely nothing or you have truly stupid defendant lawyers in Rhode Island.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1170.769,1171.612,Because--
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.612,1172.376,What's to lose?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1179.157,1181.481,"--Because, Your Honor, they actually want to reduce their sentence."
2010.09-868,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1190.918,1201.896,"There is another argument that you could make other than the one you have been pressing, which is that collateral review means something other than a step in the criminal case."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1204.067,1218.281,"Well, we have spoken about the words ""collateral review"" as embracing a case that's already -- upon looking at a proceeding that occurs after the finality of the judgment, which obviously includes this Court's denial of cert or the time--"
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.281,1221.435,But you've said that this could be done before finality.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1221.825,1222.605,--No.
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.605,1227.507,"--I'm sure you said that earlier, that this motion can be made before the judgment is final."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1227.963,1228.369,It can.
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.181,1232.335,But that's not what you just said.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1234.491,1234.928,--No.
2010.09-868,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1252.265,1253.123,I'm sorry.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1262.415,1262.992,They have 120 days.
2010.09-868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1278.798,1282.159,Justice Scalia's suggestion--
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1282.159,1283.126,Except that it says--
2010.09-868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1283.126,1296.665,--that perhaps the -- the leniency review is -- is not review of the conviction or sentence.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1309.818,1311.3,"It's clearly not, Your Honor, correct."
2010.09-868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1335.917,1337.571,So what -- is it something in between?
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1340.351,1343.397,"--It -- it's neither fish nor fowl, Your Honor."
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.438,1368.404,"--I guess we need a new adjective then, because I've always thought that there are two kinds of review, direct and collateral."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1372.37,1377.51,"Well, I don't know that it needs to be called anything, Your Honor."
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.711,1380.96,I think it maybe doesn't need to be called anything because it doesn't exist.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1382.602,1383.163,--Well--
2010.09-868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1383.163,1384.255,--imagine anything that isn't either direct or collateral.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1384.255,1394.608,"--it is certainly -- it is certainly an interesting vehicle because, it can be filed prior to the finality of the judgment and it can be filed -- and it can be filed after the judgment becomes final."
2010.09-868,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1418.758,1423.676,"But, Mr. Weisman, that's true also of State habeas claims that are based only on State law."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1429.251,1429.797,We are not.
2010.09-868,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1457.328,1460.452,Where the exhaustion policy does not come into effect.
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1460.452,1460.78,--Exactly.
2010.09-868,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1489.547,1490.935,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-868,0,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,1490.935,1492.342,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-868,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1492.342,1504.774,Ms. Mizner.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1504.774,1507.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-868,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1542.177,1549.927,"Am I correct that you think ""post-conviction or other collateral review"" means anything that occurs after the conclusion of direct review?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1549.927,1553.502,"Yes, for purposes of the tolling provision."
2010.09-868,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1553.502,1557.64,"Then what does the phrase ""or other collateral review"" add?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1561.828,1578.193,"In Duncan, this Court talked about the possibility of civil commitment or contempt custody that could be part of the Rule 2254 proceeding and that that would not be post-conviction."
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1611.024,1616.147,Why don't you just call your motion a motion to correct an illegal sentence?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1619.24,1622.707,"Under the State's theory, there would not be."
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1624.535,1629.114,You are not one of the stupid lawyers that we were worried about before.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1629.426,1632.83,"I may be in other respects, Your Honor, but not this one."
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1632.83,1633.688,I'm sure of that.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1639.841,1641.655,From the State's perspective.
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.324,1648.525,"Well, it's because you want something other than legal review, right?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1663.737,1664.459,--Yes.
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1688.62,1698.239,"You can raise all of those -- all of those claims under the normal State collateral post-conviction, State habeas, all those other thing, right?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1698.239,1704.877,--You can raise those issues under the post-conviction review.
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1719.231,1721.528,So I guess I'm having trouble.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1737.223,1741.521,In Rhode Island you can not challenge your sentence on direct review.
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1741.521,1746.064,Can you challenge it on -- in State habeas?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1746.064,1749.468,You challenge it by way of the Rule 35 motion.
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1749.562,1755.762,That's the only vehicle you have -- that's the only vehicle you have for challenging the sentence?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1755.762,1760.524,--That's the normal vehicle that is used for challenging the sentence.
2010.09-868,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1773.88,1793.838,"So after a conviction in the State, if there's an appeal with a number -- on direct review, with a number of issues, improperly admitted evidence and so forth, you -- the lawyer can't add -- and in addition he was sentenced under the wrong provision."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1797.978,1802.787,"--Under my understanding of the Rhode Island Supreme Court decisions, the answer to that is no."
2010.09-868,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1802.787,1808.082,"You can challenge only the conviction, not the sentence, on direct review?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1808.082,1812.364,I believe that that is the holding of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.
2010.09-868,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1812.364,1824.703,Do you agree that Rule 35 is not something that the prisoner must exhaust before seeking Federal habeas?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1824.703,1834.524,Exhaustion for Federal habeas is limited to the exhaustion of claims that are going to be presented in the Federal habeas petition.
2010.09-868,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1858.0,1870.448,Isn't the whole purpose of allowing tolling of the 1-year Federal statute the purpose to give the petitioner an opportunity to exhaust what he must exhaust?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1870.448,1893.408,"Exhaustion is one of the purposes of the tolling provision, but this Court has recognized that AEDPA's purpose was to further the principles of comity and finality and federalism and had a clear purpose of encouraging litigants to pursue claims in State court prior to seeking Federal review."
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1911.042,1916.397,"I may have asked this already, but it seems unusual to me so I want to make sure the answer."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1942.87,1947.916,"It would be raised in the State Rule 35, a motion to correct."
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1947.916,1949.429,"Well, you say it ""would be raised""."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1952.51,1961.565,It could be raised under the State post-conviction review proceedings as well.
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1961.565,1963.613,That's what I would have thought.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1968.581,1969.86,No.
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1969.86,1970.312,Okay.
2010.09-868,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1970.312,1979.273,"I -- your adversary said the contrary, and I was -- you are flip-flopping."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1982.417,1982.947,No--
2010.09-868,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1982.947,1983.914,An illegal sentence?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1983.914,1985.509,--Not on direct appeal.
2010.09-868,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1985.509,1992.285,So what did you mean when you answered the Chief Justice that it could be brought in collateral proceedings?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1992.285,1995.315,Rule 35 is a collateral proceeding.
2010.09-868,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1995.315,2011.089,"That's -- just so your adversary, when he gets up on rebuttal can confirm or not this point, any challenge to an illegal sentence has to be brought first with a Rule 35(a) a motion, regardless of what the grounds of illegality are?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2011.089,2019.945,"Yes, or perhaps in a motion for post-conviction relief under section 10-9.1."
2010.09-868,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2019.945,2023.381,Can I return to the question Justice Ginsburg asked a couple minutes ago?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2066.74,2079.936,"A prisoner who receives adequate relief in the State court, through whatever vehicle, may choose not to pursue a Federal habeas corpus claim."
2010.09-868,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2079.936,2082.17,"In your experience, does that happen a lot?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2104.784,2117.0,"I would say that would be unlikely, but there are many Federal habeas cases that are -- raise questions of, for example, ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing."
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2129.182,2130.727,Can you explain--
2010.09-868,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2130.727,2142.067,"If you look at 2255 -- that's the Federal post-conviction review, and it also has a 1-year statute of limitations."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2152.295,2173.181,"2255, Justice Ginsburg, has no tolling provision at all, and the reason for that may perhaps be the respect for comity that Congress recognized when you are addressing a 2254 petition filed by a State prisoner."
2010.09-868,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2173.181,2187.894,"I think, Ms. Mizner, the amicus brief in this case asserted that in Rhode Island or in other States with a rule like this many judges sit on these Rule 35 motions."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2204.915,2211.883,"I don't practice in Rhode Island, but in this case the Rule 35 did not sit."
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2228.578,2236.682,"Well, I guess the question -- and I'm sorry if I cut you off -- is not that this is a question of abuse, that it may be a good thing."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2273.606,2280.633,"Well, the Rule 35 also provides that the decision must be made within a reasonable time."
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2280.633,2282.259,"120 days, right?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2282.259,2285.757,No. 120 days is the time frame--
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2285.757,2286.708,For filing?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2286.708,2288.6,--within which the motion must be filed.
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2288.6,2288.927,Right.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2288.927,2293.61,The rule also provides that it must be decided or resolved within a reasonable time.
2010.09-868,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2298.454,2304.171,Do we have any indication in the case law what a reasonable time consists of?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2304.171,2310.947,I have not found any Rhode Island cases discussing that particular question.
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2310.947,2312.647,--Can you go back for a second?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2332.797,2333.44,Yes.
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2333.44,2338.888,"And as to the second, he files a Rule 35 motion?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2338.888,2340.452,That's my understanding also.
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2340.452,2343.794,"And when does he file the Rule 35 motion, because it says at any time?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2343.794,2345.167,No.
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2349.461,2349.835,"No, it doesn't say that."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2364.189,2369.764,A defendant would have an interest in getting an--
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2369.764,2372.264,Don't take what I have as my view.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2381.199,2387.898,"--He could correct it by filing the motion at any time, and--"
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2387.898,2388.71,Where?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2388.71,2390.601,--In the trial court.
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2390.601,2392.694,"If the trial court says no, what does he do."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2392.694,2393.443,He appeals.
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2393.443,2393.802,Fine.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2410.218,2411.014,Yes.
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2411.014,2411.56,Okay.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2415.51,2427.837,"If both appeals are pending at the same time, the practice would be to consolidate them, so you would have a ruling from the Rhode Island Supreme Court--"
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2427.837,2431.179,"And if they are not -- they are not -- if they are not at the same time, then what?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2431.179,2449.903,--Then the judgment would become final when the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirms the conviction and either this Court--
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2449.903,2450.465,Why not the sentence?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2450.465,2455.168,--You may have two time frames--
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.168,2457.134,In April they affirm the conviction.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2470.205,2471.235,--I would say June.
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2471.235,2472.034,June.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2493.914,2497.412,There may be an appeal--
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2497.412,2498.757,There may be?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2498.757,2501.409,--from such -- from the denial of a Rule 35.
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2501.409,2512.312,"What I'm trying to figure out is why, if you are willing to call for purposes of one -- the one-year statute begins to run from the time the direct appeal becomes final."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2524.776,2529.666,It -- the Rule 35--
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2529.666,2531.681,"This would help you just as much, I imagine."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2533.849,2543.489,--Rhode Island's manner of addressing the Rule 35 seems to be somewhat unusual in terms of--
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2543.489,2547.018,"You see, my basic question is: Why -- look."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2584.208,2595.482,--If the Rule 35 motion is filed after the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirms the judgment with--
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2595.482,2595.996,Wait a minute.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2599.841,2600.871,--Judgment of conviction.
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2600.871,2608.803,"That's the same reason that it doesn't become final when you have not appealed your sentence yet, or when they haven't -- they didn't consolidate."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2624.25,2626.796,"It is, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2650.254,2652.922,There must be in Rhode Island some complaints about the sentence.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2652.922,2661.025,--In terms of a motion for reduction for leniency--
2010.09-868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2661.025,2662.539,Both.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2662.539,2673.114,--I have not seen any -- prejudgment -- pre-Rhode Island Supreme Court resolution.
2010.09-868,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2673.114,2694.978,"What would happen if the statutory maximum for an offense in Rhode Island is 5 years and the sentencing judge imposes a sentence of 10 years, and the defense attorney at that time says, Well, you can't do that; that's more than a statutory maximum, and the judge goes ahead with it and then an appeal is taken?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2708.72,2711.844,That is what the Rhode Island Supreme Court has said.
2010.09-868,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2711.844,2715.513,"Is there a citation for that, that you have?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2715.513,2728.615,I do not have that with me.
2010.09-868,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2728.615,2730.55,Could I return you to something more basic?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2742.136,2771.027,"Well, this Court has discussed -- has used the term ""collateral review"" in a number of different contexts, in civil cases, in habeas cases, in the manner of distinguishing between direct review and something that is outside direct review."
2010.09-868,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2771.027,2777.918,"Isn't -- if I look up ""collateral attack"" in Black's Law Dictionary, won't I find a definition there?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2792.487,2806.4,"""Collateral"" generally means supplementary, as defined in Black's, and ""collateral attack"" in Black's is defined as an attack on a judgment in a proceeding other than direct appeal."
2010.09-868,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2806.4,2806.9,Right.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2806.9,2812.242,But the Rule 35 motion in Rhode Island is not part of the direct appeal.
2010.09-868,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2813.884,2814.726,It is part of the case.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2814.726,2826.565,"--It is part of the case, Justice Alito, but a -- a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence which is viewed as collateral is also part of the original proceeding."
2010.09-868,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2826.565,2831.857,"What about just a regular motion for a new trial, not based on newly -- on newly discovered evidence?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2836.077,2855.207,The motions for new trial -- a motion for new trial that has to be filed within 10 or 14 days of the conviction would be part of the direct appeal and therefore would be -- would not be collateral.
2010.09-868,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2871.624,2878.995,What's wrong with the argument that nothing that occurs in the criminal case itself is collateral?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2929.146,2946.827,"There is no indication that Congress was limiting the use of the term ""collateral review"" to a post-conviction legal challenge."
2010.09-868,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2951.295,2954.388,I'm not saying it has to do with whether it's legal or something else.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,2959.305,2986.508,"Traditionally motions that are filed -- motions for new trial are -- may be filed after the judgment has been affirmed and have been viewed by the courts as collateral, as collateral review."
2010.09-868,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3039.156,3039.721,Do you--
2010.09-868,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3039.721,3044.217,2255 is -- is in the original case but it's a habeas substitute.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3048.667,3050.713,Yes.
2010.09-868,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3050.713,3059.257,--Do you think that a petition for clemency that is presented to the governor would toll the limitations period?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3059.257,3060.946,"No, I do not, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-868,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3060.946,3061.788,Why -- why is that different?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3061.788,3070.145,Because 2244(d)(2) is tolling an application for review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.
2010.09-868,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3097.507,3100.132,"Well, that may be right but I don't think that's the reason."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3117.065,3124.403,--I would agree.
2010.09-868,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3124.403,3134.528,"You think it doesn't matter that -- I mean, Rule 35 motion is a motion made in the original criminal proceeding, not to the side of it."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3146.461,3158.174,"Yes, it is, Justice Ginsberg, as is a Rule 33 motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, which courts have held to be collateral."
2010.09-868,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3172.903,3185.897,"So if this was -- if this motion had been filed before judgment, which can happen, before the judgment is final, then there would be no tolling?"
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3185.897,3193.926,Tolling would not come into -- into play until after the judgment has become final.
2010.09-868,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3196.939,3197.875,So the answer is yes.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3207.309,3207.886,Yes.
2010.09-868,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3207.886,3210.931,There seems to be some confusion.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3220.462,3221.257,Yes.
2010.09-868,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3221.257,3222.864,So there is a judgment rendered.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3232.691,3242.232,"Well, the judgment would become final as far as the State is concerned, if on appeal, if there is an appeal and the Rhode Island Supreme Court has--"
2010.09-868,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3242.232,3244.544,"But if there is no appeal, it was final the day it was rendered."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3244.544,3245.293,--Yes.
2010.09-868,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3245.293,3246.276,As far as the State is concerned.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3249.166,3249.933,Yes.
2010.09-868,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3249.933,3254.289,So there is a judgment and this is always post-judgment.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3254.289,3256.103,Yes.
2010.09-868,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3256.103,3264.254,"Well, that's not -- that's not what the State says, anyway."
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3271.675,3278.825,It has to be filed within 121 days after the entry.
2010.09-868,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3278.825,3279.406,That's right.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3285.154,3290.571,It would have to be filed after the sentence is imposed.
2010.09-868,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3290.571,3291.463,That's right.
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3291.463,3293.288,And the sentence--
2010.09-868,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3293.288,3295.134,When does -- when does it become final?
2010.09-868,1,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3301.661,3307.8,--I would say it becomes final when it is imposed.
2010.09-868,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3307.8,3310.252,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3312.923,3314.861,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-868,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3354.277,3357.916,"I'm sorry, I -- you were speaking so fast, I didn't follow you."
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3357.916,3359.199,"I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-868,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3359.199,3373.018,"Perhaps we can go back to the simple question, which is, can a defendant who has been sentenced bring a challenge to a sentence in a direct appeal, or not?"
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3376.048,3390.933,"Although there is dicta and some language where our supreme court says essentially file challenges to your sentence as pursuant to Rule 35, it is clear that only certain types of challenges can be brought in a Rule 35 motion."
2010.09-868,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3402.884,3403.18,Okay.
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3408.113,3408.706,Right.
2010.09-868,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3408.706,3410.02,"So they should go on direct appeal, correct?"
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3410.02,3419.936,"The only ones that are correct on a Rule 35(a) are again where the sentence is not authorized by law, when where it has imposed unauthorized form of punishment, or a judgment--"
2010.09-868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3419.936,3421.126,"That's called ""it's illegal""."
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3421.126,3421.422,--Correct.
2010.09-868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3421.828,3422.733,So now it's illegal.
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3422.733,3423.045,Correct.
2010.09-868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3423.045,3437.305,And the odd thing is that -- that kind of appeal takes place either days or possibly weeks after the defendant may already have appealed his conviction to the higher court.
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3437.305,3438.194,Well -- correct.
2010.09-868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3438.194,3438.709,Is that right?
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3439.536,3440.257,That is correct.
2010.09-868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3440.663,3452.314,"And what I'm curious about is what happens if the court affirms that sentence, let's say two months after it already affirmed the conviction?"
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3452.314,3452.689,Right.
2010.09-868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3453.157,3464.091,Which is the judgment pursuant to which -- which is the judgment that became final by conclusion of direct review?
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3464.091,3469.445,"--And our position would be, that's not part of the direct review appellate process."
2010.09-868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3469.445,3469.695,Why?
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3469.695,3470.147,That's--
2010.09-868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3470.147,3484.642,"The person is not being held in custody pursuant to a judgment of the State court, or at least a relevant judgment, until the sentence has been appealed."
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3493.217,3494.39,"--But Your Honor, that could occur at any time."
2010.09-868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3496.952,3497.28,Exactly.
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3497.28,3498.31,And we're not--
2010.09-868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3498.31,3501.23,That's why I don't -- that's why I am confused.
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3512.429,3514.005,--But we would suggest--
2010.09-868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3514.005,3523.707,"And the sentence is final in the lower court, but they say when the sentence is final at the conclusion of direct review in respect to that sentence, which hasn't even taken place yet."
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3523.707,3528.452,"--Yes, but our point would be, Your Honor, that it doesn't move the start of the 1-year limitations period."
2010.09-868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3539.839,3540.104,Okay.
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3540.572,3541.523,--It doesn't--
2010.09-868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3541.523,3549.034,"--all appeals in Rhode Island from sentences -- all appeals on their lawfulness or their mercy take place under Rule 35, and all of them are collateral."
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3549.034,3551.144,--No.
2010.09-868,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3562.655,3564.277,I'm totally confused.
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3575.024,3576.713,It becomes final--
2010.09-868,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3576.713,3578.962,That -- that truly -- because -- you're--
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3578.962,3587.363,"--Well, under Jiminez v. Walker becomes final when -- 90 days from when the supreme court affirms the conviction."
2010.09-868,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3587.363,3606.731,"--But if the Rhode Island court has told litigants that they can't challenge some portions of an illegal sentence except by way of Rule 35, how can we call the decision on the affirmance of the conviction a final determination of legality of the sentence?"
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3609.48,3619.943,"Because Congress has decided to pick the day on which the appeal becomes -- the conviction becomes final, which always occurs 90 days after the State's high court--"
2010.09-868,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3619.943,3622.209,That's not what it says.
2010.09-868,2,17286,aaron_l_weisman,,3634.344,3639.031,"--Yes, but Congress has set four dates on which the conviction becomes final."
2010.09-868,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3639.031,3640.435,"Thank you, counsel."
