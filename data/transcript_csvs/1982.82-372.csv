1982.82-372,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.963,We will hear arguments first this morning in Federal Trade Commission against Grolier Incorporated.
1982.82-372,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,10.884,12.058,Thank you.
1982.82-372,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,204.588,210.164,"Mr. Geller, are these documents among those that were refused to be disclosed pursuant to the 1976 order?"
1982.82-372,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,210.164,211.069,I believe they are.
1982.82-372,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,211.069,213.21,So they're the same documents in both cases?
1982.82-372,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,213.21,215.99,I believe some of them are the same documents.
1982.82-372,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,217.379,223.111,And the Government took no appeal or sought review in any way?
1982.82-372,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,223.111,227.953,"--That's correct, of the dismissal of the Americana action."
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,1719.678,1720.349,Thank you.
1982.82-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1794.163,1799.24,What showing did they make to get the documents from the judge?
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,1799.24,1802.707,"What showing did the Americana Corporation make, Your Honor?"
1982.82-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.978,1871.801,"What was the master's order in response to, a motion to produce documents?"
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,1871.801,1876.848,"--Yes, Your Honor, a Rule 37 motion filed by the defendant in the Americana litigation."
1982.82-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.77,1884.155,And of course you just can't get any document you want by making a motion.
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,1884.155,1885.189,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.189,1889.717,What was the... what's the standard in Rule 37?
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,1889.717,1892.7,"Well, the standard under Rule 37... the Government--"
1982.82-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1892.7,1896.342,What's the standard under Rule 37 to get documents?
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,1896.342,1901.306,"--Well, the standard under Rule 37 would be whether they're relevant, whether it fits all the other tests."
1982.82-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.184,1903.088,What are the other tests?
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,1904.227,1913.239,"--Well, the main test in civil litigation, Your Honor, under Rule 37 is whether the documents are relevant or may lead to relevant evidence or information in the litigation."
1982.82-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1957.361,1962.891,"Mr. Mason, you seem to make a great deal of these facts, as if they suggested some impropriety on the Government's part."
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,1979.059,1987.334,"Your Honor, so the Court is clear, we are not contending that this case should be affirmed because we've shown some ethical violation."
1982.82-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1988.444,1991.038,What ethical violations do you think you have shown?
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,1991.038,1992.848,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't know that we've shown any."
1982.82-372,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1995.72,2001.515,Why were you talking about the ethical factors so much when you now tell us that you don't know whether you've shown any?
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2001.515,2012.403,"Your Honor, there was no finding by the district court of any ethical practice, and I would not tell this Court that it should make a ruling based on any ethical violation that was found below."
1982.82-372,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2012.403,2013.495,Well then why talk about it?
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2013.495,2014.575,"Because, Your Honor--"
1982.82-372,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2014.575,2017.87,To cast some sort of a cloud over the argument here?
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2017.87,2018.682,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.82-372,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2019.883,2021.43,That's the impression you're giving me.
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2021.43,2022.335,--The only--
1982.82-372,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2022.335,2024.133,Your brief gave me the same impression.
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2024.133,2036.268,"--Your Honor, the only reason we have raised that point is to indicate that this case is slightly different than the type of documents that were generated by Mr. Fortenbas in Hickman versus Taylor."
1982.82-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.11,2275.811,"I'm not sure where you say that, Mr. Mason."
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2304.858,2311.807,"Your Honor, Your Honor is talking about the Howerton documents, how we could have gotten those in some other way?"
1982.82-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2311.807,2312.949,Yes.
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2312.949,2316.26,"Your Honor, we asked for those documents--"
1982.82-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2316.26,2317.991,"Why were they relevant, anyway?"
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2317.991,2331.082,"--Your Honor, the reason they were relevant is because the Federal Trade Commission had filed an action against Americana Corporation alleging all types of violations of a cease and desist order."
1982.82-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2340.359,2346.123,"Well, have you ever tried a lawsuit in which you didn't have to go out and get supplemental evidence, sometimes during... while witnesses were testifying?"
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2348.311,2383.749,"--Your Honor, Justice Rehnquist, the only point we are making... and it is not a big point in our appeal, but I want to be responsive to Your Honor's questions... the only point we are making is that the documents that were generated here were generated as a result of an effort by counsel for plaintiff, counsel for the Government, in litigation against defendant, which instructed his client to go, after a lawsuit had been started, after counsel had been retained by the defendant, and try to go and get some supplemental information or so-called evidence without telling the lawyer for the other side."
1982.82-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.95,2386.607,Why on earth would you tell the lawyer for the other side?
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2389.465,2407.785,"--Your Honor, because Disciplinary Rule 7.104 says that after a lawsuit is filed and the other side hires a lawyer you, the lawyer for one party, can't approach the other defendant on the subject of the representation or the litigation without advising the lawyer who represents the other party."
1982.82-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2407.785,2414.5,"Mr. Mason, didn't you a few minutes ago tell the Chief Justice you were not raising any ethical points?"
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2414.5,2416.033,Your Honor--
1982.82-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2416.033,2416.688,Didn't you?
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2416.688,2417.437,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2418.186,2418.844,So now you're raising them.
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2418.844,2422.623,"Because Justice Rehnquist asked me the question, Your Honor, and I wanted to be responsive."
1982.82-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2445.568,2464.871,"Mr. Mason, do you think then we should adopt a principle that... supposing it's not Judge Fisher in New Jersey but Judge Schmaltz in Wisconsin, and he files a perfectly bizarre order directing the Government to disclose information which they would much rather dismiss their lawsuit than conform to."
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2477.411,2481.318,"I would assume, Your Honor, the Government does not appeal Judge Schmaltz's outrageous order--"
1982.82-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.318,2482.737,"Well, you can't really appeal a discovery order."
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2484.691,2491.017,"--Your Honor, a lot of times the Government will take a dismissal with prejudice, as they did in Leggett & Platt, and appeal that up to the Circuit Court."
1982.82-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.441,2635.88,Still just a concurrence.
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2635.88,2639.409,"--It is a concurrence, Your Honor, but I think the language is very persuasive."
1982.82-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.974,2715.66,Mr. Mason.
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2715.66,2716.269,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2716.269,2717.488,May I ask you a point on that question.
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2720.985,2721.485,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2721.485,2728.294,"And that was an action to penalize Grolier-Americana for violating a 1948 order, was that not it?"
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2728.294,2728.731,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2728.731,2731.074,Is the 1948 order still on the books?
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2731.074,2736.37,"Your Honor, I believe the FTC... and we're representing Americana."
1982.82-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2740.118,2744.165,"Well, isn't there a possibility that that order might be violated in the future?"
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2744.165,2754.176,"Your Honor, I would not want to suggest that my client would do that, but yes, there could be a possibility, but that is a pending case."
1982.82-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2795.378,2796.454,"Well, let me just make sure."
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2816.914,2827.506,"--Your Honor, because under the D.C. Circuit's rules the litigation must be terminated and, step two, there must be no related litigation."
1982.82-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2844.342,2853.744,"It would seem... the answer, it seems to me, is that the documents should not be disclosable because there is potential litigation on the horizon."
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2856.104,2865.553,"--Yes, Your Honor, but also sine quo non, the reason for having the rule, i.e. terminated litigation, hasn't happened."
1982.82-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2878.703,2880.032,Why isn't that this case?
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2881.046,2888.825,Because the documents we're asking for in this case were generated in the enforcement proceeding--
1982.82-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2888.825,2889.293,Right.
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2889.293,2891.212,--which was dismissed with prejudice.
1982.82-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2895.368,2896.288,"No, I understand."
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2896.288,2897.411,--but in the underlying litigation.
1982.82-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2897.411,2902.365,"But you also acknowledge the possibility of another enforcement proceeding of the 1948 order, as I understand you."
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2902.365,2904.147,"Yes, Your Honor, that's true."
1982.82-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2910.034,2912.285,"You'd be happy with that rule, but you'd lose this case."
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2912.285,2923.528,"--Your Honor, we are not asking... I don't think that's correct, because we are not... we don't say that there is a relation here between the consent decree and discovery--"
1982.82-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2923.528,2924.857,"No, and the Government hasn't made this argument."
1982.82-372,1,21213,daniel_s_mason,,2928.416,2928.775,--All right.
1982.82-372,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3413.158,3415.469,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Geller?"
1982.82-372,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3415.469,3418.624,"Just one or two things, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3525.143,3527.951,"Mr. Geller, you don't really contend it mirrors civil discovery."
1982.82-372,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3532.935,3535.699,"Well, it mirrors civil discovery in terms of the extent of the privilege."
1982.82-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3538.058,3538.355,--Right.
1982.82-372,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3538.355,3539.041,--then you never--
1982.82-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3539.041,3545.947,"But your view is that really in specific cases it's narrower, FOIA is narrower, whereas the Court of Appeals took the view it was broader."
1982.82-372,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3545.947,3553.536,"--Well, it's quite... it's narrower in the sense that no showing of need has to be made under FOIA."
1982.82-372,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3555.193,3555.567,Right.
1982.82-372,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3555.567,3562.876,"--to see whether there's some plaintiff somewhere who could overcome the privilege, because that would read the privilege out of the statutes in terms of Government litigation."
1982.82-372,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3564.095,3564.61,"Thank you, gentlemen."
