1963.25,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,13.266,"Number 25, Claude Dennis, Petitioner, versus Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad Company."
1963.25,0,43888,wayne_l_black,,15.577,20.629,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Honorable Court."
1963.25,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,383.204,387.688,(Voice Overlap) -- he didn't really inquire the foreman (Inaudible).
1963.25,0,43888,wayne_l_black,,387.688,388.051,No.
1963.25,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.051,392.628,The only efforts where he says (Inaudible).
1963.25,0,43888,wayne_l_black,,392.628,394.412,That's correct Your Honor.
1963.25,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,399.77,401.143,(Inaudible)
1963.25,0,43888,wayne_l_black,,401.143,402.464,Yes Your Honor.
1963.25,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,472.808,475.74,Is there any evidence anyone else was frostbitten?
1963.25,0,43888,wayne_l_black,,475.74,476.886,"No, there isn't Your Honor."
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,1406.488,1410.135,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.592,1889.378,But if the --
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,1889.378,1891.691,(Voice Overlap)
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.691,1894.523,Go ahead Brother.
1963.25,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1894.523,1912.854,(Inaudible)
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,1912.854,1915.379,I don't -- I don't know if I am or not if the Court please.
1963.25,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1916.5,1918.304,(Inaudible)
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,1918.304,1927.842,"I don't think it makes any difference really in this particular case unless to the thing that he's assuming is the risk, it is something that was created by railroad -- through the railroad's negligence."
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.683,1983.813,"Let's assume that -- that the man had a -- the foreman had seen him working without gloves at all on this night, and you say there's no duty, I guess you just mean that, there's no duty if the fellow want to work without gloves --"
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,1983.813,1987.088,"Well -- frankly, do I have to get there Your Honor?"
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.797,2014.277,"As I understand the record, the -- when this man showed up to work, the foreman noticed he is wearing these -- these white cotton gloves."
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2026.903,2027.064,Yes.
1963.25,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2042.718,2067.009,"I just wonder, suppose the plaintiff was clad in a pair of shorts and a sweatshirt, jockey shirt or something like that, just in the -- even though he assured the foreman that I'm -- I'm alright, I prefer working this way in five degree below zero and no responsibility of the -- paternalistic to suggest that the railroad was having a duty in that (Inaudible)?"
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2067.009,2071.831,Well Your Honor it gets to a point which you -- where a direction you may want to take in this case.
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2102.626,2110.531,But why -- why did -- why did -- why did the foreman say he sent the man to the track at midnight?
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2110.531,2125.123,"Well, it was -- when they -- when they came down to get into the place where the work was to be done, they first have got onto a section car and they've gone along the track to the point designated then he sent this man back to get the truck to bring down to the point where they were going to work."
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.123,2125.397,Yes.
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2128.195,2130.643,"Oh excuse me, I misunderstood your question."
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.999,2136.606,Then why -- so he -- he told him to get in the truck?
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2136.606,2138.141,To protect himself --
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.141,2138.583,And -- but the --
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2138.583,2139.83,-- from the cold.
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.83,2139.905,I guess the --
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2139.905,2146.42,And that was the first indication that he had had from this man that he was being in anyway bothered by the cold.
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.42,2157.449,"So you think -- you think he could've -- without any breach of duty dispensed, let's assume the foreman was correct, admitted he actually told him to get in the truck."
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2161.474,2161.778,No.
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.995,2168.321,Yes.
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2168.321,2170.117,-- and that there's something that should be done and I think --
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.117,2170.453,Yes.
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2170.453,2171.318,-- there's a duty.
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.318,2176.621,"Well, then how we -- isn't exactly this case then?"
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2176.621,2177.197,"No, I don't think --"
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2177.197,2182.588,Accepting the -- accepting the testimony of the -- of the plaintiff --
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2182.588,2182.757,"No, I don't think so."
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2182.757,2185.195,"-- between (Inaudible) he says, ""I'm cold."""
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2188.679,2190.433,But he didn't give any indication of what --
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2190.433,2193.201,I don't know what -- I don't know what he indicated.
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2193.201,2194.757,Or nor do I Your Honor.
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.757,2196.45,Oh I know but it certainly is consistent with the evidence --
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2196.45,2197.283,Indicated that he was cold.
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.283,2199.068,-- that his hands were cold too.
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2199.068,2199.83,Yes.
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.83,2204.386,I mean as well as his ears maybe but maybe his hands too.
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2213.444,2227.385,"Well, if -- if you want to take that -- to the other point of that is this if the Court please that the plaintiff himself said that there was at no time that he was prevented from going over the fire to warm himself or do anything else he want to do to warm himself."
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.725,2238.008,That's part of contributory negligence I suppose would have nothing to do with the duty you were talking about.
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2241.999,2242.537,I don't --
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2242.537,2245.346,"-- that the man was complaining that he ought to do something about it, I believe."
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2245.346,2255.642,"I don't think that there is a duty in this case for this foreman to do anything until it became apparent to the foreman, the exercise of reasonable care that if he didn't act, this man might be injured."
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.642,2258.82,"Well, if the -- the fellow comes up and says, ""I'm cold."
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2261.535,2265.2,"Well, I think the foreman should take -- exercise a reasonable care."
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.2,2266.191,"Well, which is what?"
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2266.191,2272.068,But this foreman didn't at any time say that he didn't -- that he didn't take care -- exercise care in that regard.
1963.25,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2272.068,2278.56,"No, but I thought the plaintiff testified that the foreman agreed that apparently the plaintiff came to the foreman and said I'm cold."
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2278.56,2279.352,I think --
1963.25,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2279.352,2284.647,And the plaintiff says that he did nothing about it and kept out there until 4 o'clock in the morning.
1963.25,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2288.398,2295.796,"Yes, it was a duty and the jury -- wouldn't at least for the jury to say whether on those circumstances, cold night, all the rest of the circumstances there was -- it was --"
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2295.796,2299.952,But I think the chief dispute that we get into there is one at a time.
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.036,2331.837,"Nevertheless, there's a clear conflict in the testimony as to when the --"
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2331.837,2334.112,"Conflict on time I think Your Honor, not on the fact --"
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.112,2334.508,The -- that's right --
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2334.508,2335.13,-- the foreman told him to get into the --
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.13,2335.991,Exactly right.
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2350.133,2357.773,"I -- I -- I -- I appeal to the record Your Honor, we'll have an opportunity to look to because I think our position is clear and -- and your position is clear."
1963.25,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2364.122,2373.626,"What about the record on page 35 where he said at 12 o'clock that he went to a fire, the train was going by?"
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2373.626,2374.464,"Yes, sir."
1963.25,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2374.464,2378.747,"And the plaintiff said -- the petitioner said, ""I went to the fire."
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2411.502,2412.961,I think that's the correct record.
1963.25,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2412.961,2416.375,So he brought it to the attention of the foreman at 12 o'clock.
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2416.375,2416.698,Yes.
1963.25,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2430.652,2440.844,"Well, he contends as I remember that the wind was blowing through this cut so if the fire -- the blaze of the fire and the heat of the fire was dissipated."
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2441.614,2442.677,I must concede that.
1963.25,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2453.92,2456.696,So the wind was blowing too hard (Inaudible)?
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2456.696,2457.525,This is correct.
1963.25,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2457.831,2468.979,"This truck, as I read, that's why it seemed to me that if his hands were sticking to this wrench which I understand was about four feet long."
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2468.979,2469.176,"Yes, this is a large --"
1963.25,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2469.176,2469.829,Is that --
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2469.829,2472.608,-- wrench which they use on the bolting of these particular --
1963.25,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2472.608,2481.449,I'm not familiar with railroading but it appears to me that might put the foreman on notice that here's the man that's got a frozen hand.
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2481.449,2492.585,"Well, in any event, this time, and obviously had at this time, where they were standing by a fire, it may have put him on notice but what would he be required to do at that point?"
1963.25,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2492.585,2492.673,I --
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2492.673,2492.842,(Voice Overlap)
1963.25,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2492.842,2495.442,-- suppose take him back to the hospital (Inaudible).
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2496.797,2499.162,"Well, he didn't say he had a frozen hand, he said he was cold (Voice Overlap) --"
1963.25,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2499.162,2501.985,That it -- doesn't that -- so he kept all working till 5'oclock.
1963.25,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.985,2508.676,"Yes, that's the point, a suggestion that maybe different --"
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2508.676,2520.254,"Well, there -- there is -- your -- I -- I certainly see your point Your Honor but I -- I don't think that the railroad under those circumstances acting as a reasonable ordinary person would have done anything other than they did."
1963.25,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2582.492,2585.322,"Well, suppose -- suppose that he had known of -- that the --"
1963.25,1,18246,clifford_l_ashton,,2585.322,2586.41,Excuse me Your Honor I didn't hear you.
1963.25,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2586.41,2589.611,I -- I just proposed that midnight --
