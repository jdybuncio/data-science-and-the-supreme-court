1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,76.807,79.527,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1261,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,139.876,141.493,Household or householder?
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,141.493,142.4,Household.
1976.75-1261,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,142.4,142.849,Household?
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,142.849,144.209,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1976.75-1261,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,146.469,147.262,Total picture?
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,147.262,148.877,Right.
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,321.518,327.469,"The transportation for get an education and not household, isn’t it?"
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,328.985,329.516,Mr. Justice Marshall --
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,329.516,331.928,Deprived from household too?
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,331.928,348.5,"Transportation expenses, whether they are incurred by one into trying to attend a vocational training program, I think under the Secretary’s regulations are not treated any differently from transportation expenses incurred by other households in the pursuit of equally important endeavors like work or some other."
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,348.5,353.556,Well why do you draw the line between tuition and travel?
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,353.556,362.117,Tuition and travel I think is a form of expense incurred by students that does not have a counterpart in the ordinary household budget.
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,362.117,363.078,Of course not.
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,363.078,363.699,That’s correct.
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,365.856,370.562,"I’m not talking about household, I’m talking about schooling."
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,379.982,381.672,If you -- I’m sorry.
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,381.672,386.392,"If you can’t get the transportation, if you can’t get to the school, you don’t need tuition."
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,386.392,387.845,That’s correct.
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,387.845,393.778,"So, you’ll get credit for tuition providing you get there, but you can’t get credit for -- on your --"
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,393.778,399.724,"That’s right, and I think the whole point of allowing the tuition though is that it is a form of expense incurred by students."
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,409.005,417.273,But why is education limited by household?
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,417.273,423.13,I’m not sure Mr. Justice Marshall that it -- but I understand what you are getting out.
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,429.927,431.755,"It’s on household income, is it not?"
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,431.755,433.856,It is on household income.
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,433.856,440.318,"Well, the normal person is not on the list, pays his tuition to college."
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,443.692,446.031,"Well, it would be included under the Secretary’s regulation as income --"
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,446.031,452.218,Not the secretary but I mean anybody other than the Secretary that would draw line like that?
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,452.218,456.313,"Well, I think that it does accord with the common sense understanding of the term income."
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,468.767,483.516,"But suppose the government said “everybody have the lowest certain income, we will give you all of your tuition, all of your books and everything else, provided you get there on your own.”"
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,484.745,486.534,"Well, certainly, that would be alright and the --"
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,486.534,490.131,Because that’s what you done?
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,492.709,493.9,"Well, I don’t think so. Unless there’s --"
1976.75-1261,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,493.9,494.891,You get there on your own.
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,496.876,506.926,"When you say credit, the point I’m trying to make I think is that the Secretary has a uniform and general approach to deductions from income as opposed to inclusions from income."
1976.75-1261,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,596.247,607.819,"Do you have any idea Mr. Urbanczyk why the District Court, after having found on the statutory grounds that the regulation wasn’t authorized, and went to decide the constitutional questions?"
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,607.819,610.985,"Well, I don’t have a exact idea."
1976.75-1261,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,998.094,1017.243,"Suppose the employer of an individual allowed $50.00 a month to any employee in the one city who attended extension courses of the university 25 miles away, and that was the standard allowance to employees."
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,1025.25,1032.179,"They have to give a legal opinion on that -- regarding that matters since it's a while that I took tax, but I believe I would be, yes."
1976.75-1261,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1032.179,1036.705,"Well, is it not a reasonable analogy?"
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,1036.705,1038.3,"Well, I think it is."
1976.75-1261,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1049.574,1061.357,This could be quite different from an automobile allowance of 10 cents a mile or flat amount for the purposes for carrying on the daily occupation of the employee.
1976.75-1261,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,1061.357,1062.852,I believe that is correct.
1976.75-1261,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1108.352,1116.587,Very well.
1976.75-1261,1,35241,lorna_lawhead_williams,,1118.922,1123.625,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1261,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1614.552,1620.069,"Mr. Williams, I thought your opponent said that she was not able to buy all her food stamps after the case?"
1976.75-1261,1,35241,lorna_lawhead_williams,,1620.069,1627.57,"In his third brief, he attaches her own affidavit where’s that -- all through, she’s talking about she had to buy the food stamps by paying $12.00 more."
1976.75-1261,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1630.351,1635.182,"Didn’t she say that she couldn’t afford the $12.00 and therefore, she got the lesser quota of food stamps?"
1976.75-1261,1,35241,lorna_lawhead_williams,,1635.182,1636.704,"No, Your Honor."
1976.75-1261,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1702.988,1704.794,What is that again?
1976.75-1261,1,35241,lorna_lawhead_williams,,1706.17,1708.848,At page 1b Your Honor.
1976.75-1261,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1750.541,1757.819,It happened until the red light goes on.
1976.75-1261,1,35241,lorna_lawhead_williams,,1757.819,1761.38,"But Your Honor, I want to save my little time for rebuttal for both of us."
1976.75-1261,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1771.218,1774.323,Mr. Bartels?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,1774.323,1777.72,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1261,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1809.315,1815.988,"Of course, if the District Court hadn’t reached the constitutional ground, the case wouldn’t be here at all, isn’t it?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,1815.988,1816.398,"Well Your Honor, I think --"
1976.75-1261,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1816.398,1818.501,"Well, it will be in the Court of Appeals?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,1818.501,1820.451,"Your Honor, I think that would have been an interesting issue."
1976.75-1261,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1846.631,1853.344,[Voice Overlap] send those cases back to the protective appeal to you or require them to go to the Court of Appeals?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,1853.344,1855.779,"Your Honor, I’m not aware of the court’s normal practice."
1976.75-1261,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1942.122,1949.435,"Mr. Bartels, before you get into the explanation of it, I’d like to get one thing sorted out in my own mind."
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,1958.731,1959.938,That’s correct Your Honor.
1976.75-1261,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1959.938,1980.085,"Supposing she had a next door neighbor who worked as a -- did household work of some kind and earned $272.75, and also took training at the university to become a nurse just did everything else exactly the same except her income was from private sources rather than public sources."
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,1987.58,1988.683,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-1261,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.407,2012.295,She just has a net of $272.75.
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2012.295,2013.065,Right.
1976.75-1261,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2025.97,2028.536,But she decided to go to school just like your client is?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2028.536,2029.365,Your Honor --
1976.75-1261,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.365,2032.135,What different choices does she have having made that decision?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2032.135,2041.864,"Well You Honor, if I may persist with that, the crucial factor here is the choice that she has not to take the education."
1976.75-1261,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.551,2077.129,Supposing she has able to hitch hike to work?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2077.129,2088.127,"Well Your Honor, I suppose that then we’re talking about was the $44.00 allowance was really necessary and then, it wouldn’t covered by the District Court’s order."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2128.605,2139.265,But isn’t true or have I misapprehended the situation Mr. Bartels that this is a lump some monthly payment for which no accounting of any kind need be made?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2139.265,2152.193,"That’s not clear at all from the record, and I frankly have not been able to determine whether Ms. Hein was on a full time or part time plan, but I think, it’s really not particularly important either way here Your Honor."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2153.082,2164.817,"Well the Secretary had said for example that if your client had moved to the campus where her only transportation was walking, she would still get the allowance, you disagree with that?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2164.817,2167.411,"Well You Honor, I’m not sure in Ms. Hein’s case."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2167.963,2170.067,Not the general program [Voice Overlap]
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2170.067,2177.457,"Alright, with regard to the general program Your Honor, we have to talk about two groups; part time trainees and full time trainees."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2195.54,2197.889,Part time (Inaudible) for a part time --
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2197.889,2205.411,It’s called a participant trainee in a part time individual education training program.
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2206.59,2207.982,"But, if they where full time?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2207.982,2211.49,"Okay, now a somewhat more complex problem."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2252.192,2254.072,"Whose order, this District Court order?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2254.072,2254.819,That’s right Your Honor.
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2256.674,2259.827,"But other program, she still get the money, would she not?"

1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2262.763,2263.636,That’s right Your Honor.
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2271.784,2274.458,"District Court didn’t make any such distinction, did it?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2274.458,2275.087,No Your Honor.
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2308.069,2309.725,"That’ll be some state of nightmare, wouldn’t it?"

1976.75-1261,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2535.919,2538.993,"What was their actual travel expense, is that in the writing?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2538.993,2555.391,"No Your Honor, the only indication of it is that the allowance was for necessary commuting and that she did the commuting and from that, the District Court I think properly found that all the money had been spent."

1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2758.958,2763.544,"Your Honor, there is -- I think, there maybe a small loop hole there in the allowance."
1976.75-1261,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2780.058,2782.543,How many days in a week that she goes to school?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2782.543,2783.738,"Your Honor again, --"
1976.75-1261,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2783.738,2784.805,That’s not here.
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2784.805,2786.841,"Records not clear on that, no."
1976.75-1261,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.841,2790.711,I’m trying to find out what is in the record that we can use?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2790.711,2818.003,"Your Honor, I think that the main problem at this point that the Court ought to address is people in the future and it is clear that however Karen Hein was treated and however her expenses, actual expenses broke down that we do have left in this case two basic groups of people, part time IETP students and full time IETP students."
1976.75-1261,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2825.462,2827.839,Was this a class action?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2827.839,2828.578,Yes Your Honor.
1976.75-1261,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2828.578,2833.261,Well was Mrs. Hein a full time or a part time student?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2833.261,2834.252,"Your Honor, we don’t know."
1976.75-1261,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2834.252,2841.155,"Well, how do we know whether she can represent both full time or part times students if we don’t even know which one she was?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2841.155,2850.017,"Your Honor, I would think that she can certainly represent the group of people who received these individual education and training allowances."
1976.75-1261,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2850.017,2854.637,But you said a moment ago that you thought part time should be treated differently from full time.
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2854.637,2860.944,"Well Your Honor, it’s really just a matter of sort of the administration and not the theory of the fact."
1976.75-1261,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2860.944,2864.787,"But ordinarily, a District Court doesn’t set to decide matters on pure theory."
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2869.27,2884.911,"You Honor, I think that if one assumed that Karen Hein were a full time student here, which seems to be that the assumption that the Secretary wants to make and which I am perfectly willing to accept, then --"
1976.75-1261,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2884.911,2887.884,But can we accept here?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2887.884,2888.547,Your Honor --
1976.75-1261,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2888.547,2892.811,You can’t come here with a record that you pull out of the thin air.
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2908.032,2920.557,"Your Honor, the stipulation was that it was an allowance for necessary commuting expenses, and the District Court regarded that as sufficient together with the other facts."
1976.75-1261,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2957.113,2964.652,This case has already been here once and was sent back to the same three judges who have dealt with it.
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2964.652,2979.299,"Your Honor, I think and in fact, that’s the good point because when it went back down Your Honor, the District Court had made its findings of fact which included the fact that this was for necessary commuting expenses and that in fact, the money was spent."
1976.75-1261,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2995.019,2997.316,Who initiated the litigation?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2997.316,3000.528,"Well Your Honor, the plaintiff did."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3012.32,3016.534,"Mr. Bartels, what precisely is the statutory issue?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3020.207,3021.351,"Yes Your Honor, it does."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3021.351,3035.198,"It says well, except it says -- it authorizes the Secretary to prescribe the amounts of household income and other financial resources, including those liquid and none liquid assets to be used as criteria of eligibility."
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3038.138,3038.52,Well Your Honor --
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3038.52,3040.706,Statute doesn’t define the word income is what I mean?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3040.706,3041.831,"No, it doesn’t, Your Honor."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3050.386,3054.873,You are talking about it as preamble or the celibacy 2011?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3054.873,3077.524,"2011 is choose the purpose and I think also quite important in terms of showing the connection that Congress saw between income and food purchasing power, Section 2014 (a) says that the program is to be limited to those households whose income and other resources are found to be limiting factor on the ability to purchase --"
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3077.524,3086.668,It authorizes the Secretary then in rather broad authorizing language to prescribe the amounts of household income and other financial resources?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3086.668,3088.168,"That’s correct, Your Honor, and I think --"
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3088.168,3093.519,And the precise statutory question then is what --
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3093.519,3110.508,"Whether the Secretary has exceeded his authority or has exercised in terms of I believe, it would be 2013 (c) Your Honor, whether the Secretary has exercised his authority in a manner inconsistent with the Food Stamp Act."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3110.508,3118.87,"The Act reports to give him very broad authority to -- I won’t read it again, prescribe the amount of income, does it not?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3118.87,3133.329,There’s no question that the Secretary has very broad authority in that they’re sort of basic purchase price levels that he sets for particular levels of income and so on is almost total extent within the Secretary’s authority.
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3133.476,3144.208,"In other words, there cannot be any claim here that the administrative definition of income is contrary to some statutory definition of income because the later doesn’t exist in this statute, is that right?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3144.208,3149.095,"Your Honor, it’s not directly contrary to any clear definition of income."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3159.446,3161.225,And where do you find this conflict?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3165.864,3179.147,"Well Your Honor, the language of the statute that indicates that this and the purpose of this Act is to increase food purchasing power in that income is to be related to food purchasing power."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3181.69,3185.253,"Nothing here about food purchasing power, is there?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3185.253,3187.319,"[Voice Overlap] Your Honor, I believe that the --"
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3187.319,3190.594,"In concurrence of this lawsuit, but there is nothing and either the statute or the regulation?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3190.594,3212.753,"No Your Honor, I believe [Voice Overlap] I believe purchasing power is used in 2011, but you’re right that for the most part, it has become a means of speaking about of the ability of a household to purchase food, to make food purchases."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3212.753,3227.892,"For just the 2011, a food stamp program is herein authorized which will permit low income households to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet through normal channels of trade."
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3233.685,3234.744,"Your Honor, that the next sentence --"
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3234.744,3245.565,-- in the 2014 expressly authorized to prescribe these standards and somehow violated the statute.
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3247.323,3248.774,"That is one of the issues, Your Honor."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3250.927,3254.353,"Well, the second one is the constitutional issue which the court has already talked about?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3254.353,3260.998,"No Your Honor, I think the second statutory issue has to do with 2014 (c) in Title 20."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3274.321,3275.105,Yes.
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3275.105,3287.677,But I think to not provide disincentives is clearly there and that’s very strongly supported by Title 20 which funded the individual education and training program and the allowances involved.
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3289.672,3292.193,That Title 20 is not part of the Food Stamp Act right?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3292.193,3293.364,"No Your Honor, it’s not."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3293.364,3302.869,"But the claim here, however, is that the Secretary’s regulation violates the statute under or is in conflict with the statute under whose authority he made the regulation?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3302.869,3306.177,"That’s right Your Honor, and I think we have to look at 2014 (c) --"
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3306.177,3311.422,It’s not the claim that violates some other statute that did authorize the --
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3311.422,3318.156,"Your Honor, the District Court found that it violated Food Stamp Act because of the disincentive to education."
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3344.838,3348.487,You say that’s in the 2014 (c)?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3348.487,3353.845,"Your Honor, that’s a reference and the students are exempted from the work registration requirement."
1976.75-1261,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3374.059,3381.953,"Mr. Bartels, is there anything in the statute that would prevent Iowa from terminating the $44.00 allowance?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3381.953,3389.995,"Your Honor, in Title 20, I don’t believe so and certainly Iowa is perfectly free not to participate in at all."
1976.75-1261,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3389.995,3394.427,"So and that of course, that wouldn’t raise any question under the Food Stamp Act?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3394.427,3406.555,"No Your Honor, that would raise a question if there is this training program and there is not sufficient allowances to allow say an AFDC recipient to participate, that might raise a problem under Title 20, but not on the --"
1976.75-1261,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3406.555,3407.467,It’s the Food Stamp Act.
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3407.467,3420.466,"No Your Honor, because in there’s no impact on food purchasing power and there’s no disincentive to education from the Food Stamp Act that then becomes disincentive from Title 20 and certainly the State of Iowa --"
1976.75-1261,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3420.466,3429.156,"What’s you are saying if I understand you, is the more travel allowance she gets, the greater the disincentive because it reduces the food stamp, you know, a percentage of that is taken away from --"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3429.156,3430.338,No Your Honor.
1976.75-1261,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3450.923,3456.863,"As I understand, there was a stipulation in this case says that $40.00 was necessary for travel in this case?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3456.863,3462.739,It’s the stipulation that was for necessary commuting in connection with the individual education and training plan.
1976.75-1261,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3462.739,3464.961,And the District Court accepted that?
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3470.646,3474.688,"Your Honor, that’s the way the District Court has read the stipulations and affidavits in this case."
1976.75-1261,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3474.688,3479.747,"Quite back way though, it wasn’t to find there a stipulation that it was necessary."
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3482.452,3483.982,For necessary.
1976.75-1261,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3483.982,3492.467,"No determination of necessity, except by the administrative decision to grant it which would presuppose that someone had made the decision."
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3492.467,3500.472,"Well Your Honor, I think if we are talking about a full time student, one couldn’t even say that it was for necessary commuting."
1976.75-1261,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3519.148,3542.154,"In order to sustain your position and the District Court’s position, we have to conclude that the $44.00 that it was either violation of the statute or violation of the constitution for the Secretary to include the $44.00 as one of the financial resources of this recipient, isn’t that right?"
1976.75-1261,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3542.154,3543.198,That’s correct Your Honor.
1976.75-1261,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3579.238,3580.107,Very well.
1976.75-1261,3,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,3586.266,3588.681,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, just a few points."
1976.75-1261,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3617.465,3620.886,And the class as I understand it includes recipients of both kinds?
1976.75-1261,3,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,3620.886,3624.483,That has been the understanding as I read it.
1976.75-1261,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3636.055,3657.355,"Oh, I just wanted to get the -- your colleague's view of the stipulation because in his brief, he said the stipulation was that the -- it was stipulated in District Court that the monthly allowance received was for commuting that was necessary."
1976.75-1261,3,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,3657.355,3660.723,I believe the District Court read that stipulation as --
1976.75-1261,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3660.723,3669.033,"So, you think the District Court construed the stipulation as establishing the fact that the expense was necessary for commuting?"
1976.75-1261,3,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,3669.033,3672.323,"Well, the District Court as a matter of fact, it was necessary."
1976.75-1261,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3677.63,3678.723,It was necessary?
1976.75-1261,3,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,3678.723,3680.832,I believe that it was on the basis of that stipulation.
1976.75-1261,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3682.117,3684.775,"Well wasn’t the Court find it, don’t you?"
1976.75-1261,3,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,3684.775,3686.378,"Well, yes we do accept that."
1976.75-1261,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3690.609,3691.22,Not all.
1976.75-1261,3,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,3691.22,3691.588,All the individuals --
1976.75-1261,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3691.588,3696.863,"I understand that, but the District Court did find that in this case the $40.00 was necessary?"
1976.75-1261,3,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,3696.863,3700.225,I believe that is what they found on the basis of rather ambiguous stipulation.
1976.75-1261,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3700.225,3702.312,And you accept that for the purpose of your argument?
1976.75-1261,3,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,3702.312,3706.066,"Yes of course, yes we do."
1976.75-1261,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3717.228,3718.307,Thank you counsel.
