1993.92-1384,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.593,"We'll hear argument now in Number 92-1384, Barclays Bank, PLC v. Franchise Tax Board of California, Number 92-1839, Colgate-Palmolive Company v. Franchise Tax Board."
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,17.376,21.413,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-1384,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,191.403,200.076,"But a preference not strong enough to be reflected in the Senate's exercise of its power, because it didn't have enough votes for the supermajority necessary."
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,200.076,233.797,"That is correct, and as a result, Justice Rehnquist, this does not reflect any policy sufficient to take the case out of dormant Commerce Clause analysis, which is the State's argument, and moreover, at least some of the supporters of the reservation were concerned about the use of the treaty method rather than with any restriction on worldwide combined reporting to... by the States as such, and in fact, both of the contracting parties, the United States and the United Kingdom, have made it clear in the past and before this Court that they do not think the treaty reserves the issue, so--"
1993.92-1384,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,233.797,242.903,"Nonetheless, it is clear from the history that you recited that Congress was certainly well aware of this problem and this debate, and did nothing."
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,242.903,243.769,--Well--
1993.92-1384,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,243.769,244.771,Although it surely could have.
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,244.771,278.076,"--Senatorial awareness, of course... because I don't think both Houses of Congress had addressed the issue... senatorial awareness is not a substitution for this Court's off-affirmed principle that Congress must act affirmatively to remove the State act from scrutiny by this Court under the dormant Commerce Clause, and in fact, at best, the treaty situation is much like a filibuster in which the majority wasn't sufficient to break the filibuster over a particular provision, and so you had to delete that provision to move the rest of the legislation forward."
1993.92-1384,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,284.646,296.954,"There was in the Wardair case, as you mentioned, the use of the words, affirmatively acted, but the affirmative action was by nonaction, right, by failure to forbid the State taxes?"
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,296.954,298.99,"Yes, but you had a prohibition."
1993.92-1384,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,489.698,494.25,Was that argument available to the taxpayer in Container Corporation?
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,494.25,498.618,"--No, that argument was not available, Your Honor... Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1384,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,500.654,500.97,It's from over here.
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,500.97,502.77,"I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-1384,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,505.456,510.593,"Well, but were there not foreign affiliates in Container Corp.?"
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,510.593,511.476,--That is correct.
1993.92-1384,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,511.476,524.119,And would not a foreign nation under your hypothesis have felt some duty to lesson the impact of the California tax on those foreign affiliates that were within its jurisdiction?
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,524.119,528.804,"No, because the obligation to relieve the tax flows back to the home country."
1993.92-1384,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,537.077,539.66,"Well, to me when we say, obligation, that's simply hypothetical anyway."
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,539.66,545.481,"It's a hypothetical obligation, but it is part of the overall international practice in which--"
1993.92-1384,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,545.481,547.099,I still don't quite understand.
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,567.846,568.346,--Right.
1993.92-1384,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,568.346,572.231,I don't see why it makes a difference that there is a parent in one case and a subsidiary in the other.
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,572.231,583.689,"Well, if I might try to see if I can answer that in this fashion, Justice Kennedy, first of all, in Container, the ultimate parent was the United Kingdom company... I'm sorry, a United States company."
1993.92-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,646.298,648.298,May I ask you a question about--
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,648.298,648.964,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1993.92-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.964,664.058,"--Isn't the assumption, if you think this very complex system really works, that all that's being taxed is income earned in California, and that one looks at the other income only for the purpose of determining what share of the total is attributable to California?"
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,664.058,667.26,"Justice Stevens, I would have to respectfully disagree."
1993.92-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,683.369,686.137,Because you acknowledge you have a unitary business.
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,686.137,694.26,Because of the unitary business principle that is accepted in the United States but has never been... we are here to--
1993.92-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.26,695.21,It is not challenged in this case.
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,695.21,695.543,--Right.
1993.92-1384,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,701.211,702.947,We have to assume you are for purposes of our decision.
1993.92-1384,0,30405,joanne_m_garvey,,702.947,703.247,Exactly.
1993.92-1384,1,31245,james_p_kleier,,1071.735,1077.056,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1137.427,1144.783,"Well, Mr. Kleier, you say that this reaction demonstrates that the decision in Container was wrong."
1993.92-1384,1,31245,james_p_kleier,,1146.066,1148.568,"--Yes, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1993.92-1384,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.293,1165.696,"Well, you mean something that has developed since Container?"
1993.92-1384,1,31245,james_p_kleier,,1165.696,1167.613,Not entirely.
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2260.887,2275.547,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1384,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2297.626,2308.018,"General Days, do you take the position that the California tax is perfectly valid today as applied to Barclays?"
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2308.018,2309.334,"Yes, we do."
1993.92-1384,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2334.615,2335.332,How about September 9th?
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2335.332,2336.067,--September 9th?
1993.92-1384,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2336.067,2337.534,Before they adopted it.
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2337.534,2346.007,"Before they adopted it, we have not taken a position in this case as to whether it would satisfy the standards that we've set out."
1993.92-1384,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2346.007,2353.177,"Well, I'm asking you what your position is as of September 9th and before they adopted this change."
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2353.177,2354.863,I would say--
1993.92-1384,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2354.863,2357.565,But not going back to the tax year in question.
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2357.565,2357.865,--Yes.
1993.92-1384,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2395.721,2408.381,"Well, if the 1970 California tax were still in operation, the tax that Barclays objects to, if it were still in operation, what then would be your position as to its validity?"
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2408.381,2430.294,"Our position would be that during the period from 1980 through 1986, there were expressions of concern by the Federal Government... that is, by the executive branch... with respect to the California taxing scheme."
1993.92-1384,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2468.686,2481.744,"Well, would it be constitutional, consistent with our foreign policy interests, for California today to reinstate the worldwide reporting statute that it seeks to apply to Barclays?"
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2481.744,2494.154,"I think, Justice Kennedy, that what would be necessary is an evaluation of the principles that have been set out by this Court in Japan Line and Container Corporation."
1993.92-1384,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2520.804,2527.958,But I take it you cannot say with assurance that under my hypothetical case the statute would be consistent with our foreign policy interests.
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2527.958,2528.825,That is correct.
1993.92-1384,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2545.169,2555.292,"So our analysis should just turn on when the executive branch has spoken, and with what clarity, and that's what turns the tide?"
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2555.292,2557.477,"--Not at all, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-1384,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2604.875,2607.343,Sort of a Teague rule for the Commerce Clause?
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2607.96,2609.445,"Well, not quite, Your Honor."
1993.92-1384,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.272,2733.842,What about Vermont's tax that we reviewed in the Mobil case?
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2738.878,2783.692,"It is something that the Court has to take into consideration in determining objective considerations, whether what California or Vermont is doing violates the Foreign Commerce Clause, but failing a clear answer with respect to those objective inquiries, it is our position that one place to look is to the executive branch, and what we are saying not as a matter of history, but speaking about the contemporaneous relationship of the United States Government with our trading partners that what California has done has removed whatever tension might have been presented at an earlier point by what California was doing."
1993.92-1384,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2818.513,2819.615,You in effect--
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2819.615,2820.615,--it seems to us would be inappropriate.
1993.92-1384,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2820.615,2821.298,--I'm sorry.
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2843.647,2848.432,"Certainly, this Court has never explicitly held... may I complete the answer +/?"
1993.92-1384,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2875.868,2877.318,"Thank you, General Days."
1993.92-1384,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2877.318,2877.651,Thank you very much.
1993.92-1384,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2877.651,2879.403,"Mr. Laddish, we'll hear from you."
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,2879.403,2886.057,Thank you.
1993.92-1384,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2969.378,2987.625,"Well, under your theory, I guess, or maybe it's the theory adopted by the court below that you're supporting, if Congress has a bill before it to deal with the issue of State taxation and for whatever reason doesn't pass it, then that's congressional action."
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,2987.625,2987.992,No--
1993.92-1384,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2987.992,2988.475,That's it.
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,2988.975,2992.51,"--No, Justice O'Connor, we would not take that position."
1993.92-1384,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3064.875,3066.508,May I ask you a sort of basic question--
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3066.508,3066.792,--Certainly.
1993.92-1384,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3066.792,3067.577,--Mr. Laddish.
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3084.419,3085.455,The tax would be constitutional.
1993.92-1384,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3088.073,3089.44,I would think that that's part of your case.
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3089.44,3089.89,Certainly.
1993.92-1384,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3089.89,3090.692,You don't argue that very much.
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3090.692,3092.275,"Well, I plan to, Your Honor."
1993.92-1384,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3214.756,3219.792,"You're relying on what's, in effect, a negative implication from action which Congress took."
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3219.792,3220.392,Yes.
1993.92-1384,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3220.392,3221.344,You say that's the same thing as Wardair.
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3221.344,3224.946,"Yes, in those terms, Mr. Chief Justice; that's what they used."
1993.92-1384,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3228.398,3235.385,What negative implication is there from the action that Congress... what action did Congress take in the normal sense of congressional action?
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3235.385,3252.779,--In the same sense that in Wardair they found an implication... I should say you found an implication... in that the national government of a Federal system was the sole member of that system that was... that had a limitation put upon it.
1993.92-1384,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3259.75,3271.225,"But there were allied provisions that did contain a limitation, and it's just a straightforward application of an old maxim of interpretation, inclusio unius."
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3272.491,3273.01,--Well--
1993.92-1384,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3273.01,3276.295,--The explicit inclusion of one thing implies the exclusion of another.
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3280.331,3290.888,"--Well, I mean, it's the same principle as in Wardair, but also it's the culmination of decades of congressional acquiescence in the other treaties."
1993.92-1384,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3290.888,3291.571,"Well, but that's quite different."
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3291.571,3292.188,We also have--
1993.92-1384,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3292.188,3299.042,I mean just mere congressional inaction is quite different from a situation in which the maxim inclusio unius is applicable.
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3299.042,3306.231,--I don't... I'm afraid I don't understand any distinction between what the Court did in Wardair and what the U.S. U.K. treaty was.
1993.92-1384,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3327.477,3328.177,Never mind the history; give me the text.
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3328.177,3329.096,"--Oh, the text."
1993.92-1384,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3329.096,3329.629,Yes.
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3329.629,3329.929,Yes.
1993.92-1384,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3503.225,3517.568,Does the record tell us at all what the difference in money would be if California were collecting based on the arms-length method as opposed to the worldwide combined--
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3517.568,3538.164,"What the record shows is that... as to the differences in the amounts between the returns that were filed and the assessments as to tax amounts, for Barclays Bank International it was $1,678; for Barclays Bank of California, for example, it was $152,470."
1993.92-1384,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3552.908,3570.702,"--Does the system that California uses impact particularly because California has high property values or perhaps high wages or something, and these are part of the formula--"
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3570.702,3588.081,"--Well, I should point out... there's an assumption... and I was going to wait until I got to my dormant Commerce Clause analysis, but I think there's an assumption we have to dispel here that somehow we collect excess taxes and we cost the taxpayers the inordinate amount of money to comply with our wild scheme of taxation."
1993.92-1384,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3711.228,3714.93,"--But, I had thought... you indicate that they have these figures, every company has them."
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3720.434,3721.718,$2 million and $5 million--
1993.92-1384,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3721.718,3729.274,"--To establish this system, and then substantial sums in order to maintain it."
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3729.274,3730.49,--They... that was a--
1993.92-1384,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3730.49,3736.427,Are you saying that it's not burdensome because there's this approximation option?
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3736.427,3743.883,"--Exactly, Your Honor, and that's what the California Court of Appeal has held is a reasonable system, and that--"
1993.92-1384,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3743.883,3751.537,"But if the approximation option were not available, this would be a substantial burden on the taxpayer from the standpoint of accounting costs, would it not?"
1993.92-1384,3,42960,timothy_g_laddish,,3751.537,3758.376,"--As the testimony indicates, it would be a substantial burden whether it was foreign parented or domestic parented, yes, Your Honor."
