2013.12-682,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.872,"We will hear argument next today in Case 12-682, Schuette v. The Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action."
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,11.139,14.674,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-682,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,39.056,42.858,Holt had nothing to do with an antidiscrimination law.
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,50.095,54.482,"Justice Sotomayor, it's not identical because of the remedy issue."
2013.12-682,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,63.087,66.555,You don't think that the proponents of affirmative action are attempting to do the same thing?
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,75.661,78.763,"Well, there's two points to that question and I'll address them both."
2013.12-682,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,129.562,137.135,"I thought that in Grutter, all of the social scientists had pointed out to the fact that all of those efforts had failed."
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,143.222,146.174,"--Well, there's social science evidence that goes both ways."
2013.12-682,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,166.952,175.708,"It's always wonderful for minorities that they finally get in, they finally have children and now you're going to do away for that preference for them."
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,180.677,185.665,"--Given the makeup of Michigan's alumnae right now, certainly that playing field would be tilted the other way."
2013.12-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,225.973,227.239,"Mr. Bursch, could you go back--"
2013.12-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,227.239,232.127,"Well, while you're on Seattle, can you -- I have difficulty distinguishing Seattle."
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,251.355,253.307,I think it's a distinguishing factor.
2013.12-682,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,351.485,352.102,I don't see the distinction.
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,380.669,380.919,Right.
2013.12-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,394.677,404.701,--But there -- there was no proof that there was any de jure segregation in Seattle.
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,404.701,413.724,"--That's correct because, at the time of Seattle's decision, we didn't yet have parents involved, and so there wasn't a strict scrutiny test that was being applied to that bussing program."
2013.12-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,420.811,421.827,But you're saying there -- there are three things.
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,423.294,424.013,--Yes.
2013.12-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,424.013,425.529,The law was a racial focus.
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,425.529,425.913,It can't be because of racial focus.
2013.12-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,425.913,426.463,Okay.
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,432.617,433.967,"That, plus--"
2013.12-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,433.967,435.0,"Responsiveness, I guess."
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,435.0,435.35,--Right.
2013.12-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,439.271,439.854,"And was there a third, did you say?"
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,439.854,447.125,"--Well, the third way is really to -- to look at racial focus and say that's wrong, and maybe this whole doctrine needs to be reexamined."
2013.12-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.746,492.989,"But there is such a claim in this case, it just wasn't decided -- wasn't there a racial animus, that the reason for Proposition 2 was to reduce the minority population?"
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,496.708,499.66,"There was a claim, but, Your Honor, there was also a decision."
2013.12-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,544.188,550.858,"That, it seemed to me a good distinction for Hunter and Mulkey v. Reitman, which the briefs don't talk much about."
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,550.858,551.208,--Yes.
2013.12-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,551.208,560.131,"But not necessarily a distinction in Seattle because Seattle you could argue, well, there are other methods that are less racially divisive."
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,560.131,564.852,"And I think -- and I would like to come back to Reitman because that fits into this framework, too."
2013.12-682,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,596.321,598.239,But I don't see how the argument would be any different here.
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,618.152,620.519,"That's true and there is always some bad apples, too."
2013.12-682,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,635.362,636.364,In Seattle as well.
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,640.083,641.849,"--I think it's much harder in Seattle, Your Honor."
2013.12-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,724.92,732.693,"Mr. Bursch, can I ask you to go back to the very first thing you said, because I didn't get your -- your point."
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,753.773,755.506,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we have a muddy picture."
2013.12-682,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,832.304,833.806,So what do we do with the statistics from California?
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,843.845,856.672,"Well, the statistics in California across the 17 campuses in the University of California system show that today the underrepresented minority percentage is better on 16 out of those 17 campuses."
2013.12-682,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,913.341,936.724,"So why is it okay to have taken away -- not okay to have taken away the decision to have bussing from the local school boards, the people on the ground, but it's okay to take that power away from the people on the ground here, the board of regents, who are also elected like the school board was in Seattle?"
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,936.724,937.407,Because as--
2013.12-682,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,937.407,953.316,"The general population has feelings about many things, but the only decision that they're -- educational decision that they are taking away from the board of regents is this one: affirmative action."
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,957.97,966.893,"--You've put your finger on the fulcrum of Respondents' best argument, that only race as a factor alone has been removed."
2013.12-682,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1017.942,1028.05,You have been asked several questions that refer to the ending or termination of affirmative action.
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1030.1,1039.941,"No, and I'm glad that you brought that up, Chief Justice Roberts, because affirmative action means a lot more than simply the use of race or sex-based preferences in university admissions."
2013.12-682,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1092.59,1094.442,You've done something much more.
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1103.032,1103.632,--Correct.
2013.12-682,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1103.632,1104.148,--all right.
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1123.195,1124.295,"No, that's not what we are saying."
2013.12-682,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1124.295,1128.832,"Well, but you're -- but this amendment is stopping the political process."
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1136.686,1143.425,"Well, again, it actually runs the other way, because equal protection is what singles out race-focused measures for strict scrutiny."
2013.12-682,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1160.234,1174.394,"What would you do with a constitutional amendment that said pro-affirmative action laws, and only those, require a three-quarters vote of the State legislature?"
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1174.394,1190.573,"Well, under what we're going to call the narrow “ Save Hunter and Seattle ”, something like that would be unconstitutional because it removes an antidiscrimination provision and moves it to a higher level of government."
2013.12-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1315.57,1316.336,"Mr. Bursch, isn't--"
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1316.336,1316.703,--Yes.
2013.12-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1316.703,1329.611,--isn't the position that was taken in Seattle derived from a different view of the Equal Protection Clause?
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1411.496,1413.781,"Well, two thoughts on that, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-682,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1503.019,1517.363,"You said that the district court found it was clear that there was no -- there was no discriminatory intent, but that wasn't reviewed on appeal."
2013.12-682,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1517.363,1518.496,"No, it was not."
2013.12-682,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1533.854,1535.039,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1541.109,1543.794,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-682,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1591.458,1593.508,Is that an accurate description of Seattle?
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1620.795,1624.013,"That's correct with respect to at least one of the districts, Justice Alito."
2013.12-682,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1633.383,1634.302,I don't understand the answer to that question.
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1638.704,1641.656,"--Yes, but there'd been no finding, Justice Alito, of de jure segregation."
2013.12-682,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1641.656,1644.874,And isn't it correct that the district court found that there was de jure segregation?
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1644.874,1645.458,That is not correct.
2013.12-682,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1645.458,1646.041,It didn't?
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1646.041,1654.314,There was -- there was no finding whatsoever that there had been de jure segregation and that there was a constitutional imperative to correct that desegregation.
2013.12-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1682.047,1682.731,"Well, there are two things."
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1691.018,1693.687,"--That -- that -- that is no question that that's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-682,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1703.911,1711.834,What if the -- what if the -- the board delegated to the various universities the authority to develop their own admissions programs?
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1711.834,1713.7,"--It couldn't alter -- I'm sorry, Chief Roberts."
2013.12-682,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1713.7,1723.223,"And they did, and then after several years they decided, you know, we don't like the way it's working; they're adopting too many racial preference programs; we're going to revoke the delegation."
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1723.223,1724.158,Absolutely fine.
2013.12-682,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1724.158,1725.975,Why is that any -- any different?
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1725.975,1736.799,"Because the difference is that in the Seattle case, in this case, and in the Hunter case, what's going on is a change from the ordinary political process, which Your Honor perfectly described."
2013.12-682,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1743.886,1768.021,"So if there were a provision in the Michigan Constitution that says the board of regents is authorized to enact these programs, in other words delegated from the people in the Constitution to the board, and then the people change the delegation by saying, no, it's no longer -- we're no longer going to leave that up to the board, we're going to make the decision ourselves in the Constitution, how is that any different?"
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1768.021,1771.805,"It is different, Your Honor, because of the racial nature of the decision."
2013.12-682,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1882.99,1892.279,"Well, I thought the whole purpose of strict scrutiny was to say that if you want to talk about race, you have a much higher hurdle to climb than if you want to talk about something else."
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1901.301,1902.084,Exactly.
2013.12-682,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1902.084,1906.688,"So I don't know why that's a hard question that you asked about the student who says, I want to talk about race."
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1915.894,1926.002,"The State can say, we don't want to hear that whether it comes from a white person or a black person or whomever, if in fact, they are not doing it on a race-specific basis."
2013.12-682,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1935.541,1936.592,"Well, I don't understand your answer then."
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1951.734,1958.557,"--You do, Your Honor, when the program has passed the strict scrutiny test that we're talking about."
2013.12-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1986.79,1992.061,"Well, I'm not sure I understood the answer you gave to the Chief Justice's hypothetical."
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2004.202,2004.769,Yes.
2013.12-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2004.769,2008.673,Five -- and the faculty votes for affirmative action.
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2014.058,2020.297,"Assuming that the regents say that's fine, no problem whatsoever, no problem whatsoever."
2013.12-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2022.197,2025.699,So the -- so the regents can take it away from the faculty?
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2025.699,2026.549,The regents have plenary--
2013.12-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2026.549,2028.199,But can the legislature take it away from the regents?
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2028.199,2031.151,"--Not under the Michigan Constitution, because the Michigan Constitution--"
2013.12-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2031.151,2031.417,"No, no."
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2032.217,2032.851,--Okay.
2013.12-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2042.557,2043.407,But then the voters can't take it away.
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2049.825,2050.275,Where there is--
2013.12-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2050.275,2051.711,--the declension here--
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2051.711,2053.294,"--My apologies, Your Honor."
2013.12-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2053.294,2054.279,"--Or the crescendo, whatever you call it."
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2055.029,2056.929,Both are music to my ears.
2013.12-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2075.875,2085.648,That applies in the Chief Justice's hypothetical or my revision of it as between the board of regents and the faculty or between the faculty and the legislature.
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2085.648,2086.098,--Exactly.
2013.12-682,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2112.216,2118.385,"Why is -- why is the faculty administration, a faculty decision, any less outcome determinative than what the voters would say?"
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2121.921,2123.189,--Then I'm not explaining it clearly.
2013.12-682,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2153.609,2160.462,"So I mean, you could say that the whole point of something like the Equal Protection Clause is to take race off the table."
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2202.708,2214.783,"--The problem, Your Honor, as this Court stated as recently as last term in the Fisher case, is that under the Equal Protection Clause race is not all the way off the table."
2013.12-682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2248.687,2257.11,Why -- why doesn't the Fourth Amendment violate the rule you're saying -- or the 14th Amendment violate the rule that you're proposing?
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2275.672,2277.19,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.19,2292.049,"Well, so I guess -- I guess that on this subject of equal treatment of the races, we can eliminate racism just at the -- at the legislative level, can't we?"
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2292.049,2306.057,"Your Honor, the underlying basis of the entire strict scrutiny doctrine in the 14th Amendment is to preclude the government, preclude the Legislative and Executive Branch, from making those determinations as absolute determinations."
2013.12-682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2319.034,2322.086,"And you can't change those rules by normal legislation, correct?"
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2322.086,2322.769,--That is correct.
2013.12-682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2322.769,2326.471,"So if you're a minority that wants favored treatment, you're just out of luck."
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2326.471,2328.99,You have to use the ordinary political process.

2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2384.438,2385.088,It is a racial--
2013.12-682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.088,2387.64,It's the prohibition of racial classifications.
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2387.64,2388.023,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2388.023,2392.044,Every prohibition of racial classification is itself a racial classification?
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2392.044,2392.511,"No, Your Honor."

2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2425.613,2426.196,"Well, it sets the standard--"
2013.12-682,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2426.196,2430.081,"In that sense, the 14th Amendment itself is a racial classification."
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2430.514,2434.55,"--I don't agree with that, Your Honor, because I'm measuring it as a racial classification by the 14th Amendment."
2013.12-682,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2450.06,2450.393,Yes.
2013.12-682,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2450.393,2459.249,"When the court looked at this particular issue, the concern was the way that it racially divided the political process itself."
2013.12-682,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2473.973,2474.673,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2488.182,2491.884,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2517.619,2522.673,"My goodness, I thought we've -- we've held that the 14th Amendment protects all races."
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2539.715,2544.253,I think it is -- it's a measure that's an antidiscrimination measure.
2013.12-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.253,2544.853,Right.
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2544.853,2569.903,"And it's a measure in which the question of discrimination is determined not just by -- by power, by who has privilege in this society, and those minorities that are oppressed, be they religious or racial, need protection from a more privileged majority."
2013.12-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2569.903,2573.188,"And unless that exists, the 14th Amendment is not violated; is that right?"
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2582.128,2583.278,I think that--
2013.12-682,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.278,2590.567,"Do you have any case of ours that propounds that view of the 14th Amendment, that it protects only minorities?"
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2592.184,2593.869,--No case of yours.
2013.12-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.869,2599.188,Some people think that there is a difference between the plus and the minus.
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2644.885,2652.155,I think that affirmative action programs could -- could be permissible under employment.
2013.12-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2653.657,2654.224,Okay.
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2655.426,2655.942,--That's right.
2013.12-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2655.942,2656.226,Fine.
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2714.898,2715.698,I think--
2013.12-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2715.698,2717.666,"--which I don't think you want to say, but maybe you do."
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2717.666,2718.382,--No.
2013.12-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2734.609,2735.461,So what's the line?
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2753.173,2755.958,I think Hunter-Seattle provides the line.
2013.12-682,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2788.194,2793.581,Can I -- can I come back to the question that the Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy were asking before?
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2843.513,2862.894,"--I think in this case, the difference between what other groups can do in order to get preferential treatment for their sons and daughters and what racial minorities are subject to, the level of distinction places such a high burden on minorities."
2013.12-682,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2862.894,2866.546,"Well, that really -- that really isn't responsive to my question."
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2879.772,2888.542,I think it depends on where it is that minorities face a heavier and special burden.
2013.12-682,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2888.542,2895.112,"It can't be that, because the normal political process imposes burdens on different groups."
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2952.382,2955.95,"You have, you restated it very well, and I agree with you in principle."
2013.12-682,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2955.95,2959.988,But I still don't understand your answer to Justice Alito's question.
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2976.098,2979.633,I don't think it -- I don't think Hunter-Seattle applies.
2013.12-682,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2979.633,2980.468,All right.
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,2987.656,2994.059,I think you need two things: I think you need the decisionmaking -- the decisionmaking body.
2013.12-682,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3018.427,3018.843,But would that be true -- I'm sorry.
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,3029.299,3050.829,"--I think if they have the plenary authority to do that, yeah, I think that, again, if they wanted to eliminate affirmative action programs and they had that plenary authority and it was guaranteed by the Michigan State Constitution and it had existed for 150 years, and they chose to enter this area, I think--"
2013.12-682,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3050.829,3056.05,I don't see how that is consistent with Justice Sotomayor's answer to my question.
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,3062.037,3084.135,"--In this case, the particular -- it's -- they are applying that plenary authority in -- or in a way that is racially focused, and creates a political process that is disadvantageous to minorities."
2013.12-682,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3084.135,3085.602,I'm not saying instead of political process.
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,3121.994,3143.258,This -- what we're talking about in terms of affirmative action are constitutionally permissible programs that were shown to this Court to be the only way to achieve racial diversity and integration at the University of Michigan.

2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,3235.451,3237.37,--that the political process be on a level field.
2013.12-682,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3237.37,3238.136,--Right.
2013.12-682,2,41227,shanta_driver,,3257.964,3267.905,"Certainly the minority voters of Michigan believe them to be, because 90 percent of black voters in Michigan voted against Prop 2."
