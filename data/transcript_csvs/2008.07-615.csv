2008.07-615,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.274,"We will hear argument next in Case 07-615, Ministry of Defense and Support For the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran versus Elahi."
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,12.541,19.272,"Mr. Chief Justice, good morning and may it please the Court: At the heart of this appeal is a matter of statutory construction."
2008.07-615,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,80.186,85.01,"Well, they could have agreed that they have a bank account somewhere and any amounts would be set off by that."
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,89.088,106.488,"No, in that scenario I agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that that would not be implicated, because I think the clear import of the statutory language here that Congress is trying to achieve is that being at issue -- as you'll notice, the statutory provision in 201(c) is disjunctive."
2008.07-615,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,125.385,137.255,"So it doesn't matter that Iran recognizes that this would be used to set off a judgment it might obtain, because you just said, well they could -- a bank account could be used to set it off and that's not sufficient."
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,137.255,138.882,"Well, the mutual -- let me be clear."
2008.07-615,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.158,190.093,The United States at some stage told the tribunal in The Hague that the Cubic judgment -- and now I'm quoting --
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,197.779,203.824,"Yes, that is the language used by the United States in a memorial before the tribunal."
2008.07-615,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,277.981,281.962,There is no counterclaim stated before the tribunal as of this moment.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,281.962,283.447,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear the first."
2008.07-615,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,283.447,288.272,There is no counterclaim in the case before the tribunal.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,288.272,288.755,That's right.
2008.07-615,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,307.328,309.278,I was going to ask that question.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,322.053,328.675,"There -- there certainly have been cases, if you are speaking of the tribunal's earlier jurisprudence in terms of offsetting claims."
2008.07-615,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,328.675,329.033,Yes.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,329.033,335.249,"Yes, there has certainly been ample tribunal precedent which the United States has relied upon in making this demand for a setoff."
2008.07-615,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,335.249,345.902,"But assuming -- assuming the tribunal takes up some such issue as Justice Kennedy has mentioned, it will start with the assumption that the Cubic judgment is in fact a valid judgment."
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,350.087,356.474,"Of course, the validity of the Cubic judgment does remain on appeal when the Ninth Circuit--"
2008.07-615,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,356.474,358.755,But that's an entirely separate proceeding.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,367.908,369.409,--I would assume it would.
2008.07-615,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,370.298,370.735,Okay.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,374.374,376.062,"--No, Justice Souter."
2008.07-615,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,404.906,406.782,"I mean, I think we understand that."
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,424.509,426.524,"--I won't speak, of course, for the United States' position."
2008.07-615,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.862,444.611,Explain to me why it would effect the relief?
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,487.029,492.169,"Well, obviously we await the tribunal's award in this respect."
2008.07-615,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,538.964,542.539,Would you -- something that I would just like clarification on.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,551.395,552.522,"--Yes, ma'am."
2008.07-615,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.522,554.737,And there are cross appeals.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,562.782,565.374,That has been a mystery to me as well.
2008.07-615,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,685.48,699.724,Could -- let's assume that the -- that Iran is able to execute on the Cubic judgment.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,709.048,719.0,"Well, I mean, the issue of the secretary of state's October 2007 designation, which I think is what you are referring to, is a late development in this case."
2008.07-615,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,782.737,791.609,You mentioned -- you mentioned that there were other claimants or others -- others who would like to execute--
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,791.609,795.107,Other lienors.
2008.07-615,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,795.107,797.794,--other lienors -- other attachments.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,806.228,818.833,"My understanding, Justice Ginsburg, is in both the cases of Mr. Rubin and Mr. Raffi, as far as I am aware, they have not made the relinquishment election under TRIA as Dr. Elahi has done here."
2008.07-615,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,868.998,881.559,"But going back to the main issue, the only reason that this is at issue before the Iran tribunal is because it might be a setoff in the event of judgment in favor of Iran?"
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,881.559,881.98,--Yes.
2008.07-615,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,887.323,890.271,That's the -- that's the only basis for your argument?
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,897.957,903.173,"--Well, I mean, that may be one useful analytic in thinking about this."
2008.07-615,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,939.253,949.64,Can you -- can you articulate a general test in a sentence or two about how you decide whether particular assets are at issue?
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,949.64,950.155,Yes.
2008.07-615,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1064.75,1073.274,"""At Issue"" means related to -- ""At Issue"" means related to an issue in a separate case."
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1073.274,1073.964,I mean--
2008.07-615,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1073.964,1076.277,"That's what it boils down to, doesn't it?"
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1076.277,1077.447,--Petitioner is not taking the same--
2008.07-615,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1077.447,1077.852,"Well, doesn't it?"
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1077.852,1078.898,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1121.304,1126.003,Is it the case that there are two other individuals who have attached this judgment?
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1126.003,1126.975,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1128.628,1129.474,All right.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1146.527,1151.931,"--My understanding, if you are speaking of me characterizing the United States' position--"
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1151.931,1152.633,No.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1164.66,1165.085,--Yes.
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1165.085,1178.218,"--who they thought was prevented from delivering planes because of the embargo -- so it was relevant -- that that judgment, which they get if they collect on it, should be deducted from other money the United States owes them."
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1178.218,1179.61,"Yes, and--"
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1179.61,1184.357,"--unless instead of them getting it, the attacher gets it."
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1184.357,1186.169,--It's the--
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1186.169,1188.415,The attachee gets it.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1188.415,1191.558,"--It's the ""unless"", I suppose, that, of course, Iran objects to."
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1201.288,1205.129,Has to get the money for the attaching person.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1206.159,1206.474,"--Yes, sir."
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1206.474,1214.702,And so that is at issue before the -- and -- and it is at issue in those cases.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1223.889,1224.498,I agree.
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1225.465,1225.963,Isn't that right or--
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1225.963,1226.354,--Correct.
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1226.716,1232.994,"--And that is the same question that you think would be presented through this attachment, is that right?"
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1232.994,1240.724,--I thought that's what we were speaking of: The status of the Cubic judgment and -- and Dr. Elahi's attachment of the--
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1240.724,1243.597,"Dr. Elahi is one of several persons, is that right?"
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1243.597,1244.771,--That is correct.
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1248.019,1260.201,What I'm trying to get at is Iran's position vis-a-vis the Elahi judgment is the same as its position vis-a-vis the other two attachments on the Elahi judgment.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1260.201,1260.747,"--Yes, sir."
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1260.747,1266.589,"That if Iran ends up with the money, you can subtract it from other money the United States owes them."
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1269.743,1273.911,"So it's ""At Issue"" -- I am -- I am sorry for having been so opague."
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1299.372,1336.686,"You would take the same position if, in fact, this money which is owed to Iran by -- by Cubic -- that is, Cubic, which then Iran got a judgment on -- instead of a judgment in favor of Iran, Cubic had written them a check, and they had taken the check and bought a house in Manhattan, or they had put it in an Iranian bank account, and either Mr. Elahi or one of the other two people sought to attach the bank account or the house or the grocery store, which they might have also have used."
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1337.341,1337.716,--Yes.
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1337.716,1338.121,--or wrong?
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1338.121,1339.654,"Yes, Justice Breyer, you are correct."
2008.07-615,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1349.368,1352.46,I don't see why either is the slightest a bit more attenuated.
2008.07-615,0,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1356.644,1359.767,"--I would certainly concur; and, if I may, I will reserve the balance of my time."
2008.07-615,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1359.767,1361.689,"Thank you, Mr. Bederman."
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1369.079,1384.713,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States does not appear here today in support of Iran, but, rather, in defense of critical interests of the United States before the United States -- Iran Claims Tribunal."
2008.07-615,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1406.764,1407.813,But that's not saying that.
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1412.278,1418.603,"--Well, Your Honor, there is now a new and independent reason why the asset is blocked."
2008.07-615,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1441.22,1449.811,"But if we -- if we took the position that you are expressing about what is at issue, we would never reach the second question."
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1449.811,1451.842,"Well, we -- we think that the Court would not."
2008.07-615,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1465.694,1469.633,But it's not our job to help you -- it's not our job to help you in other tribunals.
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1476.502,1476.97,--No.
2008.07-615,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1479.47,1482.672,So is it your position that that -- that is moot?
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1482.672,1493.185,"It is our position that the -- because Respondent has relinquished his right to attach these assets, the decision of the court of appeals should be vacated."
2008.07-615,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1539.165,1551.16,"Do I understand correctly that that means that because it's a blocked asset, then Dr. Elahi can get it, but Iran itself couldn't get it?"
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1551.16,1557.967,"Elahi, Respondent Elahi, could get it if he had not relinquished his rights to attach--"
2008.07-615,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1557.967,1558.236,Yes.
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1558.236,1559.905,--assets at issue before the tribunal.
2008.07-615,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1574.619,1588.084,"So why isn't the consequence that you are so worried about under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act that this is going to hurt your position by the tribunal, the same consequence that is going to come from the fact that these assets are blocked?"
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1588.084,1596.393,"Well, Your Honor, again, the blocking order is the present status of the assets."
2008.07-615,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1607.651,1608.072,But--
2008.07-615,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1608.072,1612.9,"So why wouldn't the United States get credit for that, too, on the theory that I suggested before?"
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1612.9,1616.445,"Well, you are right, Your Honor, that is the position of the United States."
2008.07-615,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1628.378,1629.613,It has nothing to do with matters before the--
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1629.613,1646.088,"--That is in the context of our saying that, whether or not -- in the view of the United States, whether or not Petitioner ever collects that money, the United States is entitled to an offset, and in fact, we believe it's a complete defense to Iran's claim."
2008.07-615,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1783.208,1785.894,--I guess this may be the same question Justice Breyer asked.
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1803.261,1815.803,"--Well, I believe that in fact the language of the statute makes it -- the assertions of the parties before the tribunal that define the property that is at issue before the tribunal."
2008.07-615,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1825.19,1827.939,"Well, that's kind of a -- that's a broad assertion."
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1840.213,1845.958,"Well, Your Honor, I don't believe that this Court needs to consider what the outer reaches are."
2008.07-615,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1905.276,1910.322,But how is that affected -- how is that affected depending on whether or not the judgment is executed or not.
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1916.617,1920.554,--I -- I don't know.
2008.07-615,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1952.605,1953.884,I don't know that it's the subject of the award.
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1958.649,1968.971,"Well, I guess, Your Honor, you have to think what does it mean for any property -- property to be at issue before the tribunal or the subject of the award?"
2008.07-615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1968.971,1973.893,It means that at the end of the proceeding one side or the other gets the property.
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1973.893,1974.392,Well--
2008.07-615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1974.392,1982.545,And that is not going to be the -- what one side or the other gets in this proceeding is going to be a new judgment.
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2002.644,2004.722,--If I may respond.
2008.07-615,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2033.96,2034.303,Okay.
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2034.662,2035.633,--is not entitled to the ACMR.
2008.07-615,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2042.831,2043.892,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-615,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2043.892,2044.348,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.07-615,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2044.348,2053.547,Mr. Phillips.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2053.547,2083.11,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the previous 25 or so minutes has demonstrated one sort of overarching fact, which is that there is an enormous risk, if this Court decides to interpret the language of this statute broadly, that it will easily sweep beyond any kind of arrangements between Iran and the United States in ways that fundamentally, obviously, disadvantage the very people that Congress clearly intended to benefit by this entire statutory scheme."
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2152.677,2158.955,"So that if you had these military assets, which are clearly the assets that are at issue in Iran's claim--"
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2158.955,2159.831,--Absolutely.
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2159.831,2175.184,"--Cubic is worried about what to do with it and so they sell them to the Canadians but they keep the proceeds in escrow, under the theory that look we may end up owing this to the Iranians under the tribunal."
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2185.335,2189.789,I think they would be because of the way the Iranians actually pled this.
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2198.187,2209.777,"Well, why is that very different from this situation, where you have an arbitration award saying that you, Cubic, owe the equivalent of what you should have -- what you would have provided to Iran, if there hadn't been the revolution?"
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2209.777,2210.67,"--Well, there are two answers to that."
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2268.628,2269.506,Right.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2298.397,2298.978,--Right.
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2298.978,2299.852,Now suppose that happened.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2314.191,2314.612,Right.
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2314.612,2315.86,We want the grocery store.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2395.733,2396.314,Right.
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2396.314,2397.016,All right?
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2399.406,2403.746,"Well, you clearly -- and I agree with you; there is no question you can read this statute either way."
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.746,2404.23,All right.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2452.853,2453.227,Right.
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2453.898,2454.616,Yes.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2454.616,2460.55,--A significant purpose of this entire exercise obviously is to provide redress to the victims of terrorism.
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2460.55,2461.116,"That's one, but--"
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2461.116,2474.89,"201(d) is a specific statutory construction provision which seems to suggest that Congress says that if there are doubts about how to apply this particular provision, you ought to put the thumb on the scale in favor of the victim."
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2505.909,2526.167,"--That creates the issue, because the question is whether money that never goes back to Iran, but rather goes to an attaching person, is money that is or money that is not subtracted from the amount that the United States owes Iran."
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2526.167,2526.651,But -- but--
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2526.651,2527.68,And that question is the question--
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2527.68,2528.46,--But Justice Breyer--
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2528.46,2530.991,--is the question that is before the commission.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2530.991,2535.507,"--But the problem with this, Justice Breyer, is that this is a relinquishment provision."
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2562.433,2564.134,They are totally knowable.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2601.822,2602.696,--Justice Breyer--
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2602.696,2603.432,That's what I gather.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2605.101,2618.801,"--The parties have been very specific about it, and we cited in a series of quotations about what is the property at issue here; and the property at issue, Justice Breyer is the ACMR system or the economic value of the ACMR system."
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2637.854,2640.041,They are trying to attach the ACMR system.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2640.041,2640.602,--They did--
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2640.602,2643.367,They are trying to attach the Cubic judgment.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2645.711,2647.162,--But that's the whole point of this.
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2659.485,2660.643,And that's one piece of property.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2693.8,2704.781,"Justice Breyer, there is no question that the fact that there are subsequent lienholders in line affects the possibility, but I would have thought it would only affect it in a way that is positive for me."
2008.07-615,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2736.987,2737.892,Why not?
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2755.805,2767.145,"--Right, the United States would still have that -- would still have that argument, but it's not a claim against the United States, which is what's required under the statute that we are dealing with here when it's viewed that way."
2008.07-615,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2767.145,2790.449,"But Iran might say in the tribunal, in responding to the setoff argument, this claim that we brought against you, the United States, implicates a breach of obligations that you have that are un -- somewhat unrelated to what was at issue in the -- in the -- in the Cubic judgment."
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2800.475,2811.487,"No, I don't think there is anybody whose going to -- well, maybe there is some sense in which examining the Cubic judgment, but I don't think the tribunal has remotely been asked to or will under any circumstances be asked to review the Cubic judgment."
2008.07-615,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2811.487,2813.44,There might be in the setoff proceedings.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2819.407,2822.718,"Well, I mean, I think there is no question these are for two different obligations."
2008.07-615,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2847.019,2848.345,"Well, I think we might get--"
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2848.345,2848.816,--and Iran.
2008.07-615,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2848.816,2852.549,--substantial -- a substantial degree of argument on that point.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2852.549,2856.436,"I don't know how there could be an argument on that point, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2885.456,2887.629,The agreement between who -- between who--
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2887.629,2889.719,Between Iran and Cubic.
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2889.719,2895.514,"--So Iran, I assume, would say, look, we entered into this agreement to take the place of what was at dispute."
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2902.653,2911.026,"Well, it just says that you move even further down the road from what are the properties that are, in fact, at issue before the tribunal."
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2911.026,2914.741,"Right, so Iran says, look, you are not going to ship us the planes, whatever it is, you are not--"
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2914.741,2915.817,Although they wanted that.
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2915.817,2917.756,"--You were not going to give us the money, right?"
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2917.756,2918.645,And they still want that.
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2918.645,2919.975,And we still have a dispute.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2926.3,2928.721,"Mr. Chief Justice, that -- that -- they may have been able to make that argument."
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2946.854,2956.115,"Well, why would Cubic enter into a contract with Iran to give them money if it wasn't taking the place of the money they owed them in the original agreement?"
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2956.115,2961.317,"--Well, the question was, they were going to try to go forward in these arrangements."
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2996.725,2999.006,Do you know why it was pending for ten years?
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2999.006,3010.955,"--Well, it was stayed as a consequence of this other litigation -- as a consequence of these proceedings in order to allow, I think in general the Iran claims tribunal to -- to sort out, at least, some portion of these issues."
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3015.03,3017.919,So the stayed because it was at issue before the Iranian claims tribunal?
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3017.919,3018.434,Right.
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3039.815,3053.217,"Well, the -- the other thing -- and I think this counts against you, but maybe you have an answer to it, that there could be a lot of property that was directly at issue in '79 or '80 that Iran didn't get."
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3078.236,3078.782,Sure.
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3078.782,3094.743,"Now, I can understand Congress in passing this statute having one of two possible things: One is say we are just going to cut an arbitrary line here because it's a compromise, and what we will do is, you can go ahead, victim, and seize anything you want, as long as it doesn't narrowly fit within this."
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3098.07,3101.582,"But it also provides protection for victims, right, and those are the people who are the most--"
2008.07-615,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3101.582,3114.486,"The other way to look at it is to say, well, what we that had in mind here is we will pay these victims something; you know, they are going to get something right from Congress right now, because they are hurt."
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3128.462,3151.032,"--Justice Breyer, I think the Hague cases are the place to look in terms of trying to understand this, because what it's what -- Hague, that line of cases all involve efforts to seize consular properties of Iran and all arose prior to the Accords, and every one of those courts of appeals has concluded that each of those properties is beyond the ability of the courts to attach all of those properties."
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3261.16,3272.609,"Well, but the point is, depending on how it comes out, once you give a argument to the Iranians that they can raise with the claims tribunal that will affect far more than your one single case."
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3278.277,3278.714,Right.
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3353.842,3358.292,What provision -- can you cite me the provision where the Congress said put your thumb on the scale?
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3358.292,3358.806,Yes.
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3361.338,3362.617,11a.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3371.773,3374.409,"Well, I think what you have to do is give the language some credit."
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3393.731,3394.449,You don't see any--
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3394.449,3399.822,"--alternative it seems to me you ought to give it -- again, give the tie to the victims under this--"
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3399.822,3403.725,--You don't see any problem with Congress telling us how to conduct statutory construction?
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3403.725,3411.972,"--No, I think Congress does -- is entitled to suggest, if it's -- if you have ambiguity in our language, which way to come out as a matter of policy."
2008.07-615,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3416.161,3440.041,"--Mr. Phillips, one piece of -- I don't -- you have agreed that the United States could recoup from Iran the amount paid to the victims, including Dariush Elahi, including the 2.3 million."
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3450.785,3455.55,You mean in the situations where the United States has subrogate -- right to subrogation?
2008.07-615,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3455.55,3455.909,Yes.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3459.281,3464.967,"Well, I think it would almost certainly work as a matter of diplomacy and not as a matter of adjudicated resolution."
2008.07-615,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3498.015,3500.687,--You said this is a one of a kind case.
2008.07-615,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3509.137,3516.48,"There are, but the problem is you have to back into the situation of property that is at issue in the claims tribunal."
2008.07-615,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3550.542,3551.404,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2008.07-615,3,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,3553.354,3556.384,If I can make just a few points.
2008.07-615,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3713.082,3713.803,"Thank you, counsel."
