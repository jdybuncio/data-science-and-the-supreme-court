1956.153,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,30.703,"Number 153, Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation versus National Labor Relations Board."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,37.995,43.526,May it please the Court.
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,625.547,630.058,"How was that done, by a general notice or just to -- to those who returned?"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,630.058,640.19,That was by a written proposal to the Union representatives on a clause to be included in the new collective agreement.
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,640.19,648.55,"No, I mean, this advised to those who returned before the main body of workers that they would have a permanent status."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,650.349,651.52,"It was not, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,653.288,659.42,"In other words, the first notice of this was on the occasion of the collective bargaining for the new agreement subsequently for the return of everyone."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,659.42,672.572,"So far as the record shows, nothing was said one way or the other when the men came back or than the later time until the layoff list was being made out."
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,688.397,691.486,"Well, but ahead of everyone else?"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,692.911,694.556,It was assumed here.
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,723.925,745.97,"Well, what I'm trying to get at of course is whether -- is there anything in this record which justifies an inference that one of the inducements to get these seven or whatever the number may be to come back in advance of the large body, was that they would, by coming back, get preferential status seniority wise?"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,745.97,773.621,"No, Your Honor, and strangely, when I say strangely, and then relate the Court held that of that had happened, if the employer had offered the strikers as an inducement to return, the assurance of permanent tenure above those who would have, who stayed out, and then the decision would have been different."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,809.541,818.055,"Well, that's what -- isn't that what the Court -- the basis on which the Court acted and that was what the Board had found that they did do it for the purpose of granting a property?"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,818.055,818.798,"No, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,818.798,820.158,What -- I don't quite understand.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,826.175,829.178,"26 -- 26 of what, Your Honor?"
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,829.178,837.552,Right here on the second part of it.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,859.302,861.541,"After the strike, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,917.409,929.996,"What does he mean by saying ""Always does not dispute the fact, promulgation and implementation of its superseniority policy was discriminatory in favor of employees abandoning or not participating in the strike --"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,929.996,930.15,What page is that?
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,930.15,932.99,"-- against those remaining on strike until it called out."""
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,932.99,934.001,"What page is that, Your Honor?"
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,934.001,942.346,Page 27 and 28 right at the bottom of 27 and top of 28.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,942.346,946.284,"Well, I don't think -- I don't think he meant it."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,980.776,987.697,And that Olin did promulgate and implement its superseniority policy to accomplish that purpose.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,987.697,1001.371,"Well, that is the proposal which was made to the Unions by the employer on -- at the first collective bargaining negotiation and conference after the strike ended."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1001.371,1007.877,Then he added not as all and denied that its action discouraged union activities.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1007.877,1016.304,"Well, I think that's a matter of -- of inference, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1016.304,1017.545,But the Board drew -- drew it.
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1017.545,1018.349,"Oh, it felt."
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1018.349,1020.364,The Board drew it
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1020.364,1021.886,Of great many things --
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1021.886,1024.599,Judge Dobie said all and then denied.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1024.599,1026.714,"Well, I -- I don't deny it."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1034.256,1036.588,"Well, he didn't say lose a strike, if that --"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1036.588,1037.441,"I know he didn't, but I'm saying that."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1037.441,1040.81,Then the Olin adopted a policy and put it in effect for that purpose.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1040.81,1054.682,"In other words, there are great many things may have a discouraging effect on union activity and so, with the difference, I say this to Your Honors, still may not be a violation of the Act."
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1054.682,1078.18,"But wasn't -- wasn't there a year, a purposeful classification as to seniority rights, purposefully disadvantaging those who had been out on strike -- not as an inevitable consequences -- consequence of making replacement but designed to have those fellows remember."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1078.18,1078.715,"No, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1078.715,1089.423,It wasn't the operation -- the inevitable operation of hiring people to replace people on strike and hiring people who would then obtain permanent tenure.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1092.219,1092.667,As we contend --
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1092.667,1098.692,"-- typical aspects of a strike, but that has been held not to be, as I understand it, an unfair labor practice."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1098.692,1116.232,"Quite so, Your Honor, and that is precisely what our contention is here, that this clause to be added to the contract and which was -- unilaterally effectuate it and then the union then agreed to it, was no more than a regulation of the inevitable consequences of the fact --"
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1116.232,1118.525,Are you -- I beg your pardon.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1118.525,1137.309,"-- no more than a recognition and a confirmation of the inevitable consequences of the fact that these employees came back to work from a strike when jobs were available, and thereby, became of their own right entitled to permanent tenure and that's what they've got."
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1154.115,1176.862,Are you -- are you urging on this Court the proposition that although the Board made a finding that there was this conscious discrimination after the strike was over with a view of inflicting that kind of disadvantage to those who had been on strike that that's what the Board found.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1189.868,1191.788,I am contending that along with some other --
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1191.788,1192.467,All right.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1192.467,1193.884,"-- along with some other things, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1193.884,1200.039,But aren't you making the point -- but aren't you making the point that this was in the nature of a reward after the event rather than an inducement before the event?
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1200.039,1202.371,"That is -- that is -- no -- no, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1213.37,1218.578,Everybody agrees -- everybody agrees there wasn't -- not made before they came back.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1218.578,1221.947,Everyone agrees that nothing was said before they came back.
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1223.543,1243.386,"Well, Mr. Stuart, I gather then that you're asking us to say that actually, in legal consequence, what was done here does not differ from a situation in which rather than seven strikers coming in and taking those jobs, you had employed seven new men."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1243.386,1246.146,"Precisely, Your Honor, precisely."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1281.732,1285.321,May I say that -- I -- I'd like to find out if I'm wrong about it.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1338.335,1362.182,"Well, Your Honor, I think you can -- I think you can hold with me without doing more than holding that this employer would have -- have been guilty of strike breaking if it had done the same which was the sole thing the Court said they didn't do in order to win a favorable decision in the case."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1363.013,1366.683,But what do you do about this finding?
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1369.536,1372.408,"The finding -- the finding is wrong, Your Honor, and that it --"
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1372.408,1373.757,"Why, because it's not supported by the facts?"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1373.757,1375.798,"Not supported by the evidence, sir."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1375.798,1377.371,Not supported by the evidence.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1390.482,1394.12,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't think it's quite as simple as that."
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1418.118,1424.61,"Well, would you tell me this, Mr. Stuart, if I may refer you back to what Mr. Justice Black was just reading for you."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1439.471,1443.754,"Let me -- let me just read, Your Honor, exactly what Mackay does say."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1453.415,1454.147,Page 28?
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1454.147,1465.013,"-- brief on pages 18 and 19 in our brief -- 19 and 20, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1472.44,1474.604,"Yes, well now, but look at the difference."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1494.372,1495.343,That was the Board's finding.
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1495.343,1499.008,"Well now, now if -- how -- how do you get over that?"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1499.474,1499.868,Well --
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1499.868,1506.925,"Other than as Mr. Justice Black suggests, so you're asking us now to say that the evidence didn't support that finding."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1506.925,1510.227,"We got over it in this way, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1595.809,1596.686,But I think as I -- am I correct --
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1596.686,1598.096,And it's a matter of law.
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1598.096,1611.845,"Am I correct that Mackay in point of time concern the right of the employer, in other words, the charge was that he had replaced strikers in an effort to carry on this business and that that was an unfair labor practice."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1614.225,1614.349,That's right.
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1614.349,1637.163,"Now, your view in your case however, as I understand it, the action at which -- your action at which the complaint was directed is your action as subsequent to the strike in relation to the -- according at that time as the Board found at least for the purpose of punishing these other strikers who didn't come back."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1637.163,1645.805,"In relation to, Your Honor, what happened after the strike and without any relation at all to what happened during the strike."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1645.805,1647.178,What difference does that make?
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1674.051,1674.797,"Well, Your Honor --"
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1674.797,1675.8,If you say -- if -- suppose you said that --
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1675.8,1676.338,We --
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1676.338,1677.424,-- would that be a violation of the Act?
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1677.424,1679.111,"Well, if we did it, but we didn't do it."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1679.111,1680.598,That's right and they say you did.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1680.598,1687.861,"Well, they -- they draw that as more to legal conclusion on a closed conclusion of facts, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1687.861,1690.299,Judge Dobie didn't so treat it.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1690.299,1695.96,"Well, I -- I want to have a little something to say about Judge Dobie's decision in a moment."
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1740.476,1740.672,Mr. Stuart --
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1740.672,1742.078,But that's our position.
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1742.078,1747.358,"Mr. Stuart, there was another part of the decision in the Mackay case."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1758.846,1759.727,"That's right, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1759.727,1771.64,"Now, as I understand this decision and regarding this on this, that's what the Board found in this case with reference to the layoff, references of seniority rights."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1771.669,1772.711,Seniority rights.
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1772.711,1774.145,"Well, that's the seniority right."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1802.88,1803.16,There's no such contention.
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1803.16,1809.542,"So that's an -- that's an arbitrary, then it becomes no finding, it becomes a dogmatic assertion."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1810.535,1822.699,"Yes, Your Honor, and there's no contention on the part of the -- of the Board at all that this was aimed at people who -- who are particularly active in the strike, none at all."
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1902.635,1911.8,"Then tell me, Mr. Stuart, if there had been no strike and the Union and the company had not been able to agree on a renewal agreement."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,1919.355,1921.786,"We cite the authorities, if Your Honor please."
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1996.015,1997.402,"May I ask this, Mr. Stuart?"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2015.708,2016.001,Nothing to say.
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2016.001,2016.733,Nothing of that kind.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2016.733,2017.156,Nothing to say.
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2017.156,2022.021,Do you rely on the mere fact of termination of the agreement as importing --
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2022.021,2022.06,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2022.06,2024.109,"-- that thereafter, there was no seniority?"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2024.109,2035.226,"The termination of the agreement as emphasized by the fact that the employees promptly went on a strike thereafter, against -- what would have been against the no-strike clause in the contract."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2035.226,2036.986,You referred to the trial examiner.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2049.507,2051.889,Yes.
1956.153,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2074.722,2076.471,Before you came in here?
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2076.471,2085.045,"Now, I'd like to -- I'd like just to summarize this point which really is the whole point of the case as we see it."
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2206.902,2217.113,"When you say irrespective of the finding of motivation, how can you -- how can you put that aside to be irrelevant?"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2230.198,2237.034,"Your Honor, I am speaking of the motivation at the material and critical time."
1956.153,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2243.156,2249.259,"I understand -- I understand the argument that the Board was just entitled to find it as a matter of law, I understand that."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2249.259,2253.009,The Board found this as to something that happened long afterwards.
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2564.899,2566.026,Where are you reading?

1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2573.567,2575.872,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2774.066,2778.653,Do you claim a direct conflict in the Potlatch case in this decision below?
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2778.653,2783.608,"Yes, Your Honor, and I understand the Board to concede that practically."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2783.608,2786.77,What were the findings in the Potlatch case?
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2786.77,2791.807,The findings (Voice Overlap) --
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2791.807,2797.143,How could there be a -- how could there be a conflict unless it's on -- it's when -- when --
1956.153,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2797.143,2797.487,Yes.
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2797.487,2802.046,-- so far as the evidence is concerned to support the findings.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2802.046,2807.953,"The situation on the Potlatch case was in all essential particular as the same as in this case, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2807.953,2809.241,How could it be the same?
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2818.813,2823.323,"They've found that in Potlatch too, Your Honor and then the Court overturned it."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2823.323,2827.236,They overturned your findings but that's on the evidence before them.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2827.236,2827.515,No sir.
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2827.515,2830.21,"This is quite different evidence, how could there be a conflict?"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2830.21,2833.518,"There's practically no difference in the evidence, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2873.62,2883.703,Well -- but I -- I guess this is an actual -- I'm looking at the Court of Appeals' opinion at page 30 in which this is quoted from Potlatch.
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2901.541,2901.821,Yes.
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2901.821,2910.47,"Isn't that a very different finding in the one that was found here that this finding being, that what was done was an order to discipline employees?"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2910.47,2911.507,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2911.645,2922.779,"Now, what about this Mr. Stuart, is this an accurate summarization of at least one fact in the record that Olin's -- I'm looking at page 29."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2943.021,2947.069,"That's accurate but the inference is erroneous, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2947.069,2949.337,"Well, I'm –- I'm trying to --"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2949.337,2949.664,"Well, let me --"
1956.153,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2949.664,2962.17,"It seem to me that there must have been rather -- if that's accurate, that law of it or if its standing alone support this finding that the whole purpose of what was done was in order to discipline employees adhering to the strike."
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,2962.17,2969.219,"Let me explain this, Your Honor, which will account for the answer I gave Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3044.265,3048.615,Do you think our Universal Camera decision has any relation to this case?
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,3048.615,3051.669,"Well, Your Honor, I think it has."
1956.153,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3051.669,3064.147,"In that case, we've indicated pretty strongly, doesn't it, that the Court of Appeals starts first responsibility and only in the most exceptional circumstances when we attempt to read all the evidence to overturn the finding?"
1956.153,0,46253,william_a_stuart,,3064.147,3064.687,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.153,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3101.752,3129.909,Just one moment please.
