1985.85-246,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,19.062,We will hear arguments next in United States against Dion.
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,55.568,70.244,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question in this case is whether an Indian may assert tribal hunting rights as a defense to prosecution for taking wildlife in violation of federal conservation statutes."
1985.85-246,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.38,184.102,"Mr. Minear, may I ask the status of what it is we are reviewing?"
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,192.375,193.041,--That is correct.
1985.85-246,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.041,200.795,And the panel on remand found that the takings were for commercial purposes.
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,205.949,207.718,We don't believe that it is contested.
1985.85-246,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,213.122,219.776,So are we being asked to review the en banc judgment that occurred before the remand?
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,219.776,220.926,"--Yes, that is right."
1985.85-246,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.702,243.141,"And all we are looking at is the question of, if it is not for a commercial purpose and not for a religious purpose."
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,243.141,244.041,"That is right, Your Honor."
1985.85-246,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.041,244.991,Is that right?
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,244.991,245.843,Yes.
1985.85-246,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,287.753,294.757,Do you regard the golden eagle as threatened with extinction today?
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,294.757,303.28,"Your Honor, the Congress has made that determination in its 1962 amendments to the Bald Eagle Act."
1985.85-246,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,307.997,312.318,"They certainly treated the two types of eagles differently, did they not?"
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,312.318,314.851,"--Yes, they did treat them somewhat differently, although both are--"
1985.85-246,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,314.851,315.453,Somewhat?
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,317.87,326.895,"--In both cases, bald eagles and golden eagles, the prohibitions apply to both of these eagles, in both cases."
1985.85-246,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.588,361.382,"Well, I thought the government conceded that the golden eagles were not endangered, but that when they were young they resembled bald eagles, and therefore as a prophylactic measure the government decided to prohibit the taking of either."
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,362.484,364.618,"Your Honor, I don't believe that is quite correct."
1985.85-246,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,364.618,367.453,"That certainly is what came through to me, too."
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,368.638,368.721,Okay.
1985.85-246,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,377.408,378.427,That is 20 years ago.
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,378.427,378.81,--Yes.
1985.85-246,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,378.81,379.91,Go ahead.
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,379.91,385.064,Stated that it had two purposes for extending protection to the gold eagle.
1985.85-246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,750.084,755.17,"Now, what sort of legislative history do you feel that is that supports your position?"
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,755.17,758.705,I think it probably could be characterized as insipient legislative history.
1985.85-246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,758.705,761.324,Grade F or Grade E perhaps?
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,762.757,771.946,"At this point the House, shortly after this statement was made, the House passed the reauthorization bill, and the action is now pending in the Senate."
1985.85-246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,771.946,780.719,Having been assured by the chairman of the Subcommittee that the coverage of a particular Act that had been passed many years before was such and such.
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,780.719,782.754,"Yes, I think that that is reasonable."
1985.85-246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,785.94,794.962,"I do, too, but the question is, how much additional weight do you give to this little transaction on the House floor?"
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,799.013,803.151,"I do believe, Your Honor, that it is relevant and should be brought to the Court's attention."
1985.85-246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.507,820.027,"But we are not talking, as I understand it, about a floor statement at the time that the bill in question was passed, whose coverage we are now trying to ascertain."
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,823.815,827.35,"Yes, that is right, Your Honor."
1985.85-246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,827.35,830.985,Certainly we didn't mean that all floor statements should be brought to our attention.
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,856.219,859.571,"That was a 1962 memorandum, an internal memorandum."
1985.85-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,859.571,860.004,Right.
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,860.004,862.04,It was quoted in the White opinion.
1985.85-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,866.158,872.062,"Whether it still exists or not, you don't question that it did at one time exist?"
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,872.062,878.316,"Yes, it certainly did exist at one time, and it was quoted, but what I am pointing at, Your Honor--"
1985.85-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,878.316,880.917,"We may not have the original copy of Hamlet, either, but we know what it says."
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,881.817,884.603,"--But, Your Honor, I am not sure what context that was said in."
1985.85-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.767,915.908,"I know, but generally... I know the Court has frequently... Mr. Cohen's work on Indian law and so forth has been treated almost like the Bible from time to time, and I guess this is the... I don't know whether this was Felix Cohen or Solicitor Margo."
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,922.911,927.315,"We are not even sure, Your Honor, this was in fact from the solicitor himself."
1985.85-246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.973,941.475,It is your position it is just simply wrong?
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,941.475,943.542,"Yes, I think that it is inaccurate."
1985.85-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,964.757,970.661,Are you saying that the Department of Interior says that this does not exist?
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,970.661,975.213,"No, we have simply been unable to locate that particular memorandum."
1985.85-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,976.079,978.998,"You mean, the Interior Department can't locate its own files?"
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,978.998,982.735,--Sometimes it is difficult to find memoranda that are 20 years old.
1985.85-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,982.735,983.569,But this is impossible.
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,984.919,987.771,"I cannot say it is impossible, no."
1985.85-246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,987.771,991.741,How do you account for the fact that they have it and the Interior Department doesn't have it?
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,991.741,995.276,"I believe that they just cited the White opinion, which quoted this."
1985.85-246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1031.132,1035.501,You feel the public interest is something different than the statutes and treaties involved here?
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1037.87,1040.136,I think it is something that again should be given consideration.
1985.85-246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1050.678,1061.568,"Yes, but I thought you were just entering into a discussion of the public interest after having concluded your discussion of the statutory and treaties."
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1067.805,1069.055,"Yes, essentially it is, Your Honor."
1985.85-246,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1121.937,1124.973,What about the golden eagle population?
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1124.973,1129.443,It is less clear that there is an immediate threat to the golden eagle population.
1985.85-246,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1150.69,1155.86,Do you have comparable statistics on golden eagle population?
1985.85-246,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1155.86,1160.396,--I believe the best statistics that we have that I received from Interior.
1985.85-246,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1222.467,1223.084,Mr. Pechota.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1223.084,1244.399,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the government's position in oral argument and in its briefs in this case appears to be that the Bald Eagle Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act abrogated the right of Dwight Dion as a tribal member to take eagles while on Indian land, while on his reservation."
1985.85-246,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1329.552,1334.187,And the respondent hasn't contested that?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1334.187,1337.056,The respondent has not contested that.
1985.85-246,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1337.056,1342.11,And you concede that the treaty does not incorporate taking for commercial purposes?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1342.11,1345.662,That is conceded for the purposes of this appeal.
1985.85-246,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1373.498,1381.668,"Well, I guess we first have to know whether the right to hunt to extinction of a species is included in the treaty rights."
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1381.668,1382.37,Okay.
1985.85-246,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1400.066,1400.532,The golden eagle.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1400.532,1401.066,The golden eagle.
1985.85-246,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1462.738,1477.847,Could we go back for just a moment to determine whether it is your position that the treaty gives the tribe and its members a right to hunt eagles to their extinction?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1477.847,1484.167,It is not the position here that they give the Indians that right.
1985.85-246,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1517.721,1530.464,"Well, if the treaty doesn't include the right to hunt to extinction, then perhaps it is open to the federal government to regulate hunting to extinction."
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1530.464,1543.539,"--I think that the government can abrogate a treaty, there is no doubt about it, if in fact it does it in the proper manner under the principles that have been enunciated by this Court."
1985.85-246,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1546.574,1552.395,"But if the treaty doesn't cover it, it isn't a question of abrogation of the treaty at all."
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1552.395,1552.861,--Okay.
1985.85-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1642.953,1646.087,"May I ask one preliminary question, counsel?"
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1647.272,1648.589,Yes.
1985.85-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.589,1669.536,"We start from the premise that there is a treaty right, and is the right one to kill the eagles, because I notice in the House legislative history there was a suggestion that historically the tribe did not actually kill the eagles, but rather trapped them and was able to get their feathers without actually destroying the eagle."
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1669.536,1672.405,I think that depended on the particular tribe that was involved.
1985.85-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.385,1692.151,I see.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1702.224,1702.824,That's correct.
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1711.113,1715.084,"Well, in this particular case it was solely for money."
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1715.084,1725.623,"Not... it hasn't been shown that these three taking counts, in other words, when Dwight Dion took the three eagles, or the five eagles that are involved in this case, in the three counts--"
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1725.623,1728.224,"Well, he sold it to an agent."
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1728.224,1729.926,--But it sold it later.
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1731.06,1731.976,But he sold it.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1731.976,1732.878,He sold it.
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1734.578,1735.914,And he got money for it.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1735.914,1737.014,--And he got money for the--
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1737.014,1738.616,That is sale for profit.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1738.616,1740.132,--If in fact... if in fact--
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1740.132,1740.732,If nothing.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1742.584,1745.02,--If in fact he took the eagles initially--
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1745.02,1746.92,And that is what you want to protect.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1746.92,1747.472,--No.
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1747.472,1752.59,"You want to protest his right to kill off 100 more of these, and that is it."
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1752.59,1759.927,"No, all I want to protect is the right of Indian individuals to take eagles for traditional cultural purposes."
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1759.927,1762.196,All 120 of them.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1762.196,1763.779,Not all 120 of them.
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1769.533,1773.253,But the evidence shows that one man took 20.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1773.253,1774.703,"No, the evidence--"
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1774.703,1775.603,Over a period of a year.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1775.603,1778.471,"--The evidence is disputed on that, as I set out in my brief."
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.157,1790.863,"Whether it is disputed or not, there is evidence that one man took one-twentieth, which is of 120."
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1790.863,1791.598,--There is evidence--
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1791.598,1795.167,"And if five more did it, that is the end."
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1795.167,1797.969,--That would be correct.
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1797.969,1798.919,That's right.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1798.919,1800.237,And I am not saying--
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1800.237,1802.537,And you want me to sit by and see that happen.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1802.537,1809.342,--I am not saying that they should be authorized to sell those eagles or to take that particular--
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1809.342,1811.242,Isn't that what is involved in this case?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1811.242,1813.311,"--No, what is involved in--"
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1813.311,1817.615,Doesn't this case involve eagles that were sold?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1817.615,1819.932,"--No, it involves eagles that were taken."
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1819.932,1822.317,And sold to the agents.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1822.317,1826.852,There was a lapse of time in there between the time that they were taken and the time that they were sold.
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1828.721,1832.773,"Well, if there is a lapse of time, they were sold."
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1832.773,1834.375,--Yes.
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1834.375,1836.791,And that was the purpose of taking them.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1836.791,1838.093,I am not sure that the purpose of--
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1838.093,1840.112,"Well, what other purpose was there?"
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1840.112,1852.336,"--Dwight Dion is a tribal member who by the evidence in this case had taken eagles for other purposes, for tribal members to use in cultural, traditional ways."
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1884.723,1887.259,But the eagles are gone.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1887.259,1890.377,"I don't believe that the eagles are gone, Your Honor."
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1890.377,1891.977,"Well, those 20 are gone."
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1891.977,1896.448,The 20 eagles that he took exactly are gone.
1985.85-246,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1899.583,1900.583,Before we move on--
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1900.583,1901.217,--Yes.
1985.85-246,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1901.217,1902.269,--I am over here.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1910.023,1915.743,Traditional purposes include within the context of this case the right to take eagles--
1985.85-246,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1915.743,1917.445,To do what with?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1917.445,1928.8,--To use them in religious rites that are used by the Yankton Sioux tribe of people.
1985.85-246,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1928.8,1934.554,Did not the District Court in this case find the eagles were not used for religious purposes?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1934.554,1936.839,He found... the eagles that were taken in this case?
1985.85-246,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1936.839,1938.524,Yes.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1938.524,1940.691,"The eagles that were sold, or that were taken?"
1985.85-246,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1940.691,1941.143,Well--
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1941.143,1946.262,I don't think that the District Court found that they were not taken or that they were not used for cultural purposes.
1985.85-246,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1946.262,1947.047,"--He says,"
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1959.855,1966.025,"Okay, I think they are saying that he took them for commercial purposes, the ones that were sold."
1985.85-246,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1966.025,1974.781,"And in addition to religious purposes, what other would be included within conventional... traditional purposes?"
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1974.781,1977.064,"Well, that would be the primary use."
1985.85-246,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1977.064,1977.564,That is the primary one?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,1977.564,1981.185,"Right, within the context of this case."
1985.85-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2082.316,2087.287,Can you shed any light on the authenticity and the authorship of this memorandum?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2087.287,2089.906,I took that quote in my brief--
1985.85-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2089.906,2090.372,Just out of the opinion?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2090.372,2091.256,--out of the White--
1985.85-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2091.256,2093.274,It just comes from the Office of the Solicitor--
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2093.274,2093.558,--Right.
1985.85-246,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.558,2096.143,--and we don't know just how high up the particular author was.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2096.143,2096.676,Right.
1985.85-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2575.605,2581.259,Is it contrary to the federal statute to just capture an eagle?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2581.259,2583.409,--It is contrary to take an eagle.
1985.85-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.409,2584.361,In any way.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2584.361,2584.894,That's right.
1985.85-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.894,2587.496,It doesn't make any difference whether you kill it or hurt it or not?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2587.496,2588.646,No.
1985.85-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2591.032,2592.484,Right.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2592.484,2611.779,"--a particular... the government also contends here that if Indians are allowed to take eagles for traditional cultural purposes, that the eagle is going to be rendered extinct."
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2632.875,2635.894,But there is no traditional purpose in this case.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2640.298,2641.631,There is evidence--
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2641.631,2642.415,Or commercial?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2642.415,2644.317,"--And if he sold them, and I concede that he sold them--"
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2644.317,2644.85,If he sold them?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2645.467,2646.535,"--Right, he did sell them."
1985.85-246,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2647.085,2648.571,Why do you keep saying traditional?
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2648.571,2656.807,"--If someone does sell them, then certainly there is not a traditional culture purpose, and they are not included within the holding of the Dion case."
1985.85-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.85,2803.321,"If Congress had in the statute itself or in the legislative history clearly said that it is absolutely essential because of the dangers of extinction to safeguard both the bald eagle and the gold eagle, and that was a Congressional finding, would you say you nevertheless would have to have a litigation about that conclusion in the specific case?"
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2803.321,2811.593,"I don't think you would have to have a litigation if they said, by this particular statute we clearly intend to abrogate the rights of Indians under their treaties."
1985.85-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2811.593,2832.84,"No, they didn't say that, but they just say in the preamble or in the body or the legislative history that we find that the bald eagle is in danger of extinction, and any taking of them must be forbidden, and in order to achieve that end we must protect the golden eagle, too."
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2832.84,2840.946,"I don't believe that that's sufficient to abrogate the right of Indian people to exercise their rights, their reserved rights under their treaties."
1985.85-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2840.946,2865.644,"Well, so in this case if there had been evidence out on about the bald and the gold eagle and the dangers and threats to them, and the judge had found that it is necessary not to recognize a treaty right in order to keep the bald eagle from being extinct, what if there had been a finding like that in this case?"
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2870.279,2871.212,No.
1985.85-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2878.452,2881.904,Let's assume that we accept Puyallup.
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2881.904,2902.75,"--If you accept Puyallup and there is a finding that as a reasonable conservation measure you have to... you have to prevent Indians from taking eagles to a certain extent, then under Puyallup that would be proper."
1985.85-246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2902.75,2907.452,"But you say that would have to be found in a case, that a Congressional finding to that effect would not suffice?"
1985.85-246,1,43193,terry_l_pechota,,2907.452,2921.51,"If in fact there was a Congressional finding under Puyallup and you agree that Puyallup should apply in this case, which I don't, then I agree that that would be sufficient."
1985.85-246,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2924.295,2926.83,Very well.
1985.85-246,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2931.567,2935.602,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has questions, we will waive rebuttal."
1985.85-246,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2935.602,2936.385,Very well.
