1984.83-1020,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.558,We'll hear arguments next in Ohio v. Kovacs.
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,15.76,30.352,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, this matter is before the Court pursuant to a petition filed by the people of the State of Ohio, seeking a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit."
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,85.606,87.072,"It's been abated now, hasn't it?"
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,87.072,89.808,"No, it has not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,126.331,128.683,Is the receiver still in possession?
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,128.683,130.735,The receiver is still in possession.
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,130.735,136.122,And Kovacs is out of possession.
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,136.122,138.741,The receiver has equitable possession.
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,142.693,148.429,"But the receiver is in charge of the site, I take it."
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,148.429,149.246,Yes.
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,158.385,161.92,But Kovacs couldn't literally carry out the terms of the injunction.
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,170.86,171.895,You mean now?
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,171.895,172.762,Yes.
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,172.762,174.247,"No, he could not."
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,174.797,179.549,Because the State dispossessed him of the property by putting a receiver in charge.
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,179.549,184.702,--They created... they put the receiver in equitable possession of the property.
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,184.702,197.862,"Well, I know, but he's the one that sooner or later took some steps, but then the United States took some steps and removed the toxic wastes from the surface."
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,198.429,199.829,The waste that remained--
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,199.829,202.481,"Well, what did the receiver want from Kovacs but money?"
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,202.481,207.616,--What the receiver wants and what the people of the State of Ohio want is completion of that cleanup.
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,207.616,210.901,"I know, but is the receiver... the receiver is in charge of it."
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,217.824,218.774,They may--
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,218.774,221.193,"Maybe they should get it for that, but isn't that what they want from him?"
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,221.193,225.995,--What he wants is the performance of certain acts which probably wouldn't require the expenditure of money.
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,225.995,227.862,"Well, what acts do they want him to do?"
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,230.948,235.202,"Well, they want the acts of removal of the soils and--"
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,235.202,238.837,"Yes, but he can't perform those acts because the receiver is in charge."
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,238.837,239.954,--That's true; he cannot.
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,240.537,242.022,"Well, then what do you want out of him?"
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,242.022,251.212,"--He may be able, with the receiver's agreement... and the receiver would be happy to have him come in and do those things... it's not where the receivers will not let him on the site."
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,255.197,260.068,But the receiver would be as happy as he could be if he just paid over the money.
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,260.068,263.603,The receiver... he would not be paying money to the receiver.
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,267.155,268.989,Nevertheless--
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,268.989,272.291,"And that, in and of itself... that is the situation."
1984.83-1020,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,295.924,302.161,--You stated that the receiver would be very happy to help him do all these things.
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,308.75,309.233,Yes.
1984.83-1020,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,333.282,336.418,Has the receiver any responsibility for the cleanup?
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,336.418,340.12,The receiver effectively is the alter ego of Mr. Kovacs.
1984.83-1020,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,340.12,344.34,Does he have responsibility to effect the cleanup... the receiver?
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,344.34,345.007,Yes.
1984.83-1020,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,345.007,347.04,Is that by force of the injunction?
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,347.04,348.991,That is by force of the order appointing him.
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,365.337,366.803,Where is that injunction?
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,372.174,372.891,"Yes, it is."
1984.83-1020,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,377.693,378.159,Right.
1984.83-1020,0,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,378.159,389.067,"--repeats the original injunction and then has also another injunction in it, stating Mr. Kovacs is to continue to cooperate with the receiver in implementing the injunction."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1292.993,1304.282,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, some of the Court's questions to the counsel for the State of Ohio indicate what we think is one of the mistakes made by the Court of Appeals in--"
1984.83-1020,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1304.282,1307.317,Do you think we're falling into the same error that the Court of Appeals fell into?
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1307.317,1310.086,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think you're headed in that direction."
1984.83-1020,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1364.422,1372.861,"Before these waste dumps were opened and operated, did they secure a license of some kind from the State?"
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1372.861,1374.428,"Not in this case, Your Honor."
1984.83-1020,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1382.934,1386.603,Is the Ohio state law something since this event arose?
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1386.603,1388.721,"--Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1984.83-1020,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1399.076,1408.784,"But if ultimately there isn't any money anywhere in the private source to do this, where lies the obligation?"
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1408.784,1417.557,"Well, the obligation still lies with the responsible party, but then it falls to the public to pick up the tab for the responsible party is--"
1984.83-1020,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1417.557,1423.211,"Because the State allowed them to do it, either by license or by leave."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1423.211,1424.844,--The State didn't allow them to do it.
1984.83-1020,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1425.694,1428.046,"Well, you say they license them now, though?"
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1428.046,1430.798,"Yes, because we've all learned a lot more about the problem."
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.067,1452.961,"I think you would like us to judge the case as though a receiver had never been appointed, and I think that may be the right way of judging it, because then the question would be, is he still subject to the obligations of the injunction?"
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1468.054,1468.537,--That's correct.
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.256,1474.041,I think you have to address that.
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1475.243,1479.611,"Well, Your Honor, it doesn't change the fact that Kovacs is under an obligation to clean up."
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.611,1489.134,It does change the fact that his obligation under the injunction has been taken over the receiver and all the receiver wants from him is money.
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1489.134,1491.586,The receiver wants him to help to perform.
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.858,1503.394,He doesn't interfere with him by... he interferes with him unless he pays the money.
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1503.394,1505.096,"--No, he has done more than that."
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.592,1535.698,And what do you draw from that in terms of the receiver's ability to collect... to get money from him out of his post-bankruptcy earnings?
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1535.698,1551.641,"That he's made it impossible by getting a ruling from the bankruptcy court that this debt is dischargeable and therefore the receiver has no assets, whether pre-bankruptcy or post-petitioner earnings, that he can use to effectuate this cleanup."
1984.83-1020,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1551.641,1553.943,"Do you say this is a debt, or is it something else?"
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1553.943,1554.41,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1583.929,1590.635,"Well, neither... the Court of Appeals certainly didn't agree with that, and neither did the bankruptcy court."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1590.635,1593.487,"We wouldn't be here if we didn't think those courts were wrong, Your Honor."
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.487,1605.461,"Well, I know, but you are essentially saying that the federal court is wrong in construing Kovacs's obligation under state law."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1606.094,1613.817,"First, of all, Your Honor, one of the problems with this case is that, since the bankruptcy proceedings began, Ohio has been prevented from going back to the state court--"
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1613.817,1621.237,--Do you think the bankruptcy court thought that Kovacs was in... what you claim is that he was in contempt of court by filing the petition of bankruptcy.
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1623.673,1624.439,--We think that he was.
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.875,1626.325,I know.
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1627.375,1628.058,That's correct.
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1628.058,1631.695,"And obviously, under state law, he was not in violation."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1631.695,1640.884,The state court hasn't had an opportunity... no court has... no federal court in this proceeding has addressed what the state court would think has happened to its injunction.
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1640.884,1646.371,"Well, what the state court... but I'm sure that the bankruptcy court must have considered what Kovacs's obligations were under state law."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1646.371,1657.644,"There's nothing... excuse me, Your Honor, but there is nothing in this opinion of the bankruptcy court, the district court, or the Sixth Circuit to indicate that those courts thought that Kovacs's obligation had been satisfied."
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.346,1659.096,I didn't say that.
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1659.096,1660.329,--What they said was that--
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1660.329,1660.846,I didn't say that.
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1668.035,1670.654,"--They didn't address that, although the State asked them to."
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.343,1687.346,"Suppose the District Court had addressed it and said, yes, we think Mr. Kovacs is in violation of the state court injunction."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1689.281,1692.917,I think they should have abstained to the state court to determine the scope of his obligations.
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1692.917,1693.283,Exactly.
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1695.952,1697.971,Without writing an opinion explaining they were doing that.
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1697.971,1699.506,"Well, they rejected it nevertheless."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1705.41,1705.843,No.
1984.83-1020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1728.323,1734.846,"--May I ask... assuming that we have two insolvent people here, apparently, both Kovacs and the State of Ohio."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1742.666,1743.2,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1748.204,1751.122,"--No, but why couldn't Ohio do the cleanup and say pay us back?"
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1751.122,1753.391,--For two reasons that I gave.
1984.83-1020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1761.414,1763.414,But you know it by the time you do the work.
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1763.414,1774.721,"--No, you may not, Your Honor, because 20 years from now, you may find out that the remedial measures you took, the containment measures to clean up ground water, your monitoring of ground water, proves that the problem hasn't been solved."
1984.83-1020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1784.493,1794.385,"Do you think a person who gets, in this sort of situation, who has millions and millions of dollars, there is no way in the world he can discharge his obligation by paying the State whatever they think is necessary?"
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1794.385,1795.285,I think that's correct.
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.478,1840.597,"Ms. Oberly, this is sort of like ships passing in the night."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1871.551,1872.668,--I may have missed the first part.
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.541,1896.1,"Well, I suggest to you that all the Court of Appeals did is say the receiver is trying to get money, just get money from the Defendant, and not trying to force him to go clean up himself."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1903.856,1904.839,"--My time is expired, but--"
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1904.839,1906.141,"You may answer, of course."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1906.141,1915.247,"--If I may answer the question, I think that is the fundamental error in this case in equating an injunction to do a specific act with just a desire to get money."
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1921.151,1924.186,"I think the Court of Appeals is talking about the money, not about the obligation."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1924.186,1924.77,"That's correct, and that was--"
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.77,1926.02,Not about the obligation.
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1926.02,1934.791,"--That was its error, because by talking about money, it was able to say, because we're talking about money, this is a debt that is dischargable under the bankruptcy code."
1984.83-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.791,1943.164,"If all it was doing was talking about the money, it wouldn't... they weren't saying that the State of Ohio cannot enforce the obligations under the injunction."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1943.164,1949.051,They've discharged and approved the discharge of the entire injunction.
1984.83-1020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1956.657,1960.609,"Ms. Oberly, I also would like to ask one more thing."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1978.32,1983.891,"I think, if he has jurisdiction, and I have my doubts about that, I think it would be something he should abstain."
1984.83-1020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1983.891,1992.83,Is there something in the bankruptcy code presently that tells the bankruptcy judge what the judge should do in those circumstances?
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1992.83,1997.901,"It says that Ohio, or a person in Ohio's position can file a motion for abstention."
1984.83-1020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2002.27,2002.67,Right.
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2006.155,2006.506,That's correct.
1984.83-1020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2038.359,2046.732,"But there's nothing in the bankruptcy code, either under the new amendments or otherwise, that would require sending it back to the state court."
1984.83-1020,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2046.732,2048.083,--That's correct.
1984.83-1020,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2087.709,2089.577,Very well.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2094.279,2112.341,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I think in analyzing this obligation, there is really only one point in time which is relevant, and that is on the date of bankruptcy, September 2, 1980."
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.026,2233.084,I don't see anything in the settlement or the order appointing the receiver or anything else that released Kovacs from his obligations under the injunction.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2233.084,2234.786,"No, except that it replaced--"
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.786,2236.405,I know the receiver undertook to do it.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2236.405,2246.278,"--The receiver is ordered to do it, and it's a little hard to visualize these two arm-wrestling over who has control of the site."
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2262.203,2279.315,"Well, that's all well and good, but I don't see anything... if the state had... if the receiver quit or he was discharged and receivership liquidated, do you think Mr. Kovacs would have any remaining obligations under the--"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2279.315,2281.517,"--No, I do not, because I think the--"
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2281.517,2283.719,--You think it was agreed that the receiver would take it over.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2283.719,2299.478,"--I think that's the natural consequence of it, because the receiver took all of his assets, both personal and corporate, and the court then ordered the receiver to apply those assets to the cleanup."
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.062,2309.501,"Well, do you think that's the source of the Court of Appeals' observation that Kovacs cannot personally clean up the waste he wrongfully released into Ohio waters?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2313.738,2314.372,"--Well, I think that's--"
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2314.372,2317.44,"Is that because the receiver had the job, or what?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2317.44,2345.876,"--I think it's a necessary characteristic, if you're talking about an obligation here that involves the expenditure of millions of dollars, you're talking about a human being who has a family to support, and you take everything he owns; can you imagine any State court, after the money is all gone, holding him in contempt because he doesn't quit his job in New Jersey and come back here and clean up that site?"
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.38,2357.684,"Well, of course, Kovacs didn't exactly live up to his obligations either."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2357.684,2358.351,"--Well, there's no question."
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2358.351,2361.553,"He didn't pay over the $75,000."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2361.553,2364.255,"No question about it, and no question that that's an obligation--"
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.255,2365.838,"Instead, he filed for bankruptcy."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2365.838,2370.492,--He failed to cooperate by filing bankruptcy.
1984.83-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2450.277,2457.265,But your opponent claims that Kovacs's obligations under the injunction haven't been fully performed.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2460.299,2462.084,I certainly do.
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.024,2480.796,"Well, what if we disagree with you on that, that the obligations are not completely discharged under the injunction?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2484.682,2497.092,"I think, even if you disagree, that the whole obligation of Kovacs is now performed, you're still looking at a money obligation."
1984.83-1020,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2505.845,2518.338,"Well, is that a question that ought to be addressed by some court, somewhere along the line, the extent to which under the State court injunction, there is a continuing obligation of some kind?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2534.281,2545.822,"Well, since the adoption of the 1978 Code, the determination of the dischargability of bankruptcy claims has been pretty well lodged in the Federal court."
1984.83-1020,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2557.463,2572.104,"--Well, shouldn't part of the inquiry encompass, at least at the first level by the bankruptcy judge, the extent to which Ohio would say there is a continuing obligation remaining under the injunction?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2575.425,2580.043,"I don't think that's a matter of state law, Your Honor."
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2580.043,2596.588,Ms. Oberly reads the Court of Appeals opinion and the opinion below as indicating that any equitable obligation imposed upon Kovacs is dischargable and has been discharged.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2609.896,2611.931,"Oh, yes; I think so, because--"
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.931,2620.12,"So you say that a court has addressed it, namely, the Court of Appeals and the Bankruptcy Court?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2620.12,2621.203,"--Your Honor, we're looking--"
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2621.203,2622.037,"Well, yes or no?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2622.037,2622.671,--Pardon?
1984.83-1020,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2640.967,2652.425,"The Assistant Attorney General told us that since these problems arose, Ohio law now requires some kind of a license for waste dumps and that sort of thing?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2652.425,2652.991,I'm sure that's true.
1984.83-1020,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2652.991,2659.845,Does it also require them to put up a bond to cover situations like this?
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2660.612,2665.065,"I'd have to defer to my colleague, but that's a typical State regulatory scheme."
1984.83-1020,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2665.065,2667.35,But it didn't apply at the time?
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2667.35,2667.734,No.
1984.83-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2685.146,2704.691,"Counsel, in the old classical case where you are enjoined from maintaining your wall or your bridge over my property, and you go into bankruptcy, that discharges that?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2704.691,2708.392,I think not.
1984.83-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2724.021,2733.293,"The job was you were ordered to take it down, and you say you can't take it down because you're bankrupt."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2733.293,2736.912,I think that obligation might well be discharged.
1984.83-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2736.912,2740.114,You got any cases for that?
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2740.114,2741.399,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2785.512,2787.395,"Well, about a child support decree?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2788.078,2793.931,"Child support, there's a clear example of the differentiation here."
1984.83-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2811.56,2824.887,"--But I was addressing myself to your insistence that because he has no money and is in New Jersey... has moved to New Jersey from Ohio... therefore, who in his right mind would suggest he ought to perform his duties under the Ohio injunction?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2826.921,2832.123,"Well, the appeal... maybe I didn't state it properly... is the possibility of doing."
1984.83-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2836.444,2844.181,"You're saying that if he were cited for contempt, the Ohio court in Butler County would probably say no, you're not in contempt because it's impossible for you to perform?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2844.181,2852.62,"That's right, just as in child support cases, you can't find in contempt the quadraplegic who can't earn any money to pay child support."
1984.83-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2859.826,2862.126,"Mr. Caldwell, can I ask you a question, please?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2893.029,2894.179,I think it would.
1984.83-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.179,2896.964,That's basically the same case in your judgment.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2896.964,2899.433,I think it is.
1984.83-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2947.766,2948.682,"Forever, apparently."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2948.682,2951.801,--Forever.
1984.83-1020,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2958.105,2972.897,"Well, it might, of course, serve as a deterrent to other people who might otherwise think that they had to do to get out from under one of these State court injunctions is to file for bankruptcy, and then it's over."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,2991.376,2993.128,I'm sorry.
1984.83-1020,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3004.019,3005.969,"--No, not the bankruptcy law."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3019.862,3029.051,"--I know what you're saying, Your Honor, but I think it's always been the philosophy that the bankruptcy laws are not to be used as a deterrent."
1984.83-1020,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3034.253,3055.183,"Yes, but we're really talking about whether the bankruptcy, the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy law extends to cover a State pollution injunction in some of its permanent features and aspects."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3080.667,3084.686,"That is to refrain from future acts, certainly."
1984.83-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3118.626,3124.03,"But the State's point is that if your client doesn't pay for it, they have to pay for it."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3124.03,3125.13,"Well, that isn't really--"
1984.83-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3125.13,3125.963,That's the State's position.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3125.963,3126.948,--I know.
1984.83-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3139.855,3140.489,We all know that.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3140.489,3150.413,"Through the suits against the generators, the courts have recognized that industry as a whole should bear the cost, and they are as a practical matter in this case."
1984.83-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3158.603,3160.936,"United States brought those suits, I take it."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3160.936,3161.555,That's right.
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3161.555,3166.34,And they settled them and the money has been used to clean up the surface.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3166.34,3166.79,Right.
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3193.49,3211.286,"Well, why should, though, the... you really don't think that these kind of equitable obligations to perform are just normally dischargable in bankruptcy, do you?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3211.286,3216.987,"Well, if you're talking about an affirmative obligation to do something--"
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.987,3226.378,"I suppose claims under contracts are discharged, even though they could be specifically enforced."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3226.378,3234.984,"--If Kovacs had filed bankruptcy in September 1979 instead of '80, we might have a different question."
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3237.401,3239.769,What changed it in '80?
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3239.769,3243.221,"In '80, he's already out of possession and there's no--"
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3243.221,3244.704,The receiver is in possession.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3244.704,3245.187,--Right.
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3245.756,3247.139,And you've made the settlement.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3247.139,3249.291,That's right.
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3256.612,3265.05,"So if the day after the injunction was entered he filed for bankruptcy, and the question came up of dischargeability, you would be taking a different position."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3265.05,3266.919,Depending on which side it was on.
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3269.288,3278.144,"Well, I'm asking you whether your position is whether, ordinarily, equitable obligations like this are dischargable?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3278.144,3284.131,You can certainly make an argument that they are dischargable.
1984.83-1020,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3304.092,3314.983,"Well, if what you have suggested to us... and your colleague, your friend seemed to imply the same thing... the cost of meeting this problem is going to run into millions or hundreds of millions."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3314.983,3315.383,No question.
1984.83-1020,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3315.383,3323.589,"Then, isn't the question of dischargability in bankruptcy really academic, unless this man wins a billion dollar lottery or something?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3323.589,3326.208,"Well, you may be correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3389.198,3390.317,May I ask a factual question?
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3402.375,3405.927,"Well, I think the answer to that question depends on--"
1984.83-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3405.927,3406.643,This case.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3406.643,3407.377,--the decision of this Court.
1984.83-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3407.377,3411.329,"Well, that's right."
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3426.672,3430.557,Then this obligation will fall under the discharge; yes.
1984.83-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3430.557,3438.211,Any obligation under the injunction... except not to--
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3438.211,3442.615,"I don't think if he goes back to Hamilton, Ohio and starts dumping anything into the river again--"
1984.83-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3442.615,3443.298,--No.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3443.915,3448.935,--I think he will have no further monetary obligation to pay money into the--
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3448.935,3453.553,Or to do anything to clean up the site if it still needs cleaning up.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3453.553,3454.422,--I think that's right.
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3455.638,3459.54,And that's the result of the opinions below.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3459.54,3461.242,--Yes.
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3492.88,3498.451,Didn't the bankruptcy court take charge of the property in the hands of the receiver?
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3498.451,3500.817,"No, they did not."
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3500.817,3508.307,So Kovacs's property was never committed to paying his bills?
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3508.307,3521.881,"Well, you have to remember, you have a piece of property, the toxic nature of it being notorious all over the Midwest; do you really think that any--"
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3521.881,3523.15,Did the trustee... was there a trustee appointed?
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3523.15,3524.117,--A trustee was appointed.
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.117,3525.3,Did he abandon the property?
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3525.3,3529.304,"Not formally, but he wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole."
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3530.287,3537.14,"So anyway, it was never listed as a part of the assets of the estate?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3539.776,3541.111,I'm not sure of that.
1984.83-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3542.728,3546.68,"Well, was it an asset if it was loaded with the stuff?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3546.68,3547.346,--Pardon?
1984.83-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3547.346,3551.584,Was it an asset if you can't sell it?
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3551.584,3554.619,"Well, I guess anything is an asset."
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3554.619,3558.321,"Well, nevertheless, the property is still in possession of the receiver?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3558.321,3558.904,"Oh, yes."
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3558.904,3560.69,Never was a turnover ordered.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3560.69,3562.106,No.
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3564.057,3566.926,So the receiver is still in possession.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3566.926,3567.659,Right.
1984.83-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3567.659,3569.961,And it's not part of the bankrupt estate?
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3569.961,3577.132,"Well, the bankruptcy court has not dealt with it, and as I say, no trustee wants to grab it until it's cleaned up."
1984.83-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3577.132,3580.234,"Well, the trustee has been discharged, hasn't he?"
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3580.234,3583.519,"No, I don't think so."
1984.83-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3583.519,3587.34,May I ask a follow-up to a question Justice Rehnquist asked earlier?
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3603.517,3605.468,You mean to share in the bankruptcy estate?
1984.83-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3605.468,3606.551,Maybe there's nothing there; I don't know.
1984.83-1020,2,20667,david_a_caldwell,,3608.336,3624.78,"I don't think there is that estate, simply because the State court receiver had spent everything that there was in the way of assets by the time he went bankrupt."
1984.83-1020,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3624.78,3625.882,"Your time has expired, counsel."
1984.83-1020,3,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,3629.584,3631.886,Two fact statements.
1984.83-1020,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3648.295,3649.83,The Court should be provided with a copy.
1984.83-1020,3,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,3649.83,3654.549,"He simply has nothing left, and he can't even pay for his receivership bond anymore."
1984.83-1020,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3654.549,3656.284,"He wants discharge, then."
1984.83-1020,3,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,3656.284,3656.667,Yes.
1984.83-1020,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3656.667,3658.353,What's he going to do with the property?
1984.83-1020,3,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,3658.353,3662.905,"The property will revert, I would assume, to Mr. Kovacs because here is the--"
1984.83-1020,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3662.905,3665.34,Or to the trustee in bankruptcy.
1984.83-1020,3,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,3665.34,3667.959,"--Well, here is the status of the property."
1984.83-1020,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3695.542,3697.328,Who owns Chem-Dyne?
1984.83-1020,3,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,3697.328,3703.048,"The Chem-Dyne Corporation, all the stock is owned by Kovacs, but the stock--"
1984.83-1020,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3703.048,3706.75,It shouldn't have been too hard to figure out who owned the property.
1984.83-1020,3,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,3706.75,3710.119,"--I think on that suggestion, that would certainly show where it is."
1984.83-1020,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3717.225,3718.058,What happened?
1984.83-1020,3,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,3718.058,3727.681,"--against the receiver, and the receiver had to turn over the most important thing, being like the tank trucks and the pumps and the things that he was using to do the cleanup."
1984.83-1020,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3727.681,3730.783,"Now, are these facts in the record that was before the Court of Appeals?"
1984.83-1020,3,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,3730.783,3732.401,"No, that was not in the record."
1984.83-1020,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3733.401,3737.703,Should we not decide the case on the same record they did?
1984.83-1020,3,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,3737.703,3740.804,"Well, I was simply responding to the factual question that was raised."
1984.83-1020,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3740.804,3748.66,"I know, but the inference was previously given that the property would revert, and I just couldn't see... understand that."
1984.83-1020,3,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,3749.36,3760.152,"Well, it would be my understanding, what the receiver apparently intends to do is to file a motion to dissolve it, and at that point the property will go back to Mr. Kovacs."
1984.83-1020,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3762.004,3770.526,"Whatever factual information you provide, it would be more helpful to the Court if it's provided as an agreed statement of what the facts are."
1984.83-1020,3,22780,e_dennis_muchnicki,,3774.645,3775.212,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1984.83-1020,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3775.995,3777.245,"Thank you, counsel."
