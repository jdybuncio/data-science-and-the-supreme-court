1973.73-9,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.766,"We’ll hear arguments first this morning in 73-9, Commissioner of Internal Revenue against National Alfalfa Dehydrating and Milling Co."
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,16.207,19.08,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,316.816,320.283,There’s no argument about the $33--
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,320.283,323.492,"No, there’s no argument that-- well--"
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,323.492,325.423,-- of the accuracy of that figure?
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,325.423,347.307,"Well, the accuracy of that figure is only questionable from the point of view of the sporadic nature of the transactions and since it only involved but a few hundred shares of the 47,000 shares outstanding, but for purposes of this case, there’s no argument that the fair market value could have been $33."
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,649.278,651.301,What was the life of the bond?
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,651.301,653.279,The life of the bond here was 18 years.
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,653.279,655.437,Eighteen.
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,655.437,680.652,"But respondent’s argument assumes that it could have redeemed $33 for cash, but recalling that the preferred shareholders were entitled to a redemption price of $51 a share in 1957 plus the $10 of dividend arrearages, this is a $61 obligation per share to each preferred shareholder and not a $33 obligation."
1973.73-9,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,725.403,735.736,"Well, what if the respondent had sold the bonds to third parties, gotten cash from them, and used the cash to redeem the preferred stock?"
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,735.736,750.056,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that kind of analogy was one of the basis of the reasoning of the court below and, we feel that it is simply a variation, as I will point out, of respondent’s financing medium argument."
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,846.479,850.468,"But there was no obligation on the part of the corporation to redeem, is there?"
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,850.468,852.722,There’s no obligation -- there was no obligation.
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,852.722,853.897,They could’ve redeemed at $61 --
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,853.897,855.04,They could have.
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,855.04,857.116,-- under the sliding scale of that --
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,857.116,857.254,Yes.
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,857.254,857.896,-- at that particular time.
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,857.896,858.31,Yes.
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,858.31,863.141,"There’s no obligation, unlike the maturity of the bond, there’s no obligation at all."
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,863.141,863.581,Right.
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,863.581,871.569,What happened here was that each shareholder turned in a piece of property worth $33 in return for a $50 bond.
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,873.196,874.22,"Worth $33, but --"
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.22,875.266,In the market?
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,875.266,875.619,In the market.
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,875.619,876.001,In the marketplace?
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,876.001,878.454,"Right, but not worth $33 --"
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,878.454,882.367,It was worth $61 because he had no right to compel redemption?
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,882.367,892.865,"He had no right to compel redemption, but if redemption were to be affected as it was in this case, it had to be -- it could have -- the shareholders could have insisted on $61 per share."
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,892.865,894.137,If had there been redemption?
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,894.137,894.654,Had there been redemption.
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,894.654,896.242,"But there wasn’t, there was an exchange --"
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,896.242,896.511,"Well, in exchange --"
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,896.511,908.616,"-- of a piece of property worth $33, i.e. the preferred stock of the company, in return for a $50 bond bearing a 5% rate of interest in 18-year bond, is that it?"
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,908.616,909.552,"That’s correct, but --"
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,909.552,913.808,You don’t need to cut this thing and dichotomize it?
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,913.808,919.455,"No, exactly and we feel that the Tenth Circuit, having done so, that it was error to have done that."
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,919.455,920.174,You think it is error.
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,920.174,920.685,Because this was --
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,920.685,921.951,Let’s assume it was error.
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,933.231,934.01,Okay.
1973.73-9,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,983.327,986.384,It says the bookkeeping transaction?
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,986.384,996.192,"A bookkeeping transaction in the sense that it is a reshuffling of one security for another, technically called a recapitalization."
1973.73-9,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,996.192,998.754,"Well, they’re very different kinds of securities however, aren’t they?"
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,998.754,999.175,They are different.
1973.73-9,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,999.175,1001.16,One is debt and one is ownership?
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1001.16,1006.58,"They are different kinds of securities, but we don’t think that makes any difference in this case."
1973.73-9,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1036.217,1042.896,"Well, but the relationship of the parties very drastically changed, did it not, from ownership to --"
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1042.896,1044.328,From a corporate point --
1973.73-9,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1044.328,1050.019,-- from ownership to a debtor-creditor relationship?
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1050.019,1052.9,"That is from a technical corporate point of view, that’s correct."
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1302.238,1304.2,How would the value to the corporation be measured?
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1306.044,1313.924,"It’s not entirely clear, Mr. Justice Stewart, exactly what the District Court had in mind and that is one of our complaints about this test."
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1319.815,1329.321,"If they would’ve cost the corporation $61 in cash to redeem any one of these preferred shares as of the time of the conversion, would it not?"
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1329.321,1329.839,Yes.
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1329.839,1337.844,"So I would suppose that would be the “value” to the corporation, that’s what it would’ve cost the corporation to get it."
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1337.844,1338.8,On a redemption.
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1338.8,1339.031,Yes.
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1339.031,1341.3,The problem with that kind of analysis is that --
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1341.3,1345.552,Although the corporation could go out in the open market and buy it for $33.
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1345.552,1356.451,"Yes, but as -- simply, as a matter of realistic market mechanics, I would assume that if the corporation here attempted to buy up as many shares as it could on the open market --"
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1356.451,1356.782,I know.
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1356.782,1364.511,-- it’s intention to retire the whole issue would’ve become apparent and the market price would’ve been pushed up toward the redemption price.
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1364.511,1368.939,"But you don’t understand, in other words, what the court meant by the alternative."
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1368.939,1369.803,"Well, it’s not entirely --"
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1369.803,1383.34,"Either the -- it’s either the par value, assuming that par value had been the true amount paid in capital, or you say alternatively the value to the corporation and your representation is you don’t understand what that means --"
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1383.34,1400.619,"Well, I don’t think the courts quite understand what the value to the corporation means because the Court of Claims has suggested that fair market value of the preferred stock is a relevant consideration for determining the value to the corporation, but it is not a determinant consideration."
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1555.492,1558.842,"What voting rights, if any, did the holders of the preferred shares have?"
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1558.842,1564.057,"They did vote as a class and, in fact, voted on this very plan."
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1564.057,1565.796,Share-for-share with the common shareholders?
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1565.796,1570.729,"I think as -- I think, simply, it was a much smaller class."
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1572.32,1573.342,Many if you’re par view of shares.
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1573.342,1575.729,"Yes, par view of shares."
1973.73-9,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1575.729,1579.019,And no increase in voting power when there were arrearages?
1973.73-9,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1579.019,1580.727,"No, not that I’m aware of."
1973.73-9,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1585.023,1590.336,"Very well, Mr. Smith."
1973.73-9,1,19179,charles_white_hess,,1592.324,1595.687,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-9,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1717.908,1719.235,Is that stipulated?
1973.73-9,1,19179,charles_white_hess,,1719.235,1723.32,"Yes, it was a stipulated fact in the Tax Court."
1973.73-9,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1723.32,1732.243,Did they stipulate to the extent that it would’ve been possible to purchase it on a market at that figure or just that it had a value?
1973.73-9,1,19179,charles_white_hess,,1732.243,1736.477,There are two or three exhibits.
1973.73-9,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1928.068,1941.924,"Mr. Hess, I suppose if National Alfalfa had actually done that, gone out into the market and done what was supposed, you wouldn’t be here, there’d be no case?"
1973.73-9,1,19179,charles_white_hess,,1941.924,1944.714,That is true.
1973.73-9,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1944.714,1956.397,"Of course in tax law we have a lot of distinctions and cases depending on what actually was done, not on what might have been done, but you feel that what might have been done equates with what was done?"
1973.73-9,1,19179,charles_white_hess,,1956.397,1957.051,Very much so.
1973.73-9,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1992.449,1996.104,"Your Tax Court decision was reviewed by the Full Court, wasn’t it?"
1973.73-9,1,19179,charles_white_hess,,1996.104,1997.872,Yes.
1973.73-9,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1997.872,2006.247,It’s a little surprising you didn’t pick up somebody in your favor among that array of tax judges.
1973.73-9,1,19179,charles_white_hess,,2006.247,2018.982,"The -- in all of the cases that had been cited on the variant issues here, the Court of Claims and the Tax Court are the only ones that had gone this direction."
1973.73-9,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2053.694,2057.108,Of course the Tax Court’s been wrong before.
1973.73-9,1,19179,charles_white_hess,,2058.253,2059.498,"Right, I sure do."
1973.73-9,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2059.498,2072.262,"Mr. Hess, in the real world of finance, are there many debentures with the face value of $50 that you would market for $25?"
1973.73-9,1,19179,charles_white_hess,,2076.71,2080.498,I’m not sure that I have the background to tell you that.
1973.73-9,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.46,2124.045,"Then a $5 discount, say $50 or $45 or $30, has just really a very insignificant effect on the stated interest rate if $17 would have that small?"
1973.73-9,1,19179,charles_white_hess,,2124.045,2133.222,"Yes, I can’t calculate quite that fast, but I assume it would be much smaller than 1.9%."
1973.73-9,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2137.286,2145.114,But you get a very substantial discount sometimes depending upon the stated interest rate in the debenture.
1973.73-9,1,19179,charles_white_hess,,2172.941,2178.024,"The discount will vary directly with the stated interest rate, it’s one factor and --"
1973.73-9,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2178.024,2181.881,Stated interest rate and the secure --
1973.73-9,1,19179,charles_white_hess,,2181.881,2183.242,"Condition, right."
1973.73-9,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2183.242,2188.01,"-- and the strength of the issuing company, the financial strength."
1973.73-9,1,19179,charles_white_hess,,2188.01,2192.828,"And National, at this time, was not strong."
1973.73-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2615.918,2617.04,Thank you Mr. Hess.
1973.73-9,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2619.166,2621.815,Just a few points.
1973.73-9,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2657.461,2661.066,Did government put in any evidence contradicting that?
1973.73-9,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2661.066,2666.254,"No, because from our point of view the fair market value of the preferred, whatever the fair market value of the preferred stock, doesn’t --"
1973.73-9,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2666.254,2667.253,Didn’t make any difference?
1973.73-9,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2667.253,2669.31,-- Doesn’t make any difference.
1973.73-9,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2812.358,2814.815,"Mr. Smith, may I ask you a question."
1973.73-9,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2822.309,2822.557,We do not think --
1973.73-9,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2822.557,2823.427,-- in your reply brief?
1973.73-9,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2823.427,2828.206,"We have filed the reply brief, Mr. Justice Powell, which discusses this point."
1973.73-9,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2877.223,2877.97,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
