1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,24.744,28.724,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-80,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,198.464,200.183,Municipal judges?
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,200.183,208.649,"Yes Your Honor, I should say however that the grand jury's investigation involved as well an Atlantic County Court Judge."
1974.74-80,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,208.649,212.04,These Municipal Judges were down -- were in Atlantic county?
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,212.04,213.555,Yes.
1974.74-80,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,213.555,218.155,"And in New Jersey, a municipal judge can be a part-time judge, can he not --"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,218.155,218.212,Yes.
1974.74-80,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,218.212,221.398,-- and practice laws so long as he doesn't practice in criminal courts?
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,221.398,230.505,He may not practice in criminal courts or have anything to do with the penal law that includes disorderly person's violation etcetera.
1974.74-80,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,230.505,234.357,"The grand jury was setting interim, wasn't it?"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,234.357,235.163,I am sorry?
1974.74-80,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.163,235.787,Was the grand jury setting interim?
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,235.787,237.489,"Yes it was, yes it was."
1974.74-80,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,245.402,249.782,And does the subpoena power or the grand jury sitting interim can extend over to the Atlantic County?
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,249.782,250.746,"Oh yes,"
1974.74-80,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,389.475,391.142,Mr. Baime may I ask?
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,397.622,398.897,That's true.
1974.74-80,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,398.897,401.732,"Associate Justice Nathan L Jacobs, he is retired?"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,401.732,403.388,"Yes, sir."
1974.74-80,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,403.388,406.105,"Associate Justice Haydn Proctor, he is retired?"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,406.105,407.018,It's true.
1974.74-80,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,407.018,411.363,"Associate Justice Frederick W. Hall, has he retired?"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,411.363,412.817,He has retired.
1974.74-80,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,419.394,426.27,"And the others are Justice Worall F. Mountain and Justice Mark A. Sullivan, they are still in that --"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,426.27,429.392,They presently serve in their official capacities in the state of New Jersey.
1974.74-80,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,429.392,432.19,"Well, do those changes bear on the issue?"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,432.19,446.097,"As we note in our brief, and I think it's made clear by the decision in Spomer against Littleton, the case with respect to seven or perhaps six, the named defendants truly is moot."
1974.74-80,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,482.478,489.784,"Well, you understand that Judge Helfant's whole case turns on that conference in the Supreme Court conference room?"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,489.784,490.731,Yes.
1974.74-80,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,505.92,515.068,You suggested earlier that the allegations of bad-faith and harassment were against the prosecutorial officials?
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,515.068,517.537,That is the way we understand the respondent's complaint.
1974.74-80,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,517.537,525.033,"Well, that's more of than just harassment and consequence of this meeting with the Supreme Court, is it?"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,525.033,532.4,"Yes, but I should point out that in New Jersey, not only has the composition of the Supreme Court change but we have a new Attorney General as well."
1974.74-80,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,607.103,618.888,"(Inaudible) Sitting Justices, Justices Mountain and Sullivan, they could be replaced by Superior Court judges as a matter of --"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,618.888,623.147,"Yes, Your Honor, we have pointed that in our -- out in our brief as well."
1974.74-80,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,647.558,650.71,Conferences of this kind is that -- are they unusual?
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,650.71,651.805,No they are not unusual.
1974.74-80,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,657.345,660.613,"(Inaudible) New Jersey Supreme Court, we had such conference?"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,660.613,665.925,I believe Chief Justice Vanderbilt was chief justice at that time and that's true.
1974.74-80,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,712.611,718.486,"Mr. Baime, when did the alleged false swearing occur?"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,718.486,722.448,The false swearing occurred in the grand jury room and it was --
1974.74-80,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,722.448,725.12,The first grand jury hearing?
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,725.12,727.2,"I am sorry, I don't understand --"
1974.74-80,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,727.2,729.044,"There were two grand jury hearings, weren't they?"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,729.044,734.685,"Yes and the first grand jury hearing in October 18, 1972, the respondent refused to testify."
1974.74-80,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,757.25,758.596,That was at the second hearing --
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,758.596,770.584,Yes and with regard to that we would point out that the coercion issue is again wholly irreverent to the criminal proceedings pending against the respondent.
1974.74-80,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,994.806,1013.309,"Mr. Baime, you earlier referred that the Third Circuit as having provided for a declaratory judgment but they also preliminarily enjoined the prosecution of the state proceedings pending that determination, didn't they?"
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,1013.309,1014.446,That's true.
1974.74-80,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1063.447,1070.354,But why do we need to wrestle with the refinements of the declaratory judgment aspect of it.
1974.74-80,0,20610,david_s_baime,,1075.668,1075.995,That's true.
1974.74-80,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1193.703,1196.083,Thank you Mr. Baime.
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1197.708,1201.125,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1352.36,1357.671,As I understand that they told him that he could go before the grand jury and plead the Fifth Amendment?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1357.671,1360.231,He did and went before the grand jury.
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1360.231,1364.012,"Is all of this, he just objected to going into the door?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1364.012,1366.068,He objected to testifying before the grand jury.
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1366.068,1367.994,For going in the room?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1367.994,1368.98,Yes Sir.
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1368.98,1372.699,"And you went all the way up to Supreme Court, to find out whether he had to go in the room or not?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1372.699,1377.065,"Yes, and he found that he had to go in the room Mr. Justice and at --"
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1377.065,1385.184,"But he could, once he got there, have refused to say a single word, could he not, except to claim the Fifth Amendment?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1385.184,1387.526,"Yes, and that's exactly what he did Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.74-80,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1473.154,1479.737,"When you say he appeared before the court, the fact is he appeared before the members of the court in a private room?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1479.737,1489.319,"That's correct Your Honor, in their private chamber and there is one other thing that I should state at this time, and I have heard it where the Attorney General was arguing this case with me."
1974.74-80,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1523.2,1529.63,"They were filling in not specifically for the purposes of this interview, but were generally there filing in just --"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1529.63,1531.823,"Yes, sir, they were there in connection with their regular duties."
1974.74-80,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1531.823,1533.785,The members of the Court for the Court's regular duties?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1533.785,1535.255,"Yes sir,yes sure."
1974.74-80,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1539.237,1545.36,So how many judges or temporary judges of the Supreme Court were in the room when --?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1545.36,1547.47,"There were one short, there were six."
1974.74-80,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1553.725,1555.733,About 10 o'clock in the morning on the --
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1555.733,1567.065,"He got there about 10 minutes of 10, his meeting before the Grand Jury was at 10 o'clock and when he said to the Administrative Director who called him, I have to be before the State Grand Jury at 10 o'clock, he said we know all about it."
1974.74-80,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1580.131,1582.709,"I'm still confused, as I think Justice Stewart was."
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1584.921,1587.298,"Now, this was the day 5, this was Wednesday."
1974.74-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1614.286,1621.554,Was it that strike it was an unreasonable inquiry under these circumstances on the part of the Justices of the Supreme Court of New Jersey?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1621.554,1622.695,It certainly does Your Honor.
1974.74-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1628.98,1644.542,"You say that a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New Jersey charged with disciplinary and administrative response goes for entire court system, can't ask a judge who has claimed the Fifth Amendment whether he thinks it's consisted with his judicial role?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1644.542,1665.151,"There is a time and place for that inquiry to be made and it's certainly in my opinion it's not 10 minutes before you're about to go before a Grand Jury, where you're accompanied by a counsel, and where there are rules, and there is a due process established for the disciplining of courts, which calls for notice, which calls for a hearing, which calls for representation by counsel."
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1703.093,1704.598,(Voice Overlap) what you said.
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1708.91,1711.744,"He knew what three of them had, they were convicts --"
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1711.744,1718.681,I thought you said a minute ago that the Supreme Court shouldn't have known what went on in the Grand Jury?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1718.681,1720.434,"They should not have, they should not have."
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1720.434,1722.994,Then why should he know if the Supreme Court shouldn't know?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1722.994,1729.9,"Well, he was told by a representative of New Jersey State police, that's what appears that he shouldn't have been told, but he was and that's part of the --"
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1729.9,1734.921,But it's evident that the Grand Jury minutes of New Jersey aren't so secret?[Laughter]
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1734.921,1735.156,"Well, that--"
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1735.156,1737.087,People just walk in around told him that?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1737.087,1750.19,"That's one of the points we're making here, that there was a complete collapse of due process that the Attorney General should have never turned those Grand Jury minutes over to the Chief Justice, and what's more, he should have never told his detectives what was going on in that Grand Jury."
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1750.19,1751.227,He shouldn't have told?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1751.227,1755.751,"No, the Attorney General who was conducting the investigation Mr. Justice, was obliviously the source of the leak."
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1755.751,1757.361,(Inaudible)
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1757.361,1758.262,Pardon?
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1758.262,1760.008,(Inaudible)
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1760.008,1762.346,"He certainly shouldn't, he certainly shouldn't."
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.346,1765.033,Did I misunderstand that you?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1773.311,1778.987,"In New Jersey you're not allowed to bring your attorney into a Grand Jury, you can have him standing outside and you can consult with him."
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1778.987,1780.147,"The general, the traditional pattern?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1780.147,1780.953,Yes.
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1785.303,1799.31,"But, when you suggested that he did not know why he was being called to conference with the members of the Supreme Court, does your pleading allege or your pleadings allege that he did not know?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1799.31,1802.255,"Absolutely, absolutely, it's in the verified complaint."
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1802.255,1805.408,Is that a credible allegation?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1805.408,1806.604,"Well, he asked --"
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1806.604,1810.369,As a judge that he did not know what he was being called there for?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1810.369,1817.483,"Well, in view of what happened I think it's a very credible situation because they did not do what you would think they would do."
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1935.089,1937.372,"These facts are covered in affidavits, are they?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1937.372,1948.498,"Yes sir, that's the affidavit of Samuel Moore that is in the appendix and I might say that the only affidavits in this case are ours, and every fact that I have alluded to is in the appendix and is supported by affidavit."
1974.74-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1948.498,1953.263,Is your fundamental claim that he was coerced in testifying and waving as Fifth Amendment?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1953.263,1956.726,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1974.74-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1956.726,1968.331,"He said that in his affidavit, “I cannot say that the Supreme Court in anyway directed me to testify, nor did they in anyway indicate to me what the consequences would be if I continue to stand by the Fifth Amendment.”"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1968.331,1969.578,"Yes, but there the very next sentence --"
1974.74-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1969.578,1971.896,"Now, where did the question come from?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1971.896,1978.09,"Well, if you follow that through the very next sentence is “but I was under the impression that if I didn't, something would be done to me,” that's a --"
1974.74-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.09,1980.236,"Well, that was under his impression –- that was his impression?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,1980.236,1983.956,"Yes, well the fact, let's look at the facts."
1974.74-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.787,2017.138,"Well, another question is coercion -- is coerced testimony a defense to a false swearing count?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2017.138,2023.222,"This again, I certainly think it is, and using the cases that were cited by my opponent, United States versus Knox."
1974.74-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.222,2025.002,Is it in New Jersey?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2025.002,2028.24,"In New Jersey, that question is not completely resolved."
1974.74-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2028.24,2029.816,"Well, it is in the Federal system."
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2030.451,2038.518,"I believe it is, because in the case of United States versus Knox, there was a language that duress is a traditional defense to our Criminal Act."

1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2095.597,2113.193,"Because traditionally and I cite the case United States versus McCord, and there are other cases that where there was a prosecutorial misconduct, the remedy was not to go through the trial, but a dismissal of the indictment and where there is a judicial misconduct and after all the standard of conduct of a Supreme Court is the highest possible standard."
1974.74-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2113.193,2118.539,(Inaudible)
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2118.539,2124.223,"Well, the New Jersey system is an integrated system, there is absolute power --"
1974.74-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.223,2127.716,(Inaudible)
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2127.716,2132.917,"No, but the rise of appeal would go through the Supreme Court."
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2145.136,2149.738,Are there not other judges that could be substituted if he took that route?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2149.738,2156.098,"We could, you know, we could go over a full resurrection or re-manufacture of the court system in the State of New Jersey."
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2156.098,2159.476,"Well, I would like an answer to that question?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2159.476,2164.583,"The answer I don't think -- I think is no, because I liken it to the conflict of interest cases."
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2164.583,2170.393,You mean that no other judge would be available to sit in place by special designation?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2170.393,2183.955,"There would be many judges who would be able to be replaced by the Chief Justice to sit but whether the -- that in anyway changes his remedy or the autocracy of his remedy, I don't think it would and I say because of this."
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2203.362,2206.768,You are saying then they can't ever try him in the State of New Jersey?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2206.768,2212.355,"Absolutely Sir, I don't think it is humanly possible for this man to get a fair trail in the State of New Jersey."
1974.74-80,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2238.182,2241.51,(Inaudible) by the new Chief Justice (Inaudible).
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2241.51,2244.738,"Yes, the Chief Justice has gone, but the influence lingers."
1974.74-80,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2244.738,2253.102,"Well, apparently by everyone who participated in that conference except Justice Sullivan who is gone."
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2253.102,2259.098,"No, Justice Sullivan is still there, Justice Mountain is still there, Judge Conford is still sitting on the appellate division."
1974.74-80,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2259.098,2263.276,All of them under New Jersey system can be replaced by other judges?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2263.276,2273.858,"They can be replaced, but I don't think due process contemplates that if you search the four corners of a state, you can finally find somebody that can hear it."
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.205,2284.916,Suppose the Court of New Jersey changes you still couldn't try him?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2284.916,2287.221,"No Sir, because I think that what happen --"
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2287.221,2291.273,"Now, what theory do you possibly have there on?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2291.273,2302.419,"Because, again the influence lingers, the personnel may change but this is an action done by the Court and you are asking a trial judge --"
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2302.419,2306.951,"Did you say it was done by the Court, I thought it was done in a private room?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2306.951,2308.08,It was done by the Court in a private room.
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2308.08,2310.421,"Well, is there any record of it?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2310.421,2311.159,There is no record of it.
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2311.159,2313.379,"Well, then it is not called action."
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2315.666,2315.977,It is done by --
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2315.977,2320.93,"And those individual people have gone, but the memory lingers on?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2320.93,2323.731,"That's correct, that's correct Your Honor."
1974.74-80,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2323.731,2333.997,And the memory (Inaudible)
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2333.997,2337.965,"Well, I am not concerned with them with all due candor."
1974.74-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2446.038,2451.47,"Well, they didn't -- they meanwhile have joined the prosecution by the state?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2451.47,2452.845,Yes.
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2582.957,2599.959,"Isn't it pretty clear that body of man is not ever going to hear any appeal on this -- I don't know on your client, through the New Jersey State system isn't that clear that there would be substitute judges?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2599.959,2600.511,I don't know.
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2604.471,2607.785,Does the system provides for that part?
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2607.785,2613.296,"It provides for it, but it did not occur up to now as I say we have made two appeals."
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2613.296,2621.692,"You have taken a number of steps that have retarded the state proceedings, have you not quite successfully?"
1974.74-80,1,36448,marvin_d_perskie,,2621.692,2632.129,"Well, the all the retardation of the criminal proceeding has been caused by the state since we have gotten the first effective order on our behalf in the Circuit Court of the Appeals."
1974.74-80,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2723.395,2724.129,Mr. Baime.
1974.74-80,2,20610,david_s_baime,,2727.067,2732.358,I would like to answer at least one question that was propounded.
1974.74-80,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2830.129,2830.87,Thank you gentlemen.
