1998.97-1868,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.588,"We'll hear argument next in No. 97-1868, UNUM Life Insurance Company of America versus John Ward."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,47.721,52.145,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1868,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.002,159.788,"Well, you do agree that, even under ERISA, a State law that satisfies McCarran-Ferguson Act requirements is not preempted?"
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,161.659,163.541,We agree there is a savings clause.
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,204.28,223.221,"Not just the broad general purpose of ERISA, because if you did that wouldn't you have to call every one of them in favor of the beneficiary, because the purpose of ERISA was to protect people's insurance, workers' insurance, right?"
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,229.575,232.006,ERISA made a number of balances.
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,261.588,266.001,"Well, what does the savings clause save?"
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,288.346,292.149,"We agree with that, Your Honor, and we're not saying that you can do away with the savings clause."
1998.97-1868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.965,364.924,Why couldn't the Federal scheme adopt the same rule as California?
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,387.099,392.323,That would... that would eliminate one of the problems with what the Ninth Circuit has done.
1998.97-1868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.323,392.623,The one you just talked on.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,392.623,407.436,"Yes, because now you would be doing what Congress said for the courts to do and what you told the courts to do, which is in a 502(a) action apply the statute and as necessary develop a uniform body of Federal common law."
1998.97-1868,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,478.903,480.353,May I interrupt just for one question.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,494.732,502.178,"I do not believe the three words ""written plan instrument"" appear in a row."
1998.97-1868,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,506.591,509.764,So it's referring to the words.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,541.494,549.571,"And we're now addressing, if I understand your question correctly, not to 301, 502 field preemption that we talked about in the beginning."
1998.97-1868,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,549.571,549.701,Right.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,549.922,550.641,Now we're on to the written plan.
1998.97-1868,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,550.641,550.992,Yes.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,550.992,564.192,"And I think this Court in Curtiss Wright captured it this way, that reliance on the face of the written plan document... those were this Court's words... is one of ERISA's core functional requirements."
1998.97-1868,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,564.192,572.966,"If ERISA uses the word ""document"", that's... even without any other explication from us, that's pretty strong language for your position."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,572.966,573.527,"Yes, it is."
1998.97-1868,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,586.876,587.156,Okay.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,635.148,646.217,"The example you pose has not just the preemption problem, but, because you pick notice prejudice, it runs head-on into some other provisions of ERISA."
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,665.799,668.43,My question is this very specific one.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,668.43,668.76,--Yes.
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,671.041,674.064,You must give people two years to put in a proof of claim.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,674.064,701.482,"I do not think that a State could do that with the specific one, because in that situation, even though you would have a facial illegality of the policy if the underlying rule were saved, such as for example the rule in Metropolitan-Massachusetts, but here the underlying rule is a dictate to Federal courts as to how they must enforce or interpret language in the plan, and that--"
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,701.482,703.465,"No, it isn't how they interpret it."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,736.512,742.215,"--All right, if the State law says you have to have this notice provision in your contract and the policy does not--"
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,742.215,742.636,Not in your contract.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,747.378,757.984,"--Well, then, then if the State law doesn't say that it's improper to have a contract without this language, it simply says that whatever your language we're going to deem it to be this--"
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,757.984,760.437,It doesn't say anything about deem or whatever your language.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,769.404,773.997,"--Well, then the policy would not comply with the mandatory State insurance statute."
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,787.728,794.911,"Then you're saying that California courts, because it's a court-made rule that we're dealing with, notice and prejudice, they just used the wrong words."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,816.325,818.796,--That is what the California rule essentially says.
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,818.796,819.568,"Yes, that's the rule."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,826.683,831.586,"In effect, that's what the California common law rule does."
1998.97-1868,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,836.41,838.462,"Well, would the answer be different if it did?"
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,840.294,844.848,"Well, the answer would... the answer to this particular question, we would get over one hump."
1998.97-1868,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,848.621,850.592,"Well, let's make it even easier than that."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,861.0,861.107,That's right.
1998.97-1868,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,861.107,864.212,The commissioner says: I won't approve the policy.
1998.97-1868,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,886.545,904.897,"In that... we're not conceding that, because in that circumstance what California would be doing is directing its attention not to the 502 issue, but to the other provisions in ERISA which say and delegate to the Secretary the authority to promulgate regulations on claims administration matters."
1998.97-1868,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,916.024,916.175,I see your argument.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,916.175,920.406,"--So I'm off to a different argument here, which is why that statute would not work."
1998.97-1868,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,922.86,927.613,"But that's ultimately, I suppose, your answer to Justice Cinsburg's question, too, then."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,943.503,947.464,"--Well, I'm saying two things, yes, and perhaps you're saying it better than I am."
1998.97-1868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,947.464,948.336,I'm sure I'm not.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,948.336,954.54,"I think how the State does it does make a difference, and I can come back to it if you like."
1998.97-1868,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,964.295,972.613,"Well, supposing that a State wanted to impose on your client this requirement of notice and prejudice in submitting claims."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,974.626,982.88,"Well, practically it certainly could because any State bar of that sort insurance companies will comply with."
1998.97-1868,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,982.88,985.193,"Well, but that's not an answer in a court."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,985.193,995.459,"And as a legal matter, I do not think a court can dictate... a State can dictate the claims administration procedures under an ERISA plan."
1998.97-1868,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,996.841,1008.599,"So what is your answer to my question, that there is no way a State can legally require the sort of notice and prejudice with respect to claims that California has here?"
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1008.599,1012.871,"In an ERISA plan, as a matter of imposing State law, that's correct."
1998.97-1868,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1012.871,1017.825,So that your case... there's a lot of talk in the briefs about this being a common law rule.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1026.4,1027.589,"No, it's not, Justice Stevens."
1998.97-1868,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1027.589,1029.232,I thought you told the Chief it was.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1029.232,1035.675,It is not irrelevant because the fact that it was a common law rule I think means that this isn't even that case.
1998.97-1868,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1035.675,1038.949,"Yes, but would produce the same result in your view--"
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1038.949,1039.089,Yes.
1998.97-1868,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.089,1043.453,"--whether it were a common law rule, a statute, or a regulation by an insurance commissioner?"
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1043.453,1047.936,"Yes, we would get to the same result, for a different reason, for a reason that is also applicable here."
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1056.202,1072.193,"I don't understand that because what business is it of the Federal statute what... how a State makes its law, whether the State makes its law through its courts, through its administrative agencies, through its legislature."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1099.222,1106.305,"ERISA defines the term ""laws"" to include all laws on that point."
1998.97-1868,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1117.345,1126.94,"That's back to Swift against Tyson, you know, where a statute had one level for diversity jurisdiction, but that a common law didn't."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1133.265,1145.303,"Well, I don't quite see the analogy, because the issue here is, given that Congress said a law which regulates insurance, did it have in mind common laws of this type, particularly--"
1998.97-1868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1145.303,1146.234,General common laws.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1174.483,1175.795,--That's correct.
1998.97-1868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.795,1194.034,"You would say that that fails for two reasons, both because it impinges upon the administration of the scheme which is given to the Secretary and, secondly, because it does not regulate insurance."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1194.034,1194.335,That's correct.
1998.97-1868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1194.335,1195.176,It's a general statute.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1195.176,1195.737,That's correct.
1998.97-1868,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.737,1197.858,What's special about this?
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1224.469,1224.886,That is the rule.
1998.97-1868,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1224.886,1227.18,"And it only applies to insurance companies, says the SG."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1229.043,1231.364,"Well, by name it only applies to insurance companies."
1998.97-1868,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1231.364,1234.274,And they've found no case in their research that says it applies to anything else.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1234.274,1235.306,That's not what they've said.
1998.97-1868,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1235.306,1237.768,"Well, what I have them as saying is:"
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1245.983,1246.133,Exactly.
1998.97-1868,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1246.133,1247.054,"--""# outside the""... oh, ""as such""?"
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1247.054,1259.022,"Yes, and the reason they say VACLI, the mechanic' lien case, a notice to a conservatee case, a real estate case."
1998.97-1868,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1259.022,1259.633,"Okay, okay."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1306.105,1320.263,"Well, what's special is because it purports to dictate the enforcement and interpretation of claims administration procedures, and that is the one area in particular that Congress meant to preempt the field entirely on."
1998.97-1868,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1320.263,1342.98,"Well, why is it more of a procedure, a claims administration procedure, to say, insurance company, your contract allows you to enforce that notice requirement only when there is prejudice, than to say, insurance company, that contract means you still have to pay unless it's written in plain English, unless it has four-point type, unless?"
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1344.951,1355.876,Because we are in a 502(a) action and Congress said it intended that those actions would be exclusively Federal actions modeled on 301.
1998.97-1868,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1358.59,1360.671,"Well, this is a 502 action."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1369.118,1370.4,--If you're talking about a rule--
1998.97-1868,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1370.4,1373.722,They did bring it under 520.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1373.722,1393.657,"--That's correct, but the rationale that this court adopted for finding that a 502(a) action is an exclusive remedy... and the State law might have lots of remedies that would be fully applicable in a State court; you can't bring them, you can't pursue them, you can't get those damages here... the rationale was Congress' instruction that this be modeled after 301."
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1393.657,1394.826,But this isn't a remedy.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1434.393,1447.372,In Metropolitan Life the Court enforced an injunction against Metropolitan violating a State law that required that certain benefits with respect to which ERISA was silent be included in policies.
1998.97-1868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.948,1484.528,What State law would govern?
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1495.167,1497.238,"--Well, you would first need to do a choice of law analysis."
1998.97-1868,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1524.657,1528.861,"And they can both apply to the same plan, because... because the claimants are in different States."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1528.861,1529.35,"That's correct, that's correct."
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1529.35,1539.077,301 doesn't have a savings clause and that's... what you're trying to say is the savings clause cannot operate at all when it comes to plan administration?
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1539.077,1548.474,"If you say that Congress meant that we would have 301 here, but with a savings clause, that's the equivalent of saying we don't have 301, because everything in ERISA--"
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1548.474,1549.436,"Yes, but we do have it."
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1551.465,1555.808,"--Yes, everything in ERISA preempts but for that savings clause anyhow."
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1575.322,1579.613,I don't see anything in 502 that refers to 301.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1579.613,1582.675,Congress specifically said that it intended 502(a)--
1998.97-1868,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1582.675,1583.216,Where did it say that?
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1583.216,1585.567,"--In the committee, the committee report."
1998.97-1868,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1585.567,1587.911,Let's talk about the statute.
1998.97-1868,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1587.911,1590.461,"Well, that's what this Court said in Pilot Life as well."
1998.97-1868,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1598.727,1599.468,"Very well, Mr. Kayatta."
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1601.819,1609.205,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1868,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1661.26,1665.123,"So the argument based on, in effect, on the word ""document"" is essentially a circular argument?"
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1665.123,1674.94,"Yes, because the statute itself says only insofar as it's consistent with the subchapter, which itself incorporates State law."
1998.97-1868,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1706.542,1714.279,Could the Secretary adopt regulations like the notice prejudice rule and then occupy the field?

1998.97-1868,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1766.395,1769.677,"Do other States have similar notice prejudice rules, to your knowledge?"
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1769.677,1775.383,"According to the amicus brief filed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, 26 States have similar--"
1998.97-1868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1775.383,1777.144,"What about this ""as such""?"
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1788.951,1789.231,--Right.
1998.97-1868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1789.251,1797.378,"And then Mr. Kayatta said, well, you said we haven't found a case in California that applies the rule ""as such""."
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1797.378,1808.387,"--There are... there are parallel principles of general contract law that aren't precisely the same, but that will relieve a party to a contract of a default."
1998.97-1868,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1808.387,1819.566,"Well, then he says, well, once you say that, his point is that, well, this is just like, you know, a rule that says offer is good on acceptance or something."
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1828.932,1834.087,"Well, but the important point, though, is that from the outset... and this is explained at some length in respondent's brief."
1998.97-1868,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1853.431,1856.452,"It's not just a branch, then, of the condition subsequent law?"
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1856.452,1857.133,"Right, no."
1998.97-1868,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1864.121,1866.983,And we have a court of appeals holding to that effect.
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1866.983,1868.814,"Yes, we have a court of appeals holding to that effect."
1998.97-1868,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1868.814,1869.855,Interpreting State law.
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1869.855,1870.486,"Right, and this Court--"
1998.97-1868,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1870.486,1871.645,Which we presume is correct.
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1871.645,1880.171,"--That's correct, and the District of Columbia Circuit also interpreted specifically the California notice prejudice rule as being an insurance-specific rule."
1998.97-1868,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1922.081,1932.359,"Mr. Kneedler, applying the same principles, do you think that California's Elfstrom rule is one that applies general agency principles or is insurance-specific?"
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1932.359,1938.453,"We believe that that's a general agency principle, and in fact the respondent doesn't try to defend it on any other ground, nor did the court of appeals."
1998.97-1868,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1938.453,1945.666,Are you going to address whether this notice prejudice rule is something regulating the business of insurance?
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1945.666,1947.576,"Yes, I would like to address that."
1998.97-1868,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.286,2008.611,It doesn't alter the allocation of risks insured against at all.
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2020.888,2022.69,But we do not believe that that is essential.
1998.97-1868,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2131.775,2133.725,What is the rule?
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2144.393,2150.968,"The Ninth Circuit seemed to treat it more as a factual question under general agency law, and that's why we believe it is not... that it is not saved."
1998.97-1868,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2154.929,2156.942,--Do you know which it is in California?
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2161.337,2171.772,"I actually think it's a combination of the two, because it depends on the predicate fact that the employer has actually assumed some responsibilities for administering the contract."
1998.97-1868,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.772,2175.355,"Well, if we're going to believe the Ninth Circuit for one thing, why don't we believe them for the other one?"
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2175.355,2176.667,"Well, the Ninth Circuit did not say that it was--"
1998.97-1868,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.667,2178.049,"Well, you say they treated it that way."
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2181.462,2181.973,--Well--
1998.97-1868,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2181.973,2184.595,"I mean, I think we have to assume that they applied the State law properly."
1998.97-1868,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2184.595,2188.768,"--For these purposes, we don't think it matters whether it's law or fact."
1998.97-1868,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2192.292,2193.832,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2196.225,2202.848,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1998.97-1868,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2242.917,2246.558,Is that a question of coverage or a condition for the payment of benefits?
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2259.586,2268.372,"Justice Souter, I believe it is fair because in its effect it determines whether or not the coverage is available to the claimant in this situation, and the State has changed it."
1998.97-1868,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.7,2281.923,"Well, it alters the terms, but it doesn't necessarily alter the coverage."
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2287.747,2289.467,"Well, there's no doubt that Mr. Ward--"
1998.97-1868,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2289.467,2293.52,"Where you have to mail your notice, is that... is that a coverage provision?"
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2293.52,2296.371,"--No, I wouldn't say that's a coverage provision."
1998.97-1868,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2312.691,2318.776,They could say the same thing about the wrong address: You sent your thing to the wrong address and therefore you're not covered.
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2320.278,2327.214,"--I don't know that... the word ""coverage"" is not what Congress put in the savings clause."
1998.97-1868,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2381.723,2385.116,Doesn't that... doesn't that change the scope of the insurance company's risk?
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2392.671,2398.334,"The insurance... the risk to the insured is the same, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-1868,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.907,2416.11,"Well, but the insurance company's risk is considerably changed."
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2416.11,2424.447,"--My understanding is that the risk, the transfer of risk, goes to what the insured must no longer be responsible for."
1998.97-1868,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2424.447,2427.5,"No, I think it goes to the allocation of risk between the two."
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2435.825,2457.259,"I think that's right, and in the Fabe decision the Court's position was that a statute, an Ohio preference for insureds who have the misfortune of having their insurance company go into receivership, was sufficiently addressed to the spreading of risk because it assured that the policy would be performed in circumstances where it otherwise might not be performed."
1998.97-1868,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2461.072,2499.497,"He would like to describe it, I take it, as simply a branch of contract law, where courts have, with contracts of adhesion for example, tried to make certain that defendants can't avoid their bargain through what courts have considered a number of technicalities, and therefore because this is simply a branch of that broader law and really no different from that broader law, and because it's so carefully, it's so closely bound up in when a judge will permit a plaintiff to... a defendant to assert a certain kind of claim, it's like court administration."
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2507.394,2523.482,"I want to be very careful in responding to your question, Justice Breyer, not getting hung up in ""as such"", because the notice prejudice rule is not just a branch or an application of a broadly applied principle."
1998.97-1868,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.797,2624.872,"Suppose, suppose the Secretary decided that this just makes the administration of plans impossible, that every plan administrator has to figure out what the law is in 50 different States and go through the same job of determining whether it is narrowly applied to insurance or it's a general law and so forth, and he says: We're going to adopt a rule that'll apply to all."
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2628.222,2638.25,"So as I understand your question, would it be valid if the Secretary under its authority under section 503 adopted a rule, and would that preempt the field?"
1998.97-1868,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.25,2638.841,Yeah.
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2644.344,2646.056,That would... I think that's correct.
1998.97-1868,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.158,2649.94,"Of course, the government doesn't like that."
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2658.548,2671.916,--The Secretary's power is obviously delimited by the terms of what Congress gave the Secretary in ERISA and what Congress... part of what the Secretary has to work with is the fact that laws that regulate insurance are saved.
1998.97-1868,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2671.916,2686.397,"But I mean, you know, that doesn't help your case a whole lot, because that means that there could be all sorts of different rules in different States pertaining to the administration of insurance plans, and they would all be applicable."
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2686.397,2687.208,Well--
1998.97-1868,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2687.208,2691.68,And it could make... it's clear that Congress wanted administration of these plans to be simple.
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2691.68,2701.436,--I suppose that when the rule... there are rules of administration and rules that go directly to whether the claim's going to be paid.
1998.97-1868,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2878.193,2885.798,Are you going to address the Elfstrom rule?
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2885.798,2904.06,"I have very little to add to the Elfstrom rule than what we've already said in the briefs, and so I would ask the Court to simply resolve the case by reaffirming what it said in Metropolitan Life, which is if a State law regulates insurance it's saved, and that the Court will not read limitations--"
1998.97-1868,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2904.06,2908.403,I didn't know that you were making that particular argument.
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2921.302,2923.513,"--That's right, that was the Ninth Circuit's view."
1998.97-1868,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2923.513,2925.195,--The Ninth Circuit didn't say anything about the savings clause.
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2925.195,2925.656,"No, Your Honor."
1998.97-1868,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2933.83,2935.252,"But you just said something about savings, and that wasn't--"
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2935.252,2938.955,"I was trying to wind up and sit down, Your Honor."
1998.97-1868,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2939.755,2947.979,"--But the Council of State Governments did say something about savings in Elfstrom, and your brief doesn't pick that up."
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2950.924,2956.938,I don't... I didn't understand the government's position to be that the Elfstrom rule was a rule that regulated insurance.
1998.97-1868,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2956.938,2959.332,"No, I'm not talking about the SG."
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2963.513,2963.663,Yes.
1998.97-1868,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2964.474,2969.587,And they said they think that this is a law that regulates insurance and therefore it's saved.
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,2969.587,2988.54,"Justice Ginsburg, we didn't make that argument because we were troubled by the fact that what the Ninth Circuit appeared to apply were generally applicable rules, and so it looked to us maybe too much like the situation in Pilot Life, where the Court said that a rule that was generally applicable in all cases wouldn't be specifically directed at insurance."
1998.97-1868,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2989.391,2999.189,"But you did make the argument that the Ninth Circuit really didn't apply Elfstrom, which I find very difficult to follow in view of the language of the Ninth Circuit."
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,3001.69,3002.872,"It was difficult, Your Honor."
1998.97-1868,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3021.723,3024.885,To see if it had assumed the duties.
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,3024.885,3048.68,"Well, another clue to what we view as the way the Ninth Circuit read the Elfstrom rule was the discussion of the Oregon case where the Ninth Circuit sort of harmonizes Elfstrom and all other rules that are... might initially seem at odds with each other, and comes out saying that Elfstrom is one end of a continuum and there are other cases on the other end of the continuum."
1998.97-1868,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3075.621,3081.985,Is it your view that if you win on the notice prejudice rule we don't have to fuss with the Elfstrom rule?
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,3081.985,3082.466,That is our view.
1998.97-1868,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3082.466,3085.027,"That's the heart of your argument, if I got the message."
1998.97-1868,2,30128,jeffrey_l_ehrlich,,3085.027,3085.658,"That is the heart of our argument, yes."
1998.97-1868,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3086.76,3088.49,And that's a good time to sit down.
1998.97-1868,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3088.49,3092.384,"Thank you, Mr. Ehrlich."
1998.97-1868,3,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,3095.546,3096.297,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.97-1868,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3140.947,3142.459,So the question isn't the content of the State law.
1998.97-1868,3,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,3148.312,3148.813,--That's correct.
1998.97-1868,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3148.813,3149.993,Which we can re-examine de novo.
1998.97-1868,3,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,3149.993,3150.314,That's correct.
1998.97-1868,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3183.336,3206.4,"But that would... I know you said this is not like McFadden, but there's lots of things that regulate insurance, like false and deceptive selling techniques and representations in policies, that are in insurance codes of fair practices, and they surely have common law derivation just like here."
1998.97-1868,3,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,3212.366,3218.859,I agree you have to... there is a spectrum here and we need to draw a line someplace.
1998.97-1868,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3244.026,3244.657,"Well, now you're shifting to something else."
1998.97-1868,3,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,3254.315,3259.667,"That would then lead us, if we follow that to its end, that leads us to a conclusion that there is no limit to this definition."
1998.97-1868,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3259.667,3271.556,"What you're saying is that half of what's in an insurance code doesn't count because it's derived from the common law, but applied to, specifically to the insurance industry."
1998.97-1868,3,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,3271.556,3275.86,I'm saying that I don't think the rule could be at either end of the spectrum.
1998.97-1868,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3284.046,3286.617,"Your time has expired, Mr. Kayatta."
