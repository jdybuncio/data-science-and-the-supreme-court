1997.96-1654,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,17.369,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 96-1654, Frank Muscarello v. United States, and Number 96-8837, Donald E. Cleveland and Enrique GraySantana v. United States."
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,18.43,24.646,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1654,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,103.707,113.486,"Do any of those other provisions speak of transport in relation to a crime of violence, or a drug crime, or is it just transport in the abstract?"
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,113.486,119.312,"Well, there are a whole variety of provisions, Justice Souter."
1997.96-1654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,135.665,137.242,"For an unlawful purpose, you say?"
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,137.242,138.819,"No, it does not use that--"
1997.96-1654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.819,139.256,For a lawful purpose.
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,143.099,150.112,"--Not... transporting, shipping or receiving for any lawful purpose from where he may legally possess."
1997.96-1654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.112,151.393,But it--
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,152.393,154.471,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,154.471,156.157,I didn't realize we'd gone that far yet.
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,173.898,176.758,"Not in that precise terminology, that's correct."
1997.96-1654,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,176.758,187.472,"So that to read it as the Government would read it I think probably would not, therefore, just duplicate, in effect, all of the other prohibitions on transportation, correct?"
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,187.472,189.003,"Well, we think that it would."
1997.96-1654,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,190.456,191.924,Maybe I'm not getting my point across.
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,209.198,218.256,"--No, I understand, but the during and in relation to is a separate component, but in terms of the meaning of the word carry we think that it is instructive to look at the other statutes."
1997.96-1654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.256,220.49,--I still don't think you're understanding Justice Souter's point.
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,243.56,244.668,"Oh, I agree with that point, Your Honor."
1997.96-1654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.668,245.137,Okay.
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,249.994,250.711,"No, there are not."
1997.96-1654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,250.711,257.709,I can't imagine that there's none that says it's a crime to transport a firearm for an unlawful purpose--
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,257.709,259.74,There's no--
1997.96-1654,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,259.74,261.926,--from a statute that makes it a crime to carry it for a lawful purpose.
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,261.926,264.066,"--There's no statute precisely like that, Your Honor."
1997.96-1654,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,264.941,271.251,"With reference to carry, the definition of firearm includes a missile, a rocket launcher--"
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,271.251,272.533,Yes.
1997.96-1654,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,273.938,276.734,--Do you have to carry the rocket launcher in your vest pocket?
1997.96-1654,0,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,276.734,279.247,"--No, and that is correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1654,1,37347,norman_s_zalkind,,696.595,701.296,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1654,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,733.235,746.152,"Well, in days gone by if some rider had a gun in the scabbard on his saddle, as used to be the day when I lived on a ranch, is that person carrying a weapon?"
1997.96-1654,1,37347,norman_s_zalkind,,746.152,748.073,If it's right on his--
1997.96-1654,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,748.073,749.37,Right there on the saddle.
1997.96-1654,1,37347,norman_s_zalkind,,751.899,754.023,"--I understand that, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-1654,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,760.459,765.16,Nor would it be if you had it in a wheelbarrow and were moving it from place to place.
1997.96-1654,1,37347,norman_s_zalkind,,765.16,765.441,"--No, that would not be carried."
1997.96-1654,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,778.998,801.551,"Why do... why when I put the... I mean, this is what... because I so often use the words, I put a flower plant or something for my wife in the trunk, and I feel I'm carrying that to my house, and why, in the plain meaning of the words, if instead of a... I hope I wouldn't do it... instead of a flower plant, it happens to be a case of rifles that we're using to... for the big drug transaction."
1997.96-1654,1,37347,norman_s_zalkind,,808.143,810.205,Because we're talking about statutory interpretation and we're--
1997.96-1654,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1601.715,1605.214,"I haven't... I'm not aware of the continued use of that phrase, no."
1997.96-1654,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1618.817,1624.284,I think the Government has some problem just in the colloquial sense of the word.
1997.96-1654,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1630.515,1635.108,"--I... Mr. Chief Justice, I think a lot depends on when it's asked."
1997.96-1654,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1650.554,1651.257,I'm not sure I agree with you.
1997.96-1654,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1651.257,1652.398,You don't think... I... well--
1997.96-1654,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1652.398,1655.694,"Maybe my eight colleagues do, but I'm not sure that I do."
1997.96-1654,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1655.694,1665.704,"--At least our feeling, and it's consistent with standard dictionary definitions, that if you ask someone if they're carrying a gun in their car they would say either yes, or no, depending on whether the gun was in the car."
1997.96-1654,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1665.704,1668.125,"If you ask them if they're carrying your gun in the car, yes."
1997.96-1654,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1670.188,1679.528,"No, I think the same answer would... I think the same answer would be true even if you said if you're carrying a gun, in a circumstance where you're talking about where that seems the reasonable reference."
1997.96-1654,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1684.275,1694.88,"Most dictionaries seem to... which I'm sure we've all been looking at since this case arose, they seem to say two different things."
1997.96-1654,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1720.479,1725.54,"Our position is that Congress intended it to refer to both, and that movement is--"
1997.96-1654,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1725.54,1733.396,So someone with a gun in a pocket who's sitting in a chair and not moving is covered under your definition?
1997.96-1654,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1733.396,1734.74,"--Yes, and I'll tell you why."
1997.96-1654,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1769.257,1772.583,"Well, if the weapon is in the car, in the Government's view is movement required?"
1997.96-1654,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1772.583,1782.533,"--Yes, and my only qualification I would give for that, if the defendant is just storing a gun in the car in his garage, for example, I don't think that he's carrying it."
1997.96-1654,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1788.545,1792.84,"Well, the car stops, so the drug transaction can be carried out."
1997.96-1654,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1798.042,1799.136,--Right.
1997.96-1654,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.82,1807.117,And what about--
1997.96-1654,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1809.912,1820.361,"I... carry and transport, as the dictionaries, as every dictionary I think recognizes, there is a lot of overlap between the terms, but there's a couple of features that clearly... I think three things that clearly distinguish them."
1997.96-1654,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1852.334,1855.77,"Well, what do you do about two people in a vehicle in the Government's definition?"
1997.96-1654,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1862.297,1867.108,I think it's usually... those cases are resolved in terms of who has dominion and control over the gun.
1997.96-1654,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1868.325,1873.262,"Well, who has it, in the Government's view, driver, passenger, weapon in glove compartment?"
1997.96-1654,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,1873.262,1879.494,"I... you know, I don't... ordinarily it would be the driver, but it could easily be the passenger too, or instead of."
1997.96-1654,3,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3169.18,3169.712,Thank you.
1997.96-1654,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3197.981,3209.976,"Well, it seems to me in the great runofthemind cases the gun is in the glove compartment, or in the... in a bag under a newspaper on the passenger seat within easy reach, or even in the trunk."
1997.96-1654,3,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3216.396,3224.47,"--There are cases of guns in ships and trains, and there are many, many cases of guns in the back seat between the passengers, and the Government's position is anomalous there."
1997.96-1654,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3225.423,3226.345,--Guns in the suitcase on the train.
1997.96-1654,3,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3230.562,3231.078,--Exactly.
1997.96-1654,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3260.377,3262.065,"No, but on the State statutes let me ask you this question."
1997.96-1654,3,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3265.204,3265.954,--There are a few.
1997.96-1654,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3266.548,3270.468,"Would you not agree that if you're correct the words, on the person in those statutes are redundant?"
1997.96-1654,3,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3270.468,3271.779,--Those few statutes.
1997.96-1654,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3273.185,3276.699,So at least some States thought carry was broader than on a person.
1997.96-1654,3,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3276.699,3286.663,"--Well, most of the States say on or about, and many of them, 22 of them, and they're cited in the Cleveland brief, say on or about, or including broadly, in the vehicle."
1997.96-1654,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3314.7,3316.932,May I ask you to comment on one other thing that's kind of puzzled me?
1997.96-1654,3,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3332.255,3337.018,"Well, I don't believe that the Court was referring to the situation where the gun was just laying there in terms of carry."
1997.96-1654,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3338.221,3345.64,"Well, he puts... the defendant puts a gun into a place to protect drugs or to embolden himself, were the Court's words, and we all signed on to that."
1997.96-1654,3,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3345.64,3347.875,"--Right, but the Court was not describing carry there."
1997.96-1654,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3348.826,3355.323,"It was saying the reason that we don't want to read it as use is, that would mean... it would leave no room for carry to cover that situation."
1997.96-1654,3,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3355.323,3362.585,"--Well, I... respectfully, Justice Stevens, I would submit that the Court was not in any way suggesting that carry cover that situation."
1997.96-1654,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3367.272,3368.188,"Thank you, Mr. Klonoff."
1997.96-1654,3,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3368.188,3368.605,Thank you.
1997.96-1654,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3368.605,3369.605,The case is submitted.
