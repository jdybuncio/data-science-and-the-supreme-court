1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,200.534,204.27,Whose agent if any by is the broker?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,204.27,207.223,The broker is really a joint agent.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,231.747,234.109,And the title is never in the broker's name isn't?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,234.109,236.948,The title is never in the broker's name.
1974.73-628,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,236.948,239.545,This broker hack it for others also?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,239.545,247.52,"Yes he did in prior years in the particular year involved in this case, he did not buy any cotton for any other company, but we didn't restrict him."
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,262.469,266.393,But he acted for several producers always --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,266.393,269.739,He acted for a number of different farmers in that year.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,269.739,271.627,But only for you as the buyer in that year?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,271.627,273.924,"Only for us, but that was his own choice."
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,275.039,276.71,He wasn't -- you didn't have any --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,276.71,281.217,We have no control of what he did and did not act of the --
1974.73-628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,281.217,282.915,Who paid the commission here?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,282.915,293.288,In the commission here was added to the invoice price of the cotton and Allenberg paid the full price of the cotton including the broker's commission.
1974.73-628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,293.288,298.098,You indicated that sometimes it was either divided or --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,298.098,298.357,Fully --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,298.357,299.604,Farmer abated?
1974.73-628,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,343.654,355.458,"Mr. McQuiston, before you get to the harvest point, what control did the contract give Allenberg over Pittman's course of cotton collaboration?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,355.458,359.502,The contract specifies that he would follow normal good forming methods.
1974.73-628,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,393.896,402.564,Would Allenberg either by contractor by Mississippi law have a lean at any point on Pittman's land or --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,402.564,408.007,On the going crop -- no Your Honor.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,408.007,409.594,When was the contract made?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,409.594,414.554,The contract was made in January before Pittman ever planted a single seed.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,414.554,417.719,And what is the cotton you seized in that that part of this?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,417.719,420.179,The planning is the spring in April.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,420.179,420.915,April?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,420.915,433.235,"And then the harvest would be September, October anywhere from -- it begins at the point depending on the weather and end as late of March -- I mean sorry, as late as December, January."
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,437.397,441.366,And the contract was -- for what so many bales or --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,441.366,441.681,It was for all --
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,441.681,443.14,For the entire product --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,443.14,446.269,-- they produced on a 700 acres of land.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.269,447.055,Whatever was produced --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,447.055,448.431,Whatever was produced.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,448.431,450.999,"At so much per bale, was that it?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,450.999,454.634,At so much depending on the quality of the cotton.
1974.73-628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,458.378,459.735,"There were several grades, were there not?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,459.735,460.908,There were several grades.
1974.73-628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,518.938,520.464,You speak of the merchant now who --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,520.464,522.347,"The cotton merchant in Memphis, Allenberg."
1974.73-628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,522.347,522.783,Memphis.
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,522.783,529.773,"It perceives the samples in Memphis, uses them to make up 100-bale shipping lots of even-running cottons."
1974.73-628,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,698.877,702.198,"In Dahnke, the sale was FOB, wasn't it?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,702.198,720.943,"The sale was FOB course in Dahnke, but the sale in the Shafer and Lemke cases was delivery at the grain elevators which served the same function in the wheat industry that the cotton warehouse is doing in car industry."
1974.73-628,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,851.715,857.085,Why would you not have gone ahead and qualify it if the Supreme Court of Mississippi decision have stood?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,857.085,863.147,"We did qualify immediately thereafter, but under the decision below, subsequent qualification does not cure the defects."
1974.73-628,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,866.09,872.541,But your contract -- I would think you could sue on contracts made after your qualification in Mississippi?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,872.541,877.194,"Yes we could, but this in 1973 where made before this decision was announced."
1974.73-628,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,877.194,878.42,But I mean as to the future.
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,882.432,888.178,"Well, it has an impact in this manner Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1974.73-628,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.504,903.933,But you have qualified?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,903.933,906.42,"We have, yes."
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,931.023,935.342,"Well, isn't the burden of qualifying is nothing as vague isn't it?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,935.342,954.82,The burden is a -- these are small companies Mr. Justice White and they are 500 to a thousand of them and the administrative cost in our industry are very significant factor in determining what areas of competition we operate in.
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,962.145,964.06,And not a lawyer?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,964.06,965.656,And not a lawyer.
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.831,978.053,Free traders?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,978.053,987.294,"A free trader, absolutely under the decisions of this Court in the Dahnke-Walker case and Lemke and Shafer."
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,991.964,1003.975,"I wonder if what you really worried about was not disqualification, but other burdens that this might fore tend, might threatened."
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1006.975,1009.462,We're not worried about it at all.
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1016.263,1026.648,"What if the Mississippi designs a tax, put an excise tax on cottons store in Mississippi, in warehouses in Mississippi, even if it's owned by Allenberg?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1026.648,1028.369,That would be all --
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.369,1030.97,You would think they have jurisdiction to do it?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1030.97,1032.631,Yes.
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.631,1036.281,But you -- so you think the tax cases and the qualification cases are --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1036.281,1039.603,They have to be separated and they always have been for this reason.
1974.73-628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1039.603,1046.569,I suppose the economic basis for your response is that Mississippi must remain competitive with the other states on the cotton market?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1046.569,1047.26,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.714,1055.252,But you don't think storing cotton in a state is intrastate business?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1055.252,1057.924,We don't store the cotton there Your Honor.
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1058.806,1062.447,"Would you take title to it, it's in a warehouse in Mississippi."
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1062.447,1063.508,That's exactly right; warehouse --
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.508,1067.827,And you get the warehouse receipts and are you saying there's no -- there's no --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1067.827,1068.647,There's a small --
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.647,1074.902,No substantial period of time that the lapses between that -- could be the warehouse receipts to you in the shipment are the same?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1074.902,1076.886,Not in relation to the industry practice.
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.005,1078.016,Well how long?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1080.708,1091.033,"The cotton crop begins to come in, in September and October, and as soon as those receipts have began to be received by the cotton merchants, it's moved down if the -- in it's a continuous milling --"
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1091.033,1092.546,What's the average length of time?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1093.606,1098.003,"Well, there's nothing in the record indicating that."
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.003,1103.724,"Well, for all we know then, the cotton stored there in your name for quite a while?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1103.724,1107.753,"Well, for all that you know, I might replay the cotton losses immediately in an --"
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1107.753,1112.957,"Well, I know, but do why do we do invalidate state statute on some assumption like that?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1112.957,1116.124,"Well, I don't think this case turns on how long the cotton stays there."
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1116.124,1117.956,"Well, that's what I mean when we get to."
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1125.294,1132.917,"No, it would not Your Honor because the purchase contract, the making of the purchase contract is the protected activity here."
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.182,1146.014,"You mean eventhough -- eventhough it was contemplated that Allenberg would not take the cotton on the state for a long time, but only when its future's contracts matured, even if you were planning --"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1146.014,1150.206,"Even if you made that assumption, I would say that this contract was an interstate commerce when it was --"
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.206,1156.931,"Well, what if you're wrong on that -- how about this case?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1156.931,1163.182,"In this case, the cotton was never delivered, so there's no evidence in the record is to how long it would've stay."
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1165.359,1168.447,"Well, who gets the benefit of that without knowing, the state or you?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1168.447,1182.771,I believe that we would be -- we know from the industry practice as describe in this record that the cotton moves out of the state all during the succeeding weeks after it's harvested.
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.571,1194.915,"Well those cases, are they when the farmers sold it, put on a common carrier and headed out of the state?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1194.915,1209.874,"No, the farmer sold the wheat in Shafer and Lemke to a grain elevator operator who stored it there and then when he made a carload lots and shipped that out afterwards."
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1285.797,1290.138,And would you think it might be subject to a local taxation?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1290.138,1292.842,Which I -- I think that's an open question.
1974.73-628,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.771,1306.019,"Or in accordance we put there, it might be subject to service or processing the state?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1306.019,1309.968,Yes sir and that too.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1422.326,1428.276,What is involved in the registering to do business in Mississippi?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1428.276,1443.743,Filing a number of informational papers about the corporation's activities and the basic corporate information and some fees and renewing that each year.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1443.743,1444.518,It is annually renewed?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1444.518,1448.192,It is annually renewed and this is the thing that gets to be such a burden.
1974.73-628,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1490.402,1498.959,"Is the annual qualification fee at Mississippi, a flat fee or it's graduated in accordance with business or --"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1498.959,1501.528,I'm not sure Mr. Justice Powell.
1974.73-628,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1526.832,1534.744,This can't say in technique of doing business obtains in all 17 in these states with forward contracts and warehousing in the states?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1534.744,1535.581,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1539.712,1542.313,Not every state however --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1542.313,1544.612,Not every state has this “no cure statute.”
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1544.612,1545.9,-- that has this no cure of sanction?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1545.9,1561.091,"The no cure sanction is what is got our industry on the edge because what is happened is when these contracts were made in 1973, they were immediate hedged by off setting sales in the New York Cotton Exchange."
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1603.996,1604.672,Excuse me.
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1604.672,1605.057,Excuse me.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1605.057,1610.627,"I just been little untutored and unsophisticated in this business, I'm curious."
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1619.619,1619.71,Yes.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1619.71,1628.29,"And so in January, even long before any seed that even been planted, it made an offsetting sale of the New York Cotton Exchange."
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1628.29,1628.647,"Yes sir, the same --"
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1628.647,1629.342,Of what?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1631.181,1638.137,Of cotton futures to be delivered in October or December of the following year when it expected that this cotton --
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1638.137,1639.346,Of the same you year --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1639.346,1641.478,Of the same year.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1641.478,1644.028,And out of the same amount of cotton?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1644.028,1646.143,But -- yes sir.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1646.143,1649.382,"Or what certain number of bales of cotton, I guess?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1649.382,1659.167,"The contracts on the New York Cotton Exchange are in 100-bale lots, so Allenberg made this contract in August in Mississippi decided about how much cotton estimated that's involved."
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1659.167,1660.356,Estimated about the year --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1660.356,1664.709,And made an estimated sale on the New York Cotton Exchange at identical same time.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1664.709,1669.641,"And that what price compared to the price, you compared to the agreed purchase price?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1669.641,1672.627,That's usually about what we call a 400-point spread.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1701.424,1703.527,It sells it --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1703.527,1703.866,Yes sir.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1703.866,1705.813,Sell a futures for 34 cents?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1705.813,1707.072,34 or 35 cents.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1707.072,1709.106,34 or 35.
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1709.106,1722.617,"And of course, if the price of cotton went up as it did in 1973 to almost a dollar a pound for the first time since the civil war, we're looking at loses that far exceeded the capital of the entire industry."
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1722.617,1727.433,"And then when the cotton, let's -- I'm just talking now about industry practice and not about this case."
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1727.433,1727.906,Yes sir.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1727.906,1732.97,When the cotton was delivered by Mr. Pittman or somebody else --
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1732.97,1733.69,It had been --
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1733.69,1738.186,"-- to the warehouse, he gins it, he does the ginning?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1738.186,1740.853,"He takes it to local gin, that's all his business."
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1743.554,1744.084,Warehouse.
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1744.084,1745.663,A compress in warehouse.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1755.173,1764.033,"Can you tell us about the cutting the samples, sending one to the Department of Agriculture, another one up to your client and your client has the job of having running what is called a running --"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1764.033,1766.725,Making even-running lots out of all these hundreds of bales.
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1766.725,1780.79,"Hundred of bale, 100-bale lots and then what happens when the time comes due on the New York Cotton Exchange?"
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1780.79,1790.005,"The hedge is taken out by an offsetting transaction and if the market has gone up, there's a loss account on the New York Cotton Exchange."
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1798.634,1805.975,Because you say where you're going to this business is with a desk and a telephone and a banker who exchange your credit?
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1805.975,1809.421,"Well, this is true not only in the cotton industry but wheat, soy beans --"
1974.73-628,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1809.421,1809.891,A lot of it.
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1811.044,1816.343,The commodities merchandising industry works exactly like the cotton industry does.
1974.73-628,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1816.343,1819.697,"Mr. McQuiston, before you sit down, let me ask you question."
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1849.679,1858.682,"Your Honor, we felt that there was no way to this Court to consider the case without considering the industry context."
1974.73-628,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1873.598,1894.644,"There are some members of the Court to think we have not to do, you have a 106-page brief and the 44-page reply brief and your friend Professor Blumstein has a 100-page brief, its make a 250 pages on a single issue."
1974.73-628,0,31765,john_mcquiston_ii,,1903.608,1912.605,"Well, I hope that that has not happened Mr. Chief Justice Blackmun and I apologize for burdening the Court with the extra pages."
1974.73-628,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1932.206,1933.755,Mr. Cochran?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,1933.755,1938.642,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2024.152,2026.265,Wasn't the certificate signed by the Chief Justice?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2026.265,2027.346,"Yes sir, it was."
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2027.346,2028.741,Doesn't that comply?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2028.741,2039.194,"Not under Alderson, Footnote 4 in Alderson indicates that a single judge certificate is not sufficient, and your order of December 17 -- sir?"
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2039.194,2041.659,"Did Alderson referred to a State Supreme Court, I forgotten --"
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2041.659,2043.588,Yes sir it did.
1974.73-628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2054.415,2057.301,And our orders -- that was our order of December 17 --
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2057.301,2059.3,December 17.
1974.73-628,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2059.3,2060.58,It was never complied with?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2060.58,2061.704,It was never complied with.
1974.73-628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2077.083,2081.295,Why did we note -- what do we do?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2081.295,2089.598,"Two and in a half months later, you know that probable jurisdiction pending of determination of whether or not there was not jurisdiction."
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2089.598,2092.284,The (Inaudible) and probably counselor wasn't there?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2092.284,2102.28,"Yes, a filing was made reprinting the opinion of United States District Court case Cone Mills."
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2196.767,2209.203,Do you have any -- do you make any distinction between engaging in taxable activities and the tax who every done the -- on the raise of the company itself?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2209.203,2212.672,Talking about actual tax being lend or a potential tax?
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2212.672,2213.276,Either.
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2213.276,2227.986,"Well, with respect to Allenberg, there are cases showing that an add vellore and property tax can be apply as well as a tax for engaging in the business, your license tax."
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2227.986,2230.701,But which kind of a tax where you talking about?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2230.701,2234.348,"Well under Eli Lilly, it had to be licensing."
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2238.965,2243.604,"And ad valorem tax would create that problem in, is that your position?"
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2243.604,2246.206,No.
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2246.206,2248.287,What about Shafer and Lemke?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2248.287,2261.951,"Well, the Shafer and Lemke -- that was Shafer to begin with, you have language in that opinion that buying for interstate shipment is interstate commerce."
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.018,2287.837,But Lemke wasn't a preemption hearing?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2287.837,2288.909,"No Your Honor, it wasn't."
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2288.909,2290.039,No trace of it?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2290.039,2290.331,All right.
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2319.292,2321.729,"Are you relying in that here, there's no immediate shipment?"
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2322.069,2324.211,"No, I'm pointing at the record says that --"
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.211,2333.681,Let's assume Allenberg -- let's assume Allenberg took delivery from the farmer by a way of an interstate carrier.
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2333.681,2335.957,That would do it.
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.957,2336.697,That would do what?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2336.697,2337.804,They would not have to qualify.
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.394,2345.638,So you think it's just a way of taking delivery at the warehouse and then having it loaded on a carrier to warehouse --
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2345.638,2348.501,That was Coe versus Town of Errol.
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2348.501,2349.817,So you think it doesn't like the difference --
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2349.817,2361.226,"Sure, well the cost of our opinion points out the mechanical test is a test which this Court feels is determinative, and here we have a delay prior the transit."
1974.73-628,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2361.226,2368.053,Of course the Export Clause doesn't necessarily follow the same guidelines as the interstate commerce?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2368.053,2379.021,"Well you got Richfield Oil and the County of Merced case that both indicates the same test will be use for import, export and Commerce Clause definition in the Coe versus Errol situation."
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.724,2389.581,"Well, I would think you would argue also that the Allenberg has an agent in the state."
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2389.581,2390.416,I don't think --
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.416,2393.612,That is supervising the execution of the contract.
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2393.612,2398.849,The -- having an agent in the state my not be a critical fact.
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.141,2415.953,Located in Mississippi?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2415.953,2417.86,Located in Mississippi and stored there.
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.86,2419.04,And now on its way in.
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2419.04,2420.994,They're just like a local company.
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.512,2431.372,But Lemke and Shafer say that that's stoppage and transit doesn't -- and still part of the interstate commerce.
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2431.372,2444.98,"They stand alike, and you can't reconcile with the Shafer with Coe versus Errol, or this Court's decision last term in Kosydar."
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2444.98,2452.979,"Well, do you think time log in Kosydar has any implications in reference to this?"
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2452.979,2460.54,Reference in the opinion has written in such a way that the timeline was not critically important.
1974.73-628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2488.075,2499.256,"As my Brother Rehnquist has indicated just a moment ago the Export Import Clause is -- not the Interstate Commerce Clause, it's a separate clause in the Constitution."
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2510.028,2511.661,Involving interstate commerce.
1974.73-628,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2511.661,2512.914,Involving the Commerce Clause.
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2512.914,2518.561,But Richfield Oil says the same test will be applied Mr. Justice Douglas.
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2528.427,2533.688,"Well, what about -- what do you have the say about the impact of the Supreme Court -- Mississippi Supreme Court decision?"
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2533.688,2535.279,There's nothing in the record.
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2536.47,2545.818,What are the realities of which we might take judicial notice?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2547.361,2549.136,Realities of the industry?
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2549.136,2552.592,Yes on interstate commerce?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2552.592,2553.271,Well the reality --
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2553.271,2558.773,That consistent with the history the interstate -- the Commerce Clause itself?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2558.773,2563.64,To penalize companies do not qualify by not giving them access to the court systems?
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2568.918,2570.343,"(Voice Overlap) Of course, I would --"
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2570.343,2571.142,You go down the garden house.
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2571.142,2572.719,And have to take your conclusion.
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2572.719,2574.169,"Well, but this is intrastate commerce."
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2589.829,2596.846,"On your theory then, the only way to escape this situation would be get those bales and --"
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2596.846,2597.281,Put them on railroad cars.
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2597.281,2602.396,"Put them on a railroad car, how long could they be there, 24 hours?"
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2602.396,2603.865,On the railroad car?
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2603.865,2605.414,"No, no."
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2610.912,2621.334,"Well, then you've got cases which I've cited on my brief, if they aren't loaded directly on the car, then there's going to be problems."
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2625.872,2628.682,On a shipping platform?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2628.682,2638.544,"I would say would have to go directly to the railroad carriers with no storage facility between the time that it leaves the field, the time is placed on the interstate --"
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2638.544,2646.013,That you go on a truck or some vehicle from the field right along side of the trucks and then be put on the cars?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2646.013,2646.802,"Yes, I take it."
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2661.803,2671.499,"What if the carrier doesn't have enough cars and holds it for week, but just that do it to worse?"
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2671.499,2682.557,"Well, you can parallel that situation with the situation where you have goods in interstate transit and there's a stop, and the cot-mill transit test is it for a business purpose."
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2698.538,2702.137,I'm not giving you an analysis; I'm just asking a question.
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2702.137,2706.082,"That would be the best, the only analysis I could parallel your fact situation with."

1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2726.048,2731.319,"They take title immediately upon placement in the warehouse, right at the point."
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.319,2736.423,"Well, they take when the warehouse certificates should deliver to him?"
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2736.423,2739.198,"Yeah, the farmer has to get those certificates --"
1974.73-628,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2739.198,2741.677,"He gets them, and gives with Allenberg already."

1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2758.841,2763.86,There's nothing in the record honestly.
1974.73-628,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2763.86,2773.415,"Mr. Cochran in your view, what state interest is served by having a no cure sanction for failure to qualify?"
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2773.415,2774.371,What state interest?
1974.73-628,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2774.371,2776.597,Yes.
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2776.597,2787.788,It's a brutal penalty but it provides immediate leverage to companies to ensure that they will qualify and there is a high state interest in the qualification.
1974.73-628,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2787.788,2788.701,Right.
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2788.701,2794.147,You can parallel the no cure thing as to 60 years for smoking marijuana.

1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2816.208,2818.275,"Well, the state interest -- they're qualified now."
1974.73-628,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2818.275,2830.225,"Yes, but that could achieve couldn't it with the somewhat less penalty or allowing qualification and the payment of fees before suit can be brought?"
1974.73-628,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2854.323,2855.347,Mr. Cochran?
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2855.347,2855.623,Yes.
1974.73-628,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2855.623,2861.636,"If you permit cure in the situation like this, it's kind of like a one bite type of thing."
1974.73-628,1,25063,george_calvin_cochran,,2875.411,2905.698,"If you have a retroactive penalty, what happen -- say that there is a cure provision but you can sue on honest in deaths, well then what you do is you negotiate with the defendant and say, look -- the defendant can't raise the defense because as soon as the company complies the defenses law, so the state interest and requiring qualification is out the window without the type of provision Mississippi has."
1974.73-628,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2930.225,2930.555,Thank you.
