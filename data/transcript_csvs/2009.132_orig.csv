2009.132_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.794,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 132 on our original docket, Alabama v. North Carolina."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,7.667,14.382,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: North Carolina breached the Southeast Compact in this case."
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,78.946,88.647,"Mr. Phillips, the point that North Carolina makes is it would be throwing away the taxpayers' money to no purpose."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,113.667,113.994,Right.
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,142.2,142.5,But the--
2009.132_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.5,145.011,But how much -- how much did the Commission give before this?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,147.525,156.241,"No, it did it with -- with the approval of the other States in the compact, for the purpose of promoting the ultimate objective of the -- of the contract--"
2009.132_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,156.241,175.314,"And -- and I think that one of the best indications of what -- what a contract means is the manner in which the parties act under the contract, and that suggests to me that it was never contemplated that North Carolina alone would foot the bill for -- for obtaining this license."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,175.314,180.656,"--The language of the -- of the compact itself, Justice Scalia, is quite plain."
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,199.909,200.63,At what cost?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,200.63,201.8,--At whatever cost--
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,201.8,209.299,"What the Special Master said was, I believe, that there was never an obligation to do it at all costs."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,213.624,214.295,--Well--
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,214.295,216.233,Do you accept that as a working proposition?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,216.233,226.992,--I would say that the -- that the State of North Carolina would have -- have a defense of impossibility if they could argue that going down this path would have bankrupted North Carolina.
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,226.992,239.302,"Well, I think there was certainly a significant amount of evidence that the cost of completing this project was way above any reasonable expectation of the parties at the time of contracting, correct?"
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,239.302,246.906,"Yes, but the -- but the payment of $80 million by the Commission was way above what any of the parties expected at the beginning of the process as well."
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,246.906,253.262,What -- what do you believe the evidence shows with respect to the reasonable cost of completing this project?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,253.262,259.212,I think it was reasonable to assume that the construction of the facility itself would have cost an additional $75 million.
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,259.212,263.444,"And about a -- an additional 34,000 to get the license?"
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,263.444,266.068,Probably 34 million to complete the license.
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,266.068,266.302,So -- I'm sorry.
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,268.802,270.097,"Right, but the -- the--"
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,270.097,274.721,An amount equal to what they had already -- everybody had already put in?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,274.721,276.515,"--To be sure, but the -- but the--"
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,276.515,279.904,And about how many times greater than the initial estimates?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,279.904,283.655,"--I don't know that there were any initial estimates, at least that I recall."
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,283.655,288.728,I thought it was about 20 or 30 million dollars was initially estimated to-to do this project.
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,288.728,290.979,I doubt that that would have included the full construction.
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,290.979,301.538,I -- I'm only going through these to try to get a sense from you of at what point did North Carolina have a right to claim impossibility?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,303.16,303.503,Yes.
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,309.251,311.642,"--Well, it did by saying, we can't complete this project."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,311.642,313.642,"Well, it said it wouldn't complete this project."
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,343.941,347.688,--So your argument is then that they acted 2 years too late.
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,369.414,371.349,--Right.
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,376.145,377.627,So if they had done everything the same--
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,377.627,380.5,--I think there's an open question of whether the withdrawal in '97 would have been in good faith or not.
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,391.981,393.481,--But they told you what-it was totally up-front.
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,419.25,445.252,"--Right, and -- and the question then, obviously, that -- the legal issue that that presents is whether or not a party to a contract who is not entitled to expect the other participants to the agreement to pay any more money or in fact any money whatsoever has the authority essentially to attempt to extort that money while continuing to gain the benefits of the contract for an additional year and a half; at that point, then they -- then they withdraw."
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,457.968,465.587,What were the benefits that North Carolina was getting by paying whatever it was -- 400-odd thousand dollars -- to keep it going for another 2 years?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,465.587,478.382,"Well, the benefits of being a part of the compact is all of the powers that the Commission had to deal with other compacts in terms of how to license -- not how to license, but how to dispose of waste."
2009.132_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,494.343,500.591,Were there any benefits to the contract at all until -- unless and until there was a waste facility constructed?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,500.591,501.964,"Well, there were huge benefits, Justice Scalia."
2009.132_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,501.964,502.183,What?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,502.183,510.695,The Barnwell facility in South Carolina was disposing of waste and was only going to take wastes from the compact States in the Southeast Compact.
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.424,521.956,At what point did South Carolina withdraw?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,521.956,523.875,"In 1995, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,523.875,528.733,"And so they -- by 1997, they didn't have any access to Barnwell anymore."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,528.733,542.667,"Right, but they still had the benefit of the compact's -- the Commission's authority to negotiate on behalf of the member States deals with other compacts for the disposal in those facilities which you otherwise don't have the benefit of."
2009.132_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.667,544.164,It sounds to me pretty hypothetical.
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,567.67,569.464,"Well, this would be bad faith withdrawal."
2009.132_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.464,569.682,Why?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,569.682,579.743,"Where the State assumes -- accepts $80 million, goes down a path, is not entitled to any of that money or to any other money, and then unilaterally withdraws--"
2009.132_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,579.743,581.225,Did it misspend that money?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,582.929,585.46,--That's an open issue at this point.
2009.132_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,645.668,648.978,"But, Mr. Phillips, I really don't quite understand a part of your argument."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,664.846,681.918,--I -- I think if -- it would be a tougher case if they had taken the 80 million and come to the conclusion of this and there was a finding by the State authorities that this facility simply cannot be built consistent with health and safety.
2009.132_orig,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,701.427,709.001,What is your position -- what do you say that the States contemplated regarding the financing of these -- of these projects?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,732.6,732.912,No.
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,764.821,765.476,But in -- but in the--
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,765.476,765.85,--I'm sorry.
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,765.85,781.582,"--case of this compact and the other ones, as I -- do I understand correctly, Mr. Phillips, that none of these -- none of these compacts that were negotiated around the same time, none of them yielded a disposal -- an operative disposal facility?"
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,781.582,782.83,None so far.
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,843.771,844.956,Could I interrupt just a moment?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,844.956,845.377,--Of course.
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,845.377,848.658,Let's assume they hadn't taken the 80 million.
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,853.282,853.906,Right.
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,853.906,860.262,--and they looked and said: It's going to take us another 120 million to complete this; we just can't.
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,870.338,871.679,Right.
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,871.679,874.694,"--you have to keep -- you have to give notice, four-year notice."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,874.694,874.943,Right.
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,887.216,888.889,"Right, okay."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,924.936,930.699,"Well, other than -- other than the fact that to say ""We can't"" strikes me as utterly implausible."
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,934.401,939.165,"--Well, but the hypothetical I gave you before you described as good faith: Just too much money."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,939.165,939.524,Right.
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,940.21,941.1,What turns it into bad faith?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,941.1,953.937,"--Well, I think the problem -- what turns it into bad faith is taking the 80 million, consistently committing to going forward with it, and then walking away right before you are going to get sanctioned for failure to comply with the -- with the agreement."
2009.132_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.391,965.701,Do you have any precedent from this Court for reading into a contract between States an obligation of good faith?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,965.701,968.685,--I don't have any -- any decision of this Court.
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,977.868,980.411,Then how do you -- what is -- is that absolutely necessary?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,994.094,994.53,Right.
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,994.53,1002.076,"Now, where in the contract is it something that says -- I mean, maybe that was foolish, to put that in there, but they did put it in."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1008.37,1015.163,"Well, the only -- the only argument we have with respect to that -- and it's important to recognize, we don't have to win this issue in order to win the breach of contract claim in this particular case."
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1015.163,1015.506,--Well -- all right.
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1016.114,1024.128,"Well, because there's massive repudiation long before the -- the question still is, what do you do with 1997 to 1999?"
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1036.244,1047.303,"Is there in this implicit that the State of North Carolina, prior to their withdrawal, while they are still acting, will appropriate reasonable amounts of money for this?"
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1047.303,1052.443,"And take -- well, what they are supposed to do is take appropriate steps to license, which means--"
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1052.443,1053.847,Do appropriate steps include--
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1053.847,1055.769,--continue to do what's necessary to get a license.
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1055.769,1073.278,"--do they -- does this -- if we have a lend-lease agreement entered into a treaty and absolutely ratified, I suppose that if Congress decides not to lend and won't appropriate the money to do it, we are in breach of the treaty."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1073.278,1074.947,Yes.
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1074.947,1088.144,"And I assume if there is a similar agreement here and North Carolina's legislature doesn't appropriate any money for whatever internal reasons, North Carolina is in breach of the treaty."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1088.144,1089.052,Right.
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1089.052,1090.269,Do I understand this correctly?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1090.269,1091.708,"Yes, that's absolutely right, Justice Breyer."
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1091.708,1109.185,"Is there any authority for the proposition that when a legislature does not appropriate the money that the executive of a State has committed to another State, that State is in breach, irrespective of whose fault it is within the State?"
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1109.185,1112.886,I don't know that there is specific authority for that proposition.
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1159.695,1160.085,Okay.
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1173.282,1174.954,"Yes, I think that's a fair--"
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1174.954,1175.89,And you say they did not?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1175.89,1177.964,"--But we have other arguments, obviously, but then -- but on the breach--"
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1177.964,1178.979,"But that's -- but if you win on that one, you win."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1178.979,1179.449,--we should win.
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.285,1199.33,"And the state of the finding of the Commission in respect to that precise point, and it's called -- what is it called?"
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1205.03,1205.795,"Yes, it's a--"
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1205.795,1209.312,"They have -- they are the ones who are the judge, it says."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1209.312,1211.528,"--I believe that they are the sole judge, yes."
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1211.528,1211.902,All right.
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1212.498,1213.091,Article 7(C).
2009.132_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1213.091,1219.478,"The findings in respect to that specific 2-year point are what, and where are they in the record?"
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1219.478,1219.774,Okay.
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1261.351,1276.641,"But they also -- you said -- you said in your brief that the -- in 1997, the Commission came forward with some kind of additional funding proposal, which North Carolina came down -- turned down."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1276.641,1276.937,"Refused, right."
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1276.937,1278.642,What -- what was that?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1278.642,1299.303,"The basic proposal -- the draft memorandum of understanding would have -- would have led to the Commission providing, I think, about $21 million, and the generators in the Southeast States providing a loan to North Carolina of an additional -- I think it was $13 million."
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1313.079,1315.687,Why did -- why did North Carolina turn it down?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1315.687,1318.733,--You might want to ask Mr. Dellinger that question.
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1323.015,1334.838,"But you say there was a package, that there was a -- an offer in place where the Commission would pay X and the generators would kick in an additional amount as well."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1334.838,1335.026,Right.
2009.132_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1336.57,1341.256,And that was -- that -- everybody had signed -- everybody who was part of that offer had signed onto it?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1341.256,1341.786,Right.
2009.132_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1345.971,1347.206,Why did they agree to it?

2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1358.559,1365.995,"--Well, you know, when you -- when you've got the power to extort, you know, the temptation to go down that path, Justice Scalia, is obviously pretty strong."
2009.132_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.434,1371.213,--I suggest it's not the power to extort; it's the power to withdraw.

2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1384.081,1384.284,--Right.

2009.132_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1402.701,1405.759,So whatever the Commission contributed?
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1420.207,1427.985,"Well, I think the answer to your question is -- you know, of course, is: What's the appropriate remedy for the particular breach in any given case?"
2009.132_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1431.483,1431.702,"No, I don't think so."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1449.117,1454.413,"--But I -- well, I think the ultimate question is still: What is the obligation?"

2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1478.387,1478.87,--of the contract.
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1478.87,1498.099,"--with that answer, is that you earlier said that they could -- forgetting if they didn't take any money -- under the terms of this compact -- and Justice Scalia has been noting this repeatedly -- have withdrawn at any time because they didn't want to sink any more money into this project; is that correct?"
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1498.099,1498.504,Yes.

2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1503.594,1503.906,Right.
2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1503.906,1524.866,"--because with that duty of good faith, you're suggesting that merely because they took a million -- that's what the Chief Justice is asking you -- or 80 million, that that somehow converted or changed the express terms of the contract and bound them in some way to find funding that they chose not to."
2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1528.067,1530.832,"No, I think it's more subtle than that, Justice Sotomayor."

2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1563.806,1564.399,Of course.

2009.132_orig,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1621.25,1621.484,--Right.
2009.132_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1634.041,1640.366,It seems to me that it's the obligation of the Commission to show that there is an absolute parallel between the claims.

2009.132_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1708.748,1722.084,But isn't there an obligation before we exercise original jurisdiction to ensure that there is at least a potential viable claim by the States that they have a cause of action?

2009.132_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4197.876,4198.254,Oh.
2009.132_orig,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,4198.254,4204.158,That is to say -- there was not $6 million expended during that period.

2009.132_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4968.517,4975.45,I think all this means is that that is the only financial commitment that the States are obliged to -- to make.
