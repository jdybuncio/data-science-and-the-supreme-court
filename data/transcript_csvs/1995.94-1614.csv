1995.94-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,23.966,"We'll hear argument first in No. 94-1614, Wisconsin v. the City of New York, Oklahoma v. the City of New York, Department of Commerce v. the City of New York."
1995.94-1614,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,25.078,32.882,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,66.514,74.92,"If the true population is unknown, how can one be sure that the most recent census accounted for 98.4 percent?"
1995.94-1614,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,75.33,77.26,"--Well, it's an estimation, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.94-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,319.439,333.33,"General Days, is it clear or does the Government concede that the use of statistical estimates is permissible, let alone that it's mandatory?"
1995.94-1614,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,334.919,335.651,Yes.
1995.94-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,335.651,340.523,"--text of the Constitution, as I read it, doesn't... does not say, you know, that there will be an estimate of the number of citizens."
1995.94-1614,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,362.258,373.335,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think the approach that you were just describing was in fact what the Framers engaged in when they came up with Article I, section 2, clause 3."
1995.94-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.709,381.309,"Because they didn't have an actual enumeration, but what they called for was an actual enumeration."
1995.94-1614,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,381.309,396.059,"--That's true, but I think that what the term actual enumeration really suggests is that the Framers wanted to leave open to the Congress and later to the Secretary of Commerce the ability to rely upon developments with respect to nose counting or head counting."
1995.94-1614,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,413.47,426.049,"But going further, General Days, and using this PES adjustment, at least the district judge, McLaughlin, was confident that that was an appropriate way."
1995.94-1614,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,455.698,457.679,"Yes, there is, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.94-1614,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,457.679,462.023,"So, what is the Government's current view on that, the propriety of such an adjustment?"
1995.94-1614,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,462.023,474.101,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't think any definitive decision has been made, but I don't think that there's any plan to conduct a synthetic census, that is, not going out, as has been the case for 200 years."
1995.94-1614,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,474.101,475.382,That wasn't my question.
1995.94-1614,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,476.943,477.984,After you do that.
1995.94-1614,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,490.243,491.354,But there was no sampling in 1990.
1995.94-1614,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,500.571,501.66,That's correct.
1995.94-1614,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,533.672,542.338,Do you know what was the source of the trial judge's confidence that the use of an adjustment after the enumeration would be inevitable?
1995.94-1614,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,542.338,550.846,"Well, I'm not certain, Justice Ginsburg, but I think that after he heard 13 days of testimony from experts of the highest caliber--"
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1191.03,1205.409,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1614,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1226.112,1233.378,Do you agree that the individual voters who claim their districts have been undercounted have standing to bring this suit?
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1233.378,1239.241,We do not agree with standing in the... in apportionment.
1995.94-1614,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1277.716,1284.532,Do individual voters then not have the standing because the States necessarily supersede their interests?
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1284.532,1291.717,"In our view, it is in this case the States' interest and the individual voter does not have the standing."
1995.94-1614,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1316.745,1330.065,"Why doesn't an individual voter have standing on the theory that if there are more Representatives for that voter's States, the ratio of Representative to voters will be more favorable and, therefore, the voter, as well as the State, has a stake?"
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1330.065,1347.806,"The apportion... in my view the apportionment right, the right to a certain number of seats in Congress does not convert into the same kind of statistical how many Representatives do I have, what share of a Representative do I have in Congress."
1995.94-1614,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1349.659,1355.843,"Well, they are conceptually different but they are related because the ratio will depend on the apportionment."
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1366.893,1370.363,"--Well, because as I said, I believe it's the State's right."
1995.94-1614,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1402.774,1406.227,What about Federal funding that's based on population and so forth?
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1407.058,1409.611,--Federal funding is not a constitutional issue.
1995.94-1614,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1417.455,1418.657,"Well, doesn't that show injury?"
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1418.657,1424.141,"--Not if there is not any showing of purposeful, intentional discrimination."
1995.94-1614,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1443.082,1447.536,"Well, it's not a claim, but does it suffice to have the nexus of injury for him to bring the claim?"
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1447.536,1458.863,"--It may have the nexus for injury to bring a claim, not the constitutional claim having to do with apportionment, which is the claim before this Court, but a statutory claim."
1995.94-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1466.116,1480.348,But would you have a different basis for challenging the census as it is used under some of these statutes than you would have for challenging it in this lawsuit which does not relate to a statute but to the constitutional prescription?
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1480.348,1482.789,I think you may well have a different basis.
1995.94-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1490.513,1492.366,"So, you could come out with different results?"
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1501.491,1503.384,"--That is true currently, Your Honor."
1995.94-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1517.213,1520.525,"No, but assume the statute just says according to the census figures."
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1533.505,1537.166,If the statute said the official census--
1995.94-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1537.166,1537.997,That's what it says.
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1537.997,1545.65,"--then we believe that you could conceivably have two different results, although I think it's unlikely."
1995.94-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1551.714,1552.275,"Oh, okay."
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1565.786,1574.131,"--My understanding of the statutes having to do with disbursal of Federal funds is you would not have that lawsuit, but perhaps under a hypothetical statute, you might well."
1995.94-1614,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1679.579,1691.937,"General Doyle, then are you disagreeing with General Days who said, in answer to the question might the sampling technique or some statistical adjustment be used, yes, it might?"
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1710.259,1717.042,I am suggesting that the Secretary does not have discretion to do the kind of statistical sampling that was done in this case.
1995.94-1614,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1717.593,1719.185,Any kind of statistical sampling?
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1719.185,1720.074,--No.
1995.94-1614,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1733.966,1737.148,"Because that is inconsistent with the term ""actual enumeration""."
1995.94-1614,1,30018,james_e_doyle,,1738.448,1744.691,"--It's inconsistent with actual enumeration, but particularly it is inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, section 2, which says counting the whole number of people--"
1995.94-1614,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1815.49,1823.014,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1614,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.029,1864.043,"Well, on what basis did the district court go about finding that the Secretary's decision was wrong, as you put it?"
1995.94-1614,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1864.043,1877.801,"The basis was, first of all, 13 days of trial and the consideration of the evidence submitted there, but I think very largely on the basis made of concessions made by the Secretary."
1995.94-1614,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1888.397,1895.433,"Perhaps we should refine what you mean by saying that the district court found the Secretary's decision was, quote, wrong, close quote."
1995.94-1614,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1895.433,1919.638,What the district court said... and this is in the Wisconsin appendix at page 77... the Secretary has conceded that the objective criteria used to measure the adjusted counts show a greater numeric accuracy at the national level and that the Census Bureau estimates of distributive accuracy marginally favored the adjusted counts.
1995.94-1614,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1919.638,1922.009,How does that add up to being wrong?
1995.94-1614,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1922.009,1930.504,"It found... it adds up to being wrong if the standard is, is the corrected count more accurate than the original count, and--"
1995.94-1614,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1930.504,1941.202,"So, you say it's simply a factual inquiry that's up to the district court to decide whether one count was more accurate than the other, regardless of what the Secretary chose to do."
1995.94-1614,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1941.202,1956.371,"--I believe, as I believe the Second Circuit did, that where fundamental constitutional rights are impacted, the court must conduct a more searching inquiry than merely beyond the pale of reason."
1995.94-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1956.371,1957.833,How could that be the test?
1995.94-1614,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1999.0,2000.089,Absolutely.
1995.94-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2000.089,2014.491,"Well, then as soon as you say that, you run into their argument about, you know, who gets the extra Representative, and there are a thousand different ways to do it, and it's undercounted here and overcounted there, and we don't know the true causes of the undercount, et cetera."
1995.94-1614,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2014.491,2056.647,"Well, the... I think the key factors here are that the Census Bureau, the expert agency, to which normally I would suppose considerable deference was due, had spent a great deal of time trying to figure out the solution to the problem, after an enormous amount of effort and a very professional effort had decided that it had figured out the solution, or at least a significant amelioration of the problem, and I must say, Justice Breyer, repeatedly advised the Department of Commerce that there was no other way."
1995.94-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.647,2062.29,"You said to whom a great deference is due, and as soon as we get into a great deference is due, they win."
1995.94-1614,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2062.29,2078.972,"Well, what I'm... I guess what I'm saying is a decision that overthrows, as the Secretary did twice... overthrows the recommendation of the expert agency, when the Secretary himself obviously claims--"
