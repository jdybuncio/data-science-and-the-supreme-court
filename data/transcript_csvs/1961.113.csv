1961.113,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,37.809,"Number 113, Buford Malone, Jr., Petitioner, versus James A. Bowdoin."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,39.137,42.534,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,295.048,298.592,"What does Larson leave of the (Voice Overlap), won't you?"
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,298.592,305.569,"Yes, I think it is left virtually nothing Mr. Justice at least in its application to this type of case."
1961.113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,473.868,477.474,"This is a land on the adminis -- by the Department of Agriculture, is it?"
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,477.474,480.094,"Yes Mr. Justice, the Forest Service."
1961.113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,480.094,481.669,Which is under the Department of Agriculture?
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,481.669,482.465,Yes.
1961.113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,482.465,483.366,Not interior?
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,483.366,487.561,"No, the Forest Service is under the Department of Agriculture."
1961.113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,487.561,490.808,And this is a national forest?
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,490.808,500.036,"The -- at the time of this suit, this was something called “a land utilization project”."
1961.113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,602.479,602.945,They're what?
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,603.718,610.573,"No, no, Mr. -- the respondents do not claim either that the petitioner is acting beyond his authority --"
1961.113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,610.573,610.718,Or --
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,610.718,611.534,-- and the statutory sense --
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,611.534,612.498,Or acting unconstitutionally?
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,612.498,614.536,Or acting unconstitutionally.
1961.113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,627.708,628.619,That he is in possession.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,630.539,631.858,An ejectment that's correct.
1961.113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,635.516,636.553,He's -- he's wrongfully in possession.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,636.553,638.146,He is wrongfully in possession.
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,771.238,802.261,"By his -- by his -- by your statement, his valid authority, you mean that -- you mean to cast to one side the legal position of the United States and merely restrict his doings to that which is within the assumed scope of his responsibility without questioning the authority of his superiors, is that right?"
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,802.261,804.106,"I'm not -- I'm sorry, I'm not clear to your question, Mr. Justice."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,804.106,818.356,"Are you -- when you say his valid authority, if -- if the United States is a tortfeasor then he is -- by tort also a tortfeasor and proceedings could be held against him, couldn't he?"
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,818.356,818.799,Yes.
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,818.799,820.393,Without joining the United States.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,837.066,837.526,That's right.
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,840.252,843.327,He is doing what he is by virtue of his office supposed to be doing.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,843.327,844.453,That is correct.
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,844.453,848.468,That was held in the Lee case to be a jury question.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,848.468,855.757,"Well, Mr. Justice, we think that in the Lee case -- that the Lee case was limited by this Court in the Larson case."
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,891.152,903.382,"And the other reason was the reason given by the Department of Justice below and the District Court, I think, that United States wouldn't be bound in any event."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,903.382,916.11,"Well that -- that was -- I think that was one of the grounds that the United States would not be bound, but in this case, to permit this action to go forward would necessarily have a serious impact upon the government property."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,959.465,964.785,That -- that was -- was that the issue on Lee or the -- or title in issue in Lee?
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,964.785,966.247,"Oh, yes, Mr. Justice."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,966.247,967.986,I thought it was a possessory action.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,967.986,969.898,"Well, it's a possessory action."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,985.734,1003.522,"So that so far as legal issues are concerned, you say Lee was an adjudication of title between the parties to the litigation thought it might not be binding on the United States, same as in this Court, is that right?"
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1003.522,1009.859,"Well, that was the -- the effect in Lee, but we think that the Lee case in light of Larson did no longer --"
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1009.859,1012.106,"But I'm not -- I'm talking about Lee, just to get the --"
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1012.106,1020.176,"Yes, as between Lee, the Court explicitly stated in Lee, that it would be -- adjudication would not bind the United States."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1020.176,1020.252,I haven't read --
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1020.252,1020.737,But --
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1020.737,1026.044,I haven't read Larson but wasn't Lee distinguished on something connected with the Court of Claims?
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1026.044,1055.378,"Well, I -- I was going to add that the Court pointed out in the Larson case that at the time of the Lee decision in 1882, at that time, there was no remedy available to the plaintiffs in the Lee case by which they could obtain compensation for the taking of this property and that -- subsequently there are two, five years later the Tucker Act was passed which did authorize such a suit and then the Court went on in the Larson case to point out that the --"
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1055.378,1061.178,"Nothing like that was suggested of course in Lee, was it?"
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1063.254,1066.043,"No, no, that explanation was not in terms given (Voice Overlap)--"
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1066.043,1068.767,Nobody thought about that in Larson.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1068.767,1070.682,"Well, that maybe Mr. Justice, but that at least --"
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1070.682,1072.673,"I'm not -- I'm asking, I'm not stating."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1072.673,1088.324,"No, Lee did not speak in those terms but Lee did speak -- Lee did speak in terms quite explicitly about the Government having seized the property, the Government holding it and there being no way in which the plaintiffs in the Lee case could obtain just the compensation."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1133.462,1148.321,"Of course that explanation isn't -- isn't one of the rule because the -- the whole point about sovereign immunity is that the sovereign is immune where another -- whereas a non-sovereign wouldn't be and so the sovereign can do a lot of wrongs, but you can't go to a court."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1148.321,1169.694,"Well, but if the sovereign -- if the wrong action of the sovereign through its officer is an unconstitutional action, it is no longer considered the action of the sovereign and when the so -- the officer was acting unconstitutionally is not in effect carrying out properly the sovereign's business and therefore it is not in effect a suit against the sovereign."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1169.694,1175.437,Even though he may merely be a bad constitutional lawyer in carrying what he's told to do.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1175.437,1176.034,That's right.
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1213.032,1217.664,"You don't have to have any reasons, the Constitution precludes this."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1217.664,1218.291,"Well, I was -- I was going to --"
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1218.291,1221.568,"But for this -- as to states, you don't have to have any reason."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1228.413,1229.511,"No, I -- that's correct."
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1249.011,1271.349,"If that would be true -- what the Larson case says about Lee would be true of any ejectment action, wouldn't it, because if the Government is right, the -- the Government has the property without paying compensation if the claimant -- private claimant is right and the Government -- if it wants possession, must pay just compensation."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1271.349,1272.737,That is correct.
1961.113,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1330.165,1332.073,How long your time has elapsed?
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1332.073,1343.128,"Well, the Government acquired the property by deed in 1936 which is -- was 23 years before this action was brought."
1961.113,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1577.686,1584.97,"Do you see any solid basis for distinguishing Larson, any solid basis?"
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1584.97,1588.102,"I do -- I don't think so, Mr. Justice."
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1630.617,1642.275,You're assuming large sections of the -- Chief Justice Vinson's opinion in Larson in which five members of the Court -- in which five members of the Court joined.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1642.275,1642.437,Well --
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1642.437,1644.956,"Well, it could have been an opinion of the court."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1644.956,1647.746,I -- I don't think so Mr. Justice.
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1649.217,1652.073,"Well, I think there were only four that joined they make -- made it five."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1652.073,1654.123,You -- you joined in the opinion of the court.
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1654.123,1658.636,I think there were five -- five for the -- for an opinion including --
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1658.636,1658.927,Including ----
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1658.927,1659.648,the writer of the opinion.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1659.648,1660.951,"Pardon, including yourself."
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1660.951,1663.893,I think there were five including the writer of the opinion.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1663.893,1665.977,That's correct.
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1689.508,1695.785,But you are not without support because there were three members of the court who -- who -- had that -- that view where they dissented.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1695.785,1696.542,That's correct.
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1696.542,1698.983,(Inaudible)Justice Frankfurter.
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1698.983,1703.313,"I -- I start with the Larson case, but before I get to the Larson case."
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1718.88,1721.158,"You'd ask that Lee be overruled, wouldn't you?"
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1721.158,1724.96,"Well, I think we -- we suggest that Lee be distinguished on the ground that --"
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1724.96,1726.524,What would you do with Lee?
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1734.251,1740.157,"I -- I'm not -- I suggest -- I think we would probably ask in both steps, but first, I ask for it to be distinguished --"
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1740.157,1741.947,That too is a part of your opinion.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1741.947,1742.55,That's correct.
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1742.55,1743.256,Or position.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1743.256,1744.681,Yes.
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1745.258,1749.906,I'm in an unhappy position in taking an opinion by five members of the court as the opinion of the court.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1749.906,1750.571,Correctly.
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1750.571,1751.636,Start from there.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1751.636,1752.139,Yes.
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1752.139,1754.05,"Now, what would you do with Lee?"
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1759.801,1760.199,"Well, the distinct --"
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1760.199,1762.028,-- between this case and Lee?
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1762.028,1767.104,The distinction I offer between this case and Lee is perhaps two-fold.
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1777.231,1783.49,"Well, let -- first define what they put so fine that there is a preliminary question."
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1783.49,1784.913,That is a jury question on?
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1784.913,1786.737,That was a jury question.
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1800.856,1805.139,But all your argument as to sovereign immunities makes no difference?
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1805.139,1813.144,"But it's difficult to say that in one case, the tortfeasors and the other case, the officers act unconstitutionally, I don't know what that difference is."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1813.144,1814.696,I don't either.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1814.696,1818.174,"Well, I -- I think the -- I think the distinction is this --"
1961.113,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1818.174,1821.583,"Well, the dissent -- dissenting opinion in Larson emphasized it, isn't it?"
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1821.583,1859.212,"I -- I think I suggest this as the distinction that where the officer acts in a way that it is within his authority, purported authority but in fact, that authority has not been validly conferred in con -- in the constitutional stand, that is the statute under which he acts as unconstitutional or the particular conduct which he engages deprives the plaintiff of his property without due process of law then in that situation, the action of the officer fairly viewed is not the action of the sovereign because he is going beyond his valid authority."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1859.212,1864.827,But you can't tell that until all -- until you go through a lot of reasoning or jury trial and so forth.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1864.827,1865.565,"Well, then -- ma --"
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1865.565,1873.829,"My -- my question to you is, it does not -- is not generated by any -- any interest in the dissent in Larson."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1888.021,1888.337,Well --
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1888.337,1889.36,Which leading of all sorts.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1889.36,1893.337,"I -- I think that as a practical matter, the Lee case has been buried in Larson."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1893.644,1894.781,"Well, shouldn't it be false?"
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1897.754,1901.178,I -- I -- I hope that this maybe the occasion for that.
1961.113,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1902.46,1904.275,That's not always done is it when one --
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1904.275,1905.098,Pardon?
1961.113,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1905.098,1911.486,"That's not always done when one ceases to exist, an opinion or judgment."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1911.486,1933.843,"If I may Mr. Chief Justice, I just like to answer one thing more that Mr. Justice Douglas asked me with respect to the jury trial which is, there may of course be preliminary questions before determining whether the sovereign immunity applies that is whether in fact the officer is acting within his authority or the constitutional questions, but those questions are preliminary questions."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1951.754,1958.616,Do you -- do you think really a question should be put to the jury whether an officer of the United States is acting unconstitutionally?
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1958.616,1959.003,"No, no."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1959.003,1960.453,I think that's really a jury question?
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1960.453,1961.346,"No, no, Mr. -- No, Mr. --"
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1961.346,1966.547,Considering that we split our heads here into deciding that thing and that's because you must have a jury to pass on.
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1966.547,1967.208,"No, Mr. Justice."
1961.113,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1977.549,1979.551,All of which are fictions.
1961.113,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1979.551,1984.147,"Mr. Friedman, you may have five minutes to conclude your argument if you want to."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1984.147,1984.544,Thank you.
1961.113,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1986.396,1986.951,"Yes, yes, you may reserve."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1986.951,1988.714,I think I've completed my direct presentation.
1961.113,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1988.714,1989.997,"Yes, I have that in mind now."
1961.113,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1989.997,1990.535,Thank you.
1961.113,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1990.535,1996.99,"Mr. Mitchell and you may have -- you may have an additional five minutes, too, if you -- if you should desire."
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,1996.99,2003.008,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.113,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2330.839,2335.388,Except that Richard Roe wasn't in that case.
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2335.388,2369.288,"Now, it says it -- I wouldn't -- I haven't read the record in that case, but if I believe if you will check the original record, you possibly will find it was John Doe-Richard Roe because in the opinion it says in the fictitious form as used by the statute of Virginia and our case that is what we call it fictitious but reading the Lee case, you will find it says that it was brought in the fictitious form as provided."
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2378.26,2380.779,Do you think there has been irrelevance with your legal question?
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2380.779,2381.597,Sir?
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2381.926,2384.616,Do you think (Voice Overlap)--
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2384.616,2385.776,"No, sir."
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2535.862,2552.0,"Do you think you'd be in a different situation if Congress had passed the law saying that it wanted this particular land for governmental use and this man had been on it representing them at the time you filed your suit, so far it had been there?"
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2552.0,2558.266,"As I understand, this is not one of the things which the Constitution gives the Government the right to condemn for."
1961.113,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2675.106,2678.174,"I think -- I think before we get to that, we'll recess."
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2678.174,2678.506,Alright.
1961.113,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2678.506,2682.2,-- continue to your argument.
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2682.2,2689.685,"Thank you, sir."
1961.113,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2756.802,2759.351,Did it surprise you that that was a unanimous opinion?
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2759.351,2760.152,Sir?
1961.113,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2760.152,2763.024,Did it surprise you that that was a unanimous opinion?
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2763.024,2769.67,"Well, I thought it would might be a good law and I thought that it should have been what --"
1961.113,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2769.67,2773.601,That's before we really understood what United States against Lee decided.
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2773.601,2774.354,Sir?
1961.113,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2774.354,2779.714,That was before we really understood what United States against Lee really decided.
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2784.414,2788.323,That -- you're referring to Larson?
1961.113,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2788.323,2789.774,Something like that.
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2789.774,2796.056,Do you think your case would be any difference if you have served the post office down in Georgia?
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2796.056,2808.991,"I don't think it would be any difference if the janitor -- if I had a home next to the post office in Georgia and while, for instance, while I'm up here, the janitor went in there and took charge of it."
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2823.324,2826.491,Suppose post office -- was the post office you asserted.
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2837.454,2838.945,If a government -- if a --
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2838.945,2840.025,I'm not saying you couldn't.
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2842.938,2864.122,"I say that law would be analogous say for some children inherited some land and they were just minor small children and the Government went in there and built a post office on their land and then when they became of age, I would say that they could dispossesses the postmaster or somebody."
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2869.26,2874.547,Would you think they could sue the Government for just compensation in taking the property?
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2874.547,2878.664,"Well, I'm afraid we get into what they want us to think about."
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2938.221,2940.297,What was the statute of limitations then?
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2940.297,2942.847,You don't have statute of limitations to land in Georgia.
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2942.847,2943.809,In Georgia?
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2943.809,2945.343,You prescribe against it.
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2945.343,2946.066,You prescribe?
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2946.066,2947.721,"Yes, there's no statute."
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2947.721,2949.958,"What is it, 20 years?"
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2949.958,2951.012,There are two of them.
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2969.304,2970.784,"Well, I shouldn't have asked you that."
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2975.352,2979.648,"Well, I will be glad to go with -- I haven't gotten so much more to say."
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2990.713,2991.977,It's not compulsory.
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2991.977,2992.749,Sir?
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2992.749,2994.072,The time is not compulsory.
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,2995.559,2996.257,"Yes, sir."
1961.113,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3221.502,3233.267,"Well, who you -- just who you are trying to dispossess, Mr. Mitchell, this -- this respondent or -- or I mean this petitioner or the United States Government?"
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,3233.267,3239.328,"We are trying to get rid -- writ of this possession against the petitioner, Mr. Malone."
1961.113,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3239.328,3240.019,"Yes, Now --"
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,3240.019,3254.885,"If we get that, we're going to start to cut some timber on there and you going to hear this voice solely and they're going to do like they did in the Lee case, they're going to come in, and you know the Lee case is a [Inaudible] case."
1961.113,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3287.005,3290.137,They then -- then they'll be chasing you instead you chasing them.
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,3290.137,3291.37,"That's exactly right, sir."
1961.113,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3291.37,3294.173,"But let -- let me ask -- let me ask you this question this, Mr. Mitchell"
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,3294.173,3294.705,"Yes, yes."
1961.113,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3294.705,3296.238,I don't -- I don't ask your position.
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,3296.605,3297.174,I understand.
1961.113,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3297.174,3302.103,-- nor did I ask the other question because I want to know this.
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,3319.569,3320.393,I don't think so.
1961.113,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3335.177,3335.748,Yes.
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,3335.748,3350.195,"Larson I believe I just make a different part in there and -- and go that way or -- in an ejectment suit, it don't make any difference."
1961.113,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3358.969,3360.622,We have cited to keep a writ on that [Inaudible]
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,3360.622,3362.549,"Well, we would not to that."
1961.113,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3374.301,3379.761,"But you're point of having Richard Roe, the -- the nominal person you're trying to [Inaudible] this, is that it?"
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,3379.761,3383.676,"Well, that was done back in 1700 --"
1961.113,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3383.676,3384.081,We're addressing --
1961.113,1,45682,william_buford_mitchell,,3384.081,3392.37,-- and I don't know how to bring it in other way -- we have what we call as Jack Jones form that I don't know.
1961.113,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3876.978,3879.11,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas the Court."
1961.113,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3907.346,3929.229,"When you say statutory authority, Mr. Friedman, except in a very vague and unilluminating way, most, correct me if I'm wrong, you know more about this certainly than I do, but most government officials -- as to most government officials within the statute don't illumine much what their powers are."
1961.113,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3929.229,3941.531,"Well, I think that -- I think that is true but -- there is in every situation -- I mean, well there are certainly areas where it's clear and there are many areas which -- on which is in that situation."
1961.113,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3943.768,3951.331,Are these provisions about the Congress appropriate so much money for so many officials et cetera?
1961.113,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3962.301,3963.281,"Well, but the -- there are --"
1961.113,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3963.281,3974.238,"There shall be a commissioner of these and there shall be commissioner of that and even when they said these duties shall be, they go into the [Inaudible] so far as --"
1961.113,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3974.238,3975.185,But --
1961.113,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3975.185,3990.296,"-- be able to tell from reading the statute, I know a person who did [Inaudible] the Governor of Massachusetts said he went to the revised statute of Massachusetts, looked up all the duties of the Government and he knew what exactly what he should do and what he shouldn't do, but most people haven't got that --"
1961.113,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3990.296,4000.429,"Well, I -- I think Mr. Justice that the Larson case together with the Land case indicate that there are many difficult areas."
1961.113,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4031.275,4036.023,Even in the Federal Tort Act we have all these problems that when he does -- doesn't do anything --
1961.113,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4036.023,4036.291,Very --
1961.113,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4036.291,4036.817,-- within the course of duty.
1961.113,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4036.817,4039.495,Most difficult ones.
