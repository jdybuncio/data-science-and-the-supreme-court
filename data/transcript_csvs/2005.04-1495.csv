2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,8.074,"We'll hear argument now in 04-1495, Hartman against Moore."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,10.972,31.524,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,119.75,128.324,"I'm... I'm not sure why... why we should make the classification that you did, that... that retaliatory is simply a species of... of malicious."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,145.958,147.693,"Well, I... for several reasons."
2005.04-1495,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,156.117,168.334,"But it's... it's a peculiar, if you will, a peculiar malice with its own set of constitutional values, and I don't know of anything comparable in... in malicious prosecution generically."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,168.334,182.898,"--Well, to be sure, what renders it malice or wrongful is the First Amendment, but... but the derivation of... of the reason for why it's wrongful does not, I think, detract from the essential relevance of the tort of malicious prosecution."
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,248.433,248.643,"But, of course, here--"
2005.04-1495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,248.643,264.099,"Suppose there is probable cause for a prosecution, but the prosecutors are extremely busy and they... they have to select their cases and they select one in which they bring the prosecution against the defendant on account of his speech."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,267.671,273.317,"Well, in... in terms... in terms of the responsibilities of the prosecutor, there--"
2005.04-1495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,273.317,273.497,Yes.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,273.497,279.784,"--that... that should not... that should not be a... a selection criterion in itself, but it--"
2005.04-1495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.784,284.98,I'm... I'm asking is it a violation of the prosecutor's professional obligations and his professional duties?
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,284.98,287.618,"--Well, I... I would think ordinarily yes, but with this caveat."
2005.04-1495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,334.209,350.538,"Just going back to the hypothetical, if... if you acknowledge... and I think you must... that there's a violation of the prosecutorial duty in... in the instance I suppose, then why shouldn't the law recognize it and... and give force to that sanction and give force to that rule?"
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,350.538,356.948,"Well, there... there are certain restrictions... certainly restrictions on what the prosecutor may do, but several points about that."
2005.04-1495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,369.955,370.336,All right.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,382.35,408.147,"--Well, the... the question is whether in that circumstance the... the Bivens plaintiff, the criminal defendant, has a First Amendment right to be excused from prosecution or, after the prosecution is unsuccessful, to bring a civil action, whether he has a right not to have been prosecuted in those circumstances notwithstanding the existence of probable cause and the independent judgment by the prosecutor."
2005.04-1495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,408.147,411.466,"Well, does he have a right not to be singled out because of his speech?"
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,411.466,421.335,He does... he does not have a... he does not have a First Amendment claim in those circumstances where there is probable cause for the violation.
2005.04-1495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,421.645,424.733,I asked does he have a right not to be singled out because of his speech.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,424.733,429.797,--He does not have a First Amendment right not to be singled out in those circumstances.
2005.04-1495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,429.797,440.187,"In other words, you... you would advise law enforcement officials that they can single out persons for prosecution based on distasteful speech."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,440.187,440.958,I would not.
2005.04-1495,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,445.563,447.548,What I want you to do is to agree.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,464.617,465.291,--Right.
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,471.297,473.783,"--And you're not disputing either, as I understand it."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,481.075,485.178,--I... it is... we certainly disagree with that with our proposition.
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,485.178,487.043,But don't you assume that for the purposes of your argument?
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,487.043,491.205,"For... for purposes of our probable... probable cause claim, yes."
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,491.205,491.756,"Well, that's the only argument."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,491.756,496.7,"That... that is true, but that, of course, was also true at common law for... for malicious prosecution."
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,496.7,503.059,"But the... one of the differences... am I not correct, that at common law the prosecutor did not have absolute immunity?"
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,503.059,506.468,"At common law... at common law, yes."
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,515.285,516.558,"Now does, but not at common law."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,516.558,518.663,--under these Court's... under this Court's decisions.
2005.04-1495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,565.642,566.065,Mr.--
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,566.065,573.186,"Well, they're not totally identical because you didn't have the First Amendment interest involved in those cases, whereas you do have a First Amendment interest at stake here."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,573.186,579.505,"But... but on... on the... on the governmental interest side of the balance, the interests are exactly the same in both... in both circumstances."
2005.04-1495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,596.978,602.804,"--Mr. Kneedler, may... would you clarify just one point about this probable cause?"
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,634.848,652.24,"Well, at... at common law under the tort of malicious prosecution, the indictment created a presumption because an indictment does have to depend upon probable cause, and under the... under this Court's decision in Gerstein v. Pugh and other decisions, that can't be reexamined by the court in the prosecution."
2005.04-1495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,666.624,669.603,"Well, tell me about now, not at the common law."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,669.603,669.944,--Yes.
2005.04-1495,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,677.898,679.503,But the grand jury did find probable cause.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,689.19,699.521,"--We... we think in a... in a... it would have to show by at least a preponderance of the evidence, maybe a clear showing, that there was not probable cause."
2005.04-1495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,721.998,747.754,"The case that comes closest, as far as I can see, is probably United States v. Armstrong, and in that case, this Court said in the ordinary case, so long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe the offense was committed, the decision to prosecute or go before a grand jury rests entirely in his discretion."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,774.974,777.329,"Yes, clear evidence, and the Court stressed that it was a--"
2005.04-1495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,777.329,778.14,--to the contrary.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,781.882,785.703,"--Well, I... I think several things may explain that."
2005.04-1495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,789.675,790.706,Based on race.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,790.706,791.43,--Based on race.
2005.04-1495,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,794.018,796.374,So why should that be different than the First Amendment violation?
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,796.374,816.002,"--Well, as... as this Court's decision in... in Johnson, for example, shows, there... distinctions based on race are subject to strict scrutiny no matter what the context, in that case even in the prison context, whereas First Amendment claims often take account of the context in which they are raised."
2005.04-1495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.699,855.6,"But you're willing to acknowledge... and... and the Government concedes that you can have a different standard when the... the basis for the selective prosecution happens to violate the Constitution from the standard you apply where the basis for the selective prosecution doesn't violate the Constitution, such as I'm prosecuting him because he was mean to my brother in law."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,857.375,858.186,No.
2005.04-1495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.186,863.311,Would you apply a different standard there than you would apply where... where the reason is some First Amendment reason?
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,863.311,864.432,"Well, no."
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,889.238,890.159,But that doesn't--
2005.04-1495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,890.159,891.06,But would you answer my question?
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.06,891.22,--Yes.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,891.22,893.416,--I'm... I'm not sure that I... maybe... I guess I--
2005.04-1495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.416,902.383,"It would be a different criterion... you... you say it's going to be different for the First Amendment and the... and... and the Equal Protection Clause, at least where race is involved."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,911.621,912.583,"--No, I don't... I don't--"
2005.04-1495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,912.583,913.253,Is there going to be a different standard--
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,913.253,913.443,--No.
2005.04-1495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.216,921.707,"--Exactly, and would you apply a different standard because there isn't a constitutional claim?"
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,921.707,921.897,--No.
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,924.383,925.495,--a malicious prosecution claim.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,927.121,936.346,"There... there... and in the... in the Federal sphere, if there was a malicious... a common law malicious prosecution claim, that would have to be brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act against the United States."
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.346,948.793,"But, Mr. Kneedler, I understand your argument to be they should be treated just like a malicious prosecution claim, which is no distinction between a constitutional basis and a common... and just that he hated his brother in law."
2005.04-1495,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,953.909,954.26,That's what I'm asking.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,954.26,954.55,"Well, yes."
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,957.177,959.886,Which places no weight at all on the fact the Constitution is involved.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,959.886,968.101,"--Oh... oh, it does because the... because the... the first... the existence of the First Amendment claim is what gives you the Bivens cause of action in the first place."
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,972.263,979.474,"That's how you'd get at least as much protection as if it was an ordinary malicious prosecution claim, but you don't get any more under your view."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,979.474,992.081,"No, because... and... and again, this... this is... this is because of the... of the background of the common law tort of malicious prosecution, which strikes exactly the balance that I... that I'm talking about."
2005.04-1495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,992.081,993.225,But you really want three things.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1013.666,1013.958,Well--
2005.04-1495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.958,1019.334,"It sounds a little bit like the person who has the overcoat, turns up the heat, you know, five or... what about one?"
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1019.334,1019.634,--The... the--
2005.04-1495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1019.634,1020.285,What about this one?
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1042.349,1042.75,--No.
2005.04-1495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1054.808,1070.232,"So as far as you know, every State and every jurisdiction where... and investigators if they don't have absolutely immunity, whatever... in all those jurisdictions, nobody has ever said that even a constitutional violation, if there's probable cause, that's the end of it."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1070.232,1073.371,"--Well, I'm... I'm focusing on the tort of malicious prosecution which is--"
2005.04-1495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1073.371,1073.891,"Oh, I'm not focusing."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1073.891,1074.382,--which--
2005.04-1495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1074.382,1074.643,I want to know--
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1074.643,1075.093,--Yes.
2005.04-1495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1075.093,1075.926,--if--
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1075.926,1078.995,I'm not... I'm not aware... I'm not aware that any jurisdiction has done that.
2005.04-1495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1101.653,1102.774,--We have no experience.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1140.478,1142.394,"--There... there was much, much more evidence."
2005.04-1495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1142.394,1143.486,"Well, I didn't see any in the brief."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1143.486,1143.588,There--
2005.04-1495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1143.588,1146.164,"I saw a lot about other people in the brief, but not about him."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1146.164,1150.799,"--Well, for one thing, it's absolutely conceded that there was a conspiracy."
2005.04-1495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1152.584,1154.919,There are all kinds of things about other people.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1154.919,1155.7,"--No, but... but--"
2005.04-1495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1155.7,1156.373,I didn't--
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1156.373,1158.899,--the... it isn't all about other people.
2005.04-1495,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1173.906,1177.195,--I would like you to limit yourself to what I didn't concede.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1191.408,1191.829,Yes.
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.301,1253.354,"Mr. Kneedler, I know you're responding to Justice Breyer's question, but I think for purposes of our decision, we're not supposed to decide whether there was probable cause or not, but we're to give you the opportunity to prove there was if... if you win on your--"
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1253.354,1257.486,"Yes, although I... I certainly do not want to leave the misimpression that... and there is... there is much more."
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.486,1261.567,"--But that's a disputed issue, and we don't have to decide the probable cause issue."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1262.399,1270.631,"That... that... you do not have... you do not have to decide it, but I would certainly urge the Court not to proceed on the assumption or make any comments that there is because there were... there were--"
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1270.631,1284.983,"But because the other side is arguing that even if there is probable cause, the burden shifts when they prove the retaliatory motive, and you have to prove that you would never... you made... you would have brought the prosecution even if there had been no retaliatory motive."
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1285.423,1286.094,"--Right, and that is their position."
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1289.934,1300.454,--And the question I would ask is why should this be different from a wrongful discharge case in which there's ample cause to discharge and the issue boils down to whether or not he would have been discharged anyway.
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1302.309,1305.83,--What is very different is that this is the prosecutorial function.
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1341.065,1351.759,"Wouldn't... wouldn't all those considerations justify a rule that makes the burden of proving the retaliatory motive very high, say, maybe it has to be by clear and convincing evidence or something like that?"
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1361.808,1364.736,"--Well... oh, not... we do not think there is strong evidence of retaliatory motive."
2005.04-1495,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1367.765,1368.025,And if you had a--
2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1368.025,1367.996,--but--

2005.04-1495,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1417.051,1417.872,I don't think erroneous.

I think that's a very important point, and before a... a court enters into that, in the end, unknowable question, maybe a court can... can, in the end, determine probabilities, but before a court undertakes that, which requires looking not simply at the motivation of the... of the law enforcement officers, but the prosecutor and... and who knows whether the grand jury would have returned an indictment, and yet a court certainly couldn't be expected to inquire into that."

2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.664,1734.904,Right.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,1734.904,1747.041,The test that I would propose is the very test that this Court set forth in Harlow against Fitzgerald because we're here really on a very limited issue of qualified immunity.

2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,1773.301,1784.154,--I think what they are saying is the defense of qualified immunity should be available if there should be probable cause for the action that was taken here.

2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1802.307,1809.017,"Well, but there are two questions in the cert petition and it's the second one that's the qualified immunity issue, and the first one is whether there's a cause of action."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,1809.017,1809.327,All right.
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1827.753,1844.545,But the difficulty I think we're all having with it is that the qualified immunity issue and the standard to which you are... are adverting responds to a question that doesn't arise unless we first assume that there is... that there is a constitutional violation.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,1844.545,1844.766,That's correct.
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1844.766,1850.191,And our questions are what is the standard for determining the constitutional violation.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,1853.17,1858.546,The standard that is to be set forth to determine whether there is a constitutional violation is that that this Court applied in Mt.

2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2021.603,2022.414,But see--
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.414,2023.435,And that's what he's arguing for here.

2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2039.483,2042.585,Leaving... is there anything you can say before I give up on this?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2085.712,2086.072,Yes.

2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.131,2120.073,Which opinion are you talking about?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2120.575,2122.229,The opinion in Crawford El against Britton.
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2122.229,2122.71,Okay.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2122.71,2141.728,"There, the Court held that if there are factually specific allegations that would indicate a violation of the Constitution, that at that point the court may consider whether some additional discovery should be permitted even if there should be an independently valid basis."

2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.497,2146.078,It... it was a suit against a prison.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2146.078,2150.611,--It provides the same framework for the proper analysis of a claim of this kind.
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.611,2152.866,"No, but... but we treat prosecutions quite differently."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2160.83,2161.351,That's--
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.351,2165.845,This is a specially dangerous area in which to allow litigation.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2165.845,2173.217,"--It is far less dangerous, Your Honor, than when this is asserted by way of defense in the middle of an ongoing criminal prosecution."

2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2211.273,2218.554,They would have to prove that something other than hostility to protected speech was the reason for the prosecution being advanced.
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2218.554,2224.773,--And it would not be enough to show that the prosecution would have gone forward anyway.

2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2231.12,2231.41,Yes.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2231.41,2234.879,--the Government claims there is an objectively valid basis for the action they action they would take.
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2234.879,2235.16,Right.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2235.16,2245.982,"Then if the plaintiff has made a showing that there was an improper motivation, the burden shifts to the Government to show that the prosecution would have proceeded absent the illicit intent."

2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2279.35,2279.562,"Well, as--"
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.562,2280.564,It had nothing to do with--
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2280.564,2286.484,"--as... as you pointed out earlier, probable cause is not the standard that governs the investigator's conduct."
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2294.235,2307.076,"Well, they did, but wouldn't you have to prove under your standard not that they would have procured or tried to procure it anyway, but that in fact the prosecutor would have prosecuted anyway?"

2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2315.56,2318.027,--with a prosecutor who has absolute immunity.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2318.027,2319.732,"--Well, the prosecutor has absolute immunity."
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2327.113,2327.503,No.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2327.644,2331.123,The burden would shift once the illegal motivation is shown.
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.462,2338.676,But would it... would it have been a complete defense?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2352.267,2353.18,It shouldn't be the end of the case.
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2356.77,2361.114,But... but the question is the motivation for his decision to bring the case.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2361.114,2363.058,The motivation for his decision--
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2363.058,2364.413,And he says I... I would have brought it anyway.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2364.413,2373.52,"--But in this case, the prosecutor's decision to bring these charges to the grand jury I don't think has any probative force whatsoever."
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2373.52,2374.121,--Why--
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.121,2376.479,--Do you think the defendant can subpoena the prosecutor?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2376.479,2377.573,Of course.
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.573,2378.675,Why?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2380.772,2382.276,"The prosecutor is not a defendant, Your Honor."
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2382.276,2392.425,"You say he... he can't be brought into court to defend his own... his own judgment, but he can be brought into court when... when an investigator is sued in... in order to take his testimony as to what would have happened?"
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2392.425,2406.597,His testimony was taken in this case and can be taken in this case because at that point in these proceedings... and you have to look at the evidence of record to this point in this proceeding... there is very clear evidence of retaliation as a motive for this prosecution.
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.597,2419.317,"Well, he may have done it voluntarily here, but I find it hard to believe that he could be subpoenaed, when... when he has absolute immunity from suit against himself, to testify in a suit against somebody else."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2420.67,2425.112,"Your Honor, the fact that he has absolute immunity does not immunize him from giving testimony in the case."
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2425.112,2425.513,So he's a witness.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2426.046,2427.39,He's a... he's a witness.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2427.39,2430.128,--Suppose that the person is convicted.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2430.128,2432.263,Suppose the person is convicted.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2432.263,2432.583,Yes.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2433.797,2437.639,"Well, Heck against Humphrey I think would stand in the way of that, Your Honor."
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2437.639,2438.35,Really?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2441.249,2442.261,"Well, it's not a simple case."
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2442.261,2447.628,"So you say that if he's convicted, after all, he may have been convicted but it may be because of the retaliatory motive."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2447.628,2453.604,"Well, if he is convicted and a civil action for damages is then brought--"
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2453.604,2453.938,Yes.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2453.938,2456.536,--then I think you are in the framework of Heck against Humphrey--
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2456.536,2456.896,All right.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2457.297,2457.818,--where the court--
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2457.818,2460.035,"--if he's convicted, that's the end of it--"
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2460.035,2460.235,--No.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2460.235,2461.77,--whether there was a retaliatory motive or not.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2461.77,2462.512,No.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2478.661,2480.066,"Oh, that's 1983."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2480.066,2494.637,"The Court went on to say, however, that if the civil damage action would not necessarily impugn the conviction, that the case could proceed even though there had not been a favorable termination, reversal, or expungement--"
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2494.637,2494.72,All right.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2495.401,2495.741,--of the conviction.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2495.741,2511.939,"--he brings his action and he says here I am 20 years in prison and I agree I'm guilty, but they never would have prosecuted me without the fact that they hate the Hell's Angels and they, in fact, criticize everything that we say."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2511.939,2514.125,I don't think that action would be permitted to proceed.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2514.125,2514.316,Because?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2514.316,2516.974,It would be viewed as a collateral attack on an outstanding conviction.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2516.974,2517.164,"No, no."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2521.748,2522.549,I... I don't think--
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2522.549,2524.055,--I won't force you into that.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2524.055,2524.676,"--with all due respect, Your Honor, that's a real world example."
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2524.676,2527.283,I'll take basically virtually never if he's convicted.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2537.846,2538.046,That's right.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2558.959,2560.451,"Now, you're... you're in the cases, but I'm... I'm trying to pursue this."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2561.472,2561.683,Yes.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2561.683,2563.399,--which is I would like to say one word about this.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2612.252,2612.843,Yes.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2612.843,2615.01,--weed out the sheep from the lambs--
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2615.01,2615.822,And I--
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2615.822,2617.385,--the goats from the sheep or whatever--
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2617.385,2617.638,--Your Honor--
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2617.638,2618.369,--in that area?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2618.369,2638.16,"--I submit the screen is that set forth by this Court in Harlow, which is an objective standard and which is whether the conduct involved violated a clearly established statutory or constitutional right of which a reasonably prudent law enforcement officer or Government official should be aware."
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2647.435,2648.992,"--So the... the screen, in effect, is--"
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2648.992,2649.172,--And is a screening.
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2649.172,2650.696,--the qualified immunity screen.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2650.696,2651.136,That's right.
2005.04-1495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2660.815,2671.779,"Have there been cases where in the context of the prosecution, there's been a motion to dismiss the prosecution because it was brought in retaliation for the exercise of the First Amendment right?"
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2671.779,2675.55,"This Court has not decided what the proper remedy would be there, Your Honor."
2005.04-1495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2676.041,2677.525,Have there been cases in the other courts?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2677.525,2680.916,--I'm not aware of any cases where that has succeeded except at the circuit court level--
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2680.916,2682.04,"No, but it did in the Armstrong--"
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2682.04,2684.024,--where the conviction has been invalidated for that reason.
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2684.024,2687.516,"--But in the race context, it is a dismissal of the prosecution itself."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2688.307,2689.521,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.923,2691.636,--with Harlow here.
2005.04-1495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2691.636,2693.791,My... my question was directed to the First Amendment.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2693.791,2694.897,For the First Amendment.
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2699.741,2700.273,"--Well... well, surely the prosecution--"
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2700.273,2701.987,"--in the circuit courts of appeals, Your Honor."
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.987,2705.316,--Surely the prosecution would go ahead if there were probable cause.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2710.771,2711.254,"Well, the question--"
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2711.254,2721.485,"You mean to say if there was... if there was perfect probable cause for the prosecution, that you can stop the prosecution in its tracks by... by an allegation of the First Amendment violation?"
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2721.485,2723.21,--You can move for dismissal of the charges.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2748.376,2749.568,But that... that's true.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2770.366,2771.007,That's this case.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.007,2775.99,"In that circumstance, suppose you say we cannot even allow discovery."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2803.284,2804.055,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2804.275,2807.153,"And if you don't show that as a... as a threshold, you don't even get discovery."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2807.153,2809.879,--We don't... that is exactly the Harlow standard.
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2817.683,2824.867,"But if you turn the Harlow standard around... I mean, you're... you're making the... the negation of the Harlow standard the screening device--"
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2824.867,2825.839,Exactly.
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2825.839,2826.3,--in Justice Breyer's example.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2826.3,2826.79,Exactly.
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2826.79,2827.2,Yes.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2827.2,2831.232,That's the threshold determination in a Bivens action of this kind.
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2831.232,2835.324,"Mr. McCartan, what was the 1887 case or 1880--"
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2835.324,2836.436,Yick Wo against Hopkins.
2005.04-1495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2836.436,2836.848,Yick Wo.
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.848,2838.743,--I thought you said Armstrong.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2838.743,2838.993,"No, no."
2005.04-1495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2839.414,2839.604,Yick Wo.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2839.604,2841.821,"--much more recently, but Yick Wo against Hopkins."
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2841.821,2842.022,I thought it was--
2005.04-1495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2842.022,2844.328,Let... let me ask you this.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2865.127,2868.786,"The result is that's a question of causation, Your Honor, if there is evidence."
2005.04-1495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2868.786,2868.928,That's why--
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2868.928,2869.749,Yes.
2005.04-1495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2883.561,2887.815,"--Suppose the prosecutor said, you shouldn't have brought this to me because you... you're... you're motivated by the First Amendment."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2891.344,2900.392,--That's the evidence the Government can bring forward when the burden of proof shifts upon a showing of an illegal or unconstitutional motive for bringing the prosecution to begin with.
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2906.509,2908.656,And if the burden does shift that way--
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2908.656,2909.34,--Exactly.
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2909.34,2915.92,--wouldn't it be consistent with the screening mechanism that Justice Breyer suggested and... and that you accepted?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2942.157,2942.387,Exactly.
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2942.387,2942.577,Okay.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2942.577,2945.205,"Because the prosecutor has immunity, cannot be a defendant in the case."
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2945.205,2945.445,All right.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2947.16,2947.801,"No, absolutely."
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2947.801,2948.342,--to make sure I understand it.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2972.454,2983.356,"Well, I think that is a significant distinction, Your Honor, but I think we have to establish that they procured the prosecution and that it did proceed by reasons of the illegal motivation and not for some independently objective standard."
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.356,2986.344,"--Right, because the prosecutor could have gotten a lot of other information from other people."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2986.344,2986.555,Absolutely.
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2986.555,2991.341,And you're not going to throw out the prosecution just because this one piece of information was bad.
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2991.341,2992.042,So it's a dual--
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2992.042,2994.329,Consider too what the facts of record are here.
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3040.417,3043.946,May I go back to one question Justice O'Connor asked you earlier?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3052.613,3056.002,"There... there is precedent in the courts of appeals, Your Honor."
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3062.803,3066.205,But a violation of First Amendment rights or--
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3066.205,3066.786,First Amendment rights.
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3071.581,3079.112,"--And... and were those cases in which the prosecution itself was brought to a halt, or were they post prosecution damage actions?"
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3079.112,3079.854,Post prosecution.
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3085.19,3085.483,The conviction.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3085.483,3086.004,--based upon the violation--
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.004,3088.832,But is there any precedent for a damage action of this kind?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3088.832,3090.859,"--Well, Bivens is."
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.859,3092.261,"Well, but not quite."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3104.087,3107.507,"I'm not aware, Your Honor, of any precedents--"
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.507,3107.788,I'm not either.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3107.788,3112.122,--in the three circuits where probable cause is not a bar to an action of that kind.
2005.04-1495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3112.122,3121.199,"Now, that... that means one of two things, either what you're arguing for is not going to bring a flood of litigation, or everyone has assumed that probable cause is a... is a requirement."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3121.199,3133.345,"Well, I think it would be the former rather than the latter, Your Honor, since probable cause does not distinguish between what may be an unconstitutional act on the part of the Government and one that might be motivated by a legitimate grievance."
2005.04-1495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3133.345,3136.915,"Well, but... but I'm not sure that that proposition has been established in the cases."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3136.915,3141.207,"No, Your Honor, and that's why I think this case is before this Court at this time."
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3141.207,3149.852,Neither... neither does absolute immunity for the prosecutor distinguish between whether the prosecutor was acting just illegally or just acting unconstitutionally.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3150.743,3152.57,If I may--
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3152.57,3153.454,You apply the same rule there.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3153.454,3154.647,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3157.906,3178.428,"Yes, well, your... your point that... that there... there has to be a difference between whether there's a constitutional violation or not in this context seems to me not well taken because we don't make that distinction in the context of giving absolute immunity to the prosecutor."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3183.463,3194.537,"But as Justice Souter brought... questioned whether the prosecution was procured for unconstitutional reasons, the immunity of the prosecutor has nothing to do with the reasons for which the prosecution is brought."
2005.04-1495,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3201.406,3201.797,"No, no."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3216.109,3216.081,No.
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3233.241,3234.605,May I ask this question?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3246.761,3250.45,"--Well, certainly that would be a question for the jury, Your Honor, absence of probable cause."
2005.04-1495,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3250.45,3252.238,"Yes, but the case wouldn't be over if you lose here."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3252.238,3254.223,"Well, it depends on what ground we would lose here."
2005.04-1495,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.655,3267.012,"I wouldn't worry a lot about that, Mr.--"
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3267.012,3267.233,--All right.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3357.414,3359.119,I'd like to ask you one other question.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3368.827,3369.73,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3369.73,3374.896,What happens when the same claim is made in the middle of a trial that I... whether I'm guilty or innocent?
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3385.276,3387.253,"Well, if he were foolish enough to make such a claim--"
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3387.253,3388.777,"Well, no, he believes it."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3388.777,3394.824,--I can't believe that a defendant in a criminal prosecution who is acquitted in a subsequent civil suit--
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3394.824,3394.985,"No, no."
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3395.596,3397.201,"--Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3397.753,3399.938,He's in the middle of trial and he wants to say--
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3399.938,3402.887,"Well, I don't think he'd be in the middle of trial under Heck against Humphrey."
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3402.887,3404.701,--It's the criminal trial.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3404.701,3405.412,--It's a criminal trial.
2005.04-1495,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3405.412,3407.629,The original criminal trial.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3407.629,3408.841,"He's in a criminal trial, and what he wants--"
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3408.841,3410.487,This is not a civil action for damages.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3410.487,3411.058,--No.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3411.058,3411.829,This is a criminal case.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3411.829,3414.587,They read our opinion which holds in your favor.
2005.04-1495,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,3427.925,3429.863,That would not suffice.
2005.04-1495,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3429.863,3430.554,Because?
