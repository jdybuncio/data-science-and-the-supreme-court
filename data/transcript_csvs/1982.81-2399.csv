1982.81-2399,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.089,We will hear arguments first this morning in Metropolitan Edison against People Against Nuclear Energy.
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,17.132,28.657,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear power reactor, TMI 1."
1982.81-2399,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,167.367,184.111,"Well, isn't the question here whether the Act of Congress and Congress itself intended that that be a subject of the inquiry, rather than whether in fact anxiety is aroused by these problems?"
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,184.111,185.063,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-2399,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,234.462,237.773,"Mr. Bator, can I ask you about your hypothetical?"
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,254.062,255.045,We are saying--
1982.81-2399,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,255.045,257.684,Then you are arguing that psychological health is not health.
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,257.684,259.028,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-2399,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,263.369,269.773,And you are saying you don't have to look at it even if it's caused by a change in the environment?
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,271.929,287.157,"No, our argument, Justice Stevens, is that there are two sorts of health impairments, including mental health impairments, that must be kept distinct."
1982.81-2399,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,309.583,310.304,"Well, that is your fluoride case."
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,313.693,322.72,"No, our argument, Your Honor, is that the... maybe I... maybe another illustration would help."
1982.81-2399,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,322.72,323.219,I think maybe--
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,323.219,332.481,"Because the role in which mental health can come in is if there is a direct, almost a traumatic consequence."
1982.81-2399,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,373.839,393.067,"--What you are saying, I take it, is that you don't need committees and parades and pickets to draw attention to the vibration and the noise of an airplane going over at 300, 400, 500 feet or 1,000 feet, and that that is quite a different thing."
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,393.067,400.656,"Yes, we believe it is quite a different thing really for a number of very, we submit, very profound reasons."
1982.81-2399,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,612.582,618.83,"There is no question, is there, that the impact statement would have to consider the possibility of another accident?"
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,618.83,620.205,"Yes, and in fact, did."
1982.81-2399,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,997.963,1005.225,"Mr. Bator, I think that I am having some difficulty understanding the line that you want to draw here."
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1050.366,1061.705,"Justice O'Connor, the line we would seek to draw and that we hope to persuade the Court to draw is really the line that is given to us by the statute."
1982.81-2399,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1144.749,1156.9,"--I take it that your... the other side urges that without proving any change whatsoever in the environment, or any threatened change, that anxiety is--"
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1156.9,1162.101,"Yes, there are many, many government actions that create anxiety."
1982.81-2399,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1215.497,1218.34,"--You would analogize this, I guess, to building a prison."
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1223.759,1232.226,We believe that people's anxieties about the crime rate and about prison escapes are not an environmental impact.
1982.81-2399,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1234.207,1239.924,"Well, is the fact of escapes, the possibility of escapes from a prison an environmental impact?"
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1239.924,1251.014,"The... there is at least one Court of Appeals opinion that has indicated, at least, that that may be."
1982.81-2399,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1251.014,1253.17,What is the government's position?
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1253.17,1263.289,"The government is not absolutely overjoyed by that proposition, but we think that in any event it is wholly distinguishable from this one."
1982.81-2399,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1313.878,1323.123,"Well, the line that you stated in response to Justice O'Connor's question like, I suppose, most other lines, kind of blurs in places."
1982.81-2399,0,37751,paul_m_bator,,1323.123,1323.907,Yes.
1982.81-2399,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1335.778,1337.26,Very well.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,1340.901,1348.521,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1494.242,1496.352,"Mr. Jordan, where is that statute set out?"
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,1498.352,1500.146,"Yes, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-2399,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1571.784,1582.562,"Mr. Jordan, can you give me just an idea of what would alleviate the anxiety in this case?"
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,1582.562,1589.151,"--Well, that, of course, would be a matter for the Commission when the case goes back there."
1982.81-2399,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1612.735,1614.454,Is that forever?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,1614.454,1622.827,"In our view, if you didn't start... if you never started TMI 1, the health damage would never occur."
1982.81-2399,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1625.904,1633.041,So the only way that your clients can be satisfied is to just keep it shut down forever.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,1635.353,1646.268,"--Well, as a matter of law here, Justice Marshall, the question before the Commission in dealing with the facts will be what is... what should we do about this health damage that will occur?"
1982.81-2399,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1652.079,1656.156,"Assuming that I am the Commission, and I am asking you, what would your answer be?"
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,1656.156,1679.067,"--We would argue to the Commission as a matter of fact that the seriousness is so great that in fact the reactor should not be restarted, but I believe we would also argue to the Commission that if it did not reach that determination, there are a number of other mitigative actions that it might take, and those have been discussed by amicus... American Psychological Association in this case, for example."
1982.81-2399,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1712.318,1741.21,"But is it not so that psychiatrists or psychologist will tell you... they have written it, surely... that a subject like the placing of Pershing missiles in NATO countries in Europe causes great anxiety to some people, to the point where they can't cope with daily life as a result of the prospect of putting Pershing missiles in Germany and various other places."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,1751.457,1753.193,"No, I don't think it does at all."
1982.81-2399,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1755.626,1760.127,Your people don't want this plant at this site at all.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,1761.141,1775.307,"--That... My clients would prefer that this plant not restart, but that is not... that does not answer the question of whether the one or even ten psychiatrists who all believe the same thing control the outcome."
1982.81-2399,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1794.364,1801.906,"My thought was directed at the Presidential Commission comments that you reported, widespread apprehension."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,1811.745,1828.021,"I have never heard, Your Honor... That is a question of fact that I can't answer, but I have never heard of psychological health damage occurring as a result of widespread apprehension of fluoridation, but I think to take the fluoridation example it may be useful."
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.152,1890.963,Mr. Jordan?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,1890.963,1891.493,--Sir.
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.493,1913.794,"What if the government puts in an airport right adjacent to a city, and makes the environmental statement and so forth, and ultimately the airport is constructed, and there is considerable noise that would have required an environmental statement, and then the airport is shut down for, say, six months or a year."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,1921.324,1931.662,I... that is... we are assuming there are no changes in the way the airport is operated.
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.662,1932.114,Yes.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,1932.114,1935.332,The environmental effects are all the same.
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1996.073,1999.446,Is an assessment the same as an EIS?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,1999.446,2000.866,"No, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-2399,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2013.687,2014.783,Mr. Jordan.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2015.703,2016.374,"Yes, Justice Marshall."
1982.81-2399,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2016.374,2021.764,"Isn't the real difference that there was an accident here, and there wasn't an accident at the airport?"
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2021.764,2024.997,"Well, I think that--"
1982.81-2399,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2024.997,2028.588,Isn't there any significance to the fact that there was an accident here?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2028.588,2029.341,--Absolutely.
1982.81-2399,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2031.934,2032.917,"Well, you've been hiding it."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2032.917,2033.557,I'm sorry?
1982.81-2399,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2033.557,2035.774,You've been hiding it as the answer to this question.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2035.774,2036.476,Not at all.
1982.81-2399,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2038.598,2039.647,I see.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2040.208,2041.176,The second--
1982.81-2399,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2041.176,2046.081,"When you get to that, tell us how many people were injured and how many people were killed in that accident."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2046.081,2046.798,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2175.778,2181.51,But how about in your drug that might cause cancer example?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2195.673,2199.238,"You may have misread my example, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2213.12,2218.556,"Well, let's take the environmental impact, and the potential for causing cancer."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2218.556,2219.055,Yes.
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2219.055,2228.523,Would the environmental impact statement also have to cover the psychological fear that cancer might be caused?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2228.523,2231.584,"Again, I think it is important to make the distinction."
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2246.359,2247.732,"Well, but the damage to health you are talking about--"
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2247.732,2248.138,--Yes.
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2248.138,2249.92,"--comes from fear, doesn't it?"
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2252.092,2259.961,"Really, that's a question for a scientist to answer."
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2316.719,2338.555,"So you say if a threshold showing were made that psychological damage resulting in fear of the cancer were made, the environmental impact statement would have to cover not only the potential for causing cancer, but the psychological effect of fear of cancer?"
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2338.555,2367.419,"If people will be psychologically... their health will be damaged by a federal action affecting their environment, and there is a real... a basis for that showing, and the agency has established... and in fact, I think the agency here has established a threshold showing requirement of the pre-existing... a previous accident, of pre-existing traumatic population."
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2383.536,2393.266,"Well, the... I take it... you said the agency has to respond to a showing by a group such as yours since the agency certainly didn't try to establish the thing."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2395.235,2401.576,"Well, and we believe in fact if that... if the showing is made--"
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2401.576,2403.654,The agency has to respond.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2403.654,2408.446,"--the agency has to respond, but it does have the authority to set that threshold."
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2408.446,2426.458,"Supposing that the government is contemplating a public housing development in a neighborhood where a great many neighbors oppose public housing, and genuinely fear what the effect of public housing is going to be on the value of their houses, their neighborhood, and the like."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2447.683,2455.241,"No, and in fact I think that gives us a good place to see the distinction."
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2472.406,2484.464,"Well, but that is certainly a change in the environment, and the change is thought by some... is feared by some people, and you can get a doctor to testify that there is psychological damage."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2484.464,2493.397,"I would suggest that that in fact is not, and we have argued in the brief that that is not a change in the environment under NEPA."
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2493.397,2497.161,"Well, where is the bright line, or at least a gray line?"
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2497.161,2502.471,"Well, I think there is... the bright line can be drawn between that example and the case before you now."
1982.81-2399,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2515.234,2517.683,Why isn't the construction of housing a physical change?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2519.559,2533.898,"--Well, I think the construction of housing... construction of housing is a physical change, but it has not the slightest relationship by itself to the effect of the psychological damage."
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2534.725,2537.1,"Well, I know, but the doctor testifies it does."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2537.1,2542.909,--I don't think the doctor would testify that constructing the housing is what causes the damage.
1982.81-2399,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2542.909,2548.501,Suppose instead of housing it were a prison for irreconcilables.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2548.501,2576.005,"Well, what was held in... assuming they were irreconcilables... I don't think they were... but in the Hanly v. Kleindienst case, the second of the two Hanly cases, the Court held there that the agency needed to examine the likelihood of an increase in crime in that neighborhood."
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2621.768,2624.03,Does NEPA specify crime?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2624.03,2629.28,"--I believe NEPA... Certainly the legislative history does, and there is no question of that."
1982.81-2399,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2629.28,2637.464,How do we know just from the language of the statute that crime must be considered where you suggest other things need not be considered?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2637.464,2646.819,"If I recall correctly, Section 101... I'm sorry, Section 2, the introductory section, refers to crime."
1982.81-2399,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2676.26,2681.806,"Mr. Jordan, may I move away from crime, back to nuclear energy?"
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2681.806,2682.461,Certainly.
1982.81-2399,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2682.461,2691.005,Let's assume that a new nuclear plant is proposed to be located 25 miles from Three Mile Island.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2699.362,2700.298,"Okay, it's a new--"
1982.81-2399,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2700.298,2701.704,--It's a brand new plant.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2701.704,2702.687,--nuclear plant?
1982.81-2399,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2729.021,2735.191,So your short answer is that you would oppose the construction of one 25 miles away?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2735.191,2739.55,I can't tell you whether my clients would oppose the construction of one 25 miles away or not.
1982.81-2399,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2739.55,2743.344,Is there a limiting principle to your position?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2748.264,2752.511,"No, I... it is whether the environment--"
1982.81-2399,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2752.511,2753.01,Is it--
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2753.01,2770.676,"--It is whether psychological health damage can be expected to occur within that environment, and I think the question here would be, it would really be a matter of fact as to whether that had the effect on these... this population that TMI 1 has."
1982.81-2399,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2781.141,2804.991,"--Even apart from the same population, Mr. Jordan, in view of all of the publicity that the accident had in Three Island, do you think the people of the United States would have any substantially less apprehension... I am not talking about all the people, but some people... about a new plant that is proposed, or indeed about existing plants?"
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2804.991,2820.125,"Well, in fact, I suspect that generalized concern is greater than it was before Three Mile Island... the Three Mile Island accident occurred, but the question is not one of apprehension or even fear."
1982.81-2399,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2828.684,2829.34,I thought you--
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2829.34,2830.712,--there is no showing they would be traumatized.
1982.81-2399,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2830.712,2837.458,"--I thought you had argued initially that this health damage comes from anxiety, apprehension, and fear."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2837.458,2846.63,"The health damage arises as a result of the physical change to that environment, and there is... fear is one aspect of the cause of--"
1982.81-2399,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2846.63,2860.263,"What evidence is there that this physical change has occurred independent of what you had argued initially, that it is anxiety, apprehension, and fear generated by the fact of the accident?"
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2860.263,2863.543,"--No, I'm sorry."
1982.81-2399,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2868.822,2870.182,"Well, you said that was your argument."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2870.182,2876.524,"--We are talking about really two points at which trauma occurs, has occurred and, we expect, will occur."
1982.81-2399,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2888.265,2889.314,From what?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2889.314,2894.563,--From what these people lived through when the accident occurred.
1982.81-2399,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2894.563,2895.982,"Anxiety, apprehension, and fear."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2895.982,2910.866,"Anxiety, apprehension, and fear were doubtless among the causal relationships between the physical occurrence of the accident and their traumatization, and they may well have... in fact, they probably did have exposure to low level radiation."
1982.81-2399,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2910.866,2914.832,Let me change Justice Powell's hypothetical.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2953.394,2984.446,"I can't... what all the objections would be, I don't know, but if the... the question would be, would psychological health damage be caused, and I must say I expect that with this existing traumatized population, the answer would be, yes, there is a basis for saying in this case, as we see in no other, that the psychological health damage must be examined in that situation, but that's a unique case of Three Mile Island."
1982.81-2399,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2984.446,2986.758,May I ask you a question?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,2986.758,2987.32,Justice Stevens.
1982.81-2399,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2987.32,2999.316,"Supposing you had... perhaps it is an unlikely situation... but a restart situation, you restart Three Mile Island, but assume that you could do it in a way that would cause no effect on the physical environment."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,3008.326,3016.886,"I think we would, and the reason that we would is, you have assumed no effect whatsoever."
1982.81-2399,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3018.025,3019.241,"See, the government is arguing no causal connection."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,3019.241,3020.025,--Yes.
1982.81-2399,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3020.025,3024.88,"I say, well, let's take it one step further and say no impact at all on the physical environment."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,3024.88,3025.726,Okay.
1982.81-2399,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3025.726,3028.316,How do you get within the statute in that case?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,3028.316,3033.362,I gave you really a three-part test or a three-part showing of environmental impact here.
1982.81-2399,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3039.594,3040.658,I am saying there are none.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,3040.658,3041.813,I think that is what you have just eliminated.
1982.81-2399,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3041.813,3042.39,Right.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,3042.39,3046.952,You remain in that environment with the potential for an accident.
1982.81-2399,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3050.371,3053.807,"Say you have analyzed the... say you conclude there is zero potential, just hypothetically."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,3053.807,3056.555,--I would--
1982.81-2399,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3056.555,3057.803,"But your people don't believe it, you know."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,3057.803,3059.04,--Yes.
1982.81-2399,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3059.04,3061.228,But the statement says there is zero potential.
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,3061.228,3073.035,"Justice Stevens, we have addressed that in our brief in a footnote, because the... I believe it was the utilities claimed that we were making that argument."
1982.81-2399,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3098.834,3100.101,"Well, that is my... my hypothesis is that you don't."
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,3101.568,3102.005,--Um-hm.
1982.81-2399,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3102.005,3106.598,Is the mere--
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,3106.598,3112.83,"Nonetheless, I would have to answer that by saying there is still a physical change even within that reactor."
1982.81-2399,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3145.644,3147.379,--Isn't that true as long as the plant is there?
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,3147.379,3148.798,"I'm sorry, Justice Marshall?"
1982.81-2399,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3148.798,3154.547,"Isn't that true as long as the plant exists, whether it is started up or not?"
1982.81-2399,1,45125,william_s_jordan_iii,,3154.547,3163.808,That... I don't see a reason to say that.
1982.81-2399,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3180.911,3182.911,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Bator?"
1982.81-2399,2,37751,paul_m_bator,,3182.911,3183.957,Not unless there are questions.
1982.81-2399,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3183.957,3184.503,"Thank you, gentlemen."
