1966.136,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1393.01,1397.348,Do you mean from that that they are not properly here?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1397.348,1398.07,Yes sir.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1422.485,1427.355,"But Mr. Attorney General, I gather they were the litigant -- the original plaintiffs --"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1427.355,1429.021,"Mr. Swann was, yes sir."
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1430.042,1434.236,And then -- he moved his standing even though this litigation is complete?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1434.236,1450.047,"Well, I feel that he personally as a citizen of Dade County his vote is not discriminated against by -- he is given an equal way in his county and that what he was seeking to begin with."
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1450.047,1454.324,"But he started the lawsuit, he's not yet happy with the --"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1454.324,1454.614,That's right.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1454.614,1457.829,-- result below and he keep pressing to something better --
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1457.829,1458.402,We've set his finding --
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1458.402,1463.381,-- and he now suggests he moves his standing because his county of equal is in good faith.
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1463.381,1464.647,"Well, that's right."

1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1477.552,1480.949,"I suppose they are carried to that extreme, it would be Your Honor."

1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1485.466,1486.723,There were several Your Honor.
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1524.471,1536.555,"Now, do you mean that there is at least one county which is that 30% more population than the mean county or than the average?"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1536.555,1541.307,Your Honor that is the percentage difference between the largest district and the smallest district.
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1541.307,1545.529,"Okay, so it's maximum 30% variation between the districts."
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1545.529,1548.634,"I believe that would be correct, 1.3% yes sir."
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1548.634,1552.808,"Right, now this is -- this is not the variation from the north?"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1552.808,1553.806,"No sir, that's right."
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1553.806,1557.636,It is because of the comparison between the largest and the smallest county.
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1557.636,1558.094,The largest --
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.094,1559.844,The ratio between the largest and smallest?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1559.844,1565.91,"That is right, the largest district is 1.3% larger than the smallest district."
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1565.91,1567.817,"Well, I wonder if I could translate that in this --"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1567.817,1568.454,Yes sir.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1568.454,1569.989,-- I figured (Inaudible)
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1578.286,1579.218,That would be one senator.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1579.218,1579.696,One senator?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1579.696,1580.208,Yes sir.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1580.208,1585.193,"And then 114,053 also by one senator?"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1585.193,1585.54,"By one senator, yes sir."
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1585.54,1586.304,Is that it?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1586.304,1587.276,That is right.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1587.276,1589.683,"Well, but aren't they multiple members in its area of business?"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1589.683,1590.466,That is right.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1590.466,1591.281,And (Inaudible) --
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1591.281,1591.795,That's right.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1593.556,1595.12,This is per senator?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1595.12,1596.478,"That is right, yes sir."
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1610.843,1615.601,"Now, that's from 34,584 to 48,000."
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1615.601,1616.701,That is right.
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.171,1776.6,Have you looked in those cases to see if the states afford to justify the variances?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1776.6,1781.831,All I saw Your Honor was that it came before this Court it was affirmed --
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1781.831,1783.645,It is so per curiam affirmance?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1783.645,1785.12,That's right.
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.126,1820.022,"What about the -- does Florida have any explanation at all for these variances or do you think there should just be a rule affirmed that as long as the variances are greater than X, that's the end of the matter."
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1820.022,1826.499,"Well, Mr. Justice White, I believe on each individual theories, there would be an explanation."
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1866.76,1867.683,Mr. Attorney General.
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1867.683,1868.479,Yes sir.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1868.479,1873.884,With no hearing I gather evidence taken on the justification that you suggest --
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1873.884,1874.131,No sir.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1874.131,1875.019,-- that it exists.
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1875.019,1876.416,"No, they were not."
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1876.416,1879.836,"Well, suppose our cases would (Inaudible)?"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1879.836,1880.159,Pardon me sir.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1880.159,1886.412,"Would you suppose our cases require that these other -- I don't recall the records frankly, --"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1886.412,1886.461,Yes sir.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1886.461,1894.325,-- that other case is Wyoming and Virginia versus (Inaudible) but it may well be that there were records made there --
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1894.325,1894.777,"Well, --"
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1894.777,1895.716,-- on the justifications --
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1895.716,1896.286,Yes sir.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1896.286,1899.526,-- for the departures.
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1900.583,1903.558,"They were in -- there was no testimony taken, no sir."
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1903.558,1904.92,By those other cases?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1904.92,1905.237,No.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1906.538,1907.481,"Yes, I don't know --"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1907.481,1920.3,My impression has been that in a Texas case some briefs were filed and tables were filed in this -- and -- but and I believe there might have been some testimony taken in the Texas case.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1920.3,1924.72,"Oh, I just wondered if -- I forgot, it was -- was it wrong in Sincock?"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1936.171,1939.675,"Your Honor, I'm not aware of that and perhaps I should be --"
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1939.675,1941.152,"Now, well are you -- I maybe wrong."
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1941.152,1942.176,Yes sir.
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.694,1972.667,"You mean you should -- you don't think that within the 15% (Inaudible) that you suggest that we should assume the constitutionality of the apportionment plan, given that -- given to them instead of a presumption that there was a reason."
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,1972.667,1981.395,"Your Honor, I will concede that if it was absolutely no departure beyond 15% that it could be --still be discriminatory."
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.58,1989.655,"Well, as far as the evidence of this case to go that -- that these variances are not discriminatory."
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2009.281,2029.677,I will concede Mr. Justice White that the brief contains a lot of typos and population ratios and so on and perhaps it would be better if the court indicated that there must proofs submitted as the justification from the variance of an exact percentage population.
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2043.856,2049.17,"Must there -- most of your reasons, you got them it would be purely political compromised reasons, wouldn't they?"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2049.17,2050.155,I'm afraid you're right.
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.155,2060.585,"You mean, there wouldn't be because of the county boundary or because of the distinctive character of this county as compared to another it would be a --"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2060.585,2061.897,Exactly --
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.897,2062.989,-- it would be a confrontation of --
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2062.989,2063.092,Yes.
1966.136,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.092,2064.295,"-- political power, wouldn't it?"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2064.295,2081.246,That is exactly right and I think that the only value of a 15% rule or 10% rule would be to allow some area for that kind of maneuvering in this political picket as it has been called.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2098.802,2099.54,Excuse me Mr. Attorney General.
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2099.54,2099.67,Yes sir.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2099.67,2102.175,Would you bring me up a date on the time table?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2104.499,2105.075,Yes sir.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2105.075,2106.545,And it --
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2106.545,2107.551,Convenes in April.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2107.551,2108.747,In April.
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2108.747,2110.344,"For its biennial session, yes sir."
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2110.344,2111.401,For two years?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2113.659,2114.801,That's right.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2114.801,2130.365,"Well, I'm trying to explore this business, that they -- that there had to be a theory on justification, suppose we would've concluded it, it should've been and that's -- it sort of go back to the District Court for that picket."
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2130.365,2130.568,Your Honor.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2130.568,2132.235,Would that all be completed before --
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2132.235,2141.388,"Well, Your Honor it would be a very extremely bad situation and really hard for us to do."
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2141.388,2143.107,Your next election is not now (Inaudible).
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2143.107,2145.188,"No sir, its two years from now."
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2235.894,2250.815,"I suppose in this inference in the Georgia case in order of this Court which approved the plan under which the legislature as I recall it was elected on November 8, in the Georgia case."
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2250.815,2252.809,"Well, it approved it until a certain time in the future."

1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2255.051,2256.094,That's right.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2256.094,2257.74,There is no such order of this Court --
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2257.74,2257.9,That is right.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2257.9,2260.107,"-- that indicates, there is only of the District Court."
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2260.107,2261.263,That is right.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2262.319,2265.209,We didn't state an order.

1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2267.457,2268.31,No sir.
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2268.31,2270.477,Were there a possibility?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2270.477,2272.624,"I'm not sure, are you speaking of the Georgia case Mr. Justice?"
1966.136,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2272.624,2273.601,"No, of your case?"

1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2352.121,2352.954,Yes sir.
1966.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2352.954,2355.413,And how long did they delay the court on that?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2355.413,2360.066,They've always come up with a plan and they --
1966.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2360.066,2363.611,How many times did they come up with a plan that wasn't good?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2363.611,2371.865,"Well, this Court has now said they were all no good except this one and I'm hoping that this Court will say the plan now is good."
1966.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2374.544,2375.773,"You say what, haven't felt what?"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2375.773,2383.101,I haven't felt to the others met the standards of the Court in Reynolds versus Sims and other cases but I do feel that this one does.
1966.136,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2383.101,2389.273,How many other plans did you say they had submitted in response to the court's order?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2389.273,2398.197,"Well, after Baker versus Carr in 1962 they immediately -- Mr. Swann's case was then pending."
1966.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2418.487,2420.974,Were there any court orders in between them?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2420.974,2425.281,The District Court had ordered that it be done.
1966.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2477.893,2481.046,"There's quite a difference in the history of this in Georgia, isn't it?"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2481.046,2484.478,"Well, Georgia still hasn't come as close as we have Your Honor and --"
1966.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2484.478,2487.523,"Yes, but that -- there was quite a difference in the number of all court orders --"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2487.523,2487.685,Yes sir.
1966.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2487.685,2488.427,-- that had to be issued.
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2488.427,2489.718,"Yes sir, very too."
1966.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2514.91,2517.966,"How many years since the first order, was it decided?"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2517.966,2523.212,I believe the first order was issued some time in July of 1962.
1966.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2547.066,2551.807,But do you mean by certain attitude that you approve what it's done?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2551.807,2560.629,"Well, I happen to agree with it and believe that there is a sense of the desire to comply with the guidelines as they understand them and they will."
1966.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2560.629,2567.017,But our problem is not whether they understand or whether it complied with the standards.
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2567.017,2567.805,I agree.
1966.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2568.736,2572.655,"And that's what you are arguing, to comply with the standard."
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2572.655,2573.792,I do.
1966.136,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2576.639,2582.386,"General, in the event that we don't agree that this a constitutional apportionment --"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2582.386,2582.62,What?
1966.136,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2582.62,2586.845,-- would you suggest that we do?
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2588.327,2589.398,Yes sir.
1966.136,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2589.398,2592.792,"-- and so forth, what would you suggest that we do?"
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2592.792,2602.298,If there is to be a rule chiseled in stone as to percentage then if we knew that I believe the legislature would comply.
1966.136,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2761.581,2764.795,What would you call these (Inaudible) as rural or --
1966.136,1,22265,earl_faircloth,,2764.795,2767.216,"No sir, they are urban."
1966.136,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2773.764,2777.462,Mr. Paul.
1966.136,2,21351,d_p_s_paul,,2777.462,2785.909,I'd like to address myself first to the point raised by the Attorney General that we don't have standing to be here.
1966.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.009,2884.449,"Mr. Paul, what's your explanation for the affirmance on the Wyoming percentage?"
1966.136,2,21351,d_p_s_paul,,2884.449,2891.931,I am not familiar Mr. Justice White with the details of the Wyoming case or what evidence may have been in the record --
1966.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.931,2895.987,"Just coming up here, you're urging that these variations, they're unconstitutionally --"
1966.136,2,21351,d_p_s_paul,,2895.987,2896.496,As they relate --
1966.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.496,2901.902,-- so what's your explanation to the affirmance that the Senate plan in Wyoming?
1966.136,2,21351,d_p_s_paul,,2901.902,2903.979,There may have been some justification in the record --
1966.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.979,2913.964,The case have been that you -- would you have any answer for citing Harrison against Schaefer against your position?
1966.136,2,21351,d_p_s_paul,,2913.964,2916.395,I don't think that that particular --
1966.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2916.395,2919.993,How about (Inaudible) against Davis opinion?
1966.136,2,21351,d_p_s_paul,,2919.993,2924.064,I think that those situations may not be comparable situations with the Florida situation.
1966.136,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2924.064,2926.011,(Inaudible)
1966.136,2,21351,d_p_s_paul,,2926.011,2947.081,I'm not familiar of what evidence may have been in the record in each of those cases but I think in the plan before us there is clearly no indication or no explanation anywhere in the Attorney General has still not told us of the reason for these variances except perhaps to suggest that there are political reasons.
1966.136,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2963.009,2965.184,That is in the record or the (Inaudible)?
1966.136,2,21351,d_p_s_paul,,2965.184,2977.584,"That is in the record of the Florida case filed in this proceeding, the very last hearing held on this particular plan at page 88, Judge Jones says, “Is there any other evidence to be introduced to this hearing?”"
1966.136,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3049.792,3062.851,"Mr. Paul, I was also interested in how many plans the legislature had submitted in response to the court's order to reapportion?"
1966.136,2,21351,d_p_s_paul,,3062.851,3065.889,There have been four plans submitted by the legislature.
1966.136,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3065.889,3067.045,This being the fourth?
1966.136,2,21351,d_p_s_paul,,3067.045,3068.463,This is the fourth plan.
1966.136,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3130.716,3131.341,Excuse me.
1966.136,2,21351,d_p_s_paul,,3137.531,3148.908,"No, not for a hearing Mr. Justice Brennan but for the necessity of evidence being in the record to sustain any variances or deviations that there maybe in the plan."
1966.136,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3148.908,3154.69,"Well, as I talk -- I should remember it I suppose but I don't, are they talking about multi member districts then or --"
1966.136,2,21351,d_p_s_paul,,3154.69,3159.568,"He were, that case deal is primarily with multi member districts but I think the rule would still be same."
1966.136,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3159.568,3161.046,Right.
1966.136,2,21351,d_p_s_paul,,3161.046,3173.076,"As the Attorney General has said, unless you are going to chisel a rule in stone and send it on a stone tablet to the Florida legislature you are not going to get a proper reapportionment plan."
