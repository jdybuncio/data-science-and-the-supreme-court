1975.74-1318,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.65,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 74-1318, Drew Municipal Separate School District against Andrews."
1975.74-1318,0,16922,af_summer,,12.255,15.728,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1318,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,135.704,140.942,"The whole school population goes successfully to each of these three schools, is that it?"
1975.74-1318,0,16922,af_summer,,140.942,142.719,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, that is correct."
1975.74-1318,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,142.719,145.538,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1318,0,16922,af_summer,,145.538,149.19,"They are all, Mr. Justice Brennan, within the Town of Drew."
1975.74-1318,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,337.384,339.531,"Mr. Attorney, could I just interrupt for a second?"
1975.74-1318,0,16922,af_summer,,344.884,355.565,"Mr. Justice Stevens, this is from a distillation of the testimony in the record and the way the rule is applied."
1975.74-1318,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,355.565,359.928,Is it counsel’s distillation or Trial Court’s or the witnesses' or whose is it exactly?
1975.74-1318,0,16922,af_summer,,359.928,372.449,"At this point, I can only say that it is counsel’s, arrived at through rereading the record and the testimony in the writing and the application of the rule."
1975.74-1318,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,372.449,377.132,"Now the rule applies to much more than just teachers and teacher’s aides, does it not?"
1975.74-1318,0,16922,af_summer,,377.132,377.993,That is correct.
1975.74-1318,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,377.993,380.885,Or an instructor or an employee?
1975.74-1318,0,16922,af_summer,,380.885,382.538,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1975.74-1318,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,400.489,403.581,Probably just about everybody except maybe the people who are --
1975.74-1318,0,16922,af_summer,,403.581,404.468,The cafeteria warden is --
1975.74-1318,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,404.468,408.567,"And at night when the students are out you do janitorial services, would it not?"
1975.74-1318,0,16922,af_summer,,408.567,434.1,"Correct, I think the superintendent was unclear at the time of his testimony as to whether it would affect school bus drivers and some such things as this now, but I think it is fair to say that it would affect anyone to whom the students could relate in a role model capacity and it would, in the district’s opinion, have an impact upon their learning experience."
1975.74-1318,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,434.1,444.109,"(Inaudible) as a rule, might it not be more accurate to say that this was an employment policy or a personnel policy?"
1975.74-1318,0,16922,af_summer,,444.109,445.942,"Mr. Chief Justice, you are exactly right."
1975.74-1318,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,459.714,468.069,(Inaudible) employees specifically this personnel policy applied in addition to teachers and teacher’s aide?
1975.74-1318,0,16922,af_summer,,468.069,479.034,"Mr. Justice Stewart, there has been no other individual within the school system that has been caught by this rule and excluded from employment other than teachers and teacher’s aides."
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1273.586,1276.95,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1318,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1303.608,1305.392,Is it in the record?
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1305.392,1307.755,"Unfortunately, Your Honor, it is not in this record at this time."
1975.74-1318,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1307.755,1313.468,"You could not really expect us to give it any weight or consideration here, would you?"
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1313.468,1319.863,"I would expect mere logic, Your Honor, if the fact would become known to the Court, to demand basically that the Court might be helpful --"
1975.74-1318,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1319.863,1322.729,That is not the way Appellate review is conducted.
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1322.729,1324.501,"I understand, sir."
1975.74-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1396.003,1398.829,"The School Board did, ultimately adapt it, did it not, ratify it?"
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1398.829,1400.0,It did ratify it.
1975.74-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1406.408,1409.716,Is that the constitutional significance in your view?
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1409.716,1420.059,"Only as to the basic rationality, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, of the rule’s application in view of the fact that we are saying that the rule was solely the creation of Mr. Petty."
1975.74-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.059,1439.639,"If in fact the body charged with the administering the school district does ratify it, I do not see how the fact that -- someone has to think of every rule, the fact that a Board member rather than the superintendent thought it up would bear on the rationality?"
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1439.639,1449.948,"This could bear on the rationality only as to the concern as I am trying to point out here, sir, that no other individuals were involved in the creation of the rule until after this lawsuit became evident."
1975.74-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1590.978,1602.738,"Mr. McTeer, do you think that the State of Mississippi could prohibit by law fornication and premarital sex if it wanted to and make it a crime?"
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1602.738,1605.129,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.931,1619.321,"Surely, if you are charged in a Criminal Court and convicted on a charge I thought you have stigmatized that?"
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1619.321,1624.697,"There is no individual in this Court, none of these plaintiffs have been charged with any criminal crime or violation."
1975.74-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.632,1634.983,Why do you not address yourself to my question?
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1654.203,1665.771,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in response to your question, I am trying to say here that these individuals cannot be stigmatized solely on the basis of having bore a child out of wedlock."
1975.74-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1676.008,1684.03,"You concede that if Mississippi was to make it a criminal offense to do that and they were proven to have done it by a jury, they could go to jail?"
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1684.03,1688.942,"In fact, Mr. Rehnquist, the rule here, as evidenced by my co-counsel’s statement --"
1975.74-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.942,1689.487,Will you answer my question?
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1689.487,1693.761,"I am answering, I am trying to, sir, I am trying to."
1975.74-1318,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1708.453,1721.712,Do you concede that the employment barrier could be based on a conviction or fornication if the state had such a law?
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1721.712,1727.717,"To answer your question, Mr. Chief Justice, there is no such law to the best of my knowledge."
1975.74-1318,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1727.717,1729.462,We explore hypothetical compositions here.
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1729.462,1731.81,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1318,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1731.81,1742.836,"If there was a state law making it a criminal act, could the conviction of a crime be a barrier to employment by a school board?"
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1742.836,1756.333,"In the absence of a showing, Your Honor, that that criminal act was directly correlated to either any of the justified purposes of the rule, there would be no basis for that conviction or otherwise evidence to be a criterion of employment."
1975.74-1318,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1756.333,1778.752,"Even a statute of the state that no person shall be employed as a teacher or teacher’s aide and whatever the other categories are, where they are exemplars to the students, if they have been convicted of a criminal act in a judicial proceeding, would that be an unconstitutional statute?"
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1778.752,1783.963,"Your Honor, you are taking me from the entire plather of criminal acts that could be performed by a school teacher."
1975.74-1318,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1789.699,1793.97,"You are not required to answer a hypothetical question, I am just trying to test your argument."
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1793.97,1819.563,"To answer your hypothetical question, I am trying to say here that if a parent bears a child out of wedlock or a woman or a man bears a child or sires a child out of wedlock, that criterion of employment, even if it led to a conviction of cohabitation or whatever under Mississippi law is not a justifiable criterion or rationally related to any viable, apparent goal of the school district."
1975.74-1318,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1819.563,1826.382,(Inaudible) Mississippi makes the having an illegitimate child a crime?
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1826.382,1830.316,"Your Honor, to the best of my knowledge, there is no such statute."
1975.74-1318,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1830.316,1838.328,"Referring to Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question, do you think the state could make it a crime to bear a child out of wedlock?"
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1840.688,1843.413,"Your Honor, that question -"
1975.74-1318,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.413,1845.529,(Voice Overlap) the circumstances of the pregnancy?
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1845.529,1853.842,"Your Honor, I would think that that would bear directly upon basic fundamental interest this Court has recognized as to the decision to bear, to beget a child."
1975.74-1318,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1853.842,1856.975,You say the state could not make it a crime to bear a child out of wedlock?
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1856.975,1859.069,I would certainly make that statement clearly --
1975.74-1318,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1859.069,1860.241,Of any other parents than that --
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1860.241,1861.214,That is correct.
1975.74-1318,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1958.237,1960.826,"Well, Gomillion was a Fifteenth Amendment case?"
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1960.826,1962.727,"It certainly was, Your Honor."
1975.74-1318,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1962.727,1964.883,Fifteenth Amendment is not implicated here?
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,1964.883,1979.4,"No, it is not, Your Honor, but I would have presumed that basic concepts of constitutional laws, they reflect upon racial discrimination as it concerns the creation of racial classifications only affecting a particular racial group would certainly be applicable."
1975.74-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.047,2098.668,"Mr. McTeer, the National Education Association and the government have both filed amicus briefs suggesting that this petition be dismissed as improvidently granted."
1975.74-1318,1,19657,charles_victor_mcteer,,2102.567,2112.196,"I will take the position, Your Honor, that we have briefed this case thoroughly and throughout that indeed, we recognize the fact there is a possibility for some right of action to Title IX."
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2199.909,2202.491,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2220.265,2233.562,"My question was whether Mississippi could make either fornication or rephrased by Justice Stevens, that bearing of the child out of wedlock could impose criminal penalties for it?"
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2233.562,2241.249,"Well I think, as we will show, that it is clear that they could not make the bearing of an out-of-wedlock child a crime."
1975.74-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.137,2264.082,Do you think Mississippi could make adultery a crime?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2264.082,2271.378,"I do not think, under this Court’s decision, it could, Your Honor, but I do not think that that question is before this Court."
1975.74-1318,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2274.576,2281.915,Do I understand you correctly that -- did you just say that adultery no longer can be made a state crime under --?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2281.915,2295.252,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I am saying that under this Court’s decisions in Isenstot and Roe and in number of cases where the deterrence of premarital conduct is not a purpose for punitive treatment."
1975.74-1318,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2315.509,2318.624,(Inaudible) the question when you say that?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2318.624,2320.202,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1975.74-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2331.554,2335.404,(Inaudible) apply only to women females or does it apply to Black --
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2335.404,2337.678,"Your Honor, I would like to address that question."
1975.74-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2341.03,2345.151,Do you mean it applies only to females or its impact is greater on females?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2345.151,2350.805,"The way the rule is defined, designed and implemented, it applies only to females."
1975.74-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2406.596,2418.161,You are arguing that this kind of conduct has no impact on children if they are aware of it?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2418.161,2420.664,"Yes, Your Honor, and that is also absolutely true."
1975.74-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2428.524,2430.327,No violation to the rule?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2430.327,2431.753,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1975.74-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2431.753,2454.396,"I was addressing my question to whether premarital conduct of this kind by teachers, men or women, if known in the community would have no adverse impact on children or students in the primary and junior high schools?"
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2454.396,2463.123,"Your Honor, number one, just to bring it down to the facts in this case, there is no knowledge whatsoever shown by the schoolchildren."
1975.74-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2477.393,2480.449,"You are talking about expert testimony in this case on both sides on that issue, is it not?"
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2480.449,2483.871,"Yes, there was, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1975.74-1318,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2528.89,2531.5,"There is another possibility too, is there not?"
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2531.5,2543.65,"Yes, Your Honor, there is another possibility and that is, as the District Court said, a woman could take the more circumspect or conventional route and surrender her children to others for upbringing."
1975.74-1318,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2545.906,2552.412,"No, she could not get pregnant?[Laughter]"
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2552.412,2554.913,"That is for certain a possibility, Your Honor."
1975.74-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2639.441,2645.214,Is this an Equal Protection Clause claim because the way you are arguing it does not sound like it and I wondered?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2645.214,2646.401,"It is dual, Your Honor."
1975.74-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2658.829,2662.372,"If you are right, the Equal Protection Clause has nothing to do with this case?"
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2662.372,2664.075,"No, Your Honor, it --"
1975.74-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2664.075,2666.329,"If you are right, you would prevail on that basis?"
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2666.329,2668.787,"We could prevail on that basis, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1975.74-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2668.787,2670.628,On the Equal Protection Clause?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2670.628,2677.091,"We could prevail as well on the grounds that this is race discriminatory and as I will get to in a moment, that it is sex discriminatory."
1975.74-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2705.896,2721.708,"may I ask you, do you think it would be unconstitutional for this school district to require that no teacher should be hired who is under 18 years old?"
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2721.708,2725.499,"Your Honor, I think that would present a completely different question."
1975.74-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2725.499,2728.33,"Protection-wise, I think it --"
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2728.33,2728.764,I do not --
1975.74-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2728.764,2731.485,I do not see the difference as a part of the Equal Protection Clause?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2731.485,2738.117,"Well, number one, age has never been given quite the kind of constitutional scrutiny by this Court."
1975.74-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2744.505,2746.524,Neither of which purports to be?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2746.524,2771.846,"It purports not to be, but the question is, is it and by looking at if we -- counsel used the term “caught” and what we suggest to the Court is that there was not very much search to catch anyone here and that just as focusing on nurturance and on the woman who is rearing that child, invades the fundamental right to keep that child."
1975.74-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2776.772,2786.128,"Ms. Copelon, a minute ago you referred to the scrutiny given by this Court in cases involving sex, what scrutiny do you conceive that to be?"
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2786.128,2789.298,"I do not think it is clear yet, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1975.74-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2931.135,2943.128,Correcting that statement about Mr. Petty’s view of the matter to some other case that is not yet here that is that it is over broad in that respect?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2943.128,2946.603,I am not sure I understand your question.
1975.74-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2953.128,2966.193,"Did someone hear or claim that either of these teachers, any of the respondents, subsequently married the father of the child."
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2966.633,2974.139,"Mr. Chief Justice, I do not know whether Mrs. Peacock married the father of the child. Fundamentally, that is irrelevant."
1975.74-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2975.052,2979.788,I believe she was not clear enough as to what would happen in that kind of a case?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2979.788,2990.248,"This woman, Mrs. Peacock, or any other woman who is married and has a child at home certainly negates any possibility to rationality of this role modeling concept."
1975.74-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3016.478,3018.237,We do not have a dietitian here.
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3018.462,3022.489,"That is correct, Your Honor, and we are not trying to litigate this for dietitians."
1975.74-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3042.778,3046.218,Your time has expired.
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3046.218,3050.798,"May I have a moment, Your Honor, to sum up?"
1975.74-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3082.806,3090.28,Does the record show what percentage of the teachers in the school system were Negroes?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3090.28,3095.14,"In our supplemental brief, Mr. Justice Stewart, we submitted figures which show the --"
1975.74-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3095.14,3096.324,And White people?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3096.324,3103.048,-- and a substantial increasing number of White people just in the period that this rule was adapted.
1975.74-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3103.048,3105.423,"There is still a majority of Negroes, is it not?"
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3106.39,3107.775,"No, it is a minority."
1975.74-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3160.815,3175.806,"There is an imbalance in the faculty that violates constitutional principles as laid down by this Court in Mr. Justice Black’s opinion of some years ago, that that could be the subject of independent litigation, could it not?"
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3175.806,3178.652,"Yes, Your Honor, but what we are saying under the Keys’ opinion is --"
1975.74-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3178.652,3179.461,In this case?
1975.74-1318,2,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3179.461,3192.313,"No, but what we are saying is that that context of whitening the faculty is something which just led this Court to look at neutral rules as presenting a prima facie case of racial discrimination."
1975.74-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3193.043,3196.677,Thank you.
1975.74-1318,3,43752,william_a_allain,,3196.677,3197.47,Mr. Chief Justice --
