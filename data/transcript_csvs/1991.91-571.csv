1991.91-571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.338,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-571, Robert J. Taylor, Trustee, v. Freeland & Kronz."
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,12.098,16.823,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,244.422,246.885,Is that in the code?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,246.885,249.705,"That is in the code, in 522(1) of the code."
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,254.82,256.26,That's what I wanted to know.
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,256.26,259.351,"--Yes, that's in Bankruptcy Rule 4003."
1991.91-571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,261.844,272.451,"Mr. Dyk, do you claim that all of the recovery is open for the trustee to seek recovery?"
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,276.272,304.542,"We have only pursued a portion of it, and the Bankruptcy Court only allowed a portion of it to be reached, the $23,000, but I think that at the time that the bankruptcy petition was filed that there was a strong argument that all of that could be reached, even the part covered by attorney's fees, because there was no equitable lien with respect to the claim itself, but only an equitable lien under State law that would have arisen after the proceeds were received."
1991.91-571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.542,307.904,But I guess as the case comes to us we don't have to get into that.
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,310.686,319.322,"The judgment of this Court would only determine a portion of it, and we're only claiming the right to the $23,000."
1991.91-571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.907,336.964,Did you argue the application of the new sentence in section 105 in the court below?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,336.964,338.834,"No, that was not argued in the court below."
1991.91-571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.699,347.428,So it's being urged for the first time here.
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,347.428,378.981,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor, and we believe that's appropriate, because what the second sentence of section 105(a) says is that no provision of the code shall be construed to prevent a challenge based on an abuse of process, and the question of whether 522(1) was a bar to the trustee's claim here was something that was heatedly contested in the lower court, and we're merely saying in this Court that section 105(a) instructs as to how to interpret section 522(1)."
1991.91-571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,378.981,385.834,"If it were to apply, how do you think abuse of process should be defined?"
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,385.834,409.119,"Well, I think it certainly doesn't mean abuse of process in the common law sense, but if you look at Prosser or the Restatement of Torts, abuse of process in the common law sense would be, for example, using a writ of sequestration to get property or the improper issuance of criminal process, or the use of process to commence an improper civil action."
1991.91-571,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,409.119,417.025,You think that the claiming of an exemption which the statute doesn't allow is an abuse of process?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,417.025,427.452,"I think it is an abuse of process not in the common law sense but in the sense that this Court has used the term abuse of process, for example, in the Cooter & Gell case."
1991.91-571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,508.276,514.82,"What is the process that is abused here, the filing by the debtor claiming the exemption?"
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,514.82,522.433,"Well, Chief Justice, we're not suggesting that the term abuse of process was used here in the common law sense."
1991.91-571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.586,535.854,"Well, no, but surely... I mean, when you say abuse of process, there's a verb and a preposition and a noun, and the noun is process, and what is the process?"
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,535.854,549.923,--The claim is that the abuse of process was the act of filing the list of exemptions and making a claim of exemption that did not have a good faith statutory basis.
1991.91-571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,549.923,554.357,"So the listing of exemptions is a form of process, in your view."
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,554.357,559.659,"Not of the common law, but within the scope of section 105(a)."
1991.91-571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,577.902,590.929,"But the first sentence, Mr. Dyk, begins the court may issue any order, process, or judgment, and that suggests that they're talking about process in the sense of something of a writ, or something that the court issues."
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,590.929,610.203,"--Well, I think that the language of the second sentence, which refers to no provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest, shall be construed to preclude the court from sua sponde taking any action or making any determination necessary or appropriate to prevent an abuse of process."
1991.91-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,668.551,690.626,"Under your submission, Mr. Dyk, I take it it becomes relevant whether there's a colorable basis for the claim, or a reasonable basis for the claim, and my concern is is that that propels us into something of a collateral inquiry, and this case illustrates the point."
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,695.609,702.104,"Front pay, to the extent it's necessary for the support of the debtor, would be exempt."
1991.91-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,703.143,710.199,So it seems to me that in this case if she thought there was a possibility of front pay that that was the basis for claiming the exemption.
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,710.199,736.095,"If that were the case, that would be true, but I think that the record pretty clearly establishes first of all that the claim at the time of the bankruptcy filing was worth $110,000 and the later calculations made at the time of the settlement show that only approximately even as of that time only about 30 percent of that claim was for front pay as opposed to back pay."
1991.91-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,736.095,739.297,"But then to that extent at least it would be exempt, would it not?"
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,739.297,771.027,"It would be exempt to the extent that it was a claim for front pay, but after all at the time of the filing of the bankruptcy petition the award of the Pittsburgh Human Relations Commission that was being defended had a provision in it that she would recover from the time that she was discriminated against up until the time that her class of supervisor was no longer employed by TWA in Pittsburgh, and that was a date before the filing of the bankruptcy petition."
1991.91-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,783.466,790.411,But at a minimum does not this illustrate the complexity and the difficulty of enforcing the rule that you propose?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,790.411,810.824,"Well, I think that there can be situations in which it is complex, but it is not such an unusual thing, after all, under Rule 11, and there is an equivalent of Rule 11 in the bankruptcy rules which is section 9011 that the courts routinely make this kind of determination and make a determination as to whether claims have a reasonable basis."
1991.91-571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,819.379,831.819,"Do you have any idea, Mr. Dyk, what percentage of people filing for bankruptcy are represented by attorneys when they file as opposed to, say, people who start civil law suits in the Federal courts?"
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,831.819,841.996,"I don't know the answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice, but one of the problems here is that the bankruptcy courts are inundated with this filings."
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,862.931,869.385,How many... what percentage of all of the filings involve a trustee?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,869.385,875.57,"Well, all of the Chapter 7 filings would involve a trustee and the vast--"
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,875.57,876.2,Which is this one.
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,876.2,877.82,"--Which is this one, and the vast--"
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,877.82,889.167,So it isn't the bankruptcy judges that are any more... they are more inundated than the trustees.
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,889.167,892.459,"--The trustees have been pretty inundated, too, even--"
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,892.459,893.01,Well--
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,893.01,894.41,--Even--
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.41,899.685,"--The trustee is the person who failed to object here, or any creditors failed to object--"
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,899.685,900.314,"--Well, the... Justice--"
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,900.314,901.336,--Isn't that right?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,901.336,902.277,--That is correct.
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,916.825,918.305,"Well, you seem to have it now."
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,921.728,925.371,"--Well, I think it's not the creditors, it's the bankruptcy trustee who's--"
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,925.371,930.484,"Well, the trustee certainly didn't do what he should have done."
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,930.484,947.687,"--He did not do what he should have done in the technical sense, but what he did was immediately after the meeting of creditors he wrote a letter to the debtor's counsel handling this TWA case for her and advised them specifically of his position."
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.521,989.192,Where did you file... where did the trustee file the suit?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,989.192,992.825,He filed it within the context of the bankruptcy proceeding.
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.034,1012.527,Was it... a bankruptcy judge ruled on it?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1012.527,1021.165,"--Yes. The bankruptcy judge ruled on it and determined that the exemption should be invalidated to the extent of $2,300."
1991.91-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1035.203,1037.173,"What if it had been closed, Mr. Dyk?"
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1051.324,1054.267,"Well, I would think it would only apply while the proceeding was still open."
1991.91-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1054.267,1055.82,Why is that?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1055.82,1083.518,"Well, if you look at the bankruptcy proceeding as being parallel to ordinary civil proceedings in the Federal courts the filing of the petition is like a complaint, the objection to the exemption is like the answer, and then the closing of the case is like final judgment in the case, so if after the closing of the case there were a desire to reopen the judgment in a sense, one would have to proceed under the bankruptcy rule."
1991.91-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1117.699,1144.998,"Well, I... it makes a big difference to me how I view this case if I think, well, it's only going to apply where you have a trustee who didn't make a technical objection but he did write to the lawyers and he did know there was a problem there and kept the case open in order to be able to use 105(a), and if he hadn't done that, bygones is bygones, once there's the discharge and the case is closed it's all over with, but I'm not sure that that's what would happen."
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1150.622,1156.104,"Well, I wasn't suggesting that the case could be opened without a very substantial showing."
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.86,1166.072,Like bad faith?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1166.072,1167.882,--A significant--
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.882,1169.264,Like bad faith?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1170.934,1179.74,"--Well, I think under Rule 60(b) you could... after the 1-year period after the judgment you could only reopen the judgment for a showing of fraud."
1991.91-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.413,1206.408,"Arguably, you would also have to make a showing of cause for the trustee's not making the objection soon, if it was apparent on its face--"
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1206.408,1207.129,"Yes, I--"
1991.91-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.129,1210.631,"--Which you don't think is necessary in order to recover here, right?"
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1210.631,1236.679,"--Well, I think the showing of good cause similar to what appears in Rule 55, the default provision of the Federal Rules, would be an appropriate gloss on this, and if you look back to the equity practice before the adoption of Rule 55, which would govern both the bankruptcy courts and Federal courts, I think there would need to be some showing of good cause necessary for that kind of reopening."
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.679,1243.22,"Well, after all the rule just says a trustee or creditor may file within 30 days."
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1253.138,1257.412,"Well, unless you can rely on 105 or equity practice to reopen it."
1991.91-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.243,1289.452,"Well, but again, why don't we impose a cause requirement there and not just a cause requirement in order to reopen?"
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1303.942,1307.043,We agree that that would be an appropriate gloss.
1991.91-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1307.043,1309.404,Even when no reopening is necessary.
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1309.404,1311.167,Even when no reopening is necessary.
1991.91-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.167,1312.467,What's the good reason here?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1312.467,1354.425,"Well, we would, I think... one could look at the parallel in Rule 55 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which has a good cause requirement in it to set aside a default before the entry of judgment, and the good cause requirement under Rule 55 is interpreted as being essentially a three-part test, that there be a meritorious defense, no prejudice to the other party and no bad faith by the party seeking to reopen the judgment, and so we would suggest that that might be the way that good cause would be defined, and if that were defined in that way, we would think that the trustee in this case would easily satisfy it."
1991.91-571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1354.425,1363.51,Do we really want to import that much of the rather complicated Federal Rules of Civil Procedure into bankruptcy proceedings?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1363.51,1371.515,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that we're suggesting that we import the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure into the bankruptcy proceedings."
1991.91-571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1404.269,1423.642,"But you're also saying we should carry over at least concepts from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and it seems to me if we carry over two or three in this case the next case we're going to be asked to carry over some more, and pretty soon we won't know what concepts from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in bankruptcy and which don't."
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1423.642,1429.315,"Well, it's not so... the suggestion that I'm making, Mr. Chief Justice, is not so foreign to the Bankruptcy Code."
1991.91-571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1455.882,1476.288,"But there you have a bankruptcy rule that very closely tracks a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, but it strikes me some of your argument, or your rule based on 8(d) and 55 and 60(b), you're just drawing analogies without any real reference point in the Bankruptcy Code."
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1476.288,1490.056,"--Well, the reference point in the Bankruptcy Code, Mr. Chief Justice, would be the provisions of section 105, which for a long time have confirmed the continuing power of the bankruptcy courts to act as courts of equity."
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1514.422,1522.978,So the negligence of the trustee should really never be a bar where there's an abuse of process.
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1522.978,1525.319,"No, I'm not suggesting that, Justice White."
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1529.68,1535.995,"Well, the trustee... do you think the trustee should have filed a claim... I mean, should have filed an objection?"
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1535.995,1537.738,"--Well, there's no question that he should have filed--"
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1537.738,1538.308,Why didn't he?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1538.308,1539.157,--Why didn't he?
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1566.014,1570.058,"Well, he did disregard the rule."
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1570.058,1572.9,"He did disregard the rule, there's no question about that, but he did--"
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1572.9,1574.861,"Not just negligently, on purpose."
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1574.861,1575.732,--Well--
1991.91-571,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.732,1577.422,Isn't that right?
1991.91-571,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1577.422,1590.321,"--I suppose on purpose in the sense that he thought that it was permissible to disregard it and did that, but he did advise the debtor immediately after the creditors meeting about the claim that he had."
1991.91-571,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1596.275,1597.637,"Very well, Mr. Dyk."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1599.789,1611.656,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1665.591,1670.054,"But Mr. Simon, is it not true that the real objection is that he didn't make a timely objection?"
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1674.295,1693.448,"I don't believe that is... it is... I don't believe that is true, because the trustee commenced an action under section 549 of the code to recover property transferred."
1991.91-571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.248,1714.663,"Well, that's a pretty good challenge to the claim of exemption."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1714.663,1717.926,"In a manner of speaking, it is, but--"
1991.91-571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1717.926,1722.217,"Well, it can't be both exempt and property of the estate."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1722.217,1740.569,--We responded that it was not property of the estate because it had been prior... had been exempted out of the estate under the clear language of section 522(1).
1991.91-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1740.569,1745.522,"Yes, but that would not be a complete answer if there were no timeliness requirement."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1750.506,1751.776,That's certainly correct.
1991.91-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.776,1757.83,"So the real question is not on what 522(1) requires or means, but rather what the bankruptcy rule requires."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1757.83,1762.625,Certainly the bankruptcy rules flesh out the code requirement.
1991.91-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1762.625,1767.117,"Well, if you didn't have the bankruptcy rule you'd have no case, because he could say I'm now making my objection."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1767.117,1772.83,"That's true, but formerly he has never, to this day, objected."
1991.91-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1772.83,1773.991,"Well, he might do it today."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1777.932,1778.583,That's certainly correct.
1991.91-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1778.583,1779.895,"--Because the estate's still opened, isn't it?"
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1779.895,1781.626,"That's certainly correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1781.626,1787.429,"Well, he filed his suit, though, in the bankruptcy court, right in the bankruptcy case."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1787.429,1788.2,That's correct.
1991.91-571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.2,1795.346,"Well, that's a... and if he was trying to recover property he certainly was objecting to the claim of exemption."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1795.346,1801.308,"My point, I guess, is that there is nothing in his complaint that--"
1991.91-571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.308,1802.3,Said objection.
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1802.3,1808.863,"--Made him realize that it had been objected... or, excuse me, claimed as exempt."
1991.91-571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.161,1827.306,"Well, but you responded by saying that the property was exempt."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1827.306,1830.399,"That's true, certainly."
1991.91-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1875.018,1876.098,May I just make one other observation?
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1879.66,1914.334,"--I'm reading the word may, I believe, to say a creditor may object, he does not have to object, but the time limit set out later in the rule... may object within 30 days of a meeting of creditors held pursuant to a certain rule unless further time is granted by the court within such period, and further bankruptcy rule--"
1991.91-571,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1914.334,1916.365,"So you're saying that it really means must, and that's a fair reading."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1920.478,1923.13,"--As it regards the time limit, certainly."
1991.91-571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.13,1924.139,Yes.
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1954.129,1958.784,"I believe it can, frankly."
1991.91-571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1980.285,1988.961,What do you think abuse of process means as applied to an exemption claim?
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,1988.961,2004.362,"Well, certainly if there was no objective basis in fact, or no arguable basis in law, it was clearly an outrageous matter."
1991.91-571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2021.442,2031.51,"Well, the court below had no... apparently made no reliance upon, did not consider, the possible application of section 105."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2031.51,2032.942,That's certainly true.
1991.91-571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2032.942,2039.665,So is it still open in the court below to consider that possibility?
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2039.665,2059.027,"Well, again, to some extent pardons must be bound by what they raise or don't raise, and this particular provision speaks in terms of court orders, rules, and abuse of process."
1991.91-571,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2079.282,2085.386,"Well, is there any express time limit for use of section 105, and if so, what is it?"
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2085.386,2089.069,"--No, there certainly is not, Your Honor."
1991.91-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2113.483,2116.655,I want to be clear of your position.
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2137.549,2138.019,Well--
1991.91-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2138.019,2140.08,--105 is not applicable in any event?
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2140.08,2141.131,--Pardon me.
1991.91-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2177.826,2186.392,"Well, I take it no one contends the court lacks the power... or do you contend that the court lacks the power to give an extension of time if the trustee requests it?"
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2186.392,2187.123,No.
1991.91-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2196.898,2201.793,"Well, what is your position if the claim... the exemption has no basis in law, which was your phrase?"
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2215.721,2221.134,"--Yes, certainly there must be a bright line."
1991.91-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2221.134,2226.637,So that it doesn't make any difference that there was no basis in law.
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2228.47,2229.489,Eventually it must not.
1991.91-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2237.655,2242.609,"Well, bright lines are usually overrestrictive of cases where fairness might call for a different result, aren't they?"
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2242.609,2243.879,--Certainly.
1991.91-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.411,2279.692,But--
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2279.692,2281.134,--Construed strictly.
1991.91-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.134,2282.414,--But time limits are always strict.
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2312.754,2313.656,Certainly.
1991.91-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.656,2317.206,Okay.
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2317.206,2331.417,"In this case, however, the only action taken by the court was approximately 3-1/2 years after the objection to exemption period had run."
1991.91-571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.806,2362.106,Did you know... I take it the trustee did notify some people that... about his position with respect to the estate's interest in the possible recovery.
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2362.106,2364.65,"That's certainly correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.65,2366.089,Did the debtor know that?
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2366.089,2379.259,"My client, Freeland & Kronz, knew that by letter directed to them, and that was an inquiry letter which they answered."
1991.91-571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2379.259,2384.992,So it was no surprise that the trustee made a claim 3-1/2 years later.
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2384.992,2392.627,"Well, indeed it... whether it should or should not have been a surprise, it was."
1991.91-571,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.627,2397.679,Although it was wholly consistent with his letter 3-1/2 years before.
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2397.679,2399.962,To some extent.
1991.91-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2435.363,2441.397,"Mr. Simon, your finality requirement would simply be satisfied by the finality of the closing of the case, wouldn't it?"
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2441.397,2445.861,"It could be, certainly."
1991.91-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2445.861,2447.702,Why wouldn't that be enough?
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2447.702,2466.134,"Well, simply stated, I guess, because there's specific code and rule language that calls for an earlier deadline, and--"
1991.91-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2466.134,2471.707,"Well, doesn't that... I mean, if that's your criteria, you're reading 105 pretty much out of the statute, aren't you?"
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2471.707,2484.546,"--I am reading 105 to be severely limited, because it contains the language necessary or appropriate to enforce orders, rules, or prevent abuse of process."
1991.91-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2486.888,2503.398,"No, but you're not depending on orders, you're depending on process, and you have conceded that process can be an abuse of the judicial process, not process referring to some document issued, and the judicial process is an on-going one which only concludes with the closing of the case."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2503.398,2514.527,"--Well, if I stated that or implied that, it's broader than I intended."
1991.91-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2514.527,2526.745,"Well, I thought... I guess we'd better get clear on that, because I thought that Justice Scalia specifically asked you that question to clarify that point, so I think we do not understand what you mean by abuse of process."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2526.745,2535.4,"When I say process, the code and the rules, the statutory scheme is the process, or is--"
1991.91-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2535.4,2540.725,"Well, if the statutory scheme is the process, then I suppose the process continues until the case is closed."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2540.725,2548.167,"--But I... I'm not sure if I understand the inquiry of the Court, but--"
1991.91-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2548.167,2587.474,"Well, the inquiry started with your claim that in administering 105 there is an interest in finality which must be served in construing it as to when a 105 sua sponte objection may be raised, and I said, isn't that interest served sufficiently by saying it's got to be raised before the case is closed, and since you concede that process means judicial process, i.e. the whole statutory scheme, it would seem consistent with your view of process to say that a 105 sua sponte objection could be raised by the court or inquiry could be made by the court at any time until the case is closed."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2587.474,2644.883,"--Well, certainly the case closing could be a deadline, but I guess I'm saying that there is a specific deadline in this statutory scheme, and there is no real reason for going outside of that scheme except in very extreme and unusual cases where there are... where... and you don't have that concern not only specifically in this case but the court did not really take any sua sponte action except years into the future in this case after the exemption period had run."
1991.91-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2644.883,2652.897,"Basically your defense here is that this is not an extreme case, isn't that right?"
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2653.298,2654.279,Certainly.
1991.91-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2654.279,2656.611,--Why isn't it an extreme case?
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2663.366,2687.471,"Absolutely, because under the exemption scheme the debtor had three arguable bases for exemptions under 522(d)(5), the so-called wild card exemption allows $4,150 in any property."
1991.91-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2709.767,2712.008,"Well, would that have covered the entire claim?"
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2717.932,2729.43,"We don't believe that that was, indeed, on the appropriate date, the date of the petition filing, that that lawsuit was worth $110,000."
1991.91-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.43,2740.769,"Well, the claim... that's what had... I thought that the letter from your firm to the trustee said that, that that had been what the award had been."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2740.769,2744.35,There was a letter--
1991.91-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2744.35,2744.891,Did I make this up?
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2745.852,2747.212,--No.
1991.91-571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2916.412,2917.183,Are you saying--
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2926.71,2928.551,"No, Your Honor."
1991.91-571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2929.693,2931.132,Not raised at all.
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2931.132,2932.284,No.
1991.91-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2932.284,2953.008,"Mr. Simon, as I understand it, you're saying, number 1, the amount of the claim was low at the relevant period, i.e., maybe $9,000 or $10,000, and I think you're also saying that the value of that claim as an asset was not even the amount of the claim itself, because it was subject to contingencies."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2953.008,2954.297,That's certainly correct.
1991.91-571,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2954.297,2955.719,"Yes, okay."
1991.91-571,1,38292,phillip_s_simon,,2955.719,2971.848,"If there are no further inquiries from the Court, I would ask to be excused."
1991.91-571,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2971.848,2973.841,"Very well, Mr. Simon."
1991.91-571,2,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2985.689,2987.362,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-571,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3002.4,3004.171,But you didn't suggest that to the court of appeals.
1991.91-571,2,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3004.171,3004.682,--That's correct.
1991.91-571,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.682,3006.783,Nor in your petition for certiorari.
1991.91-571,2,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3006.783,3007.784,That's correct.
1991.91-571,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3012.597,3015.121,"Well, I know, but you didn't even cite--"
1991.91-571,2,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3015.121,3017.521,"--That's correct, we did not, in the petition."
1991.91-571,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3017.521,3019.422,--And the first time it appeared here was in the briefs.
1991.91-571,2,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3019.422,3021.122,"In the opening brief, that's correct."
1991.91-571,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3064.632,3077.08,"Mr. Dyk, if a trustee is puzzled as to whether the exemption is applied, is there a formulation where he can have some sort of a running objection just to leave the time open, or is his only option to ask for a hearing?"
1991.91-571,2,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3077.08,3089.957,"He could ask for an extension of time under rule 4003, and if the extension of time is granted before the expiration of the period the court can act on the extension of time."
1991.91-571,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3119.357,3126.902,Do you think the question you did raise in your petition subsumes this position--
1991.91-571,2,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3126.902,3127.671,Justice--
1991.91-571,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.671,3131.395,--This is just another argument for saying 522 didn't bar.
1991.91-571,2,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3131.395,3132.547,"--That's correct, Justice White."
1991.91-571,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3139.529,3150.118,"But I suppose you... even if we get to 105, I would suppose that it wouldn't surprise you if we said we're not going to fool with 105."
1991.91-571,2,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3154.71,3161.484,"--Well, I... it wouldn't surprise me, Justice White, if the case were ultimately sent back for a decision by the bank--"
1991.91-571,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3161.484,3162.814,To see what effect 105 had.
1991.91-571,2,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3162.814,3166.737,"--Well, to have him exercise his discretion under section 105, yes."
1991.91-571,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3167.488,3169.401,"Thank you, Mr. Dyk."
