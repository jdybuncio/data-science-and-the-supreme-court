1986.85-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.12,"Mr. Nolan, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,13.12,20.866,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,529.054,534.161,What was was the insurance company's fiduciary duty or position in this case?
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,534.161,543.126,"--In this case, Justice White, the insurance company had the responsibility for claims administration."
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,548.374,550.718,"It sold insurance, it sold insurance to the plan, I take it."
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,550.718,554.684,It sold insurance to Entex and--
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,554.684,556.947,"But, it wasn't a trustee of the plan?"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,556.947,561.165,--It was acting for the trustee and that's really the key to the case.
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.096,580.94,It is the named fiduciary?
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,580.94,583.812,--It is the named fiduciary under ERISA.
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.931,611.847,And under ERISA how do you get at a claimed breach of fiduciary duty?
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,611.847,626.139,"At ERISA... under ERISA you, if you have a case like this, first you go to the claims review procedure provided in 503."
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.276,637.338,"If your claim is denied, why you can contest it?"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,637.338,644.648,"--If your claims is denied, you can contest it through the procedures provided expressly in the statute."
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,644.648,648.333,And what if you think its just too slow?
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,648.333,660.032,"Well, we... our position is that this is the law that Congress provided."
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,663.889,669.497,"Was the insurance company under this plan, or under the statute required to act within a certain time?"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,669.497,671.497,"--Yes, it is."
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.61,701.734,"And, and what is the civil enforcement proceeding in a court?"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,701.734,706.419,"--The civil enforcement proceeding is in a court, yes."
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,712.136,724.975,"Well, let's assume you go to civil enforcement proceeding and you win and the insurance company has breached its fiduciary duty to act in time, or in some other way."
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,726.319,730.332,Then you get whatever--
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,730.332,731.223,You get your claim paid.
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,731.223,732.207,--You get your claim paid.
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,732.207,734.097,"With interest, I suppose."
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,734.097,735.269,Possibly.
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,738.703,744.218,"But, you get no remedy against the trustee, against the insurance company."
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,744.218,751.807,"Well, in this instance, Justice White, the insurance company, Pilot Life, is in effect the trustee."
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.807,754.542,"All right, but you get no other remedy."
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,757.697,760.181,It is correct.
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,760.181,760.712,Plus attorneys' fees.
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,760.712,764.006,It is correct that you make Pilot Life do what it should have done.
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,767.74,769.504,"Well what can, what else can you get?"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,769.504,776.908,Well you can get all of the civil enforcement rights provided in Section 502.
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,776.908,777.814,"Well, can you get any--"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,777.814,779.314,You can recover benefits under the plan.
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.64,784.546,--But no consequential damages?
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,784.546,786.139,No consequential damages.
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.139,804.132,"So even if your not getting your money on time has caused you to lose some money, or to cost you some money, you can't have any remedy for that?"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,804.132,809.052,"Well, you can sue to obtain equitable relief specifically under the statute."
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,813.926,815.159,"Well, I know, but can you get any money?"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,815.159,817.597,You can have the fiduciary removed.
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,817.597,820.658,"But, can you get any money, Mr. Nolan?"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,820.658,821.891,"Yes, you can get money."
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.891,825.0,In what form?
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,825.0,835.918,In whatever form the court to which the application for equitable relief is made finds appropriate.
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,835.918,858.675,"But, if there's a cause of action that's applied to all insurance companies in the state that says that bad faith or refusal to honor a claim is remediable by some damages or by punitive damages, that state law is inapplicable in ERISA context?"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,858.675,860.189,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.189,865.687,"Mr. Nolan, you said that in the equitable side of the thing you could get money."
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,867.515,876.388,"Well, I said that you could get money in the context of seeking to obtain equitable relief from the Court."
1986.85-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,876.388,877.246,"Well, be more specific."
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,877.246,877.996,Well--
1986.85-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,877.996,882.494,I mean you can get the amount of the claim plus attorney's fees on the law's side I take it.
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,882.494,882.916,--That's correct.
1986.85-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,882.916,887.32,And you say you could remove the trustee in equity.
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,888.46,890.382,"You can enjoin the trustee, you can remove the trustee."
1986.85-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,890.382,898.849,"--But now I want to know, because I thought you said that the equity side could award you some sort of money damages?"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,898.849,902.691,"Well, I did not say damages, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.691,903.066,"Well, what did you mean?"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,903.066,916.328,"I meant that an application for equitable relief to the Court, pursuant to the specific provisions of Section 502, can take whatever form the court, in that instance, might find appropriate."
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,916.328,917.5,Have you ever been--
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,917.5,918.75,There have been a variety of--
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.75,931.746,"--Has there ever been a case where they, under ERISA... and it's been around for a while now... where some insurance company has had to pay a disappointed claimant some money on review?"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,931.746,947.004,"--Well, I think that, generally speaking, punitive and consequential damages have not been allowed in ERISA cases by this Court or, by and large, by other courts."
1986.85-1043,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,947.004,949.785,That's really what this case is all about.
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,949.785,951.596,That is what this case is all about.
1986.85-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,951.596,955.626,And certainly a Court on equity never awards punitive damages.
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,955.626,956.798,That's correct.
1986.85-1043,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,958.75,965.56,"So, there is no prospect of recovery of punitive damages if the state law is preempted?"
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,966.544,973.62,I think that's right and I think that's the key distinction between state law and federal law here.
1986.85-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.504,997.281,"But, Mr. Nolan, I really was puzzled, as the Chief Justice was, about your notion of some other money."
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,1005.092,1006.2,"--Well, I don't know--"
1986.85-1043,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.2,1008.528,And what section are you referring to when you say that?
1986.85-1043,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,1008.528,1011.995,--I don't know of a general equitable power to give money.
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1631.687,1646.837,"Yes, I think it very clearly does, Justice White, because it defines the deemer clause, not a clause which is necessarily self evident on its meaning on first reading."
1986.85-1043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1658.207,1667.875,"Well, Mr. Nolan, don't you think we'd have to cut back a bit on some of the language in that Metropolitan Life case for you to prevail here?"
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1667.875,1673.624,"For us to prevail, no, Justice O'Connor, I don't."
1986.85-1043,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.847,1704.674,"Very well, Mr. Nolan."
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1706.346,1711.969,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.696,1773.945,"From the law of the state actually, right?"
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1773.945,1778.927,"From the law of any state, you're right, which regulates insurance."
1986.85-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.247,1800.935,xxx.
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1800.935,1801.935,"No, sir."
1986.85-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.098,1837.78,"xxx... state law that said that insurance companies will act on a claim within a week, seven days, and that would end."
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1847.198,1847.839,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1849.182,1851.713,Despite what the plan said?
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1851.713,1852.508,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.113,1866.738,"No, no, no."
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1866.738,1867.674,--it wouldn't work.
1986.85-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1867.674,1868.362,No.
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1882.545,1884.638,"Absolutely, if it's an insured plan."
1986.85-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1884.638,1887.09,"Yes, yes, yes."
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1887.09,1887.731,"And, that's the distinction."
1986.85-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1890.775,1898.554,"So, it wouldn't make a bit of difference what the plan said in terms of the time or the procedure."
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1898.554,1899.647,--Absolutely.
1986.85-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1899.647,1905.988,"And, the state law could say, if you don't act within thirty days, you're in court?"
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1905.988,1907.566,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1043,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.566,1912.767,"You don't, you can disregard all of the appellate procedures the plan might provide?"
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1912.767,1913.407,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1913.407,1930.493,"Well, Mr. Walker, I think that we have to focus on the deemer clause, because whatever is covered by the deemer clause is removed from the savings clause, if you will, that you're relying on."
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,1993.235,1997.216,"Your Honor, that's certainly the argument the petitioner is making."
1986.85-1043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2024.785,2025.363,"Well, it says,"
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,2030.642,2031.111,--Yes.
1986.85-1043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2059.6,2065.848,"Well, that's why I asked Mr. Nolan if he didn't think you had to cut back on some of the language in that Russell case."
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,2069.659,2070.628,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2118.484,2134.743,"Well, do you really think that Congress intended to allow the very detailed civil enforcement procedures for an employee covered by an ERISA plan to be completely bypassed at the plaintiff's option?"
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,2134.743,2141.817,"In the case of insured plans, I do, because Congress says so in the saving clause."
1986.85-1043,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2145.035,2149.94,"But, it may have backed out of that in the deemer clause, that's the problem."
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,2149.94,2154.047,I don't think they backed out of it under the deemer clause.
1986.85-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2195.061,2204.557,"Mr. Walker, if what you say is true, if that interpretation is correct, there is a severe disadvantage in having an insurance company act as trustee under the plan."
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,2206.76,2208.213,Your Honor--
1986.85-1043,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.213,2209.838,--an enormous disadvantage.
1986.85-1043,1,46523,william_c_walker_jr,,2217.273,2223.802,"--First of all, the insurance companies don't usually act as trustees; they act as plan administrators."
1986.85-1043,2,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,3395.095,3401.889,"Just a few points, if the Court please."
