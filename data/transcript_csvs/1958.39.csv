1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6079.269,6081.016,That's whole point.

1958.39,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6132.044,6148.838,You don't -- I don't believe you (Inaudible) may stipulate some (Inaudible) invitation of the courts judicial power shall not give the courts jurisdiction (Inaudible)
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6148.838,6151.981,I could say that's a procedural point and not a matter of substantive law.
1958.39,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6177.914,6192.591,"Well, Mr. Littell, are you -- when you agreed that there's nothing here for the question of jurisdiction of the person, maybe I'm wrong, I had the feeling that this was a question of the jurisdiction of the state courts of this lawsuit, am I wrong about that?"
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6192.591,6202.203,"No, I -- I do if I -- if my answer to Judge -- Justice Whittaker was construed that way, I -- I quite agree for this lawsuit and it's for any similar situation."
1958.39,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6202.203,6213.594,I mean this lawsuit which involves an Indian defendant against whom is sought to be enforced the claim arising out of a transaction on the Indian reservation.
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6213.594,6213.659,Precisely.
1958.39,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6213.659,6214.228,Is that it?
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6214.228,6214.96,I was tempted to --
1958.39,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6214.96,6217.88,"But it's the question of the jurisdiction of the lawsuit, not of the Indian."
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6217.88,6218.381,That's correct.
1958.39,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6222.47,6225.364,"But basically it's lawsuit, not personal jurisdiction you pointed."
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6225.364,6226.055,"Quite right, quite right."
1958.39,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6226.055,6237.928,"Why is it the courts doesn't have jurisdiction of the lawsuit, under your view, is it not because it doesn't have jurisdiction of the person?"
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6237.928,6241.098,"You see, you're both right [Laughter]."
1958.39,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6241.098,6242.104,(Inaudible) to both.
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6242.104,6243.042,And -- and may I -- [Laughter]
1958.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6243.042,6245.61,(Inaudible)
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6245.61,6252.461,"And Mr. Chief Justice, may I throw myself on the mercy of the Chief Justice and have this question resolved in chamber?[Laughter]"
1958.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6252.461,6254.987,It will be.[Laughter]
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6254.987,6263.254,"Now, very quickly because my time is going -- is almost gone."
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6433.524,6442.86,May I ask you a question about the tribal courts that -- of that idea -- idea?
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6442.86,6449.299,"Your Honor, could -- could I take the extreme and on terrible liberty of adding just this to this point?"
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6449.299,6449.635,Yes.
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6449.635,6450.601,He cites the Draper case.
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6450.601,6451.469,I'm sorry.
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6451.469,6453.045,He -- he cites the Draper case.
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6453.045,6455.264,I thought you pretty said that.
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6455.264,6462.986,"With this point, he cites the Draper in support of this extraordinary doctrine that this doesn't apply to lands only -- it only applies to lands and not to persons."
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6495.239,6496.645,"I'm -- I'm sorry, I interrupt you."
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6496.645,6497.706,"No, thank you, Your Honor."
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6497.706,6499.117,What I want to ask you is this.
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6518.898,6520.017,Unless there were what?
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6520.017,6523.168,Power to establish the tribal court.
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6541.404,6542.322,They did.
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6542.322,6542.96,-- and -- where?
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6559.741,6567.529,"Within the -- well, my associate suggests specific regulations."
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6569.555,6570.906,What is the specific regulation?
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6570.906,6581.505,The specific regulation is -- is in the -- in 25 CFR -- the regulations based upon statute 25 CFR 11.22.

1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6592.641,6593.391,Yes.
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6593.391,6601.05,“The Courts of the Indian Offenses shall have jurisdiction of all suits wherein the defendant is a member of tribe or tribes within their jurisdiction.”
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6601.05,6602.342,The courts for what?
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6603.329,6605.022,"Court -- The Court of Indian Offenses, yes sir."
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6615.689,6631.506,Those are the regulations that you have cited in your brief which show that they wouldn't have jurisdiction of cases like this which are authorize by regulation which themselves are authorized by Congress?
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6631.506,6632.65,Perhaps we should have cited.
1958.39,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6639.564,6641.055,Would you mind giving it again?
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6641.055,6651.16,"Yes -- yes, Your Honor, 25 CFR 11.22 jurisdiction."

1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6660.211,6660.478,"Oh, yes."

1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6661.388,6662.201,This -- no.
1958.39,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6662.201,6665.047,I know they're published but is that the way we get them and the volume something like that.

1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6723.287,6724.426,They have -- that's the theory.
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6735.31,6738.96,Your argument is that Congress has full power to do so --
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6738.96,6739.655,Completely.
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6739.655,6742.356,-- as fixed to these courts (Inaudible)

1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6748.062,6748.651,Have to know that?
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6748.651,6749.059,Yes.
1958.39,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6751.531,6755.302,But what's the basis (Inaudible) of this regulation?
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6755.302,6760.02,"Why, sir, the general plenary power of the -- of the Government under the Constitution over Indians."
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6767.675,6784.187,"(Inaudible) You'd have to look, would you not, even to a statute or treaty rather than the Constitution insofar as that power of the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations that have the effect of law?"
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6784.243,6784.639,They --
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6784.639,6791.594,-- could you just look to the Constitution and say that the Secretary of the Interior can do that without authority of Congress?
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6791.594,6806.952,"It's -- it's -- in -- I'm sure that there is statutory authority which I can't cite at the moment behind these, Your Honor, this -- this collateral line that comes up a little unexpectedly but I have to say the answer is yes anyway because the portion affected these regulations and -- and --"
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6806.952,6808.538,"Answer is yes, what do you mean by that?"
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6808.538,6817.777,Answer is yes that they have the power whether there's a statute behind it or not under the general delegation of the power to the -- to the Secretary to regulate Indians.
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6818.797,6821.225,Didn't that would be a power delegated by Congress?
1958.39,2,37176,norman_m_littell,,6822.706,6825.279,"Well, sir, I was thinking of the Constitution."
1958.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6834.814,6836.375,Our time is exhausted.
