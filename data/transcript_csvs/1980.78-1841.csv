1980.78-1841,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.593,"Ms. Vickers, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,5.593,8.419,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1980.78-1841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,35.579,41.702,"Ms. Vickers, isn't there some question as to whether this is actually a compact or not?"
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,41.702,46.623,"The detainer agreement, Your Honor?"
1980.78-1841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,46.623,48.449,Yes.
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,65.27,78.843,"Your Honor, I believe that this is a compact, rather an agreement entered into by party states."
1980.78-1841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,78.843,87.543,But is any agreement entered into by party states necessarily a compact?
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,97.43,103.802,"Your Honor, I must say that I have not focused on that issue and I apologize."
1980.78-1841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,103.802,115.939,"If it isn't, I suppose it would follow that there is some considerable question about whether or not there is a federal question here."
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,115.939,125.074,"Your Honor, the 3rd Circuit relying on this Court's decisions found that there was a question of federal law and that it is a--"
1980.78-1841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,125.074,125.449,I know.
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,130.932,132.026,--And it is a compact.
1980.78-1841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,142.849,154.578,"Certainly a uniform state act, even though the same act has been enacted by the legislatures of 50 states, is not a federal question."
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,158.968,162.857,"Your Honor, it might be a question of state law."
1980.78-1841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,169.682,172.883,Even though... let's assume that there's an identical federal law.
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,178.381,184.567,I would agree that simply because the United States has adopted the agreement doesn't automatically make it a federal law.
1980.78-1841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,202.075,203.685,The Court of Appeals certainly held that.
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,203.685,205.34,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.78-1841,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,205.34,208.181,So you have support for your position.
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,208.181,211.351,"I do not differ with that position, Your Honor."
1980.78-1841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,292.553,300.208,"Which was exactly contrary to the interpretation of the Pennsylvania state court, wasn't it?"
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,300.208,300.864,"That's right, Your Honor."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,535.551,540.469,"Ms. Vickers, could you help me with one question?"
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,555.745,560.572,"Your Honor, the statute itself does not provide that he be advised."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.389,590.201,Was this particular respondent given that form?
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,590.201,593.356,"Your Honor, the record does not show either way."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.356,594.966,Because he alleges he did not know about his right to filing.
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,594.966,604.665,"Your Honor, he alleges, he discussed only the time frame from when the custody request was received by the state."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.099,618.784,Whose burden would it be to show that he received a piece of paper that would tell him what his rights were?
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,618.784,624.766,"Your Honor, I think that the way the record stands at this point it's incomplete on that issue."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,624.766,630.857,But then don't we have to accept his claim that he didn't know about this right as probably a valid claim?
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,630.857,638.354,"Your Honor, normally I would agree with you but in this particular case I think that there is a lack of information on that point."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,651.552,661.283,"Well, but even if he had notice of the detainer, it wouldn't necessarily mean that he had notice of his right to make a request with the Governor within that 30-day period."
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,661.283,667.953,"Your Honor, as I was stating, when the prisoner receives notice of the detainer, he receives it through a form, Form 1."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.953,668.624,How do we know that?
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,673.777,676.011,"No, Your Honor."
1980.78-1841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,773.691,789.138,"Yet, in the Uniform Commercial Code, in its early days, which was also adopted by a large majority of the states, the highest courts of various states interpreted various provisions differently."
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,805.35,823.374,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the uniformity of the procedure here is strongly supported by the purpose enunciated in Article I of the Agreement, which is to provide the procedures to be followed."
1980.78-1841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,823.374,836.307,All uniform laws are supposed to be interpreted uniformly but lots of state courts just have come to different conclusions on rather difficult questions of statutory construction.
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,836.307,853.034,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the purpose of this Agreement, the enunciation by the framers, specifically states in Article I that cooperative procedures are going to be provided."
1980.78-1841,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,859.094,870.7,"At some point, Ms. Vickers, before you complete, do you intend to address yourself to the question of mootness?"
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,870.7,873.027,"Yes, Your Honor, we have--"
1980.78-1841,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,873.027,874.011,Do it in your own time.
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,874.011,874.604,--Yes.
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,915.073,917.149,"But, Ms. Vickers, I'm a little puzzled on how you read IV(d)."
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,918.805,927.77,"Your Honor, I think it means that the prisoner has those rights enumerated in Paragraph (a)."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.77,929.223,Why do you have to say that?
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,935.922,946.247,"I think, Your Honor, that was... that is a clarifying reference and I think that it is not unusual in statutes to find--"
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.247,949.277,What are the rights that the prisoner gets in Paragraph (a)?
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,950.432,953.712,"--Well, Your Honor, he has the right to petition the Governor."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.165,955.618,--That's right.
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,964.724,967.692,"--That's right, if the prisoner petitions."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.692,973.377,"But you say, you think Paragraph (d) was intended to preserve his right to petition the Governor?"
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,973.377,982.138,Both that and to give him an opportunity during the 30-day period to take whatever other action he might deem appropriate.
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.356,986.448,Was that right given by Article IV(a)?
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,986.448,987.448,"No, it is not."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.448,990.432,"That's a right that, if it exists, exists independently of IV(a)."
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,990.432,990.776,That's right.
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,990.776,998.678,"So as soon as you admit that that was intended to preserve that right, you're saying that Paragraph IV(d) is preserving things not granted by IV(a)."
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,998.678,1007.331,"Your Honor, I believe the right to petition for writ of habeas corpus is a right which cannot be abrogated by particular statute."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.331,1011.455,"You wouldn't need to put in Subparagraph (d) in order to preserve that right is what you're saying, then--"
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,1011.455,1012.268,That's right.
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1012.268,1022.606,--Then I find it difficult to understand what IV(d) accomplishes if it does not preserve rights that exist independently of the interstate Agreement on Detainers.
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,1022.606,1036.805,"Your Honor, I would agree that it preserves a right which is a fundamental right, a right which is not a matter of state law such as uniform extradition procedures would be."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1043.302,1051.657,"Well, just to make it explicit, you then concede that Paragraph IV(d) preserves rights beyond rights which are granted in Paragraph (a)?"
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,1051.657,1062.402,"Your Honor, within the framework of this statute, the only right which this particular statutory provision gives him is a right to petition the Governor, we believe."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1074.242,1081.677,Or that right that he had before this agreement was adopted to have certain procedural protections in connection with extradition.
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,1081.677,1095.297,"--Well, Your Honor, I think at that point we are getting into reliance on another statute and then we have to look at the interrelationship between the Extradition Act and the Detainer Agreement."
1980.78-1841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1115.522,1123.769,"I understand that, but would you agree that before the Agreement on Detainers was adopted, the prisoner had certain protections under the Extradition Act?"
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,1123.769,1125.362,"--Yes, Your Honor, he did."
1980.78-1841,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1155.365,1168.704,May I ask whether the language... any right that the prisoner may have... couldn't refer to just any right under state law?
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,1168.704,1171.625,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.78-1841,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1171.625,1172.718,It's not limited.
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,1172.718,1173.905,"Yes, Your Honor, it may."
1980.78-1841,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1193.521,1204.112,"Well, I'm not debating that point at the moment; there's not a word in the Detainer Act that refers to the Extradition Act, is there?"
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,1204.112,1205.485,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1980.78-1841,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1205.485,1210.14,"There's nothing in the Detainer Act, no specific reference, to the Extradition Act?"
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,1210.14,1211.015,"No, Your Honor."
1980.78-1841,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1211.015,1224.197,So my question was whether or not the language that you have been discussing with Justice Stevens couldn't be construed simply as applying to whatever rights may exist under Pennsylvania law.
1980.78-1841,0,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,1224.197,1231.928,"Yes, Your Honor, that would be correct, except for the fact that the Detainer Agreement is a specific statute which deals--"
1980.78-1841,1,29684,james_d_crawford,,1776.228,1778.446,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.78-1841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1831.675,1841.733,"Yes, but the Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit decided this case on the ground of what was extended to your client by the state law."
1980.78-1841,1,29684,james_d_crawford,,1841.733,1843.702,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, because--"
1980.78-1841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1843.702,1847.217,Not by the Agreement or the compact but by the state law.
1980.78-1841,1,29684,james_d_crawford,,1847.217,1847.498,--That is correct.
1980.78-1841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1855.056,1858.259,Which may vary from state to state.
1980.78-1841,1,29684,james_d_crawford,,1858.259,1861.43,"Which may vary from state to state, but an interstate--"
1980.78-1841,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1861.43,1870.659,"And the Court of Appeals simply held on this that in the State of Pennsylvania state law accorded your client certain protections and rights, and that's the end of it, and isn't that a state law decision?"
1980.78-1841,1,29684,james_d_crawford,,1870.659,1872.502,"--No, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.78-1841,2,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,3263.742,3264.586,Thank you.
1980.78-1841,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3264.586,3265.539,Do you have anything further?
1980.78-1841,2,36828,maria_parisi_vickers,,3265.539,3266.959,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.78-1841,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3313.66,3314.972,"Thank you, counsel."
