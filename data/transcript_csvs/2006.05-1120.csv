2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"We'll hear argument first today in 05-1120, Massachusetts versus Environmental Protection Agency."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,10.939,13.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,119.176,124.647,I thought that the standing requires imminent harm.
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,131.301,132.201,"--It is, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.859,143.809,When?
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,149.112,153.583,"--Your Honor, it's not so much a cataclysm as ongoing harm."
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,171.295,185.019,"Well, there's a lot of conjecture about whether... I gather that there's something of a consensus on warming, but not a consensus on how much of that is attributable to human activity."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,199.712,202.064,"It's actually about 6 percent, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,202.064,203.23,6 percent?
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,205.032,217.907,"But it's important to point out as well, though, that in the ruling we challenge, EPA has disavowed authority over all U.S. sources of emissions, which constitute about 20 percent of global--"
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,217.907,220.276,"Yes, but that doesn't go to the harm that you're claiming."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,231.166,232.149,"--Agreed, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.718,238.487,"I understand, but that has nothing to do with whether you have standing."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,255.999,262.805,"--It would take a few years, Your Honor, but it is a basic premise of the Clean Air Act that vehicle fleets regularly turn over--"
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,262.805,264.205,I understand.
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,282.516,290.955,"--Your Honor, we have shown in the record that a 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide from cars is currently feasible."
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.007,294.49,--Not in the first year.
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,294.49,294.99,"--No, no."
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.859,312.719,"I mean ultimately, when all the cars currently on the roads are off and the new cars with, you know, whatever measures you think will reduce the carbon dioxide are on the road, then 40 percent would be the figure."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,312.719,313.603,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.603,331.029,"But whatever position holds for motor vehicles would similarly hold for power plants, and has there been any application to EPA with respect to carbon dioxide in power plants?"
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,331.029,331.881,"There has, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,347.824,353.228,Do you get the benefit of that broader allegation in establishing your standard?
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,376.593,387.651,"--Your Honor, I think it's actually more direct in the sense that in the decision we challenge here, they said greenhouse gases are not air pollutants under any regulatory provision of the act."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,389.717,393.888,Don't you have to show injury from their decision here?
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,402.411,412.683,"--I believe it does, Your Honor, because we cannot win that other case unless we win this case here in terms of the authority question."
2006.05-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,423.407,433.096,"But at the outset, you made this, some of this perhaps reassuring statement that we need not decide about global warming in this case."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,450.892,463.949,"Your Honor, especially in this case where none of our affidavits were challenged, I don't think the Court needs to go there ultimately on the merits because we showed through our uncontested affidavits that these harms will occur."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,473.423,489.267,"Those affidavits talked about the fact that if the government starts to regulate, the technology is going to change, if the technology changes, other governments will adopt it, and all that, and that strikes me as sort of spitting out conjecture on conjecture, the sort that we disapproved of."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,489.267,495.421,"--Your Honor, although we believe we have shown other governments will follow suit, we are not in any sense relying on that."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,499.822,505.376,Same argument if the automobile emissions were 1 percent contributors?
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,505.376,507.078,--It would be the same argument.
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,516.667,533.427,"How is that consistent with our taxpayer standing cases where the argument is that a taxpayer doesn't have standing to challenge an illegal expenditure as a general matter simply because his contribution, the benefit that he's claiming is so small and so widely dispersed?"
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,533.427,537.998,"Your Honor, it is different because here there is particularized injury that we have shown."
2006.05-1120,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,548.471,572.921,"If you look ahead, I don't know how far imminence allows you to look ahead, but let's say we're looking at 5 years or 10 years, what particularized harm does the record show that Massachusetts will, or faces an imminent threat of suffering, that can be traceable to the reductions that you want to produce through these regulations?"
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,572.921,585.061,"Well, Your Honor, if I can deal with the traceability part of that question first, traceability is easy to show here because the extent of our harm is caused by the overall amount of the gases in the air."
2006.05-1120,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,603.19,610.546,"6 percent is the total emissions, the total contribution from motor vehicles in the United States, right?"
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,610.546,612.779,--To the global carbon dioxide emission.
2006.05-1120,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,612.779,613.331,To the global.
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,620.652,628.923,"It would be, we have shown in the record it would be about a two-and-a-half percent over the time it takes to turn the fleet over."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,646.469,649.087,"That assumes everything else is going to remain constant, though, right?"
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,659.11,659.727,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,669.584,672.619,Not if your harm is the alleged loss of coastline.
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,677.904,694.866,"--Your Honor, we would still lose coastline but we would not lose as much because these harms are cumulative, and while reducing U.S. emissions will not eliminate all the harm we face, it can reduce the harm that these emissions are causing."
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,700.27,721.35,"I mean, do we know that that's a straight line ratio, that a reduction of two-and-a-half percent of carbon dioxide... well, two and a half overall would save two-and-a-half percent of your coastline?"
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,728.956,731.325,"Your Honor, I don't believe it's established it's necessarily a straight line."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,768.831,776.354,What's your strongest case from this Court to support your standing allegation?
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,776.354,789.594,"Your Honor, what I would say to that is our standing here is so much more direct and particularized than, for example, the harm this Court found sufficient in Laidlaw, which was--"
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,789.594,793.815,"Laidlaw was a specific citizen suit provision, wasn't it?"
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,793.815,794.915,"--It was, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,794.915,798.267,So doesn't that make it somewhat analytically distinct from this case?
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,798.267,799.969,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,808.408,810.141,What's your authority for that?
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,825.184,830.821,"--Well, Your Honor, first of all, we agree that a large landowner would himself or herself have--"
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.821,831.773,What of a small landowner?
2006.05-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,831.773,832.256,"No, no."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,834.808,835.142,--Yes--
2006.05-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,835.142,838.36,"--as a State and, if so, what's the authority for that?"
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,838.36,843.046,"--Your Honor, first of all, I do think we have special standing."
2006.05-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,880.587,881.873,"Well, I don't know."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,900.418,910.99,"--Your Honor, I think if someone is losing property because of this problem, then that person would have standing, but we're nowhere near a de minimis threshold here."
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,919.545,967.443,"No, I'm not sure... I think our opinions have even said it, but certainly commentators have often said it, that really the far margin of our standing cases has been, you know, the famous scrap case, in which the allegation was that the added pollution from municipal incineration of municipal waste which would... which couldn't be transported by rail for burial because the ICC rates were too high, that added pollution interfered with the students'... they were Georgetown Law students... their hiking in the George Washington Forest along the Blue Ridge."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,991.761,1000.098,"Your Honor, once these are emitted the laws of physics take over, so our harm is imminent in the sense that lighting a fuse on a bomb is imminent harm."
2006.05-1120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1000.516,1022.447,"Mr. Milkey, does it make a difference that you're not representing a group of law students, but a number of States who are claiming that they are disarmed from regulating and that the regulatory responsibility has been given to the Federal Government and the Federal Government isn't exercising it?"
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,1041.609,1046.978,"--Your Honor, you are correct that we are saying that provides us also an independent source of our standing."
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1046.978,1047.68,I don't understand that.
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,1060.155,1061.238,"In short, Your Honor--"
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.238,1063.988,Do you know any case that has ever held that?
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,1063.988,1073.879,"--Your Honor, I would cite you to the amicus brief of the State of Arizona et al., which cites several cases, albeit not in this Court, that stand for that principle."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1117.139,1137.988,"Moving from your authority argument to the exercise of authority, the clause 202(a)(1) requires EPA to prescribe standards which in their judgment cause or contribute to air pollution reasonably anticipated to endanger public health."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,1144.308,1152.129,"--That is correct, Your Honor; but they have said that they have put off making a judgment based on impermissible grounds."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1164.054,1171.375,"Let's say the first day this law is passed, there are a lot of air pollutants that come out of motor vehicles."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,1180.898,1181.431,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1189.004,1195.408,And presumably the principle that they want to deal with what they regard as the more serious threats sooner.
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,1208.132,1218.19,"The answer to that, Your Honor, is that when they do not rely on any of those grounds, they do not rely on lack of information, they did not rely on background principles of administrative law."
2006.05-1120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1251.927,1283.799,"--But if you are right and then it went back and the EPA then said, well, an obvious reason also is constraint on our own resources, we have the authority to say what comes first, Congress... we couldn't possibly do everything that Congress has authorized us to do; so it's our decision, even though we have the authority to do this, we think that we should spend our resources on other things."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,1297.356,1304.676,"Your Honor, while background administrative law principles provide EPA at least some room to move, we think it's important that EPA say that."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1333.529,1337.064,That's not all they said.
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,1351.824,1355.359,"It is and it isn't, Your Honor, because that statement will alleges be true."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1364.065,1377.308,"There's a difference between the scientific status of the harm from lead emissions from vehicles that... when you have lead in the gasoline, to the status, the status of scientific knowledge with respect to the impact on global warming today?"
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,1381.01,1393.568,"--Your Honor, when EPA regulated lead back in the ethyl days, as the Court court itself took note, there were huge amounts of uncertainty at that time."
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.824,1434.911,"Mr. Milkey, I had... my problem is precisely on the impermissible grounds."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,1472.77,1475.305,"Respectfully, Your Honor, it is not the stratosphere."
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.572,1477.424,"Troposphere, whatever."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,1484.494,1493.849,Under the express words of the statute... and this is 302(g)... for something to be an air pollutant it has to be emitted into the ambient air or otherwise entered there.
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.849,1495.135,"Yes, and I agree with that."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,1510.828,1519.001,"Your Honor, respectfully, I disagree, and there is nothing in the act that actually requires the harm to occur in the ambient air."
2006.05-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1521.067,1523.619,"Well, it talks about air pollution all the time."
2006.05-1120,0,31929,james_r_milkey,,1529.94,1538.812,"Your Honor, we are not saying, first of all that global warming is air pollution, any more than we're saying that asthma is air pollution."
2006.05-1120,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1625.02,1626.503,"Thank you, Mr. Milkey."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1630.155,1630.605,Thank you.
2006.05-1120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1665.411,1676.683,"Mr. Garre, doesn't the EPA's decision on the first, ""we don't have any authority"", doesn't that infect its subsequent decision,"
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1684.206,1686.491,"Your Honor, I don't think that it does."
2006.05-1120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1722.264,1740.992,"--I take it that on that question, is there authority, the EPA has come out one way, but at least it is debatable because as you just said, the predecessors of the current people said we do have the authority."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1740.992,1754.635,"--Well, to that degree, Your Honor, this Court has made clear, for example, in the Brand X case that even where agencies change positions, where they've provided reasonable grounds for a new interpretation, that interpretation is entitled to Chevron deference."
2006.05-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1757.837,1765.341,"On this particular issue, the opinion as I read it, of the EPA, consists of 32 pages."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1829.817,1835.254,"Justice Breyer, I don't think that it depends on how many pages that the agency devoted to the--"
2006.05-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1835.254,1845.479,"The reason it depended on that is whether or not these other, improper considerations might have influenced the ultimate decision not to go ahead."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1845.479,1848.514,--I think it depends on the reasons that the agency gave.
2006.05-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1867.791,1872.445,"When I write an opinion... when I write an opinion, sometimes I write the words:"
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1897.026,1897.928,--But Your Honor--
2006.05-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1897.928,1910.903,"If they write that all of these considerations justify our result, again, one of them by themselves, it sounds, they think would not have been sufficient."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1910.903,1916.474,"--I... I don't think that that is a fair reading of the EPA decisional document, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.066,1943.207,I find it interesting that the scientists whose worked on that report said there were a good many omissions that would have indicated that there wasn't nearly the uncertainty that the agency described.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1943.207,1949.111,"Your Honor, if you are referring to the amicus brief, Your Honor, there are... assuming there are amicus briefs on the other side."
2006.05-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1965.703,1972.374,"But in their selective quotations, they left out parts that indicated there was far less uncertainty than the agency purported to find."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1972.374,1980.463,"Well, Your Honor, I think one thing that we ought to be able to agree on is there is that there is uncertainty surrounding the phenomenon of global climate change."
2006.05-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.249,2016.303,Is there uncertainty on the basic proposition that these greenhouse gases contribute to global warming.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2016.303,2023.492,"--Your Honor, the report says that it is likely that there is a... a connection, but that it cannot unequivocally be established."
2006.05-1120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2051.876,2054.36,"--it is not a mathematical question, right?"
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2066.319,2067.603,"--I think that's true, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2080.329,2082.364,Suppose it is not greenhouse gas.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2127.076,2134.88,"Your Honor, I think that that is a fundamentally different case, for the simple reason that global climate change is a global phenomenon."
2006.05-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2135.232,2157.228,"I was only addressing, using that to... to address your problem that the chances are too small that, in fact, any one individual will be affected by the 7 percent or 6 percent of the material that comes out of the truck... the CO2."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2157.228,2168.703,"--The... the individual in that case, Your Honor, like the plaintiffs here, would have to show specific facts demonstrating injury, redressibility and traceability."
2006.05-1120,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2169.786,2181.777,"Your problem, I think, you take the position, the proposition that the greater the harm the greater the risk, the smaller the probability has to be before it is reasonable to act, and necessary to act."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2181.777,2190.217,"--Your Honor, this Court's standing cases make clear that you have to show that granting the relief requested is likely to redress the alleged harms."
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2191.735,2204.959,"They are saying it is likely to do so, even though we cannot give you a point for point percentage correlation between reduction of gas and coastline loss."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2211.296,2212.648,--I don't... we're not saying that.
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2212.648,2215.434,"--before, before there is redressibility."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2215.434,2216.65,"We're not saying that, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2221.004,2225.206,"Tell me what it is that they need, be more specific about what they need to do."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2225.206,2227.575,"--Well, I will be more specific."
2006.05-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.773,2255.742,I think it can be argued that the Assistant Attorney General hasn't argued that here.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2255.742,2256.427,Well--
2006.05-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.427,2258.294,He has said that 6 percent is enough.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2258.294,2263.431,"--That, that's true, Your Honor, but I still think you have to look at the basis that they've relied upon on standing."
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2276.639,2282.994,Why is there... why is there reason to assume that it will have no effect?
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2282.994,2283.444,Well--
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2283.444,2285.228,That seems to be the assumption you're making.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2301.556,2302.173,--Your Honor--
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2302.173,2325.436,"But why do they have to show a precise correlation as opposed simply to establishing what I think is not really contested, that there is a correlation between greenhouse gases and the kind of loss that they're talking about; and it is reasonable to suppose that some reduction in the gases will result in some reduction in future loss."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2327.671,2333.442,"--Justice Souter, one fundamental reason is that we don't know what the rest of the world is going to do, whether or not--"
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2333.442,2337.144,Let's assume the rest... let's assume that the rest of the world does nothing.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2403.688,2410.292,"--Justice Souter, their burden is to show that if the Court grants their requested relief it will redress their injuries."
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2411.075,2421.666,Not redress their injury in the sense that it will prevent any global warming or stop global warming and stop coastal erosion; their argument is a different one.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2428.92,2429.289,--I think--
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2429.289,2429.922,That's their argument.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2434.641,2437.11,"--And that's fine, Justice Souter, I grant you that."
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2464.293,2469.045,Don't they have to show that it is reasonable to suppose it will have an effect?
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2469.045,2470.264,"--They have to show that it is likely, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2473.566,2493.612,"Why is that showing... and I agree with, by the way, with the Chief's suggestion a moment ago, life is not, or physics are not so simple as to assume that there's going to be a be a direct two and a half percent reduction of coastline for a two and a half percent reduction from the 6 percent."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2508.788,2510.422,"--I don't think that it is fair, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2530.285,2532.451,But do you have any--
2006.05-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2532.451,2533.82,Suppose others cooperate?
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2598.429,2613.272,"--Your Honor, what I would point you to is your decision in Lujan versus Defenders of Wildlife, Justice Kennedy's opinion in ASARCO versus Kadish, where the Court made clear that you cannot establish standing based on predictions of the actions of independent actors not before it."
2006.05-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2619.593,2624.378,"So they couldn't have gone in and asked for ozone regulations, because that requires other countries?"
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2637.054,2642.891,"Well, first of all, Congress has specifically addressed two of the areas that you mentioned, Your Honor, and we're not saying that categorically--"
2006.05-1120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2642.891,2648.862,"--Just because there's no standing to challenge an agency's decision doesn't mean the agency can't regulate that particular area, right?"
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2648.862,2650.312,"--That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2651.48,2669.859,"But you are saying if Congress passes a statute and they put the words CO2 right in this statute under ambient air, and they say anybody can go and sue if the EPA doesn't do it, you're saying Congress lacks the constitutional authority to do that, because it's Article III we're talking about?"
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2669.859,2671.259,"Well, Your Honor, we're saying two things."
2006.05-1120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2690.455,2692.555,They can't compromise the requirements of Article III.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2692.555,2693.507,"--It cannot, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2709.417,2719.106,"As I understand the government's position, you're not merely questioning standing but you also take the position you do not have the authority to do what the plaintiff asks you to do; is that correct?"
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2719.106,2721.541,"--That's true, Your Honor, moving to the merits, that's true."
2006.05-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.98,2742.138,"May I ask you on that question, if we turn to the statute, to Section 201, there's reference to ""shall regulate"" if in the judgment of the administrator there is a for real danger and so forth."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2746.276,2755.464,"Your Honor, our view is that agencies have inherent discretion to determine when to make that judgment."
2006.05-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2755.464,2759.099,Could they have a discretion never to make the judgment?
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2759.099,2763.368,"I think that gets to the question of whether there is, what judicial review is available."
2006.05-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2781.532,2788.853,"But as I read your brief, you didn't really confront the question, s I understand it, of whether or not there was a duty to make a judgment at all."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2791.721,2799.243,"Well, again, I think it goes to the question... we think the statute does not put a deadline on when the agency has to have, and that therefore--"
2006.05-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2799.243,2802.962,"To me, just reading the text of the statute is a little ambiguous."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2818.388,2820.422,--That's not the agency's interpretation.
2006.05-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.77,2848.824,"But you would agree that if they did make a judgment, then you would have authority to regulate?"
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2848.824,2849.507,That's right.
2006.05-1120,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2862.751,2880.128,"In Norton versus Utah Wilderness Alliance, having to do with the regulation of off-road vehicles, we indicated that one measure was whether or not the agency has unreasonably delayed its action."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2880.128,2883.33,"That's a separate sort of action, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2892.953,2895.988,Let me understand your answer to Justice Stevens' question.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2902.459,2903.744,Under the statute--
2006.05-1120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2903.744,2908.629,I thought you had a Brown and Williamson argument that EPA was precluded.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2908.629,2914.699,"--No, I was assuming... in answering Justice Stevens' questions, that we were down in the exercise of discretion part."
2006.05-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2920.603,2921.539,Can I ask about that?
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2954.01,2955.26,"--I think there is, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2976.174,2981.744,--You concede that it's an air pollutant that affects health?
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2981.744,2982.461,--No.
2006.05-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2996.103,3002.291,"Then why isn't it air pollution within the meaning of the statute, although whatever it is that causes acid rain is?"
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3002.291,3009.078,"I think, Your Honor, that the key to the agency was that Congress did not give it regulatory authority over this."
2006.05-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3013.049,3016.851,But you can't give me any text in this statute itself.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3020.286,3032.194,"--The agency pointed to the term ""air pollution agent"" in the statute, and concluded that because global climate change was not air pollution that Congress intended to address--"
2006.05-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3032.194,3034.878,And that gets us back to acid rain.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3034.878,3043.151,"--And with respect to acid rain, it's a good example insofar as Congress has enacted a whole separate title of the Clean Air Act to address acid rain."
2006.05-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3059.911,3064.696,"So that's the position you're taking, that it is within the general term?"
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3064.696,3071.6,"--I think it's largely the position that the agency took, Your Honor, insofar as it reasoned that, look, we've looked at everything."
2006.05-1120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3081.705,3097.75,"Which is why there's a significant difference between the agency saying that for 60 years, and I think this Court stressed that in its opinion, and Congress reacting to that, what the agency's position was."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3107.689,3116.045,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, it was 30 years before the agency reached the conclusion in 1998 that carbon dioxide was an air pollutant."
2006.05-1120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3122.448,3123.734,That's a different question.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3130.304,3138.142,"And I think... I mean, I grant you that there are differences between Brown and Williamson and this case, but the fundamental conclusion that the agency reached is the same."
2006.05-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3215.125,3219.427,I'd like you to address that.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3248.194,3250.196,"I think you're wrong in the following respect, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3250.196,3250.996,What articles would be--
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3250.996,3258.718,"Congress has passed at least six separate statutes to specifically address the issue of global warming, and all of them share two common features."
2006.05-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3272.26,3284.0,--Is there anything in the statute that prevents them from consulting with other nations or prevents the government from doing that when they determine how best to work out whatever standards or other forms of regulation they want?
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3284.0,3287.404,"--There's nothing in the Clean Air Act, if that's the stature you're referring to, but I--"
2006.05-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3287.404,3294.975,I presume the problem that they have in mind is that we have nothing to give in international negotiations.
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3303.847,3304.531,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3329.414,3332.016,"Do you think they have a good reason, yes or no?"
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3348.626,3353.347,"I think it's a proper basis within its inherent discretion, Your Honor, for at least two reasons."
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3374.177,3380.831,"--But Congress has not directed, don't regulate domestically for purposes of global warming."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3380.831,3382.033,"That's true, Your Honor, but--"
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3382.033,3399.827,"The problem that I have with your reference to this very... these various pieces of legislation that suggest that Congress has a different modus operandi in mind is that Congress certainly is aware that EPA has authority over pollutants, and it has never interfered with it."
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3399.827,3411.183,"--Well, Your Honor, again, I think in looking at all the sources the agency looked to, the conclusion is, that the agency responsibly and prudently reached, is that Congress has not authorized it to embark on this regulatory endeavor."
2006.05-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3412.768,3415.087,But isn't that a misstatement?
2006.05-1120,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3434.316,3435.418,--May I answer the question?
2006.05-1120,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3447.758,3448.541,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2006.05-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3451.36,3463.918,"Mr. Milkey, do you want us to send this case back to the EPA to ask them whether if only the last two pages of their opinion were given as a reason that would suffice?"
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3466.187,3467.27,"It would not make us happy, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3467.27,3467.855,I didn't think so.
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3471.941,3478.945,"Your Honor, if I can address the global aspect of the problem, the fact that the solution to the whole problem--"
2006.05-1120,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3478.945,3480.38,What is your answer to Justice Scalia?
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3491.67,3492.504,--That is exactly--
2006.05-1120,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3492.504,3493.37,Am I wrong about that?
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3493.37,3495.122,"--Your Honor, that is exactly what we want."
2006.05-1120,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3496.822,3498.408,"That's what I was asking, yes."
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3508.147,3516.453,"--Respectfully, Your Honor, I think EPA will have a hard time saying that there is insufficient... I mean, too much scientific uncertainty."
2006.05-1120,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3517.905,3519.355,They said it already.
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3519.355,3519.755,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3519.755,3521.606,The only question is whether that alone is enough.
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3521.606,3523.475,"Respectfully, Your Honor, they did not say that."
2006.05-1120,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3538.318,3549.291,"What they said was until more is understood about causes, extent and significance of climate change and the potential options for addressing it, we believe it's inappropriate to regulate these emissions."
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3549.291,3549.891,Your Honor.
2006.05-1120,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3549.891,3553.995,That strikes me as saying they think there is too much uncertainty for them to act.
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3553.995,3558.78,"Your Honor, they did not say there is too much uncertainty for them to form a judgment, which is the key issue."
2006.05-1120,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3583.847,3594.203,"If the EPA concludes that regulating an air pollutant would endanger public health and welfare, can it decline to regulate?"
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3594.203,3597.957,"Not under section 202, Your Honor."
2006.05-1120,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3597.957,3602.826,It has to regulate even if it concludes that regulation would make things worse?
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3602.826,3603.627,Would make things worse?
2006.05-1120,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3603.627,3604.06,Yes.
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3604.06,3605.527,"I'm sorry, I didn't understand that."
2006.05-1120,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3611.347,3621.639,Then why can't they... what is wrong with their view that for the United States to proceed unilaterally would make things worse and therefore they're going to decline to regular for that reason?
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3621.639,3632.095,"Your Honor, first of all, I don't believe they actually said that, and there is nothing in the statute that even hints that they can take foreign policy considerations into account."
2006.05-1120,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3638.482,3642.802,Isn't the definition of public welfare extremely broad?
2006.05-1120,2,31929,james_r_milkey,,3642.802,3649.622,"--Your Honor, it is certainly extremely broad, and it does include climate."
2006.05-1120,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3650.741,3651.391,"Thank you, counsel."
