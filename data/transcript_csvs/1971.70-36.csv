1971.70-36,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.724,We will hear arguments next in 70-36 Perry against Sindermann.
1971.70-36,0,46309,w_o_shafer,,49.644,56.814,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1971.70-36,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,180.43,184.166,You concede that there was a dismissal here or simply a --
1971.70-36,0,46309,w_o_shafer,,184.166,197.901,"It is a non-renewal, Mr. Justice and I debate in terms of termination and I may slip and say discharge, I do hope to make it clear that it was a year-to-year contract."
1971.70-36,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,201.698,203.538,It was a failure to the rehire.
1971.70-36,0,46309,w_o_shafer,,203.538,207.872,"Yes, it is a failure to renew or give him another contract."
1971.70-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.999,231.124,"Well you said dismissal, and I wondered if you were speaking that and I gather you are not."
1971.70-36,0,46309,w_o_shafer,,231.124,233.801,"No sir, we do not."
1971.70-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,233.801,235.56,"This was a professor, you are saying?"
1971.70-36,0,46309,w_o_shafer,,235.56,246.508,"Yes, well, and I guess you would say pro-professor, yes sir, this is a junior college and--"
1971.70-36,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,246.508,247.332,A two-year college.
1971.70-36,0,46309,w_o_shafer,,247.332,249.501,"Yes, sir a two year college."
1971.70-36,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,298.649,302.916,Does the college provided for hearing if requested?
1971.70-36,0,46309,w_o_shafer,,302.916,310.832,Well Odessa College does not have a tenure type of statement.
1971.70-36,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.98,631.877,"Well let's assume that there were valid grounds for non-renewal revealed in the pleading, that doesn’t necessarily mean that those are the grounds the college used, it could be that they used an invalid ground."
1971.70-36,0,46309,w_o_shafer,,631.877,633.6,Your Honor--
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1891.658,1895.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1971.70-36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1957.245,1972.437,"Well Mr. Gottesman, taking the phrase you used, is there anything but a probationary employee in a non-tenured context, do you have such thing, probationary employees?"
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1972.437,1973.569,I suppose not.
1971.70-36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1975.095,1977.228,"On a one year, on a one year plan."
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1977.228,1996.162,"That's correct, but why I meant by that was where you have a tenure systems, the arguments that are made in the Roth case, are not providing hearings, is that look we need this time to look these fellows over and we do give them the protections after we weeded out those that we don't think are going to cut the mustard here."
1971.70-36,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.97,2030.159,Where is Mr. Sindermann now?
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2030.159,2042.293,Mr. Sindermann has been for three years unable to obtain a teaching here and indeed he has for most of that period unable to obtain any employment even related to that.
1971.70-36,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2044.651,2045.36,Working for what?
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2045.36,2048.635,A former senator from the State of Texas.
1971.70-36,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.635,2049.579,State senator.
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2049.579,2054.097,"No, former U.S. Senator."
1971.70-36,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.169,2477.128,Does this theory also apply to one employed as a teacher by private college?
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2477.128,2485.168,"I would think not, since the -- that depends on whether the finance, the public financing that the private college gets would make it state action."
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2497.767,2531.401,"Well, Mr. Gottesman, if Sindermann had been an original applicant for employment by Odessa Junior college, if he had come with impeccable academic, intellectual credentials, with all sorts of fine letters of recommendation from the Dean and the Professors at Harvard where he had received his graduate degree and if the hiring authorities in Odessa Junior College had said, “ Yes, we recognize."
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2551.559,2554.88,Well this court has held that he would unless he would want to get involved.
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2574.66,2576.928,I suppose that's quite a --
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2576.928,2579.052,I don't want to get into the too far --
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2579.052,2583.118,I do want to get into that because I think it's just your position in this case.
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2586.832,2591.023,"No, I don't think, but this court has said that the state can not condition employment."
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2603.855,2606.927,But his contract has expired as it does each year.
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2606.927,2607.519,That's correct.
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2607.519,2614.331,"So, each year, he has to be rehired and I am asking simply about original employment."
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2614.331,2631.102,"Yeah, I think if a university said to a teacher, you are someone we would hire but for the fact we don't like your political views or but for the fact that you support tenure or but for the fact that you got to organize --"
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2631.102,2633.323,For year college or rather two year college --
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2633.323,2634.764,"Or well, yeah that's right."
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2634.764,2636.309,"Therefore, we are not going to hire you."
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2636.309,2643.011,Let me emphasize that under pickering this court has suggested that there are limits within which a teacher must comply themselves --
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2643.011,2644.393,That was a dismissal case.
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2655.136,2658.95,"Alright, well all I can say is that this court has decided three cases."
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2658.95,2660.205,All on behalf of --
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2660.205,2664.313,Two of them are non renewals and the third on an application for employment.
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2717.485,2719.338,But Pickering is like --
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2719.338,2721.113,Pickering itself a dismissal case.
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2721.113,2727.041,A dismissal case and you properly identified the questions on which we granted Certiorari in this case.
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2737.478,2738.644,Right.
1971.70-36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2774.227,2778.8,What impact is that concession suggested for us?
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2778.8,2784.973,"Well that concession I think has no point in this court obviously, this court considered all wrong."
1971.70-36,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2844.462,2862.173,"If you got to conceding that there is a difference obviously in fact between one who has been teaching for a tenure but who is teaches on a year to year contract and the original applicant, what is the difference from your point analytically."
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2862.173,2872.961,"Well, I started with a proposition that even the applicant can, I mean, so analytically it shouldn't make a difference, but there is a -- it seems me that there is a obvious difference."
1971.70-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2922.498,2923.053,Mr. Gottesman --
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2923.053,2926.976,Now that consideration is equally applicable to Mr. Sindermann.
1971.70-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2926.976,2938.101,"Mr. Gottesman, if we follow you to the bitter end Mr. Sindermann wins his point, doesn't he?"
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2941.423,2942.883,I am sorry.
1971.70-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2942.883,2944.414,You now have tenure employment --
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2944.414,2946.58,Oh absolutely not.
1971.70-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2948.056,2948.603,I am sorry.
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2948.603,2953.647,You now have the right not to be fired for exercising your First Amendment right.
1971.70-36,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2970.266,2973.408,"Or is your relief, you want a hearing though?"
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2973.408,2974.238,Does he want a hearing?
1971.70-36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2980.751,2983.93,"Before you do that Mr. Gottesman, let me ask you this."
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2989.628,2990.634,Absolutely.
1971.70-36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2990.634,2996.479,"Suppose when he applies a send back letter to him, so there is no dispute."
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3015.338,3016.875,If he has never worked there before?
1971.70-36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3016.875,3017.591,No.
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3017.591,3025.477,"Oh, I think that I have to get into the analysis of the hearing right to explain why I think he may not have a right to a hearing on that."
1971.70-36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3185.283,3189.543,"Alright, you are talking about a case where he is fired to use your word or --"
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3189.543,3208.622,"I am talking about a non-renewal case and I am assuming for the moment because that's our first point and I am assuming that a non-renewed teacher, if the reason for his non-renewal is the exercise of this First Amendment rights, has in fact suffered a constitutional violation and that he is entitled to reinstatement."
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3285.07,3289.582,The non-renewed teachers that he was fired for exercising his First Amendment Right?
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3289.582,3298.333,Well it would be adequate in the sense that if the teacher could afford to sue and could afford to be unemployed until he wins because those are the some of the prospects he faces.
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3300.47,3307.188,"But if the university said that, yeah, we fired you for that reason and we are sticking to it, is only alternative (Inaudible)"
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3307.188,3311.059,That's right but the hearing provides a buffer whereby he may talk them out of it.
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3328.248,3334.754,What do you think the remedy or what do you think was going to go on in a District Court for this remand?
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3334.754,3339.667,"Depends what it says, you mean if it were remanded in the --"
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3339.667,3342.433,"You figure, you won your case in the Court of Appeals?"
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3342.433,3345.812,"Pretty well, I mean there will be a remand for trial."
1971.70-36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3345.812,3347.294,For a trial or --
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3347.294,3351.236,"A trial, the Fifth Circuit's decree that there is got to be a trial on the right to a hearing."
1971.70-36,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3354.041,3365.702,"I would think you would be arguing that, the District Court would have to say that your client may not be terminated if it was been a University hearing?"
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3365.702,3374.25,"Well, the problem is the hearing at this point the hearing doesn't do Sindermann very much good, the people who are going to make the decision, they already decided before they gave them the hearing."
1971.70-36,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3377.204,3378.386,Well then --
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3378.386,3388.509,"And our point is that since they denied Sindermann the hearing to which we say he was entitled, is entitled to reinstatement and back pay and we say in a large number of cases in this Court."
1971.70-36,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3388.509,3393.108,"Without regard of what the facts would show, even though the university could show that he was not fired."
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3394.241,3394.584,That's right.
1971.70-36,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3556.102,3564.691,"There must be a hearing, when you have a – if there is non-renewal regardless of whether reasoned or assigned or not --"
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3564.691,3581.907,"Yes what we are saying is what you must do, our concept of the procedure is, if someone is recommending that you be not renewed that you will be advised that the recommendation and that you be advised that if you wish you will be told the reasons and afforded an opportunity to be heard."
1971.70-36,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3656.891,3662.087,"You wouldn't think that after a hearing such as that, there would be any room for judicial review?"
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3662.087,3668.42,"Only as it now exists, the constitution does prescribe certain limited areas where the State will exceed its discretion --"
1971.70-36,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3668.42,3681.134,"So you could have reviewed in Court your claim that in fact, he wasn't fired for discharged or not renewed for reason A but actually for reason B which was enough, that."
1971.70-36,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3681.134,3684.085,Well that exists now and we insist that.
1971.70-36,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3705.495,3708.282,"Thank you Mr. Gottesman, thank you Mr. Shafer."
