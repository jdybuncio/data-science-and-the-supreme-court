2013.12-872,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.254,"Our first case this term is Case 12-872, Madigan v. Levin."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1536.647,1540.532,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-872,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1583.128,1587.163,"Well, we said the exact opposite in Wilkie in Footnote 4."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1589.881,1592.983,"Well, we respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
2013.12-872,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1637.695,1638.861,"Well, your brother--"
2013.12-872,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1638.861,1639.311,But did--
2013.12-872,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1639.311,1647.234,--who just sat down explained that the Seventh Circuit's ruling didn't consider the issue that you're -- you're talking about now.
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1647.234,1650.003,"Well, I would respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
2013.12-872,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1665.278,1667.214,Was that the -- was that the first one or the second one?
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1667.214,1667.68,--The second one.
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1673.784,1688.561,"In your brief, could I just -- you say -- I think this is pretty close to the exact words: There's no realistic possibility of your obtaining a holding that Mr. Levin is an employee within the ADEA."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1689.994,1692.777,I concede that there's no realistic possibility.
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1692.777,1693.129,No.
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1706.77,1724.315,"Well, I -- I mean, they dodged -- he's -- the court has ruled, the Seventh Circuit in Opp v. Cook County State's Attorney, Your Honor, made it very clear their State's attorneys would be -- appointees would not be covered under the ADEA."
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1724.315,1744.745,"Well, if you're not willing to say that he is not an employee, then the issue is still in the case, and we would have -- if we were to rule on the ADEA issue, wouldn't we have to decide whether there is a remedy for somebody who is an employee within the ADEA?"
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1744.745,1745.745,Well--
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1745.745,1747.597,The district court might be wrong on that.
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1756.869,1760.587,"--Well, the Court will so rule."
2013.12-872,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1771.043,1772.812,"So you don't want to -- you don't want to give it up, which makes sense."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1783.368,1788.155,"--Well, as we stand here now, he is not in this case."
2013.12-872,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1790.873,1795.925,"It's pretty universal he's not an employee under ADEA, though he might be under GERA."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1820.31,1821.176,--Okay.
2013.12-872,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1840.789,1847.793,"Well, just to get this clear, you asked for this ruling from the Seventh Circuit."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1904.211,1915.086,"--Well, we think the difference was after the district court's decision in our case, that the Seventh Circuit decided another case in 2010."
2013.12-872,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1931.28,1938.551,"There's no real possibility that any court is going to find that your client was, in fact, an employee without GERA."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1940.986,1944.038,GERA is -- is another--
2013.12-872,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1944.038,1945.038,It's a different statute.
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1954.06,1954.56,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-872,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1954.56,1955.21,That's correct.
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1955.21,1955.662,Yes.
2013.12-872,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1955.662,1956.479,And you agree with that.
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1956.479,1956.896,Yes.
2013.12-872,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1956.896,1957.712,Okay.
2013.12-872,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1970.922,1973.523,Do you also agree that he is covered by GERA?
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1973.523,1976.059,"It is unclear, Your Honor."
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1997.139,1998.006,So what--
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,1998.006,2000.275,So whether or not there's a remedy there is very unclear.
2013.12-872,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2019.152,2021.354,"Well, it was never discussed because you never raised it; isn't that right?"
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2021.354,2025.056,Our position was it was inapplicable.
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2037.314,2047.436,--You want us to hold that the Seventh Circuit lacked jurisdiction to consider whether there is a cause of action under Section 1983.
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2076.539,2077.922,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-872,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2114.814,2125.872,"--And as far as the -- the preclusion is concerned, why does it make a difference whether it's ADEA or GERA?"
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2143.081,2145.016,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2252.968,2255.003,Can I ask you a question about the constitutional right?
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2265.794,2266.628,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2266.628,2280.738,"So that if there's any conceivable ground on which the decisionmaker could have decided that age was -- it was proper to make an age classification, there is no constitutional violation?"
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2280.738,2291.694,We can see where the rational basis test -- the court found we survived summary judgment on our equal protection gender discrimination claim and the age discrimination claim.
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2291.694,2294.478,"No, I'm just talking about equal protection age discrimination."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2294.478,2294.897,Yes.
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2294.897,2301.134,"And what if the Illinois legislature passed a statute that said: Now, forget about the ADEA."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2324.081,2326.2,We're all in trouble.
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2326.2,2332.004,Would that be -- would that survive a rational basis review?
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2332.004,2335.388,I don't believe so.
2013.12-872,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2364.242,2380.417,"Mr. Theobald, are there any cases out there in the universe of cases in which a person does not have an ADEA claim or a GERA claim, but has pressed a successful constitutional claim based on age discrimination?"
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2380.417,2386.573,"Well, GERA has never been -- there's one case on GERA that we could find."
2013.12-872,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2399.981,2418.209,"I guess the question is, what are the circumstances in which, given the very low standard or given -- given the very low rational basis standard, what are the circumstances in which you would have a viable constitutional claim but not a statutory claim?"
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2419.894,2429.85,"--If you had a claim under 1983, it would also, I believe, violate the ADEA."
2013.12-872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2433.638,2451.516,Would there be any unfairness to the parties if this case were remanded to the court of appeals with instructions for it in turn to remand to the district court to see whether or not the GERA issue has been properly presented or waived and to consider that?
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2453.016,2453.6,"Well, it would be--"
2013.12-872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2453.6,2455.234,--any unfairness to the parties in doing that?
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2455.234,2458.086,"--Be very unfair to us, Your Honor."
2013.12-872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2476.565,2479.683,That argument -- that argument could be made in the district court.
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2479.683,2490.905,"--Well, for something that's as suspect as GERA whether it even applies, it's -- the State has not said it applies--"
2013.12-872,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2490.905,2491.491,What about doing--
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2491.491,2492.124,--the State of Illinois.
2013.12-872,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.124,2494.776,--What if the -- is there anything unfair about this?
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2536.953,2542.773,"Well, our position is that, yes, that none of these apply."
2013.12-872,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2562.001,2564.203,I don't know if you've satisfied my colleagues.
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2605.197,2606.616,--Yes.
2013.12-872,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2606.616,2607.199,All right.
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2625.16,2627.612,"Yes, he's been excluded."
2013.12-872,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2630.029,2642.705,"Well, then I assume -- if you're saying the qualified immunity ruling should not be reviewed because this person was not an employee, but instead covered by GERA, right?"
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2642.705,2647.173,"--We don't agree that he's covered by GERA, but it's -- it's not clear."
2013.12-872,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2647.173,2651.059,"Well, they didn't address GERA in the preclusion ruling, right?"
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2671.222,2675.859,"Well, I don't think that would factor in, Your Honor, with the qualified immunity analysis."
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2695.521,2695.837,"Well, that's true, but is that the issue?"
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2718.45,2718.933,"It's the latter, yes."
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2718.933,2720.099,--Isn't the latter the real question.
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2720.099,2720.749,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2720.749,2723.485,"Well, that's not what the district court held though, is it?"
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2723.485,2727.537,"The district court did so hold, yes."
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2727.537,2749.985,"I thought the district court simply held that an official should have realized that irrational age discrimination was a violation of the Constitution, not that an official should have realized that it was a violation of the Constitution to do what was alleged to have been done here."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2749.985,2754.789,"I think it answered both questions, really."
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2757.408,2759.824,You don't see the difference between the two?
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2759.824,2760.926,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2796.016,2814.311,"If there's a qualified immunity appeal on the question -- on the issue of whether, let's say, a search was an unreasonable search, would qualified immunity be denied on the ground that an official should realize that an unreasonable search is unconstitutional?"
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2818.197,2825.785,"Well, if the facts that the officer was presented, if there wasn't -- it wasn't well settled that the conduct--"
2013.12-872,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2825.785,2828.57,"Ah, on the facts that were presented."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2828.57,2829.787,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2881.289,2885.257,"Yeah, but that's not what the Seventh Circuit held."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2913.76,2915.393,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-872,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2915.393,2917.878,"Well, not if there's no jurisdiction, right?"
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,2920.93,2924.382,"Yes, that -- that is true."
2013.12-872,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2992.876,2998.864,"In the Seventh Circuit, even though they -- you had that reference to him being exempt, the Seventh Circuit basically said it didn't make a difference, right?"
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,3007.203,3013.89,"I think we could read the opinion that way, but they certainly were aware that Mr. Levin was not covered."
2013.12-872,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3084.72,3089.174,Let's assume that the question that was presented is before us.
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,3112.472,3117.357,"--We believe, Your Honor, that those two cases are the second standard."
2013.12-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3271.123,3294.054,"Counsel, I'm trying to -- trying to see how -- how many of these arguments that you have made before us about why -- why we can't get to the holding of the Seventh Circuit, how many of them you made in your brief in opposition."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,3299.958,3302.477,We could have done--
2013.12-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3302.477,3309.915,"--only when the -- when the case is before us, counsel suddenly finds all sorts of reasons why we shouldn't have taken it in the first place."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,3313.284,3316.736,"--We could have done a better job -- we could have done a better job, Your Honor, and I apologize for that."
2013.12-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3325.756,3338.233,"Well, I read your brief in opposition as -- as going exclusively to what your unfortunate brother barely had a chance to argue; that is, the merits of the case."
2013.12-872,1,23319,edward_r_theobald_iii,,3348.521,3351.573,We could have done a better job.
2013.12-872,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3352.489,3353.156,"Thank you, counsel."
