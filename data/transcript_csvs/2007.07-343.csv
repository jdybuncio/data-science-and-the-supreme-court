2007.07-343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.951,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 07-343, Kennedy versus Louisiana."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,7.998,9.543,Thank you.
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,66.208,74.767,Our jurisprudence just requires the narrowing of the death penalty to be... to particularly heinous crimes.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,81.64,93.713,"--It's no doubt a serious crime, Justice Scalia, but I believe this Court's narrowing jurisprudence requires narrowing beyond a particularly heinous crime."
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,106.925,112.143,How would you describe a particularly heinous rape of a child under 12?
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,116.203,139.882,"Well, there could be several aggravating facts that would make a rape of a child, or indeed of any person, a particularly egregious crime, but in Coker against Georgia, this Court did not simply hold that the Eighth Amendment prohibited imposing the death penalty for the crime of rape; it held that this Court... that the Eighth Amendment prohibited imposing the death penalty for rape with aggravating circumstances."
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.432,180.96,Suppose... suppose the State says that all recidivist rapists of children under 12 will suffer the death penalty.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,191.534,191.909,--If--
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.909,200.391,"I mean, if the law says you have to be a recidivist, you have to have all the other factors that you just mentioned, if the law said that, would you come in and say,"
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,207.888,212.559,"--Well, no question that would be a much stronger argument under this Court's narrowing jurisprudence."
2007.07-343,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,249.34,249.699,All right.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,250.183,251.043,--on average.
2007.07-343,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,251.043,264.444,"--What if, instead, the State simply defined the class as the class of those who commit rape, and then listed as an aggravating circumstance the rape of a child under 12 years old?"
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,268.052,269.957,"I'm not sure it would, Justice Souter."
2007.07-343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,279.406,281.795,"Can you go over that, Mr. Fisher?"
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,332.557,337.697,--Let me first say that the State hasn't alleged those things that Justice Powell identified.
2007.07-343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,341.772,350.707,I'm questioning... you're saying it's off the chart because the Court held that you cannot have a death penalty for rape.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,353.237,364.185,"--Well, my understanding of this Court's Marks rule is that the narrowest opinion that commands a majority... so Justice Powell's opinion was actually a seventh vote."
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.385,372.744,That's a--
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,372.744,373.057,--the controlling one.
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.057,376.009,"--That's strange way of making a majority, isn't it?"
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,400.219,409.245,"Well, I'm not aware of any wrinkle in this Court's jurisprudence that says that if a Justice is too far out of the mainstream that their vote is discounted."
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.245,409.526,He--
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,409.526,410.306,But I want to try to--
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.306,414.54,--He... he is not considering the issue that is before the Court.
2007.07-343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,430.767,432.189,At any rate--
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,432.189,432.736,--Fair enough.
2007.07-343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,432.736,436.749,--There were four justices on the plurality opinion.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,438.609,439.373,Okay.
2007.07-343,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,440.264,443.481,"Even... even with respect to... now, I'm asking you to--"
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,443.481,443.779,--Right.
2007.07-343,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,443.779,445.979,--to forget my question again for a minute.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,445.979,446.261,Okay.
2007.07-343,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,446.511,460.317,"Even on the plurality analysis, your argument, as I understand it is, if there is any question left in Coker, in effect it's answered by Enmund/Tison."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,460.317,468.566,"--I think that's right, and it's also answered by simply the empirics across the country right now, if you did nothing more than applied the Roper and Atkins cases."
2007.07-343,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,468.566,469.674,"Okay, but then that's a different reason."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,469.674,470.268,Yes.
2007.07-343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,470.268,474.704,"Well, speaking of Roper and Atkins, is it... is it only work in one way?"
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,509.33,516.451,"Well, I think it's possible, but this Court has understood... I think well understood that it is a practical problem."
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,521.998,522.198,That's nice.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,522.198,522.59,--you're going to need to gravel--
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.59,523.371,I say that's nice.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,532.18,534.022,--I don't--
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.022,536.694,--about what justify's the death penalty.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,536.694,539.318,"--I don't think that's necessarily the case, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,572.226,583.596,"And the trend since 1995, '90, has been more and more States are passing statutes imposing the death penalty in situations that do not result in death."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,583.596,584.315,--I think that's right.
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.954,595.653,Didn't we say in Atkins that it's the trend that counts; it's not the number?
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,595.653,597.185,I think this Court said in Atkins--
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.185,616.052,The trend... the trendy expression hoist by your own petard: The trend here is clearly in the direction of permitting more and more... of more and more States permitting the capital punishment for this crime.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,616.052,622.315,"--Clearly, I think that Atkins and Roper look at trend among other things."
2007.07-343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,634.217,639.964,"Well, let me ask... we will put that to one side, but how much movement you need."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,656.676,661.268,"Well, as it happened here, States can pass laws, and they can bring prosecutions potentially reaching--"
2007.07-343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,661.268,665.766,But you want to say this is... you want to say this is unconstitutional because most States do it the other way.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,678.558,692.177,"--Well, a State could do something like what Georgia has done, which is pass a law that says that the death penalty is permissible in a given crime... in, for example, rape... to the extent allowed by the United States Supreme Court, which is the extent allowed by the Eighth Amendment."
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.282,705.593,They don't even have to say
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,712.544,712.919,--Of course.
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,712.919,715.184,"Abraham Lincoln should they could, anyway."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,715.184,717.823,"There's no double about that, and it happens frequently."
2007.07-343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,719.089,729.068,"If somebody in this case is tried and convicted under that law, you would say: Well, that's unconstitutional because there is not a sufficient trend in favor of that."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,739.377,745.125,"--As I said, it may be practically difficult, but it's not impossible, because this Court could eventually take notice of what it was seeing."
2007.07-343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,747.249,782.609,"There's a brief in this case on behalf of several States, and the argument that's made in that brief on the point that the Chief Justice has raised is we can never know whether there is a consensus one way or another so long as Coker seems to cover the waterfront, so long as Coker admits of the interpretation that you cannot have the death penalty for rape, period."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,799.978,803.773,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think there are two problems with that."
2007.07-343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,851.691,857.673,"I know, but, as I pointed out, it is very expensive to run a regime in which you have the death penalty."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,893.096,895.782,"There are, no doubt, various legislative considerations."
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,896.266,910.573,"Do you really think that if this Court held in the present case that the death penalty can be imposed for the rape of a child under 12, do you really think that the trend would not continue, that there would not be more States to enact such a penalty?"
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,910.573,912.369,"--Oh, absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,912.369,913.057,That there would be more?
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,913.057,913.447,No.
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,915.602,916.352,That it would not.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,916.352,934.985,"If... and I think it is important to understand not just the Louisiana supreme court; but in 2004, when Patrick Kennedy was put on death row in Louisiana, in light of this Court's Atkins and Roper jurisprudence, notice was served in all death-penalty jurisdictions that if you want a law like this, you've got a few years to pass it before this case gets to the Supreme Court."
2007.07-343,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,966.707,985.184,"Do you think that all these other States, if told that it is permissible to have the death penalty for child rape at least under some circumstances, would come to the conclusion that the worst case of child rape that can be envisioned is still less heinous than any murder that qualifies for the death penalty?"
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,985.184,988.542,"--I think they may well, Justice Alito."
2007.07-343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1048.19,1059.435,"I wonder if Atkins and Roper are qualitatively different, considering the mental retardation of the offender, the youth of the offender."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1105.917,1112.04,"Well, this Court has always differentiated its proportionality analysis from capital to a non-capital context."
2007.07-343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1122.207,1122.769,What about treason?
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1156.381,1157.38,"--Well, of course, this Court has never answered that, but I think there is every reason to believe--"
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.38,1158.786,Isn't there a Federal treason statute?
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1158.786,1159.021,--Of course.
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1159.988,1160.66,And that doesn't require murder; does it?
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1160.66,1162.332,"--No, it does not."
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.346,1164.503,Do you think that's unconstitutional?
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1164.503,1165.503,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.079,1175.638,Do you think treason is worse than child rape?
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1175.638,1178.34,"Well, Blackstone thought treason was more serious than murder."
2007.07-343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1187.634,1188.4,But we're talking about--
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1188.4,1188.696,Now--
2007.07-343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1188.696,1199.927,"--if were talking about evolving trends, I think it's fair to say that society's recognition of the seriousness of the crime of rape has evolved even since, the period since Coker."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1203.129,1204.097,--I--
2007.07-343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1204.097,1210.171,"It certainly involved... evolved since the time of Blackstone and even since... as I say, even since Coker."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1231.96,1236.131,"--Well, I don't think societal attitudes have changed very much."
2007.07-343,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1259.887,1264.744,The plurality opinion in Coker said this: Life is over for the victim of the murderer.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1271.1,1273.412,--Perhaps not.
2007.07-343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1282.674,1314.74,"There was, at least in the amici briefs in Coker... may not have been explicit in the Court's decision... but the argument was made that the rape law in question, the Georgia law, came from an earlier tradition when a woman was regarded as as good as dead once she was raped; and the crime was thought to be an offense against her husband or her father as much as it was to her."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1360.721,1386.226,"Justice Ginsburg, I think, although not with the same historical pedigree, the same argument is being put forward by the State today, that by definition, for a child to have been raped is tantamount to having been killed, and the social workers and sex assault experts here today I think are telling you with this one voice, we very much want to avoid sending--"
2007.07-343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1386.226,1394.66,But it isn't... it isn't the notion that she's somebody else's property; and... which was the history of the rape statutes.
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1394.66,1415.918,"--I think that's fair enough, Justice Ginsburg, but I think also I'd like... perhaps Justice Alito was right, that looking at the Court's opinion gives us the best indication of the analysis; and I think the parts that you were reading are from the earlier part of the opinion where the Court was saying that rape in general is not as serious as murder, but the end of the plurality win in Coker is very emphatic."
2007.07-343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1431.021,1436.191,"Coker, of course, repeatedly in the statement of the facts and the analysis, repeatedly referred to the victim as an adult woman."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1445.858,1448.655,--We don't argue otherwise.
2007.07-343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1516.705,1524.641,"Mr. Fisher, your white light is on, and you do want to protect your rebuttal right, but you began by indicating that this statute could be narrowed."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1530.95,1538.728,"--Well, I think there are two ways to decide this case on more narrow grounds, I'll offer this answer to your question."
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.045,1564.389,Well--
2007.07-343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1564.389,1564.842,What would they be?
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1564.842,1574.183,"--One could imagine something like torture or extraordinarily serious harm in a case, something like that."
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1576.556,1577.712,--How do you do view recidivism?
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1591.675,1592.832,--I'm not sure what the question is.
2007.07-343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1592.832,1599.749,"I mean, it is an unrealistic condition that you have raped a 12-year... a child twice."
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1606.935,1608.543,"I think that's right, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1614.136,1616.135,"It was 25 years, right?"
2007.07-343,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1616.135,1618.226,"--Yes, in Texas and a couple of other States."
2007.07-343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1630.347,1631.425,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,1640.406,1648.263,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves the very savage rape of an 8-year-old child by her stepfather."
2007.07-343,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.613,1673.736,Could you just clarify about the... were those injuries permanent?
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,1673.736,1677.266,"--Your Honor, those injuries, after surgery they did heal."
2007.07-343,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1679.188,1681.281,They were not permanent injuries.
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,1681.281,1684.358,"In the sense that they healed, that's correct, Your Honor."
2007.07-343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1707.848,1719.031,"Both... both sides have something of a dilemma with Coker, because if you say that it does not control this case, then the consensus or the lack of consensus... or the consensus is more reliable."
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,1728.06,1742.726,"--Yes, Your Honor, I understand that... that sort of a tension, Justice Kennedy, and I think for the defendant, he's the one asking the Court to create this broad categorical restriction and he's saying that it clearly precludes it."
2007.07-343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1768.012,1776.274,There is no... there is doubt in my mind that this particular kind of crime has not been the subject of a Supreme Court opinion.
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,1843.809,1855.789,"Your Honor, I think the Constitution by only precluding cruel and unusual punishment leaves open the possibility that there are certain crimes that by their nature are so heinous that the death penalty--"
2007.07-343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.789,1857.117,So the answer is yes?
2007.07-343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.071,1894.461,Just the way they used to.
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,1894.461,1895.883,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2007.07-343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1895.883,1899.255,"Perhaps at the time, 200 years ago, that's true."
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,1900.146,1906.362,I think we have to recognize that with child rape there is something very unique and horrible about this crime.
2007.07-343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1909.016,1915.358,And it's not true... I've read the definition of section 41 of rape under the Louisiana code.
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,1961.965,1981.159,"--Your Honor, I'm slightly confused as to what you're referring to in terms of a wide variety of acts, because Louisiana Revised Statute 3 14: 42 that Patrick Kennedy was convicted under, it only provides that he could be convicted of aggravated rape of a child under 12 where he had anal intercourse or vaginal intercourse with that child."
2007.07-343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1982.284,1983.112,Those are the only two.
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,1984.751,1985.486,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2007.07-343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1985.486,1985.829,Thank you.
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,1985.829,1987.485,Only anal or vaginal rape.
2007.07-343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2021.316,2026.704,"Ms. Clark, what do you do with the requirement that our cases have imposed?"
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2071.795,2072.481,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.07-343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.918,2073.418,Why not.
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2073.418,2103.641,"--The point that I was trying to make about murder about the category being so broad, the class being so broad, the range of actions being so broad that when the Court was looking at... in Furman... what kind of homicides... how do we know whether... why this person is getting the death penalty and why this person isn't, what is the standard that guides it, they were looking at situations where murders like the... ini Furman his actions were described as tripping over a wire as you left the house and accidently shooting the homeowner through the front door."
2007.07-343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.641,2110.779,You think intentional murder of a... of a law officer would need no further narrowing?
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2110.779,2111.701,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.07-343,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2124.414,2124.868,Excuse me.
2007.07-343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2124.868,2138.143,"Why is it sufficient... why isn't it sufficient narrowing, even after Coker, that they make the death eligibility rape of a child under 12 as opposed to under 16?"
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2138.143,2140.236,That is.
2007.07-343,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2171.333,2175.114,May I go back to your... to your answer on the murder question?
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2349.323,2350.323,"No, Your Honor."
2007.07-343,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2366.176,2367.77,I quite agree with that.
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2430.807,2434.369,"--Well, I agree with you on that, though I think that perhaps--"
2007.07-343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2434.369,2434.775,Do you?
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2435.463,2438.617,"--Well, not... I agree in the sense that--"
2007.07-343,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2438.617,2440.336,"Well, let's find out how much."
2007.07-343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2441.008,2460.498,"Didn't the... didn't the Louisiana statute that... that was at issue in Lowenfield produce the result that if you committed intentional murder of a law enforcement officer, it was up to the jury whether to give you the death penalty or not?"
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2460.498,2460.873,"--Yes, correct, Your Honor."
2007.07-343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2460.873,2470.916,"Would not the same result be... be achieved by a statute that said if you intentionally kill a law enforcement officer, you are subject to the death penalty?"
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2474.149,2475.383,That's correct.
2007.07-343,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2476.445,2483.568,And isn't... isn't the difference... isn't the difference just what Justice Scalia brought up in an earlier question to Mr. Fisher?
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2524.738,2537.484,"I think, if I can address this perhaps without a specific yes or no, what I'm saying is the homicide statute draws specifically a large class and specifically narrows it."
2007.07-343,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2544.745,2568.517,"In one respect is broader, and perhaps whether it assists your position, Coker is a crime that could have only a female victim and a male perpetrator, but this child rape statute as I understand it could be the... the victim could, male or female; the perpetrator could be male or female."
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2568.517,2570.314,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.07-343,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.752,2618.217,"If you're looking for time, let me ask you one... one question that interests me but is a little divorced from the terms of the arguments so far."
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2658.731,2666.118,"--Well, first of all, I certainly recognize that there are approximately 28 international countries that would permit the death penalty for rape."
2007.07-343,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2687.782,2688.704,I'm not asking that.
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2707.336,2718.176,"--I think we can, especially where, as here, that turn-around, that determination is based upon a unique understanding of how this crime seriously, gravely affects children in a manner--"
2007.07-343,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.176,2720.644,Do we know more about the crime now than we did 40 years ago?
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2720.644,2721.517,"--Well, I think that we do."
2007.07-343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2747.57,2753.239,"Can you... can you give me one second on my own error here, but I just traced the statute through."
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2783.415,2783.992,That is the correct statutory thing.
2007.07-343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2783.992,2784.899,All right.
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2784.899,2786.444,I was trying to make this clear--
2007.07-343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2786.444,2803.079,"Then I go back to my if that is the right statutory thing, because it seems to cover, particularly in its definition of oral intercourse, a very wide range of child molesting, all of which I agree is quite bad, but it's still a very, very wide range."
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2803.079,2808.655,"--Well, I think that all sexual intercourse is... I think that's a pretty definite offense, despite--"
2007.07-343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2808.655,2809.483,I didn't say it wasn't.
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2809.483,2816.449,--But also I would suggest that the point is here is that Patrick Kennedy was not convicted under that provision.
2007.07-343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2817.495,2821.4,"No, I mean, my question relates back to what Justice Souter was talking about, about the narrowing of the statute."
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2821.4,2821.588,--Right.
2007.07-343,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2828.662,2842.048,What do you say about the effect of Enmund and Tison as a... as a means to understand how we ought to read Coker?
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2842.812,2843.531,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2885.141,2885.766,"Thank you, Ms. Clark."
2007.07-343,1,29455,juliet_l_clark,,2885.766,2886.874,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2007.07-343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2886.874,2898.915,Mr. Cruz?
2007.07-343,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2898.915,2913.081,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Few evolving standards of decency are more pronounced that the growing understanding in modern society of the unique and irreparable harm caused by violent child rape."
2007.07-343,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3017.025,3026.162,"You started out by saying it's the worst cases of child abuse, and that's... child rape... and that's why I was interested in the definition."
2007.07-343,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3051.62,3052.824,"You're not exactly right, Justice Breyer."
2007.07-343,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.824,3053.152,Thank you.
2007.07-343,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3053.152,3057.197,The statute that is being challenged in this case was the pre-amended statute.
2007.07-343,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3057.197,3058.697,So the amendment--
2007.07-343,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3058.697,3059.165,So oral was not in it.
2007.07-343,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3066.489,3068.113,It was not all child rape.
2007.07-343,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3068.113,3069.16,Exactly.
2007.07-343,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3069.16,3071.082,It was not all child rape.
2007.07-343,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3073.112,3073.954,That's exactly rate.
2007.07-343,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3080.124,3080.811,--Thank you.
2007.07-343,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3081.218,3081.843,--And anal.
2007.07-343,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3100.912,3111.769,"But there was some indication that in most cases the prosecutors, in part to see if they can get a plea bargain, begin by saying they're going to charge with the death penalty."
2007.07-343,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3132.995,3139.428,"Justice Kennedy, Petitioners assert that that is the case, that a plea bargain has been offered in every instance."
2007.07-343,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3218.007,3227.424,Will you give us one sentence or two on the response to all the professionals who've commented in the briefs in saying the death penalty here will make this situation worse?
2007.07-343,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3227.424,3233.655,Those professionals... that is their opinion on a difficult policy question.
2007.07-343,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3372.443,3384.548,But has that sort of a different direction from evolving standards of decency occurred at all since we first announced the evolving standards of decency and jurisprudence in this Court?
2007.07-343,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3384.548,3398.089,"I'm not aware of a decision doing so, but the analytical predicate for the evolving standards of decency... this Court said over and over again the most reliable indicium is the objective judgment of elected legislatures."
2007.07-343,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3399.511,3405.774,But what about the comment on the international community's view that it is really a one way rachet?
2007.07-343,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3479.494,3507.763,"If you were asked to draft this statute that we have here and you have just the definition of the first statute with the... what we call aggravated kind of... and you have the age limit, would any other limiting categories occur to you as being inconsistent with sound statutory drafting and sound policy?"
2007.07-343,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3507.763,3513.105,"--Justice Kennedy, there are three possible narrowing factors that occur to me."
2007.07-343,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3523.867,3524.818,And that's prior conviction--
2007.07-343,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3524.818,3525.553,Prior conviction.
2007.07-343,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3525.553,3526.146,--not prior offenses?
2007.07-343,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3526.146,3527.223,Correct.
2007.07-343,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3570.301,3571.035,"Thank you, Mr. Cruz."
2007.07-343,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3574.581,3585.186,I would like to address first the narrowing component of this case and then turn to the idea of trends on the first question presented.
2007.07-343,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3667.184,3668.527,Is that in front of us here?
2007.07-343,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3668.527,3673.839,"--It is with respect to narrowing, because Mr. Cruz... the only answer to that, I think is what Mr. Cruz--"
2007.07-343,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3673.839,3682.803,This is not a speech case where you have standing to object to the statute that can... would be unconstitutional as applied to others--
2007.07-343,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3682.803,3683.708,--We absolutely do--
2007.07-343,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3683.708,3687.176,--Or is... contradicts.
2007.07-343,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3687.176,3696.345,"--There's square precedent, unanimous holding of this Court in Maynard against Cartwright so that you can't justify a statute that fails to narrow on as applied grounds."
2007.07-343,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3704.012,3705.528,I don't understand the difference.
2007.07-343,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3740.217,3742.358,At the end of the day the jury has discretion.
2007.07-343,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3777.359,3785.793,"--I thought... the bulk of your argument, though, it seems to me, would not... would be the same in a recidivist case, because, of course, that doesn't result in death either."
2007.07-343,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3785.793,3786.73,I think--
2007.07-343,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3786.73,3792.868,"I mean, I don't... it is sort of a factual distinction but I don't see how it helps your argument."
2007.07-343,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3792.868,3794.915,"--Well, it would give you a narrower way to do this case."
2007.07-343,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3821.184,3830.431,"I'm not sure that the sort of trends that they look to in Roper and Atkins... I mean, you had different crimes that carried the capital punishment as well."
2007.07-343,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3832.961,3840.895,"If we're looking at trends, perhaps I can leave you with this: Again, remember what we have in terms of a trend."
