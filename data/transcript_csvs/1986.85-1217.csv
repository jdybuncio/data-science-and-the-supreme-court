1986.85-1217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,0.683,We will hear arguments first this morning in the City of Springfield versus Lois Thurston Kibbe.
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,1.316,1.649,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,95.991,104.847,"Mr. Pikula, is a policy unconstitutional if it permits but does not explicitly authorize constitutional violations?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,104.847,112.12,"I believe a policy is unconstitutional if it requires the conduct which causes a constitutional violation, or permits it."
1986.85-1217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,112.12,113.186,"No, my question was, if it permits."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,113.186,116.405,Or permits the conduct which is unconstitutional.
1986.85-1217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,116.405,134.2,"Did the Court of Appeals, Mr. Pikula... excuse me... say what the unconstitutional conduct, what the constitutional violation was?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,134.2,140.472,I believe a Fourteenth Amendment violation of the Constitution was at issue.
1986.85-1217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,140.472,142.039,Well what... more specific.
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,147.709,155.047,"No, the jury instruction did charge on a violation of due process, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1986.85-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,157.732,165.755,How far do you go in not taking necessary steps before you are in effect permitting?
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,184.599,191.488,"--Well, I think a different constitutional amendment would be in issue in a prison case."
1986.85-1217,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,219.905,227.828,You said a different constitutional... I understood you to say... provision would be involved in a prison case?
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,227.828,234.851,"Well, I believe Justice Scalia's question involved an Eighth Amendment case, where someone who's in custody."
1986.85-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,275.892,279.36,"Before you leave the first, I'm not sure I completely understand your view."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,303.625,305.744,"--I don't believe so, no."
1986.85-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,308.279,315.433,"But it would be... it would be unconstitutional if they, in addition to that, said, everytime you see anybody running away, you just go ahead and shoot to kill."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,315.433,315.933,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,315.933,316.099,Then it would be bad.
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,319.235,342.833,"Or an instruction such as was in issue in Tennessee v. Garner, where that policy certainly intended that deadly force be used against a nondangerous felon, even though they didn't go out and say, shoot every nondangerous fleeing felon, that conducted was permitted by the statute in that case."
1986.85-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.833,350.087,"Well, what if the municipality knows that its police are constantly using lethal force?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,350.087,351.522,"Well, that--"
1986.85-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.522,353.356,"You know, there are several people killed every month."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,362.664,367.799,"--In that situation, we certainly have some sort of pattern of misconduct--"
1986.85-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.799,370.984,"By the officers, but not by the city."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,370.984,384.16,"--No, but you may be able to infer some sort of conscious decision by policymakers in not responding to that prior patter, which might give them some knowledge that there was something wrong."
1986.85-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.814,391.681,But isn't that gross negligence you're talking about?
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,402.555,412.228,"--Well, in any case, before anything could be attributed to a policymaker, some conscious decision on the part of a policymaker needs to be shown."
1986.85-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,417.315,420.766,What if the only decision was not to fire any of these officers?
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,424.654,425.82,Again--
1986.85-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,425.82,431.022,"If they're on notice that they're very poorly trained, and they're very hazardous to the general public."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,431.022,435.49,--If there is some notice that they are some hazard to the general public--
1986.85-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,435.49,440.461,"Well, what if the notice takes the form that we don't think you have an adequate training program for your police."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,447.365,451.15,--I don't believe so.
1986.85-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.788,485.24,"Well, that goes to whether the negligence is gross or not."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,503.367,514.924,"Well, gross negligence is an insufficient standard for liability, because it does not involve any cognitive element which is necessary to show any state of mind on the part of policymakers."
1986.85-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.924,515.924,"Well, I'm not sure I agree with you."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,525.631,537.256,The violation of the due process clause has historically involved deliberate or conscious decisions rather than a lack of due care.
1986.85-1217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,562.24,580.118,"Well, Mr. Pikula, if the city policymakers adopt an inadequate policy with regard to a specific matter, and if they know that it is inadequate, is that enough for the determination of a policy?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,580.118,588.105,"I don't believe inadequate training, in itself, is enough for a constitutional violation."
1986.85-1217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,588.105,598.929,"If they adopt a policy for police training which is in fact inadequate, and if they know it is inadequate, is that enough?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,598.929,608.269,"Only if that training policy intends conduct which violates the Constitution, or permits conduct which violates the Constitution?"
1986.85-1217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,608.269,615.708,"Well, by definition, if it's inadequate, it's going to permit conduct which would violate the Constitution."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,615.708,618.243,Not necessarily.
1986.85-1217,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,618.243,623.279,Doesn't it go to fault rather than to the existence of a policy?
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,626.682,653.25,"I believe that the issue of fault on the part of the city is shown when you show that policymakers have made some sort of conscious decision, or acted deliberately, rather than inferring that they have done something without any evidence to show policymakers have acted at all."
1986.85-1217,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,655.333,656.952,You don't take into consideration failure to act?
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,665.391,673.212,--I think historically failure to act has not been the basis of constitutional violations.
1986.85-1217,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,673.212,683.185,Failure to instruct the police on the proper methods of protecting people's rights is not required?
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,683.185,687.471,"Again, it would be a violation of state law in Massachusetts."
1986.85-1217,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,695.91,705.183,"Well, for a city to hire a man, give him a gun, tell him he's entitled to kill somebody and turn him loose, that's--"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,705.183,706.283,"--No, certainly not."
1986.85-1217,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,706.283,709.068,"--and nothing else, that wouldn't be a violation of the law?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,709.068,713.955,"That certainly would be, telling somebody they're entitled to shoot."
1986.85-1217,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,713.955,715.24,"That's what I'm talking about, nonaction."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,719.525,720.025,Yes.
1986.85-1217,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,720.025,722.394,"Well, how much do you have to tell him?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,722.394,727.798,"No, under the Constitution, as I said, I don't believe there is an affirmative duty to train."
1986.85-1217,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,727.798,736.737,"xxx tell him, don't take this gun that I give you and unwillingly kill somebody?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,736.737,752.83,The Constitution... or I don't think there's any evidence in this case or in any other case which shows that just giving someone a gun is more likely than not... likely to result in constitutional violations.
1986.85-1217,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,762.554,764.221,"Well, now you're going to use the dog bite rule."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,767.089,768.206,--No.
1986.85-1217,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,800.744,812.654,"I still get the feeling that your position is, the only way the city can be liable is if the city says, specifically, you don't need to follow the Constitution; do what you please."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,815.404,815.856,"No, certainly not."
1986.85-1217,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,815.856,816.889,"Well, how else?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,816.889,834.984,"Well, for example, in Tennessee v. Garner, if a city adopted a policy which permitted deadly force to be used against a nondangerous fleeing felon, that would violate the Constitution under Tennessee v. Garner, and would be an unconstitutional policy, although not unconstitutional on face."
1986.85-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.137,842.423,Let me phrase the question just a little different.
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,877.478,879.278,--I don't believe so.
1986.85-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,879.278,889.451,xxx I'm not sure what you can say about it except that it happened.
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,929.36,931.112,I certainly wouldn't ask for that instruction again.
1986.85-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.112,931.778,I know that.
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,931.978,934.98,It may have been unartfully drafted on my part.
1986.85-1217,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.086,947.538,"Well, then, the Court of Appeals didn't foreclose review on the basis that you didn't object."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,950.757,951.44,That's correct.
1986.85-1217,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.929,961.131,What was not brought up?
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,963.131,963.583,The failure to object.
1986.85-1217,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.653,971.07,"Rule on it, they ruled on it and approved it."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,971.703,975.641,"They approved the instruction, although they noted, it could have certainly been more detailed."
1986.85-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,976.724,982.461,"But that was the instruction on proximate cause, not the instruction Justice Scalia is talking about."
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,989.882,997.119,"--As I said, I believe our motion for a directed verdict did."
1986.85-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1002.44,1004.156,And what about at the Court of Appeals?
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,1004.156,1015.163,"At the Court of Appeals, it was not specifically laid out in our brief that way, although we did ask for some higher standard of culpability."
1986.85-1217,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1030.257,1032.791,May I ask this before you proceed?
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,1035.827,1038.445,--None whatsoever.
1986.85-1217,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1044.767,1050.354,"If there was no evidence, why was the instruction not objected to?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,1050.354,1063.478,"Well, again, once the trial judge had denied my motion for a directed verdict, some jury instruction did have to be put forward, and therefore--"
1986.85-1217,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1063.478,1064.513,That's one you wish you had objected to?
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,1064.513,1066.882,"--One I wish I had objected to, yes."
1986.85-1217,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1066.882,1074.719,"xxx what Justice Scalia read you was the instruction that you requested, wasn't it?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,1074.719,1075.654,"That's correct, Justice."
1986.85-1217,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1075.654,1081.475,And then... how would you object to it after you requested it and your request was granted?
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,1081.475,1082.858,I--
1986.85-1217,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1082.858,1087.546,How did your motion for a directed verdict put it in issue.
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,1087.546,1097.901,--The first point... our first point... our first point in our motion for a directed verdict was that there was no proof of an unconstitutional policy.
1986.85-1217,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1114.796,1120.183,"Well, you never retracted the request for the gross negligence instruction, did you?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,1120.183,1121.117,"No, I did not."
1986.85-1217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1137.56,1159.908,"Yes, and we had something to say about that situation in the opinion in the Tuttle case, did we not, that where the respondent fails at the certiorari stage to bring out the reasons why the court might not be able to reach a point made in the petition for certiorari, that unless it's a jurisdictional point, the court will consider it waived?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,1159.908,1160.708,--That's correct.
1986.85-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.708,1165.479,"Of course, they did bring it out in the brief in opposition, though, didn't they?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,1167.679,1171.014,"Not in the brief in opposition to cert, but in the brief on the merits."
1986.85-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.014,1175.252,"Well, in the brief in opposition to cert, they raised the question about the instructions too, didn't they?"
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,1178.954,1184.873,"Well, I don't believe they raised the 51(a) objection."
1986.85-1217,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1206.973,1208.656,Let me go back to the instruction problem.
1986.85-1217,0,22940,edward_m_pikula,,1214.21,1219.531,"We challenged... no, that's correct."
1986.85-1217,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1276.033,1278.152,"Thank you, Mr. Pikula."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1279.819,1289.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1329.835,1343.178,"Well, Mr. Nagel, in your opposition to petition for writ of certiorari, the orange, did you bring to our attention the reasons that you now adduce for not reaching the points?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1343.178,1348.63,"No, Your Honor, that would have been impossible, because my brother, Mr. Pikula, didn't put it in his petition for certiorari."
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1398.745,1414.071,"Well, then, what you're saying is not that we can't reach the points that they raised in their petition for certiorari, which we granted, or anything fairly subsumed under it, but that the instruction point that they're making is outside the scope of even those points?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1414.071,1414.621,Yes.
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1437.437,1440.306,What did the Court of Appeals decide?
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1440.306,1441.789,--About that issue?
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1441.789,1452.779,"No, about... didn't they say that... didn't they say that... talk about the standard for determining when there is a policy about--"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1452.779,1458.617,"They agreed with the gross negligence standard, but it wasn't litigated in the First Circuit, because both sides agreed at the First Circuit."
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1464.587,1473.027,"--Well, do you say then... but I suppose the issue is fairly here with respect to whether the evidence shows that there was gross negligence?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1473.027,1473.377,"Well, certainly."
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1475.645,1476.362,Yes.
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1476.362,1477.795,--And I don't quarrel with that.
1986.85-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1513.687,1524.792,"Well, the petition for cert said... says the following, among other things: The Court in Tuttle expressed doubts as to whether inadequate training can ever be a policy or custom under Monell."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1540.069,1540.937,--It's true.
1986.85-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1555.847,1556.614,I see.
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1556.614,1561.001,"But the gross negligence question simply, as far as I can tell, isn't properly--"
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1592.937,1598.941,And what was the unconstitutional policy in this hypothesis?
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1598.941,1618.587,"Both courts below... Chief Judge Frank Freedman of the Massachusetts District, and the Court of Appeals... found that there was evidence sufficient to warrant a finding that it was a policy of the Springfield police force to allow the use of deadly force at the first moment at the first moment at which it was technically... appeared technically permissible to do so under the rules."
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1626.693,1632.847,"And what was the view below, what was it that was unconstitutional about that policy?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1632.847,1648.273,"--Well, there was evidence at trial which indicated that the police had operated under a rule which allowed them to create a danger, or create the appearance of an attack, and then use deadly force."
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.866,1664.485,And what was he doing at that point?
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1665.818,1668.77,"--He was driving down the street in his car, with a woman in the seat--"
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1668.77,1671.306,"--But there were a few more facts attending it than that, weren't there?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1671.306,1672.106,"--Well, it depends."
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1711.966,1720.572,"And your claim is that your client, or your client's predecessor, was not a... was a nondangerous fleeing felon?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1720.572,1722.005,Certainly the jury could have found that.
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.629,1734.079,"He also went through a roadblock, didn't he?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1734.079,1739.216,--He went through a roadblock that was set up over a crest of a hill where he had two seconds when he came over the hill.
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1762.566,1771.604,"And so you say, that part of your hypothesis, the unconstitutional conduct is based on our decision in Tennessee v. Garner?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1771.604,1774.206,"Which part, you mean the rule?"
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1774.206,1776.189,"Well, the... yes."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1776.189,1781.641,"Well, actually at the time it would have been based on Commonwealth v. Klein, which tracks Garner almost exactly."
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1812.445,1821.718,"Well, failure to train doesn't deal with whether or not there was a 1980... there was a violation of a constitutional right."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1826.955,1827.155,--Yes.
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.155,1835.728,"I mean, you could have a failure to train, and if no constitutional right was violated as a result of that failure to train, it doesn't make a bit of difference."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,1835.728,1837.094,That's true.
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2061.538,2066.94,"Well, wouldn't that allow the finding of liability just on the basis of respondeat superior, so far as the city is concerned?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2066.94,2067.81,"No, I don't believe it would."
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2077.166,2082.735,"Well, that's where the idea of respondeat superior comes from, I thought, is agency law."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2082.735,2085.253,--It may come from the great body of agency law.
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2216.573,2228.298,"xxx someone is hurt by... as a result of negligence by a city official at a supervisory level, there's a claim for constitutional violation?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2228.298,2231.933,"--At a supervisory level, if we're understanding that word to mean the same thing."
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2262.202,2267.154,"What about negligent construction of a building, of a city building, under the supervision--"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2267.154,2268.023,--Under 1983?
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2268.023,2270.106,"--Yes, under the supervision of a city manager?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2270.106,2272.392,"Well, I--"
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.392,2275.094,"And a piece of the building falls off and kills somebody, depriving him of life."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2275.094,2294.34,"--Of course that has so little to do with the police conduct area, where you know you're dealing with a dangerous instrumentality, firearms, so forth, that you're unleashing on the populace, and that if the people aren't trained, the constitutional violations are not only foreseeable, they're almost inevitable."
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2294.34,2298.642,Is there any constitutional violation in Justice Scalia's hypothesis?
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2298.642,2302.077,"Is there... is there deprivation, you mean?"
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2302.077,2314.152,"Well, is there any... I mean, is there any constitutional violation if the city building in structure has negligently supervised the construction of a building, and the building collapses on somebody?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2314.152,2314.719,I doubt it.
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2314.719,2316.187,"Well, I would hope you would doubt it."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2316.187,2317.471,"Yes, because we would be--"
1986.85-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.471,2319.873,"Why is that, when you've urged a negligence theory?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2326.36,2342.238,"--I think it's because, in the area of police brutality, which is a central governmental function... or police... the police are a central governmental function, one hopes... you have a different standard of--"
1986.85-1217,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.238,2344.038,I don't see anything in there about police.
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2376.542,2380.196,"--Well, I don't think it would be a deprivation under color of state law."
1986.85-1217,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2391.671,2396.623,"Mr. Nagel, haven't a good many lower courts applied a deliberate indifference standard?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2396.623,2401.193,"--The courts have been inconsistent, you're right."
1986.85-1217,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2402.16,2408.696,"Well, certainly, there are a good many cases out there in these situations that have applied a deliberate indifference standard."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2414.517,2421.94,"--Well, Davidson and Cannon, as I understood it, was ruling out simple negligence as to officials."
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2702.504,2734.058,"Could I ask, do you believe that if some member of the community or some organization interested in law enforcement thought that the city had an inadequate training program or one that evidenced deliberate indifference or gross negligence could just bring a suit and say... a 1983 suit and say, you've got a bad program, and we want an injunction for you to measure up?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2734.058,2736.758,--You mean without the occurrence of harm?
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.758,2737.544,Yes.
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2737.544,2740.21,"No, not under Section 1983."
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.21,2744.781,So the inadequacy in the program does have to be the cause of some injury?
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2744.781,2746.566,By the language of the statute.
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2746.566,2747.232,"Yes, all right."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2747.232,2752.351,"I mean, the statute gives a cause of action if someone causes a constitutional deprivation."
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.351,2770.145,"And so, in this case, certainly one of the issues here, even if you're right on the standard, does the evidence... does the case... was there an injury that demonstrated gross negligence?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2770.145,2770.781,"Well, you know--"
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2770.781,2773.383,Or whatever the standard was that was approved.
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2773.383,2774.866,--The officer who filed the shot--
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.866,2778.501,"Well, see, there is an issue of that in this case."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2778.501,2781.137,"--Well, yes, there's no issue, or no question--"
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2781.137,2781.603,As to causation.
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2781.603,2783.572,--that constitutional deprivation occurred.
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.88,2807.437,"Well, it wasn't a constitutional violation unless there was a... as the Court of Appeals said... a grossly negligent training program, and that training program was responsible for the injury."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2807.437,2816.06,"In other words, as I understand your question, the fact that the constitutional violation occurred does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the city?"
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2816.06,2817.495,"Well, that's right."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2819.212,2824.414,"There was a deprivation of life without due process of law, a summary execution."
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.414,2826.532,"Well, I know, but that is not... well, without due process of law."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2838.507,2840.208,"In the case that is here on appeal, that is true."
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2842.241,2846.195,"Well, don't say then it's clear that there was a constitutional violation here."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2846.195,2847.929,--By the city?
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2847.929,2849.012,Yes.
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2849.012,2850.079,"Well, I think it's clear on the evidence."
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.364,2853.531,"Well, I know you do."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2854.281,2854.897,Yes.
1986.85-1217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2854.897,2860.851,"Yes, but everybody agrees, don't they, that there was a constitutional violation caused by the police officer acting under color of law."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2860.851,2861.434,That's correct.
1986.85-1217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.434,2861.967,"That's not in dispute, is it?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2861.967,2863.584,And I don't think anybody would argue that it was negligent.
1986.85-1217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2864.636,2867.255,The only question is whether the city itself committed a constitutional violation?
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2867.255,2867.421,--Right.
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.457,2873.925,"xxx constitutional violation of the city, necessarily."
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2873.925,2878.563,"--Well, not merely by the fact that the officer committed one."
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2948.887,2953.458,Suppose the police officer is merely negligent.
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2961.778,2965.766,"Under Daniels and Davidson, there'd be no claim against the police officer."
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2965.766,2966.082,All right.
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2977.27,2982.257,And that that training amounted to gross negligence and caused his negligence?
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.257,2982.741,Well--
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,2982.741,2992.447,I think now... I think that's the kind of can of worms that we're opening up if we try to have special rules of culpability for each defendant in a 1983 case.
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2994.332,3000.819,"--How was the... was the officer here negligent, or just... grossly negligent?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,3000.819,3001.588,--He said he meant to do it.
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3009.709,3013.812,That doesn't necessarily mean that he knew he was breaking the law or anything else.
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,3018.43,3021.816,"--Well, he'd also been trained that he was able to do this."
1986.85-1217,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3032.94,3033.174,That's right.
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,3034.892,3035.509,--Right.
1986.85-1217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3035.509,3041.48,"Mr. Nagel, can I ask you one more question about what you would agree is before us?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,3054.972,3057.591,"I'm not sure about that one, to be frank with you."
1986.85-1217,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3087.658,3091.194,"Your short answer, you do not accept that that's necessarily before us?"
1986.85-1217,1,43147,terry_scott_nagel,,3091.194,3093.062,"--Not necessarily, no."
1986.85-1217,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3093.862,3095.264,"Thank you, Mr. Nagel."
1986.85-1217,2,22940,edward_m_pikula,,3097.647,3100.549,Just one point I would like to make.
1986.85-1217,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3120.379,3125.033,"Mr. Pikula, can I ask you a question that goes to the last point just made?"
1986.85-1217,2,22940,edward_m_pikula,,3167.443,3172.18,"No, I don't think we're urging the Court to adopt that broad a rule."
1986.85-1217,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3179.934,3185.655,"So then I don't really know what the question presented means, whether it is a viable theory... I don't like ""viable"" anyway."
1986.85-1217,2,22940,edward_m_pikula,,3191.309,3200.997,"Basically, whether a general allegation that the city just didn't train its officers well enough to prevent this incident is a basis of liability."
1986.85-1217,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3203.033,3207.401,"Thank you, Mr. Pikula."
