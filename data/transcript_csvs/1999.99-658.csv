1999.99-658,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-658, Jaime Castillo v. The United States."
1999.99-658,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,10.289,13.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-658,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,119.657,128.846,"Well, what are the basic elements of the offense, the 5-year thing, Mr. Halbrook?"
1999.99-658,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,128.846,140.202,"--The elements of the offense is that a person carried or used a firearm therein and in relation to a Federal crime of violence... in this case there's also drug-trafficking, and other cases."
1999.99-658,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,145.92,147.253,The crime of violence?
1999.99-658,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,147.253,149.388,"--A crime of violence, yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-658,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.461,206.273,"Well, do you take the position that if a person is charged with a crime of violence or drug-trafficking and with using or carrying a firearm, that that is an indictable offense, and sets out elements of a crime?"
1999.99-658,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,206.273,208.789,"Yes, Your Honor, we do think that, and I... this Court first held--"
1999.99-658,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.789,216.379,Because I would think your position might lead to the conclusion that that doesn't even set out the elements of a complete offense.
1999.99-658,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,216.379,220.164,"--Oh, because it doesn't start by saying it shall be unlawful."
1999.99-658,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.305,237.523,But you do agree that that states out the elements of an offense?
1999.99-658,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,237.523,239.189,"Yes, Your Honor, we do agree with that."
1999.99-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,281.766,288.436,"Mr. Halbrook, are you making both a statutory argument and a constitutional argument with the--"
1999.99-658,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,288.436,291.202,"--Well, we're not arguing the statute's unconstitutional."
1999.99-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,297.19,307.962,"--But you have an alternative argument that if the statute is interpreted as the Government urges, then it would be unconstitutional?"
1999.99-658,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,307.962,345.337,"We don't make that argument, and the reason we don't make that argument... we do appeal to the doctrine of constitutional doubt, but when the decision was first made that these are sentencing factors, it was the universal practice in the Federal courts that they were elements, and then we had several circuit opinions saying that these are offense elements, and we didn't think, and don't think to this day that it would be a service to this Court in a loose way to say that something's unconstitutional when it can so easily be interpreted in the narrow way to avoid the unconstitutional result or according to the rule of lenity--"
1999.99-658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.337,348.973,"And if we don't agree with you on that, you're prepared to lose the case."
1999.99-658,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,348.973,352.508,"--Well, we might not be prepared to lose the case, Your Honor--"
1999.99-658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.508,355.108,"Well, but you don't make a constitutional argument."
1999.99-658,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,368.118,368.951,--That's--
1999.99-658,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.951,373.337,And you will not make the argument that the statute would be unconstitutional.
1999.99-658,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,373.337,375.221,--We haven't made that argument.
1999.99-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,390.197,393.999,"But you know there is a case pending before this Court, Apprendi--"
1999.99-658,0,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,393.999,394.582,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-658,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,394.582,405.04,"--that does make the argument that anything that enhances a sentence beyond the maximum, that that must be given to the jury."
1999.99-658,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,410.659,412.425,"He said it three times, I think."
1999.99-658,1,32577,james_k_robinson,,1673.644,1678.429,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1744.84,1745.256,Mr. Robinson--
1999.99-658,1,32577,james_k_robinson,,1745.256,1745.873,--Yes.
1999.99-658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1745.873,1766.669,"--one of the cases relied on by the majority in Almendarez-Torres was McMillan v. Pennsylvania, which sustains some sentencing factors like this, but it also said in that case that one of the limitations was that the tail couldn't wag the dog."
1999.99-658,1,32577,james_k_robinson,,1775.942,1798.391,"That's quite true, Your Honor, and I think it's important to keep in mind the way in which that evolved as a matter of legislative history, and when the machinegun clause provision was initially inserted into the statute in 1986, the original jump was from 5 to 10, admittedly a substantial one, and then it was later that this graduated scheme was put in place."
1999.99-658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1835.147,1841.551,"Mr. Robinson, what has the practice been in the various circuits under this statute?"
1999.99-658,1,32577,james_k_robinson,,1856.393,1858.376,"It has varied, Justice O'Connor."
1999.99-658,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1870.384,1881.942,Do you have data showing how many sentences will be affected by a conclusion by this Court that the petitioner is correct in his reading?
1999.99-658,1,32577,james_k_robinson,,1881.942,1883.978,--We... I don't have the exact number.
1999.99-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1902.422,1905.993,You think that may be the dog rather than the tail?
1999.99-658,1,32577,james_k_robinson,,1905.993,1907.659,No.
1999.99-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.659,1911.045,--I don't think it still... is even the dog.
1999.99-658,1,32577,james_k_robinson,,1914.147,1915.997,I think that--
1999.99-658,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1915.997,1916.88,It's a long tail.
1999.99-658,2,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,3217.883,3236.963,"If the Court may please, I'd like to return to an earlier question by Justice Breyer about why, if firearm is an offense element, that the other types of firearms are not, or why wouldn't you argue that all of these are sentencing enhancements."
1999.99-658,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3352.569,3352.569,"Thank you, Mr. Halbrook."
1999.99-658,2,41505,stephen_p_halbrook,,3352.569,3352.569,--Thank you.
1999.99-658,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3352.569,3356.569,The case is submitted.
