1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.92,We will hear arguments first this afternoon in Mueller and Noyes against Allen.
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,12.136,16.026,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,63.303,66.348,Are you speaking of the primary schools?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,66.348,68.551,"--Primary and secondary, Mr. Justice."
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,68.551,68.988,Primary and secondary.
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,85.139,97.947,"Mr. Chief Justice, my understanding from this Court's prior rulings in Lemon and Nyquist was that the Court believes that the primary function of a religious school is to inculcate religion through the educational process."
1982.82-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,101.071,114.596,Do you understand the Court to have laid down some abstract kind of rule of law about numerous different kinds of parochial schools or private schools; that you don't need record support any more for a particular factual conclusion?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,114.596,136.572,"--Mr. Justice Rehnquist, my understanding is that the 96 % of the private school students who attend religious schools are schools that identify themselves as religious schools, and as I believe the Court previously found, those schools' primary function then is to teach religion."
1982.82-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,136.572,139.634,You mean found about these particular schools in Minnesota?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,139.634,140.259,No.
1982.82-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,140.259,151.112,"Are you suggesting they are just all homogenized, that if a school is identified as a religious school, as you put it, it is automatically... Its primary function is to inculcate religion?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,151.112,159.156,"Yes, I believe that would be the teaching that I have taken from the Court's decision in Lemon and Nyquist."
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,202.593,207.856,Are they all private schools or just church-sponsored schools?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,207.856,224.49,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I refer to parochial schools as a result of the fact that it is such a high percentage, that is to say the 96 %, that the remaining 4 %, which would be deemed to be non-sectarian, would pay out until insignificance."
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,226.974,230.455,What about a private school that has no church sponsorship?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,230.455,235.75,--They would receive the same benefits as those that have church sponsorship.
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,235.75,244.169,"Mr. Kampf, how much of these two deductible amounts have been increased since 1956?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,244.169,247.684,The original was $200.
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,259.35,261.256,Those bills have not carried?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,261.256,266.973,"They have only carried one House at a time up to this date, Mr. Justice Powell."
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,348.347,355.859,Would you challenge the deductions of... the deductibility of contributions to such schools?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,355.859,359.826,"No, that is not at issue in this case, Mr. Justice."
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,359.826,365.09,"Well, I just asked you, would you think they would be questionable under your thesis?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,365.09,365.856,Not--
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,365.856,370.978,"Are these deductions subsidies, deductions of contributions?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,379.865,393.188,"--As I would indicate later in my argument, Mr. Justice, the deduction of a contribution which comes out of volunteerism is vastly different than a deduction of a fee for a service."
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,393.188,393.641,No.
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,394.703,406.09,"I don't believe that this case in any way affects that and I don't believe that deductibility of the contribution to the school would be in question, no, Your Honor."
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.09,410.009,"And, your submission wouldn't put those in question?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,410.009,410.4,No.
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,416.991,419.849,Do you think there is a constitutional difference between the two?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,419.849,421.287,--A vast difference.
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,447.245,457.224,"I suppose you could run the argument either way, that this deduction would be even more clearly constitutional than just a contribution to support religion."
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,457.224,459.49,--The difference--
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.49,467.284,This deduction has to do with supporting an educational performance as well.
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,474.718,496.819,--The distinction between a deduction for a fee for service and the deduction for a voluntary giving is in the quid pro quo; that is to say the donor receives back the religiously-oriented educational services which would not be present in the voluntary contribution.
1982.82-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,596.231,613.146,"Mr. Kampf, suppose the state, instead of allowing the tax deduction, had simply given... decided not to run public schools at all and just gave a voucher to the parents and let them send their children to whatever school they wanted."
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,614.318,616.426,That case is not before the Court and--
1982.82-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,616.426,617.286,I know that.
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,619.549,626.484,"--I believe that presents some very substantial, different and more sophisticated problems than this case."
1982.82-195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,643.993,648.367,"Well, would you concede that a voucher system would be constitutional?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,648.367,652.021,"No, I would not."
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,787.715,792.355,"Well, this subsidy, you say, is a deduction?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,792.355,793.432,That is correct.
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.571,805.927,You just told me you wouldn't question an ordinary deduction for a contribution to a religiously-oriented school.
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,814.674,825.201,"Well, as I indicated, to not tax under those circumstances is the same as to not tax any other idiohomogenary contribution."
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.201,826.169,Exactly.
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,826.731,832.698,"But, here, there is an exchange in effect then."
1982.82-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,838.76,849.239,"Well, arguably, the state is getting something for its grant here in a way that it isn't when it just lets you deduct and it doesn't get anything in return."
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,849.239,856.049,"Well, the answer to that is that the public schools in Minnesota, I believe, are open to all people."
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,862.266,868.592,You are not suggesting though if everybody who was going to private school went to public schools it wouldn't cost the public some money?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,868.592,870.324,"Well, I think the question--"
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.324,870.84,Would you?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,870.84,871.949,"--No, of course not."
1982.82-195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,871.949,872.589,All right.
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,874.51,883.194,That is an indirect benefit which I think the First Amendment requires the public to bear by having free public schools.
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1029.089,1042.145,"Does the record in this case, Mr. Kampf, show what is the actual cost per capita to education children in the private schools or in the parochial, church-sponsored schools?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1042.145,1051.892,"The only thing we have in the record would be the national averages of $500 to $700 in tuition, not the actual cost, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1055.406,1057.327,It must be a great deal more than $500 or $700.
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1057.327,1061.138,"--I would assume so or they wouldn't be receiving much of an education, I imagine."
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1061.138,1075.897,That figure should not be difficult to ascertain and could have been put in the record by taking the total cost of the primary and secondary schools and dividing it by the number of pupils.
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1075.897,1080.24,"Unfortunately with regard to private schools, I don't believe that information--"
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1080.24,1081.816,I am just talking about the public schools.
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1081.816,1082.004,--Oh !
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1096.437,1103.589,So that the $500 or $700 doesn't cover the entire cost?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1103.589,1104.433,No.
1982.82-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1209.204,1214.671,"Well, maybe the legislature feels that private schools are doing a better job than the public schools."
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1214.671,1216.982,--That is quite possible.
1982.82-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1216.982,1220.434,"That is certainly a logical inference from the fact you just stated, isn't it?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1220.434,1226.229,"I assume it is quite possible, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I am not sure that the First Amendment would permit that."
1982.82-195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1226.229,1231.712,It wouldn't permit the State of Minnesota to feel that private schools were doing a better job than public schools?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1231.712,1235.132,"To fund them is what I am discussing, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1235.132,1239.365,"Mr. Kampf, you suggested the financial crisis in Minnesota."
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1247.283,1250.797,I don't think there is anything in the record of this case or any other case--
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1250.797,1252.0,What does your common sense tell you?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1252.0,1261.919,"--That... Obviously, if all the parochial and private schools of the State of Minnesota or of any other state closed, it would cause great economic hardship on the state."
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1261.919,1267.308,"But, you were talking about a financial crisis contributed to these deductions."
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1267.308,1268.149,I don't think--
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1268.149,1271.117,"It cost the state $2,400,000 did you say?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1273.398,1275.912,--That was in 1978.
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1286.721,1288.283,Is that in loss of taxes to the state?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1288.283,1288.627,Yes.
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1288.627,1290.845,What is the two million four?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1290.845,1293.468,That was the loss of taxes in 1978.
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1293.468,1296.796,And they increased to $17 million?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1296.796,1298.919,For biennium.
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1302.574,1307.214,What is the total budget for public education in Minnesota?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1307.214,1310.197,"I am not sure of that, Mr. Justice Powell."
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1312.729,1319.538,"Did you say the pupil cost... What did you say, $1200, $1400?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1319.538,1320.866,In excess of $1400.
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1320.866,1322.147,In excess of $1400.
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1334.0,1335.547,I don't have those figures.
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1345.074,1348.823,What do you mean by substantially?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1348.823,1366.361,"Well, the numbers in sectarian schools appear to have remained stable, slightly risen, from 85,000 to 91,000, while the number of students attending public schools between 1978 and the present have reduced from... I think it was 815,000 to 730,000."
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1366.361,1371.22,"Do you know what the figures were, do you have an estimate in 1956?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1371.22,1375.483,"No, I do not have any knowledge of what was true in 1956."
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1375.483,1379.482,"The annual reports of the State Board of Education would show, wouldn't they?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1379.482,1380.794,"Yes, I am sure that they would."
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1380.794,1390.493,Do you agree that the state has a substantial interest in the preservation of non-public schools to afford a choice?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1390.493,1399.802,I believe that the state has an important interest in not being hostile to the continued existence of private and parochial schools.
1982.82-195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1399.802,1401.318,Is that what Nyquist said?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1401.318,1408.644,I believe that is what the Court held in Nyquist; that there should not be any hostility to the continued existence of those schools.
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1444.708,1448.488,"I think you... Are you finished, Justice Powell?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1461.265,1469.043,"Well, it is a direct aid in the sense of it being a discount or rebate on the cost of religious school education."
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1469.043,1487.348,"Well, now, in Walz the Court held that contributions to churches were constitutional, the allowance for a deduction was."
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1490.127,1496.657,"Well, as I understood Walz, it was an exemption from property tax of the church buildings itself."
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1523.286,1526.972,"It surely is a very direct aid to a church, is it not?"
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1526.972,1532.47,"--Well, again, the distinction lies in the giver."
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1544.153,1550.666,Do you suggest that the churches give nothing to their parishioners?
1982.82-195,0,45249,william_i_kampf,,1550.666,1560.833,"Well, I don't know that it is something that the courts of the United States have ever measured nor one that one could place in a quid pro quo; that is to say an exchange."
1982.82-195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1587.681,1596.022,Mr. Blomgren?
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,1596.022,1598.926,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.82-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.496,1666.697,"Mr. Blomgren, to that extent, all of the taxpayers of the state share, do they not?"
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,1666.697,1667.994,--Certainly they do.
1982.82-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1788.086,1791.74,Then you are not asking that Nyquist be overruled?
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,1791.74,1792.646,"We are not, Your Honor."
1982.82-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1797.222,1801.439,I would like to have you explain the differences between this case and Nyquist.
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,1801.439,1801.955,Okay.
1982.82-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1819.979,1823.962,One can certainly say that that was true here at least indirectly.
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,1823.962,1830.631,"--Your Honor, if it can be said that it is true, it is going to have to be extremely indirectly, because what the legislation--"
1982.82-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1830.631,1831.88,"Explain that, then."
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,1831.88,1832.333,--Okay.
1982.82-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1869.834,1876.831,So that the rich man's son who goes to St. Paul's Academy in your city gets the same benefit on his parents' return?
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,1876.831,1889.107,"--Your Honor, as with any deduction, there is going to be a disparate effect with regard to the amount of money one actually pays and their particular income."
1982.82-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1942.257,1947.567,"While I have you interrupted, let me ask you something about your textbook deduction."
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,1952.004,1953.721,--As a matter of fact that is true.
1982.82-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1959.158,1970.013,"Well, then, your Minnesota deduction really gives the parent on the textbook end something that he wouldn't have had under Allen?"
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,1970.013,1972.152,--Okay.
1982.82-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1989.052,1997.048,"But, what bothers me with the argument on both sides is it seems to me you are arguing statistics and I think we really ought to be arguing basic principles."
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,1997.048,2003.061,"I agree, Your Honor, that we ought not be arguing statistics beyond a particular point."
1982.82-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2036.564,2039.688,Now may I get back to my question about--
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2039.688,2040.577,"About Nyquist, yes."
1982.82-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2040.577,2041.827,"--No, about Allen."
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2041.827,2043.186,"Oh, I am sorry."
1982.82-195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2043.186,2049.107,--and the additional items which your statute gives that you don't already have under Allen.
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2055.806,2064.833,"Your Honor, there is included within the ambit of deduction of materials beyond textbooks."
1982.82-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2197.983,2213.728,"I am puzzled about that because isn't the whole purpose of the statute to provide support for the private sector and keep the other school system alive and to the extent that money is funneled into the people that go to public schools, it really is kind of incidental, isn't it?"
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2217.367,2230.782,"Your Honor, the major purpose of the statute is to assure... There are several purposes of the statute, but one of them is to assure that there is an availability of choice that individuals can make as to whether to attend or not."
1982.82-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2397.39,2400.092,Does the record tell how large the deduction was that they took?
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2400.092,2401.529,"No, it does not."
1982.82-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.529,2403.794,It may be $5.00 for each or something like that.
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2403.794,2403.857,Yes.
1982.82-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2413.009,2420.226,"Well, is it likely that a parent of a public school child would have $500 of non-tuition expenses that would be deductible?"
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2420.226,2424.037,"--Your Honor, it is possible that those attending public schools may."
1982.82-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2427.162,2429.66,"It may be possible, but you are talking about 100,000 people in your example."
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2429.66,2430.207,--That is right.
1982.82-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2430.207,2432.581,"Do you think 100,000 of them had a $500 deduction?"
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2434.377,2440.142,"It is very unlikely that 100,000 of them have a full $500 deduction."
1982.82-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2516.016,2531.948,"But, there is no escape, is there, from the fact that every tax deduction, however it is described, whatever its form may be, in effect spreads the burden of that tax deduction over all the taxpayers?"
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2531.948,2534.04,That is true.
1982.82-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2534.04,2535.587,"That was true in Walz, was it not?"
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2535.587,2537.507,"Yes, that is absolutely true in Walz."
1982.82-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2537.507,2550.877,There are atheists and agnostics and persons of a whole range of non-belief were contributing to a part of the church who received the exemption.
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2550.877,2555.329,"Your Honor, I don't believe that they are contributing to the support of the church."
1982.82-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2561.623,2567.558,"They are making up for the fact that the church property was not taxed, were they not?"
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2569.495,2578.912,--Walz recognized the fact that to the extent that some institutions are relieved of the tax burden others will be called upon to pay more.
1982.82-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2578.912,2579.162,To pay more.
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2579.162,2601.778,"But, what is involved at the heart of the Establishment Clause is whether or not the legislature or state government has decided to enter into a sponsorship relationship with the church, advancing its cause by either directing money to an obviously sectarian purpose or singling it out for some particular special kind of benefit."
1982.82-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2860.55,2864.157,Why didn't you put it in the record?
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2864.157,2866.046,The record--
1982.82-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2866.046,2868.123,Didn't you realize it was going to come up?
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2868.123,2884.961,"--Your Honor, the record consists primarily of information which was supplied by the Department of Education and the Department of Revenue in response to certain requests and by the hard work of--"
1982.82-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2884.961,2891.864,Don't you have the whole resources of the State of Minnesota to get information and facts?
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2891.864,2897.94,"--Your Honor, we have facts concerning that portion of the population in the test year which is 1978."
1982.82-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2901.861,2906.514,What is there in the record that will help Justice Powell out?
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2906.514,2908.107,In the record--
1982.82-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2908.107,2909.575,In the record.
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2909.575,2910.185,--Okay.
1982.82-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2910.185,2912.466,Zero.
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2912.466,2915.495,"Your Honor, the record--"
1982.82-195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2915.495,2918.385,"You have one figure in there, zero."
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2918.385,2934.878,"--The record that is contained in there, and it is the record that was submitted by the plaintiffs in this case, suggests the percentage of those attending non-sectarian schools, percentage of... amount of revenue loss, things of that type."
1982.82-195,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2934.878,2939.126,Would the reports of the State Board of Education provide this information?
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,2939.126,2948.451,The reports of the State Board of Education would show you the general population trends of those attending non-public schools as opposed to those attending public schools.
1982.82-195,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3235.164,3239.599,This is the operating budget and does not include capital expenditures?
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,3239.599,3246.05,"Your Honor, there again, I am afraid that I can't tell you precisely how that breaks down."
1982.82-195,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3250.657,3254.546,Do the counties in Minnesota also contribute to public education?
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,3254.546,3258.201,--There are property taxes paid--
1982.82-195,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3258.201,3258.685,Yes.
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,3258.685,3264.37,"--to districts, school districts, and state aids."
1982.82-195,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3264.37,3267.072,State general revenue funds?
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,3267.072,3267.681,That is correct.
1982.82-195,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3268.211,3268.961,You also have federal funds?
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,3268.961,3269.571,--That is correct.
1982.82-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3401.611,3409.858,"Isn't that argument undercut, the deduction for tuition benefits, for tuition payments, because they are not available across the board."
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,3412.374,3419.291,There are about four types of tuition that are actually paid by those people in public schools.
1982.82-195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3424.259,3431.365,"Surely it is not the state policy to encourage non-residents to attend schools other than in their own district, is there?"
1982.82-195,1,20539,douglas_c_blomgren,,3431.365,3433.911,--It is certainly the policy to make it available to them if they want.
1982.82-195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3467.74,3499.072,"Mr. Kampf, on these statistics that have been discussed, suppose a case was before the Court with a record that showed that 60 % of all the people in the state under a statute like this were in private schools, some of which were non-denominational, non-church sponsored, and some church sponsored."
1982.82-195,2,45249,william_i_kampf,,3502.102,3511.038,"Well, at that point, one would have to determine whether the primary effect of the statute was, indeed, to aid the religious schools."
1982.82-195,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3520.328,3522.702,"Well, what about my hypothetical?"
1982.82-195,2,45249,william_i_kampf,,3526.076,3536.026,"As I recall, the same question was asked in the Nyquist argument and I think the answer is less than comforting since I am not sure that that hypothetical exists."
1982.82-195,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3605.919,3621.679,"Mr. Kampf, under the Lemon test, as I recall, the question is whether or not there is a primary effect that benefits or furthers an establishment of religion."
1982.82-195,2,45249,william_i_kampf,,3640.406,3647.106,"If by that, Mr. Justice Powell, you are asking for an exact analytical, statistical study, obviously that is not available."
1982.82-195,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3647.106,3653.885,Does the record back you up in your claim that there was a primary effect?
1982.82-195,2,45249,william_i_kampf,,3653.885,3656.102,"Well, the answer--"
1982.82-195,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3656.102,3659.132,A primary effect of furthering an establishment of religion?
1982.82-195,2,45249,william_i_kampf,,3659.132,3660.616,--I believe--
1982.82-195,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3660.616,3661.491,Which one?
1982.82-195,2,45249,william_i_kampf,,3661.491,3669.473,--The fact that there has been an increase in students at religious schools while there has been a decrease in students at public schools can lead one to that conclusion.
1982.82-195,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3669.473,3674.658,"But, counsel... Your friend on the other side says that there has been a decrease since '56."
1982.82-195,2,45249,william_i_kampf,,3674.658,3691.65,"But, that was before the large increase in this statute which resulted after this Court's decision in Nyquist and the subsequent decision in the Minnesota Supreme Court struck down a Nyquist kind of statute in Minnesota."
1982.82-195,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3693.838,3699.835,"So, your answer is that the increased number of pupils in the sectarian schools?"
1982.82-195,2,45249,william_i_kampf,,3699.835,3702.397,I think that is the only evidence we have in the record before us.
1982.82-195,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3702.397,3716.032,Do you think that is a greater benefit to the religious entities than the state has experienced financially and in providing some sort of option to parents who wish to have an option?
1982.82-195,2,45249,william_i_kampf,,3716.032,3719.718,That question is an academic one.
1982.82-195,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3721.264,3722.841,Why is it academic in this case?
1982.82-195,2,45249,william_i_kampf,,3722.841,3729.51,--Because we cannot determine what the Minnesota legislature would do if there was a substantial reduction.
1982.82-195,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3769.353,3770.666,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
