2010.09-5801,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.539,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-5801, Flores-Villar v. United States."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,10.656,13.408,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-5801,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,61.488,65.773,What separates a stereotype from a reality?
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,80.266,82.735,--What I was saying--
2010.09-5801,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,82.735,83.818,That's not true?
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,83.818,91.074,"--I think it is more likely, but I think that empirical evidence has not carried the day in gender discrimination cases."
2010.09-5801,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,91.074,97.145,"In all cases, it is true in general, but there are people who don't fit the mold."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,110.202,114.439,"Absolutely, and this is actually beyond just an empirical stereotype."
2010.09-5801,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,138.222,154.664,"Wasn't that said in relation to the principle that only -- that where paternity was not established, the child would be regarded as having the citizenship of the mother under the law of virtually every country, if not every country, at that time?"
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,154.664,161.385,"--Well, the law of many countries was that citizenship did go through the mother."
2010.09-5801,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,201.728,203.997,"Until there is legitimation, it goes through the mother."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,207.949,209.515,--I respectfully disagree.
2010.09-5801,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,287.363,305.677,"Mr. Hubachek, how do you deal with the argument that, really, this is a classification where the unmarried woman is being favored, because the unmarried father is being bracketed with the married couple?"
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,323.638,332.058,"This is not a case where Congress was seeking to remedy any sort of past discrimination against women, as was the case, say, in Schlesinger v. Ballard."
2010.09-5801,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,351.139,364.881,"But that doesn't answer, I don't think, Justice Ginsberg's question, which is: This appears to be an exception to a generalized non-gender based requirement."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,389.081,396.0,"The reason is, Justice Sotomayor, is that we are not talking about an exception here, the treatment that the non-marital mothers were getting."
2010.09-5801,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,423.235,428.203,So doesn't the 5-year residency requirement address that?
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,439.077,439.927,"--Absolutely, it would."
2010.09-5801,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,532.937,544.911,Is -- is this your -- are you taking this in the direction of an argument that Congress gets less deference in determining nationality than it does with admission to aliens?
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,544.911,554.617,"--What I'm saying, Your Honor, is that we are talking about the ability of a United States citizen, Petitioner's father, to transmit citizenship, and that that is a traditional interest."
2010.09-5801,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,567.341,581.267,But you -- you want us to write an opinion that says Congress has less deference when it considering -- when it determines who should be a national of this country than it -- than when it determines who should be admitted as an alien?
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,581.267,585.386,"--Well, there is no tradition dating back to 1350 for the admission of aliens."
2010.09-5801,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,586.404,591.642,Are you asking us to write that formulation in an opinion?
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,591.642,600.312,"--Your Honor, what I'm saying is that the -- that the due process guarantee of equal protection is applicable in this context because the citizens of the United States--"
2010.09-5801,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,600.312,605.883,"If I -- if I take that as a ""yes"" answer, what is your authority for that answer?"
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,608.435,612.722,"--Well, Your Honor, my authority for that answer is the tradition that I have been discussing."
2010.09-5801,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,625.363,627.981,"Of course, but it was Congress that made the distinction."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,635.735,638.001,"--Well, I think -- that's -- that's a--"
2010.09-5801,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,638.001,640.12,Maybe there is some authority for that.
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,642.739,649.309,--Chadha Zadvydas says that even though Congress has plenary power over the immigration power.
2010.09-5801,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,655.38,658.248,That was an alien admissions case.
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,660.266,664.902,--I'm talking about citizenship being transmitted by a United States citizen.
2010.09-5801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,678.328,678.744,Well -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,680.228,681.28,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-5801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,681.28,683.48,I didn't quite follow this.
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,757.226,760.43,"There are a couple of reasons at least for that, Your Honor."
2010.09-5801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,772.488,781.343,"Some people were lucky, and they are already citizens under this, and there we are, because their mother lived in the United States for one year."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,829.974,834.644,"--Well, the first thing is, is that this statute contains a severability clause."
2010.09-5801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,836.061,836.594,Fine.
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,854.756,855.975,"--By -- by extension, Your Honor."
2010.09-5801,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,856.592,859.71,"First, can we be clear about what you're saying?"
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,863.496,864.312,--That's correct.
2010.09-5801,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,864.312,872.701,So that you are talking about equating the unmarried father to the unmarried mother.
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,917.146,920.764,"Justice Ginsberg, I don't have any statistics to provide the Court."
2010.09-5801,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,920.764,924.3,Maybe this is -- maybe you would like to answer Justice Breyer's question.
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,924.3,926.835,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-5801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,948.617,951.652,"Now, there's another slight problem with that, I would think."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,991.36,993.812,"--I don't know the answer to that, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-5801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,993.812,1001.982,"I will ask the (g) that, but if it is true -- if it is true, then -- then I would think that the fathers are really worse off."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1010.988,1023.497,"Traditionally in immigration law when you have continuous requirements, if it's a short trip, casual trip, you know, then those -- that requirement is not considered to have been violated."
2010.09-5801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1030.401,1034.703,The question is: I'm looking for a way -- I'm trying to be helpful in my question.
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1048.447,1059.088,"Well, the -- the best way is to follow the Court's tradition in the benefits cases such as Wengler and Wiesenfeld, where the Court granted an extension remedy and basically treated--"
2010.09-5801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1059.088,1059.671,That would help you.
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1061.521,1071.312,"--Well, the reason for doing that is, is that the language that's contained in the severability clause is similar to what the Court has already said allows an extension remedy."
2010.09-5801,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1081.501,1082.37,"No, he would have a remedy."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1099.546,1102.348,"--You are absolutely right, that that is -- that is the state of the law."
2010.09-5801,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1188.537,1204.832,"Mr. Hubachek, I think the Chief asked you: If it's an equal protection violation, then the Court just says it violates equal protection, but whether it goes up or down, the Court has to give a temporary solution, because the legislature can't be convened on the spot."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1245.309,1246.709,Absolutely.
2010.09-5801,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.298,1264.271,"Mr. Hubacheck, you are asking, I think, that the Court pronounce your client to be a United States citizen."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1270.524,1272.559,"--Well, Justice Scalia--"
2010.09-5801,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.559,1274.328,Unless he's a United States citizen.
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1274.328,1281.482,"--This is a criminal case, so technically what we are asking is for a reversal of the judgment and opportunity to present this--"
2010.09-5801,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1281.482,1288.136,"A reversal of the judgment on the grounds that your client is a United States citizen, right?"
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1288.136,1291.957,"--That it would be possible for him, on these facts, to become a United States citizen, yes."
2010.09-5801,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1291.957,1294.573,That he is a United States citizen.
2010.09-5801,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.573,1296.823,"That he is, not that -- that he is."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1307.631,1315.486,"Well, that was one of the issues that was debated, of course, in the Nguyen and Miller cases, and the Court has not said that yet but it can in this case."
2010.09-5801,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.486,1316.252,Never done.
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1316.252,1317.102,That's correct.
2010.09-5801,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.967,1379.56,"Unless -- unless we -- we solve the violation the other way, by saying that the father gets the shorter period that the -- than the mother has."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1379.56,1380.593,"--Well, again--"
2010.09-5801,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1380.593,1383.797,"I'm sorry, that the mother gets the longer period than the father has."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1383.797,1384.264,--Right.
2010.09-5801,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.081,1387.166,You say we can't apply that retroactively.
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1397.439,1401.824,"--Even -- even prospectively, Your Honor, because this statute says you have citizenship as of birth."
2010.09-5801,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1415.484,1426.505,But any of -- of the remedies that you are discussing with Justice Scalia involves this Court in a highly intrusive exercise of the congressional power.
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1454.923,1455.774,--I don't think so.
2010.09-5801,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1466.78,1472.117,"And it also said that the remedy can't be complicated, because courts are not set up to do that."
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1490.095,1492.031,"--That's correct, and certainly Congress could do that."
2010.09-5801,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1531.572,1537.143,"But Congress did make at least some change, right?"
2010.09-5801,0,41521,steven_f_hubachek,,1542.463,1549.45,"The current system is five years, two years after the -- the age of 16 -- I'm sorry, after the age of 14."
2010.09-5801,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1567.329,1568.162,"Thank you, Counsel."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1573.733,1576.118,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-5801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1616.762,1624.849,Intermediate scrutiny and -- is not without some deference.
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1624.849,1625.7,--Excuse me.
2010.09-5801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1625.7,1638.608,"Unless we apply strict scrutiny, which no one is arguing for, the question is, is it rational basis deference or is it some intermediate scrutiny, correct?"
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1638.608,1639.075,Yes.
2010.09-5801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1649.816,1682.22,"Well, but you can't really mean that because we can put up a hypothetical that is very simple and then you'll explain to me why a U.S. citizen should be burdened in this way and the hypothetical is, let's assume Congress determines that there are too many foreign-born children of U.S. citizens coming into the United States, and that those foreign-born children, those born of women are placing a greater burden on our economic system."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1706.152,1722.947,"--I think the answer to that question lies in the Court's formulation of the test that is applied in this particular context, and that is the formulation drawn from Kleindienst v. Mandel that was articulated in Fiallo v. Bell, and that is that there has to be a facially legitimate and bona fide reason."
2010.09-5801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1722.947,1725.78,There is a facially legitimate bona fide reason.
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1725.78,1732.303,I think the Court could have no trouble concluding that an arbitrary choice between men and women--
2010.09-5801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1732.303,1744.943,"What's arbitrary about a government saying, I want to spend less money on a new citizen?"
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1744.943,1771.611,"--The -- the ultimate reason may be legitimate, but I think the facial legitimate test also encompasses means not just end, and if Congress is just arbitrarily choosing between men and women or people of a different race, I think given this Court's tradition it could conclude that those would be impermissible bases under the well-established test, but for the reasons we say in our brief we don't--"
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1771.611,1773.213,What well established test?
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1773.213,1780.2,--Fiallo v. Bell for -- and the cases underlying it and we also think--
2010.09-5801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1780.2,1782.985,Is that the rational basis plus test you are talking about?
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1782.985,1786.621,--You could call it that or you could call it a facially legitimate--
2010.09-5801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1786.621,1799.161,So now we're going to just continue sort of tweaking the definitions and creating more variations on our review standard?
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1799.161,1815.373,"--I think it is -- it is a test that this Court has articulated in Fiallo v. Bell and Kleindienst v. Mandel to address this very situation, including a situation where asserted constitutional rights of U.S. citizens in this country are being claimed."
2010.09-5801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1825.662,1839.405,"It's hard here because both the father -- this father, but many fathers and mothers are actually U.S. citizens who want to bring their children over as U.S. citizens."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1851.629,1875.579,"We would argue for the facially legitimate -- and that was the case in Fiallo, in which the plaintiffs included U.S. citizens, children and fathers, claiming that, in a very parallel situation claiming that that special privileges for illegitimate children to reunite with the mother worked an unconstitutional discrimination against the fathers of such children."
2010.09-5801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1900.479,1909.668,"I understand that, but what you are doing is applying a lesser standard to gender discrimination than is ordinarily applied to gender discrimination."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1914.204,1915.655,"Well, that was the issue."
2010.09-5801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.655,1916.221,All right.
2010.09-5801,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.721,1917.521,In Fiallo v. Bell.
2010.09-5801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1917.521,1923.392,"If it's the government's position you do, does the same thing apply to racial discrimination?"
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1926.796,1932.8,I think the facially legitimate standard in Fiallo v. Bell would render a reliance on race.
2010.09-5801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.8,1936.568,This is suddenly is cutting a big hole in the Fourteenth Amendment.
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1936.568,1941.822,"No, I don't think so because I think that same principle would be given effect in the way--"
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1941.822,1955.214,"First, in Fiallo we were dealing not with citizens, this is someone, a resident -- could be a resident alien wanting to bring in a parent or a child."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1960.683,1971.075,"--It wasn't, but in the eyes of the Constitution, anyone born abroad is an alien unless and until Congress has passed a statute making them a citizen."
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1973.908,1986.835,"Congress has passed -- has passed a statute making certain people citizens and the question is, has it done so in a way that is compatible with equal protection."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2001.26,2011.05,But there were claims based on both illegitimacy and gender and there were equal protection claims based on both.
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2200.454,2228.473,"Mr. Kneedler, if -- if the classification then were that we want to encourage, because it's good for society, father/child relationships, so we are going to give that advantage, that is 1 year for fathers, and we're going to put the mothers together with the married couples, would that be compatible with equal protection?"
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2228.473,2235.127,"Well, I think that would be -- that would depend upon a -- a -- a different rationale."
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2236.677,2237.912,I told you what the rationale was.
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2278.739,2290.463,"--I think that would be a more difficult question, because Congress would be -- would be responding based on the -- on the expected behaviors and talents maybe of men and women."
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2295.597,2303.185,"--Well, it would you, in fact, acting on the basis of what hasn't been the general pattern but what is becoming the new pattern."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2303.185,2303.668,--Right.
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2314.309,2326.533,"So there is, even though we are still dealing with citizenship, you recognize that there are categorizations that would run afoul of equal protection?"
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2326.533,2331.084,"--Well, that -- and -- and the question would be whether that's a facially legitimate rationale."
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2341.206,2349.629,"The same as in the Family Medical Leave Act, we are making it a parental leave instead as if it had been historically a maternity."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2349.629,2350.196,--Right.
2010.09-5801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2450.511,2472.657,"You have -- we have the briefs that are filled with, you know, pros and cons about the statelessness business and whether it was real, and I've read those and I would like your comment on those, but I want to comment, too, on this very -- what may be a very minor thing, but I did notice, prodded by an article, I have to say, that -- that for the women there is a sense in which its tougher--"
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2472.657,2473.109,--Yes.
2010.09-5801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.109,2475.476,--and that's because of the continuous period.

2010.09-5801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2546.053,2546.455,All right.

2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2586.044,2607.225,"Congress -- Congress selected, because while I said the mothers are like the two-citizen family or two-citizen parents in the sense that only U.S. citizens are the parent and you have some connection, Congress was balancing the duration of that connection or taking into account the duration of that connection and it chose to make it a little bit tougher."
2010.09-5801,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2646.202,2661.128,"Counsel, what if -- if the Court were to determine that this does violate the Equal Protection Clause, and the court were also to determine that this is not a case that should be the first one in history in which it grants naturalization, what do you think the Court ought to do?"
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2661.128,2671.917,I -- I think the Court ought to strike the eligibility of -- of anyone to get citizenship on the basis of 1 year.
2010.09-5801,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2678.673,2681.625,On the ground that it violates equal protection.
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2681.625,2683.475,--And it is a solution -- it's a remedy--
2010.09-5801,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2683.475,2693.433,What about your friend's point that that retroactively deprives people of citizenship that we would be saying they should have gotten if the Equal Protection Clause had been enforced.
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2693.433,2700.687,--I -- I -- I think this Court could legitimately take into account the -- the conferral of citizenship and the reliance on that.
2010.09-5801,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2710.442,2710.992,Right.
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2734.76,2736.426,--I think -- I think.
2010.09-5801,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2736.426,2738.295,Does he get the benefit of that or not?

2010.09-5801,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2762.177,2767.231,But why -- why would we grant that remedy when it doesn't do this Petitioner any good whatever.
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2770.433,2772.649,"Well, I suppose -- I suppose--"

2010.09-5801,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2784.105,2788.075,The reason it doesn't grant that relief is somewhat unusual in this case.
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2816.326,2816.792,Right.
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2823.932,2842.293,"Mr. Kneedler, in answering the question that way, I know you are familiar with the Wiesenfeld, case, and the question was, this was a father who was denied benefits to take care of a -- a child whose mother died at childbirth."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2890.024,2896.594,"--Well, here the only claim that has been raised is an equal protection violation of the parent's asserted rights."
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2896.594,2912.27,"Well, that's what -- Steven Wiesenfeld, the father was the plaintiff, but the Court -- at least one justice's rationale was that the discrimination is really against the child, but the father can raise him--"
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2912.27,2930.149,"Well, insofar as any claim of discrimination by the child, I think, since it's not based on the child's gender, I think that would clearly be a rational basis or facially legitimate standard; and Justice O'Connor's opinion in Miller v. Albright addressed the rational basis there."
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2976.63,2980.082,--That's a case where mother versus father.

2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3021.409,3049.511,"--Well, again, I think this is the issue the Court addressed in Nguyen, in which the Court -- the Court said that there is -- there is a difference at the moment of birth in the potential and therefore the likelihood of a -- of a connection of child to parent at the moment of birth that justified the requirement that -- that the father take a step to legitimate the child, in order to be able to -- to be on an equal footing with the mother with respect to -- to the rights."
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3090.469,3095.79,"In Nguyen, I thought that this Court relied on the biological factor, which is not so here."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3101.361,3106.348,"Well, yes, but in Nguyen the Court did not look at the circumstances of the particular case."
2010.09-5801,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3160.915,3179.111,"Counsel, if we determine that the only remedy we can impose is to equalize up -- in other words, add to the burden on the mother rather than relieving the father of it, do you have authority for the proposition that we can address that issue hypothetically?"
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3184.681,3185.633,Um--
2010.09-5801,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3185.633,3196.239,"In other words, look ahead and if you say, look, the only remedy that we are going to be able to give this person is a remedy that isn't going to benefit him regardless of how the merits are decided, therefore we don't reach the merits."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3196.239,3199.774,--I don't have -- I don't have authority from -- from a decision of this Court.
2010.09-5801,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3211.432,3216.836,"Well, that would be in effect saying that we have no jurisdiction, because there is no standing."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3221.64,3224.175,I -- I suppose that would be one way of looking at it.
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3236.732,3248.473,"Mr. Kneedler, in answer to the Chief's question, you know -- I mean, there have been a number of cases raising this extension versus nullification, and in every one of them the Court did make a choice."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3255.861,3256.479,--Yes.
2010.09-5801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3256.479,3258.413,--the Court did make a choice then.
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3268.371,3270.654,"No, I think that is ordinarily the case."
2010.09-5801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3308.662,3320.403,"Is there -- is there anything that rings a bell in this in your mind, of -- I mean, the thing that goes the other way is the right of an American citizen to pass his American citizenship on to his children."
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3341.919,3342.969,There is no such right.
2010.09-5801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3344.621,3345.204,I'm not saying there is such a right.
2010.09-5801,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3350.525,3357.761,"--Well, the Court's decision in -- in -- the dissenters in -- in Nguyen discussed this."
2010.09-5801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3370.152,3370.786,All right.
