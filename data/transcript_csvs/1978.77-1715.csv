1978.77-1715,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,58.838,"We'll hear arguments next in 1715, Secretary of Public Welfare of Pennsylvania."
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,65.539,68.264,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,274.161,278.496,"You say or tribunal, what's the alternative court?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,278.496,280.793,"Initially, this case has been here before."
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.67,316.425,Did the Pennsylvania legislature created such a tribunal?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,316.425,319.203,"Not at this time, Your Honor."
1978.77-1715,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,345.605,350.389,"Now, what's the source of these supplemental standards?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,350.389,351.078,The source --
1978.77-1715,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,351.078,353.084,Where did they come from?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,353.084,355.958,The lower court modified the original word that was here.
1978.77-1715,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,355.958,357.269,After the remand?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,357.269,358.168,After the remand.
1978.77-1715,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,370.078,376.036,"Where's the source of trained advocate, if not the bar?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,376.036,378.581,"As far I'm concerned, it would have to be the bar."
1978.77-1715,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,378.581,381.575,But did the District Court --
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,381.575,384.011,"There was no elucidation on that point, presumably --"
1978.77-1715,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,384.011,388.915,"Presuming the District Court, the source is the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States."
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,388.915,389.724,Oh!
1978.77-1715,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,392.622,394.598,"Frankly, it couldn't be anywhere else."
1978.77-1715,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,394.598,397.772,I didn't ask my question clearly enough by source.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,401.419,406.233,"Not exist presently, Mr. Justice Brennan other than the bar."
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,452.743,459.15,"Well, that doesn't really have anything to do with whether or not there's a deprivation of liberty, does it?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,459.15,467.294,"Well, I think to the extent that the lower court relied on this Court's analysis In re Gault, it certainly does because clearly --"
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,467.294,471.367,"A voluntary commitment results in a deprivation of liberty, doesn't it?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,476.87,478.241,A voluntary or involuntary?
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,478.241,479.349,Voluntary.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,479.349,481.475,"A deprivation of liberty, absolutely --"
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,481.475,481.738,You're correct.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,481.738,483.475,But it's not of constitutional significance --
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,483.475,486.17,But it better does reads all in a deprivation of liberty.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,486.17,486.972,That is correct.
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,487.99,500.729,"So, therefore I would think this view of the District Court which you're attacking has nothing to do with basically, or is irrelevant to the question of whether or not there's a deprivation of liberty."
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,500.729,512.326,"Well, the point is that the lower court by relying on this court's decision In re Gault, I think misperceived the relationships at stake in this case."
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,565.194,571.982,"None of these things you've been talking about has anything to do with whether or not there's a deprivation of liberty, does it?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,571.982,579.641,"I believe it does Mr. Justice Stewart in the sense that when a parent acts on behalf of his child, he is normally presumed to act on behalf of the child."
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,579.641,585.952,"Right, but when an adult acts on behalf of himself, he's presumed to be acting on behalf on himself."
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,585.952,586.312,That's correct.
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,586.312,587.863,In his best interest.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,594.863,599.085,"That's correct, that's correct, but in as much as it voluntary, no additional proceedings are required."
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,599.085,607.103,"So in other words, even if you're right in all of your submissions on what you've just been telling us, there still remains a deprivation of liberty."
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,607.103,608.818,To the -- that's correct.
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,619.552,622.157,Whether it's the equivalent of a voluntary admission.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,622.157,623.289,"That's correct, that's correct."
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,623.289,626.427,That's the point isn't it?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,626.427,639.505,"The analysis that we would urge upon this Court is of course the Court's analysis that was used in Mathews versus Eldridge whether or not in Pennsylvania, the children have been adequately protected throughout the process."
1978.77-1715,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,676.321,678.531,How does the child initiate that?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,678.531,681.04,The child may initiate that in a number of ways.
1978.77-1715,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,698.328,704.19,What contests does Pennsylvania held that the child may do so over the objection of his parents?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,704.19,708.202,The Pennsylvania law is very clear that any person confined --
1978.77-1715,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,708.202,710.921,Has the Court ever held that he may do so over the objection of his parent?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,710.921,717.412,"I'm not aware of any decisions on that point, but I think the statute is so clear that it would not be (Voice Overlap)."
1978.77-1715,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,717.412,724.607,"Well, what if the parent can waive any -- if the parent can waive all the child's rights, why couldn't the parent waive the right to bring this proceeding?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,724.607,739.921,"Because as I say, in contra distinction to the statute which provides that a parent may apply for admission, the statute regarding habeas corpus indicates very clearly that any person who is institutionalized or in a facility may challenge the basis."
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,739.921,750.692,"Yes, but a child under ordinary -- quite apart from this particular context or setting, generally in Pennsylvania, a parent speaks for his child, doesn't it?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,750.692,751.644,That's correct.
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,751.644,754.518,And wouldn't that also then presumably be true in this context?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,754.518,761.644,"I would assume that if a child initiated such a proceeding, the parent's voice would be given heavy credence by the court, but I don't think it will be --"
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,761.644,766.279,Can a child -- can a 10-year-old child bring a lawsuit in Pennsylvania in his own name?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,766.279,769.267,"Not normally, but he may do through a next friend."
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,769.267,769.926,Through a next friend.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,769.926,771.507,That's correct or a guardian.
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,771.507,778.028,"And by the guardian and not the guardian in the absence of an order to -- the contrary is the parent, isn't that correct?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,778.028,781.046,"Normally, however that need not necessarily be true."
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,783.819,790.4,How would a 10-year-old child go about getting a guardian?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,790.4,792.34,"Apply to the Court, Your Honor."
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,792.34,796.711,How would a 10-year-old apply to the Court?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,796.711,800.154,"In the context of habeas corpus, I assume that would be --"
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,800.154,807.723,"I said, how would a child, 10-year-old child go about applying to a Court?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,807.723,809.364,"Well, the only suggestion --"
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,809.364,812.083,Wouldn't it first have to know where the Court was?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,812.083,820.64,"Well, the only thing I can suggest is that they would do so the same way they have done here and that is by happenstance being put in touch with the counsel."
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,820.64,825.394,"Well a question was asked earlier, how many other case have you had like this one?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,825.394,826.951,"In Pennsylvania, none that I'm aware of."
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,826.951,828.359,In the world.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,828.359,829.82,"None that I'm aware of, other than the proceeding one, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,829.82,836.048,"Alright, I mean a 10-year-old child doesn't know about legal proceedings."
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,836.048,836.282,That's --
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,836.282,839.599,Does a 10-year-old child know what a writ of habeas corpus is?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,839.599,851.965,"That's correct but I think the point that the proceedings exist is that if in fact (Voice Overlap) -- if in fact it is suspected that the child is being treated when he does not need to be treated, anyone can initiate the proceedings."
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,852.917,857.258,"Well, does the child know whether he is being treated properly or not?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,857.258,857.432,No but --
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,857.432,859.043,A 10-year-old.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,859.043,862.66,"Presumably not, but the point is that someone else may."
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,865.169,869.849,But wouldn't most of the child's friend be 10-year-old?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,869.849,870.043,In this case --
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,870.043,872.448,And no smarter than he is?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,872.448,876.81,"In this case, Your Honor, the child's next friend was a very competent advocate."
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,879.708,884.888,"Well, how many other cases of that beautiful advocate filed in Pennsylvania?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,884.888,889.792,Well there's very active advocacy program in Pennsylvania.
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,891.469,894.697,How many cases like this had been filed?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,894.697,895.739,In Pennsylvania courts?
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,896.182,897.529,In the world.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,897.529,901.931,"In Pennsylvania courts, I know that there have been cases on behalf of juveniles, numbers of them."
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,901.931,903.422,How many?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,903.422,907.674,"I can't quote you numbers, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,911.89,923.74,"Then why does the argument hold in any case come up here involved in incarceration without due process to say, “Well, you can remedy that by habeas.”"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,926.195,927.303,The legislature has --
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,927.303,929.369,Do you?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,929.369,930.327,"In this case, I would not concede."
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,930.327,936.608,You don't want to say that the state can put anybody in jail if he allows him to file a writ of habeas corpus.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,936.608,937.447,Absolutely not.
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,937.447,937.89,I hope not.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,937.89,944.225,"The purposes of that confinement are manifestly different, however, than the purposes of the confinement in this case."
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1021.06,1029.317,Is this or all the same procedures equally applicable to adults who have voluntarily committed themselves?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1029.317,1031.406,Yes Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1031.576,1033.569,Pennsylvania equates the two?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1033.569,1042.096,Pennsylvania equates the two with respect to treatment not with respect to process for admission other than equating an act of a parent for the act of the child.
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1042.096,1046.701,"Yes, but that exception it equates voluntary commitments or voluntary committed?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1046.701,1047.982,That's correct.
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1047.982,1051.545,"For an adult, they're done on behalf of himself or herself."
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1055.976,1056.545,That's correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1056.545,1061.276,"So, beyond that precisely identical, is that right?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1061.276,1064.084,Absolutely.
1978.77-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.977,1087.851,"Well, under in Pennsylvania, will the Pennsylvania State Institutions take children who need treatment but it could be treated at home?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1087.851,1098.23,"Pennsylvania, the law with respect to the mentally ill is very specific that they must be provided the least restrictive setting upon which treatment may be -- where a treatment maybe afforded."
1978.77-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1107.768,1111.924,So parents can't get to state just to warehouse their children?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1111.924,1112.763,Absolutely not.
1978.77-1715,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1127.242,1128.859,The state law requires?
1978.77-1715,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1128.859,1134.189,You make that same statement in your brief like ever other state.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1149.058,1158.723,"Pennsylvania -- Mr. Justice Blackmun, Pennsylvania is making a strong effort at lowering the population of its facilities and has done a great deal toward that."
1978.77-1715,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1176.226,1183.891,"Well, I'm merely saying that I question the accuracy of your statement because I know states where there is surplus room in state institutions."
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1183.891,1185.857,I may have taken -- I may have taken liberty.
1978.77-1715,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1306.702,1320.121,"Mr. Watkins, I think we were told that in Georgia if the institution determines that the child could better be treated at home but the parents say, “No!”"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1332.316,1334.771,"With respect to a mentally ill child, yes."

1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1341.718,1346.682,Provided that the professionals do not determine that that would endanger the child.
1978.77-1715,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1346.682,1359.435,"Well, as I understand the hypothetical in the Georgia case was that the institutions said that the child would be better off at home but the parents refused to have the child at home saying, “No, too disturbing."""

1978.77-1715,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1368.274,1370.161,But how about as to the retarded?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1370.161,1371.951,That is not the case as far as I know.

1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1481.835,1485.572,"In both cases, there would be full time staff."
1978.77-1715,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.572,1487.692,They would be full time employees at the state?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1487.692,1488.075,Yeah.
1978.77-1715,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.812,1490.928,The general --

1978.77-1715,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1514.668,1515.261,Yes.

1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1528.848,1529.591,Must be a medical determination.

1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1534.939,1537.119,Do -- you don't mean a psychiatrist.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1538.7,1541.209,"With respect to the mentally retarded, that's correct."
1978.77-1715,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1541.209,1543.119,Well then they have to be more than just a doctor.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1544.736,1565.658,"An obstetrician presumably if that physician felt competent to make this medical diagnosis and he was licensed to do so, he could make the diagnosis and it would be unless the people in the medical people in our facility disagree that that recommendation would be given credence, yes."

1978.77-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.946,1579.239,Are you making the same argument with respect to them or different argument?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1579.239,1588.371,"The same arguments plus the assertion that I've made in my brief that with respect to admissions to private facilities, there's simply is no state action."
1978.77-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.873,1623.19,How did the District Court deal with that argument at state action?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1623.19,1628.011,The District Court in my view dealt with it incorrectly and applied the wrong test.
1978.77-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1628.011,1630.131,But how they did deal with it?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1630.131,1637.43,It simply found that because the admissions were obtained pursuant to state law and I believe those are directional -- pursuant to state law --
1978.77-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.43,1639.107,Pursuant to state statute?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1639.107,1640.963,-- then the state was involved.
1978.77-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.569,1687.683,Was this judgment on remand before or after the Flagg Brothers case?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1689.204,1692.941,I know that -- I simply just I don't know.
1978.77-1715,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1707.426,1714.731,"To what extent is the State of Pennsylvania regulate the private institutions, do they just license them, do they inspect them?"
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1714.731,1721.201,"There maybe a limited inspection, none that I'm aware of and none that has been brought before the Court."
1978.77-1715,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1729.099,1730.926,Do they regulate staffing?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1731.579,1733.489,Absolutely not Mr. Justice Brennan.
1978.77-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.489,1738.938,But do they forbid institutionalization in a private hospital unless these procedures are satisfied?
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1738.938,1740.196,That is the state law.
1978.77-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.196,1741.328,Uh-huh.
1978.77-1715,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,1741.328,1747.22,There is no regulatory body to approve each admission or to see that in fact that is followed.

1978.77-1715,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.712,1868.815,You mean Pennsylvania doesn't provide habeas relief or confinement generally?

1978.77-1715,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1876.395,1877.473,Of your own brief?
1978.77-1715,1,20870,david_ferleger,,1877.473,1901.099,"Of Mr. Watkins brief, the blue colored brief and that gives jurisdiction and venue on a several courts of the commonwealth for petitions in Sections 1, 2, and 3 indicate that it has to be a place where a court has ordered the commitment."
1978.77-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1910.102,1918.27,"Mr. Ferleger, before you leave the first point, why isn't the language of subparagraph A quote on page 5 broaden up to cover a child's petition?"
1978.77-1715,1,20870,david_ferleger,,1922.426,1924.426,"No, B is not all exclusive."
1978.77-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1930.175,1930.347,Oh!
1978.77-1715,1,20870,david_ferleger,,1934.81,1944.445,"The language of A is more general but when we get to see which gives where courts have jurisdiction, I believe that that would exclude juveniles."
1978.77-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1944.445,1961.535,"If a child was found in an institution and the parents didn't know where the child was and found the child in an Institution of Pennsylvania, there's no way that parent could get that child?"

1978.77-1715,1,20870,david_ferleger,,1981.823,1984.542,There aren't so far as I know.
1978.77-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1985.734,1987.884,"Well, I just don't believe it."
1978.77-1715,1,20870,david_ferleger,,1987.884,1992.489,"Well, I think that the parent might be able to file some sort of mandamus or other position."
1978.77-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1992.489,1993.591,Some sort of habeas?
1978.77-1715,1,20870,david_ferleger,,1993.591,1994.513,Right.
1978.77-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1994.513,2012.908,"Mr. Ferleger, I just don't mean to pursue it but you started your argument on that point and the jurisdiction restrictions in the C relate the petition's filed under subsection B both of them, and I was asking you about one filed under subsection A and there's nothing in C that limit the venue of jurisdiction of such a petition."
1978.77-1715,1,20870,david_ferleger,,2012.908,2026.195,I read the separate sections of the statute is the one section of the mental health law that they are and the no jurisdiction is conferred on any court for any kind of voluntary --
1978.77-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.195,2032.542,And you're saying then that there's no jurisdiction in any court to bring a proceeding pursuant to subparagraph A?
1978.77-1715,1,20870,david_ferleger,,2033.674,2035.871,So far as I know and I don't believe there's any --
1978.77-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2035.871,2039.291,But there's no court that holds that the way to read subsection A as a decision.
1978.77-1715,2,37339,norman_j_watkins,,2039.291,2041.926,No.
1978.77-1715,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2113.963,2121.382,"Excuse me, what was the evidence in which the conclusion that many parents warehouse, simply warehouse their children?"

1978.77-1715,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2132.903,2134.341,And what was the testimony then?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2134.341,2145.353,"That testimony was that whether or not children find themselves in mental institutions is circumstantial, that parents were subjected to great community practice --"
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2145.353,2147.173,This was in Pennsylvania?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2147.173,2148.461,Yes.
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2150.671,2151.833,Where did he come from?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2151.833,2155.869,It was Linda Glenn who is the Commissioner of Mental Retardation for the State of Massachusetts.
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2155.869,2157.42,She came from Massachusetts.
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2157.42,2164.151,That's right and she had toured institutions and facilities in Pennsylvania and was familiar with the conditions in those facilities.

1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2170.822,2171.445,That's correct.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2171.445,2175.571,How would she know that?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2175.571,2176.403,How would she know --
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2176.403,2177.781,Yes.
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2177.781,2182.176,Linda Glenn is an expert and we stipulate to be an expert on retardation and --
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2182.176,2195.859,"Well, you can be an expert on it, on retardation per se but how does that give you a basis for an opinion that most or great many parents do what she said?"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2195.859,2202.29,The District Court found that parents often institutionalized their children for (Voice Overlap) all reasons.

1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2271.351,2274.195,They may often not know.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2280.782,2284.528,And the children have --
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2284.528,2295.456,"Well, the children do not in this situation because there is no one with no conflict of interests to help protect their interests."
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2295.456,2303.031,Pennsylvania -- does Pennsylvania have procedures for the germination that a parent is unfit?

1978.77-1715,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2502.007,2504.441,"Well, let me interrupt you for a moment."
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2535.689,2543.438,I think that the process order by the lower court will result to large extent in that inquiry because --
1978.77-1715,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2543.438,2551.037,"But what I'm asking you is why shouldn't it be limited to that inquiry, not whether it should result in that inquiry inter alia?"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2551.037,2574.483,"The full hearing that the lower court described, the right to confrontation and presence of personal unless waive those rights even the right to counsel would not come into place unless the advocate for the child is independent party who could look at that issue, decided not to waive the hearing or unless the child would confidently decide not to waive."
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2574.483,2578.13,But generally an advocate doesn't make a decision here.
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2583.154,2588.627,In our case the neutral decision maker would have to accept of reject the waiver.
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2604.405,2607.934,Why our general issue found that there is a conflict of interest --
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2607.934,2614.275,The Court found that as a matter of fact and there is no challenge by the defendants that that fact is clearly erroneous.
1978.77-1715,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2614.275,2616.035,And what fact is clearly erroneous?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2616.035,2620.706,That parents often commit children for reasons unrelated to the needs of the children.
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2620.706,2624.389,"But if a parent does that, he's an unfit parent, isn't he?"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2624.389,2625.401,Not necessarily.
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2625.401,2626.233,Why?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2626.233,2629.916,He may be a parent who is unaware of alternatives.
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2634.97,2645.53,"What if a parent is pressured by neighbors or community in the beating of his child is an unfit parent, whatever the motivation comes from, isn't it?"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2645.53,2646.485,Not necessarily.
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2647.294,2661.869,"Wouldn't he be removed if you could show to the proper factfinder in Pennsylvania the juvenile court or whatever that a parent eventually mistreated and beat his child, wouldn't that be grounds for finding him a neglectful parent?"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2661.869,2662.701,"Yes, it would."
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2667.132,2668.45,Wherever the pressures came from.
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2668.45,2676.977,"Well, there might be situations where the parent would need the help, would need the knowledge, would need the assistance of experts in order to deal with those problems."
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2676.977,2684.636,"Isn't there another alternative that the parent might just be uninformed and confused, not evil in any sense?"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2684.636,2688.283,"Well, I -- definitely Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2704.319,2715.277,"Well, since there's so much talk about less restrictive measures, aren't there less restrictive measures to inform the parents about these things in holding a full scale hearing?"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2715.277,2716.535,There are in the court --
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2716.535,2721.14,Just counseling by the family guidance counselors?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2721.14,2726.074,The District Court does not require that a full hearing be held in any case.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2746.763,2750.919,"Well, what's the advocates function here under your theory?"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2763.398,2767.53,I don't believe the advocate's function is to keep the child out of confinement at all cost.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2767.53,2774.47,"That's normally the function of an advocate, isn't it when he is confronted with a confinement problem?"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2774.47,2777.674,That is often the function of an advocate.
1978.77-1715,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2780.393,2783.621,"In federal prosecution, that's his only function."
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2783.621,2800.89,"Yes, having represented a children and adults in commitment hearings, what you often find is a situation where it's clear that some kind of help needs to be imposed at that point I believe the function of the advocate is to try to work out the best least restrictive --"
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2800.89,2807.657,"Well, so now the advocate is stepping into the position of the medical advisor, isn't he?"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2807.657,2808.849,"No, I don't believe so because --"
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2808.849,2811.987,"If he is helping to decide, you said?"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2811.987,2818.445,The reason is a very important one that the advocate is not becoming a medical officer.
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2894.562,2899.173,How long historically had there been state mental hospitals?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2899.173,2911.0,The earliest institution I believe was built in 1751 in United States but there were very few until the mid-1800s.
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2943.198,2960.318,"But I suppose that before there were mental hospitals, power of the guardian to lock somebody up in an attic was unquestioned because that didn't involve any action by the state then therefore didn't implicate the Constitution."
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2960.318,2974.174,"Actually the first commitment in 1676 which occurred in Pennsylvania, the first commitment on record that I know of involved the father petitioning to colonial court in Pennsylvania for the commitment of his son."
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2992.675,2993.761,Would you say that again?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2994.107,2994.969,Certainly.
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3008.143,3008.886,In Pennsylvania.
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3008.886,3010.167,In Pennsylvania.
1978.77-1715,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3016.425,3027.257,"And prior to 1966, what was the procedure for the so-called voluntary admission of somebody who would not reach --"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3027.257,3044.537,"For the mentally retarded, sworn affidavits were required and there was an application procedure that required doctors to submit something to a magistrate or a judge for the mentally ill back a while that the procedures changed over the years."
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.953,3076.959,We'll resume at 1 o'clock.
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3076.959,3091.869,Thank you.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3091.869,3098.321,You may continue counsel.
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3098.321,3099.123,May it please the Court.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3154.615,3176.561,"You haven't talked yet counsel about whether the net effect, the ultimate effect of this might be more damaging the children to take them through this gaunt of an adversary proceeding in which the very procedure itself puts them in opposition to their parents."
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3192.358,3197.538,The District Court found as a fact in its opinion at page 1081 to 1082.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3197.538,3198.4,What's the evidence?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3207.083,3209.083,It's not conjecture on the part of the Court.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3235.123,3237.033,Presence of the child by the hearing.
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3237.033,3239.758,That's correct.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3239.758,3251.369,Just within this context as a child what capacity does the child got to evaluate whether he or she should take part from this affair or should not?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3251.369,3254.297,"If the child is able, the decision would be the child."
1978.77-1715,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3297.677,3306.162,"But if the potential for deprivation of liberty that calls into existence the right to have an advocate in the first place, isn't it?"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3306.162,3306.934,Yes it is.
1978.77-1715,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3332.028,3345.345,But is that all and much different than to defend a lawyer for a defendant and a criminal case advised and the client to plead guilty?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3345.345,3352.441,I think a lawyer in certain criminal case probably has the obligation to advise the client to plead guilty or not.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3378.037,3387.543,"Now, when you get to this point in this kind of another premise, you would have decided that the parents are not to make the decision."
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3394.816,3395.714,Not unilaterally.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3395.714,3397.511,That's no.
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3422.988,3425.647,"No, we're not taking the parents out."
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3428.809,3433.623,"Their decision isn't going to control, the decision of the parents is out."
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3433.623,3434.701,Not.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3434.701,3437.575,I don't mean the physical presence obviously.
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3458.642,3465.708,The case would be presented to the neutral tribunal which would have to approve any waiver of the hearing.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3476.6,3482.139,Aren't you giving the advocate here a greater role and you're giving either the parents or the medical advisor?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3482.139,3489.504,"No, because the unbiased tribunal has to confirm any waiver of any rights."
1978.77-1715,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3489.504,3492.627,Is the unbiased tribunal necessarily judicial when it is --
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3492.627,3493.519,"No, not at all."
1978.77-1715,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3500.016,3502.561,Is there a right of appeal?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3502.561,3506.034,The lower court did not discuss any right of appeal.
1978.77-1715,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3506.034,3510.256,What's your opinion as to the constitutional requirement of an appeal?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3510.256,3524.472,"The state when this Court asked it to give its views on what kind of hearing would be required, suggested that in administrative hearing is subject to appeal through the administrative and then court process that we have in Pennsylvania."
1978.77-1715,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3524.472,3526.442,And do you agree with that?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3526.442,3528.508,"I think that would be constitutionally sufficient, yes."
1978.77-1715,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3528.508,3531.436,Do you think you'll be constitutionally required?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3531.436,3533.113,To have an appeal?
1978.77-1715,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3533.113,3536.49,An appeal as well your initial hearing?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3536.49,3540.072,"No, I don't think it would."
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3584.741,3590.759,I take it you do agree that the advocate becomes in this setting a very important factor?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3590.759,3591.328,Yes.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3604.378,3610.839,Is there anything in these standards to assure that he knows something about the subject?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3610.839,3611.468,Yes.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3635.199,3639.534,"Well, the advocate then is a different fellow from this trained mental health person?"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3639.534,3642.289,The advocate is the trained mental health person.
1978.77-1715,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3642.289,3643.091,You've lost me.
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3649.523,3650.445,That's right.
1978.77-1715,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3670.804,3672.062,The trained mental --
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3672.062,3673.793,Would not make the decision on commitment.
1978.77-1715,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3674.895,3677.554,"Now, but the advocate would decide whether or not a lawyer --"
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3677.554,3678.356,Yes.
1978.77-1715,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3690.147,3699.189,May I ask what folks in the mental health field are trained specially in advocacy?

1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3753.345,3756.669,In my view it is and I find myself spending in a lot of those --
1978.77-1715,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3756.669,3765.435,What was the basis for the congressional decision that requires states to have an advocacy system?
1978.77-1715,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3765.435,3771.746,The basis for that and I think there are findings prefatory to the statute.
