1989.89-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.039,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-431, Yellow Freight System, Inc. v. Colleen Donnelly."
1989.89-431,0,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,13.308,16.093,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,188.154,190.256,Or with the Federal judiciary?
1989.89-431,0,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,190.256,190.923,--Excuse me?
1989.89-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.923,193.308,Or with the Federal judiciary?
1989.89-431,0,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,193.708,194.658,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,194.658,196.277,--it depends on how you read that phrase.
1989.89-431,0,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,205.733,209.668,"But in either case, it's the Federal authorities who will be making the decision under the statute."
1989.89-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,209.668,218.338,"--Yeah, but... but the way you read it, it was as though it was in the context of a discussion of whether there would be enforcement in the states or in the Federal courts."
1989.89-431,0,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,221.642,223.226,The statement was not made in that context.
1989.89-431,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.462,227.695,That's right.
1989.89-431,0,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,239.187,250.476,"Well, the... it is consistent with a whole series of other comments made by the supporters of the legislation, the court model, that consistently used reference to the Federal courts."
1989.89-431,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.476,268.872,"--Well, Mr. Pasek, it's true that the legislative history contains many references to the supposed Federal court jurisdiction, but does it contain anywhere a discussion of the possible role of state courts?"
1989.89-431,0,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,268.872,272.491,There is no discussion whatsoever about any role for the state courts.
1989.89-431,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.491,286.934,So it's a little hard to say that it meets the Gulfshore... Gulf Offshore requirement that there be an unmistakable implication of Federal jurisdiction exclusively.
1989.89-431,0,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,286.934,300.409,"I believe, Your Honor, that when the Congress talks about, as Senator Cotton said, that the process will lead to one place, the door of the Federal court, he was by implication excluding the door of the state court from resolving those cases."
1989.89-431,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,300.409,313.901,"Well, but the thrust of Gulf Offshore's comments was that it has to be an unmistakable implication, and it looks to me like that's hard to make out here."
1989.89-431,0,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,326.543,334.165,In this case there was explicit consideration of the role of the states in dealing with employment discrimination claims.
1989.89-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,438.966,458.23,"But I... I think we've had cases, haven't we, Mr. Pasek, where the congressional enactment will talk about authorizing a suit in the United States district court and we've said that that is not sufficiently negativing the idea of state court jurisdiction."
1989.89-431,0,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,471.703,476.424,I agree that the mere grant of jurisdiction to the Federal courts is not sufficient.
1989.89-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,663.496,679.421,"In your view, Mr. Pasek, supposing that Congress wanted to specify the appeal procedure in Federal courts, what more should it have done to indicate that... if it were of the mind that state courts should have jurisdiction, too?"
1989.89-431,0,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,679.421,693.265,"If it had not included the reference to 1291 and 1292, that would be some indication that the... well, reverse that."
1989.89-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,723.967,735.942,"But we've... we've said in our cases on this issue, have we not, that the granting of jurisdiction to the Federal district courts is not sufficient to show exclusive Federal jurisdiction."
1989.89-431,0,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,735.942,737.344,"Yes, that's correct."
1989.89-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,737.344,747.35,"Well, why should specifying appeal from the Federal district court to the court of appeals be any different than the granting of Federal jurisdiction of the district courts for that purpose?"
1989.89-431,0,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,747.35,755.356,It's an unusual procedure by Congress to specify that the appeal is to be taken pursuant to Sections 1291 and 1292.
1989.89-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,921.646,922.931,"Very well, Mr. Pasek."
1989.89-431,1,30900,john_j_henely,,932.204,935.573,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1989.89-431,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.662,1052.983,"Well, you don't suggest that there would have to be some express mention of state courts, do you?"
1989.89-431,1,30900,john_j_henely,,1052.983,1054.852,In the... in the legislative history?
1989.89-431,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.852,1055.285,Uh-huh.
1989.89-431,1,30900,john_j_henely,,1055.285,1056.352,"Oh, most certainly."
1989.89-431,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1056.352,1056.852,You do?
1989.89-431,1,30900,john_j_henely,,1068.926,1073.564,"Oh, that's... that's another way of putting it."
1989.89-431,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.935,1095.577,"Well, I take it the argument on the other side is that the legislative history is equivalent to that kind of a statement, that the legislative history indicates that they really meant to have these suits brought only in the Federal courts."
1989.89-431,1,30900,john_j_henely,,1095.577,1102.083,"Well, and then you'd have to say, well, whether it was a proponent or an opponent it's a problem area."
1989.89-431,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1122.46,1132.185,"Well, Mr. Henely, a good many Federal courts have held that the Federal courts do have exclusive jurisdiction in these cases."
1989.89-431,1,30900,john_j_henely,,1132.185,1132.918,"Yes, Justice--"
1989.89-431,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1132.918,1137.036,There is language to that effect in dicta and opinions of this Court.
1989.89-431,1,30900,john_j_henely,,1141.588,1142.271,--Yes.
1989.89-431,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1142.271,1145.892,Did they misread the legislative history or--
1989.89-431,1,30900,john_j_henely,,1145.892,1146.692,They read into--
1989.89-431,2,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,1753.148,1758.616,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1989.89-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.058,1881.43,"Well, this plaintiff chose the state court, didn't it?"
1989.89-431,2,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,1881.43,1882.397,"--Yes, she did."
1989.89-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1882.397,1890.103,"Well, so there will be some that will forego the advantages of the Federal court, or try to."
1989.89-431,2,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,1890.103,1897.606,"The determination will then of course be made as a basis of state law, what... what preclusion the state would provide."
1989.89-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.966,1928.478,"Well, you really have to gather something out of the legislative history other than a desire to make... to make a... the Federal courts available to a plaintiff and to have an expeditious procedure available for the plaintiff in the Federal courts."
1989.89-431,2,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,1936.381,1937.083,--That's correct.
1989.89-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.667,2055.909,"Did the courts of appeals that have decided for your position, did they... did they rely exclusively on the legislative history or did they find some incompatibility?"
1989.89-431,2,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,2055.909,2073.353,"Well, the Valenzuela case drew also upon the statutory provisions calling for the expedited proceedings, the assignment of a single judge, the application of Rule 65 standards, appeals to be handled under Section 1291 and 1292."
1989.89-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.706,2081.926,And those were thought to be incompatible with state--
1989.89-431,2,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,2081.926,2082.643,"--Well, they--"
1989.89-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.643,2083.694,--jurisdiction?
1989.89-431,2,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,2083.694,2104.005,"--They were, I would submit, both incompatible with state jurisdiction and evidence of the congressional intent because you are then left with the position of whether or not to force the states to realign their court administration system to accommodate the procedures that were an essential part of the compromise that Congress reached."
1989.89-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2114.129,2119.95,"Well, actually, incompatibility would just... itself just be evidence of congressional intent, wouldn't it?"
1989.89-431,2,32347,jeffrey_ivan_pasek,,2119.95,2121.567,"I believe that it would, yes."
1989.89-431,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2138.512,2139.829,"Thank you, Mr. Pasek."
