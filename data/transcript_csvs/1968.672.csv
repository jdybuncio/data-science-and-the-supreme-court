1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,22.453,27.959,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.672,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,155.614,157.419,"It's wholly exempt from tax, is it?"
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,157.419,158.617,"Yes, that's right Mr. Justice."
1968.672,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,158.617,161.106,If it's disability retirement.
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,161.106,175.044,"Pursuant to the Government's motion to dismiss and it asserted affirmative defense, the Court of Claims dismissed respondent King's petition on the grounds that petition was basically a claim for a tax refund."
1968.672,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,327.757,335.73,We'll recess on Mr. Ruckelshaus.
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,340.329,343.524,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,629.373,636.66,"Didn't Judge Davis said, the real question was the army regulations and not revenue code?"
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,636.66,651.757,"Yes Mr. Justice Marshall, he did say that the real question was the army regulation but I think he was forced to make that statement because he had already ruled prior to that time that this was essentially a tax refund claim."
1968.672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,690.81,693.655,And it's your position therefore loss of jurisdiction?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,693.655,699.577,"No, the minute he said that the sole question before the Court had to do with whether the man was properly retired."
1968.672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,699.577,704.351,"He didn't say sole, he said the controlling as I've got (Inaudible)?"
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,704.351,708.124,I think he -- that's the last part of his opinion.
1968.672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,721.19,721.801,Yes.
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,721.801,727.27,And those are the only issues with which this Court will treat in its further proceeding in this case.
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.717,774.134,"Now, why is it that he couldn't have said in the Court of Claims that United States made a mistake in retiring me and put me in the wrong category and by reason of that mistake I am out some money and that the United States told me that money for having cause me to pay it out when I shouldn't have."
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,776.577,778.733,"Mr. Justice White, I think that the original --"
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.733,780.55,Do you think that's just a tax refund claim?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,780.55,784.533,That's what the court below held in its original order to dismiss the --
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.533,804.119,"Well, I know but he says if I were in the right category why if I were retired in the right category, well of course I owe those taxes and as long that classification stands then why I did all the taxes but I want to get rid of the classification."
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,831.225,851.117,"I think on basis of Prince against United States, Mr. Justice White, the Court therein entertained a very similar fact situation herein in which Prince had filed a petition for tax refund with the Internal Revenue Service before bringing his suit to determine whether he was properly retired."
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.751,876.82,Do you think in a tax refund suit that in an ordinary tax refund suit that this officer could've had had litigated the correctness of his retirement?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,876.82,884.497,I don't believe that he could've had litigated or he could've had the determination made by the Internal Revenue Service as to whether (Voice Overlap).
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.497,886.67,Or in that kind of a suit?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,886.67,891.62,"Well, in Prince against United States, Mr. Prince did just that Mr. Justice White."
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.778,895.738,In the tax refund suit?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,895.738,898.469,In the tax refund suit in the Court of Claims.
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,898.469,914.165,"Well, in the Court of Claims, yes but how about the Internal Revenue Service that we won't look at that, you just know the tax if he -- could he get adjudicated in the District Court you think?"
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,914.165,919.335,"Well, if Prince is a proper holding and as I say we have some question about that."
1968.672,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1012.339,1017.188,"I don't see your Prince case cited in your brief, is it?"
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1017.188,1019.009,"I believe it is, Justice Black."
1968.672,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1019.009,1026.849,I didn't see in the index.
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1026.849,1048.044,"It's cited on page 2 of Justice Davis' opinion Mr. Justice Black, its 127 Court of Claims 612."
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.454,1160.566,What made you to the Tucker Act after the waiver as the immunity by the United States to the extent you concede United States waiver?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1160.566,1164.385,The Tucker Act states its jurisdictional statement.
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.083,1235.821,"Do you think that is harmless just amended the statute, the Tucker Act has said the Court of Claims now also have jurisdiction to adjudicate Declaratory Judgment Act, he made it to money claim and that would be (Inaudible)?"
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1235.821,1238.338,I think that would be clear enough Mr. Justice White that --
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.338,1243.578,But what will Declaratory Judgment Act (Inaudible)?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1243.578,1250.698,The Declaratory Judgment Act simply said that any court of United States may -- has the right to adjudicate --
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1250.698,1252.485,Has jurisdiction?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1252.485,1256.032,"-- within its jurisdiction, he didn't say it didn't speak in jurisdictional terms."
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.792,1262.388,"Well, it did speak about cases otherwise within its jurisdiction."
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1262.388,1272.897,Within its jurisdiction what it said that the court could issue a declaratory judgment in a case or controversy within its jurisdiction.
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1289.617,1298.805,"Well, when Declaratory Judgment Act was passed, what was wrong with Declaratory Judgment Act?"
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1298.805,1325.455,"Well, I think the primary question was one of rightness prior to the Declaratory Judgment Act and there were many -- you had to do with a rightness of a claim that some -- there were many purposes that it was primarily to decide controversies between private individuals that had not reached the degree of rightness in which a suit could normally be brought."
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1341.126,1349.182,There isn't -- there wasn't jurisdictional power regarding the (Inaudible)?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1349.182,1379.545,"Well, I think that there was a problems of rightness and problems of whether the controversy had ripened enough to be determinable by a court, justiciable by a court and that prior to the enactment of the declaratory judgment statute many cases were dismissed for being premature and that many activities on the part of private individuals were inhibited because they could not get their rights determined prior to the time that they acted."
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.545,1394.532,Do you say that the Declaratory Judgment Act didn't help the Court of Claims in declaratory judgment situation because the claim became once and otherwise this jurisdiction in the first place.
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1394.532,1396.936,I think that's right Mr. Justice White.
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.936,1399.581,Because of the lack of waiving.
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1399.581,1414.38,Because there has to be a waiver somewhere or consent to be sued in all that the Congress has ever consented in this area was that the United States could be sued in the Court of Claims for money damages.
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1414.38,1422.984,For right of claims and consent of money damage suit would only mean that the claim is sufficiently right.
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1422.984,1455.885,"Well, I think it goes further than that because if you are to say that the Court of Claims has the power to grant declaratory judgment in areas where the claim is not right, these means that under the general grant of the Tucker Act to determine controversies in regarding governmental regulation and this amounts to a considerable increase in power in the Court of Claims whether you call that additional remedy or additional jurisdiction."
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1458.517,1468.924,Because I understand your position you do not claim that the Declaratory Judgment Act on its face in speaking of the Courts of the United States excluded the Court of Claims?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1468.924,1470.128,That's right.
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.128,1489.839,That within the word “courts” is included the Court of Claims but the Act doesn't give the Court of Claims the privilege of doing something that wasn't doing before because it didn't have jurisdiction to do so --
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1489.839,1490.086,I think --
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.086,1494.14,-- to issue declaratory judgment because of lack of consent for the United States.
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1494.14,1496.072,I think the problem Mr. Justice White --
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.072,1501.298,But where does the consent of the United States stop in the Tucker Act?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1501.298,1509.762,I think it stops when somebody goes into the Court of Claims and request something in addition to a money judgment or other than a money judgment.
1968.672,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1509.762,1517.232,"You mean that ask for a declaration about of money judgment but the money judgment isn't right or not, or the money claim isn't right or not?"
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1517.232,1526.832,"Well, if the Court, I think the problem is basically is a problem between jurisdiction and remedy and we were talking about sovereign immunity."
1968.672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1581.002,1590.57,"Well, I suppose you could spell out the declaratory judgment involving a matter of dollars and cents would the Court of Claims do?"
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1590.57,1594.84,"Well, I think that's exactly what the -- has been done here Mr. Justice Marshall the --"
1968.672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1594.84,1600.237,"Or if it involves a matter of dollars and cents, isn't that the Tucker Act?"
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1604.657,1638.149,The -- in the declaratory judgment the question of whether any further relief can be granted is a reserve in Judge Davis' opinion and the petitioner herein asked for a money judgment in the form of a declaratory judgment petition and I don't think that traditionally declaratory judgments have been used to grant money judgment and so if and again in this particular case if what they're asking for is a money judgment by the Court's own earlier decision.
1968.672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1642.902,1651.042,Haven't you run across declaratory judgments and ordinary actions would end up in sizeable money?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1651.042,1652.831,I'm sorry I didn't hear your question Justice Marshall.
1968.672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1652.831,1663.155,"Declaratory judgments in ordinary courts, district courts involving hundreds of thousands of dollars, simply a declaratory judgment?"
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1663.155,1664.097,That's right.
1968.672,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1664.097,1665.726,Nothing wrong with that?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1665.726,1668.135,"No, there's nothing wrong except that the --"
1968.672,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1668.135,1669.946,Except against the United States is that (Voice Overlap)?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1669.946,1673.097,Except against in the Court of Claims against United States.
1968.672,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1673.489,1675.001,I thought you said in any court?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1675.001,1693.712,"Well, I am not maintaining, Mr. Justice Stewart, in any court because they have issued some declaratory judgments under the Admiralty Act and under the Federal Tort Claims Act where the jurisdictional grant to sue the United States is considerably broader than it is in the Tucker."
1968.672,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1693.712,1710.515,"Oh, I remember those cases in your brief at least the admiralty one but I thought your basic claim was that absence on special conferral of jurisdiction that no court not merely the Court of Claims but the District Court didn't have the power to our judgment against the United States?"
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1710.515,1723.216,"Well, without some jurisdictional absence, some jurisdictional grant and a clear waiver of sovereign immunity by Congress, yes they cannot have a Declaratory Judgment Act against United States."
1968.672,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1768.35,1772.939,The District Courts have concurrent jurisdiction up to what amount is that?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1772.939,1773.624,"$10,000.00"
1968.672,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1773.624,1778.245,"$10,000.00 and there are several courts of appeals --"
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1778.245,1787.273,"That have held that, if they try to found jurisdiction on the Tucker Act that the declaratory judgment action does not lie."
1968.672,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1787.273,1794.818,Can the tax court issue a declaratory judgment?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1794.818,1797.806,I can't answer that Mr. Justice Black.
1968.672,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1815.06,1819.054,What about the Court of Customs Appeals?
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1819.054,1820.138,CCPA?
1968.672,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1820.138,1821.244,Yes.
1968.672,0,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1821.244,1832.796,To my knowledge they cannot either Mr. Justice Black.
1968.672,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1832.796,1845.595,Mr. Kabatchnick.
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,1845.595,1851.947,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1968.672,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1996.804,1998.864,What about the Texaco?
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,1998.864,2019.405,"Sir, I find nothing if following my theory if it is correct in going to the provisions of Section 451 and the term Court of United States as defined there."
1968.672,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2028.569,2030.16,Just one of any court?
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2030.16,2030.715,Sir?
1968.672,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2030.715,2033.549,"I'm under the terms of any court, wasn't it?"
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2033.549,2042.733,If as a Court of the United States I would think that it is but it's not expressly identified within Section 451 which --
1968.672,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2042.733,2045.669,"Well, it's not covered by the definition, is it because it says --"

1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2059.674,2060.091,"Yes, sir."
1968.672,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2610.689,2616.803,You say the amount in this footnote would coincidentally have equal the amount of taxes without --

1968.672,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2632.116,2635.297,Not the out of or whatever source or tax refund comes from?
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2635.297,2637.826,"Yes, Justice Stewart."
1968.672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.812,2700.527,"Well, what if he brought suit in a District Court for a tax refund which I suppose he can do, couldn't he?"

1968.672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2737.486,2740.749,Then he sues in the District Court for tax refund?
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2740.749,2742.589,This could possibly to be done and this was --
1968.672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2742.589,2750.063,And then he would claim that I am entitled of the tax refund because they put me in the wrong category.
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2750.063,2762.727,But the Court I don't think the Court and I don't think that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue would be a futile act as far as Commissioner of Internal Revenue is concerned because he has no basis for determining --
1968.672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.727,2766.45,"Well, I want to know about the Court."
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2766.45,2782.147,"I don't -- I think that the Court could if this were a tax refund case, I think that or excuse me, no he could not seek a declaratory judgment because he accepted under the exemptions of --"
1968.672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2782.147,2782.709,"Well,"
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2782.709,2783.565,-- Declaratory Judgment Act.
1968.672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2783.565,2785.938,-- is he asking money?
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2809.759,2820.759,As I think that a District Court as a disability retirement action could (Voice Overlap) --
1968.672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.759,2823.272,This is in a tax refund suit?
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2823.272,2825.524,I don't --
1968.672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.524,2842.61,When he sues for the return of taxes couldn't he have adjudicated in that suit the army had made a mistake and once that was adjudicated they have a judgment for taxes he shouldn't pay.
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2842.61,2859.704,I do not think that the Court would possibly even reach that question because there had not been a prior adjudication or there would be nothing before the Court as to the merit or lack of merit of the tax refund.
1968.672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.098,2926.802,What would be -- would you think you'd have said something fatal if you have answered me yes?
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2926.802,2940.393,"Your Honor, I just feel and maybe counsel has failed to convey these thoughts of the Court and I apologize --"
1968.672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.393,2942.225,"Well, I understand that you say (Voice Overlap) --"
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2942.225,2942.931,That this is --
1968.672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2942.931,2945.521,-- but you really weren't interested in the tax refund suit?
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2945.521,2946.387,"Yes, sir."
1968.672,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.669,2958.375,So you really -- my question is irrelevant but that's a fair (Inaudible).
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2958.375,2975.905,"Well, I can't if Your Honor I cannot speak with any expertise as to the general nature of a tax refund suit other than as the general term applies if I may use that phraseology sir."
1968.672,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2979.229,2981.8,Did your client go as far as he could administratively?
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,2981.8,2982.246,"Yes, sir."
1968.672,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3001.909,3002.514,Retirement.
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,3002.514,3010.04,"-- retirement and I believe in the petitioner's brief in their statement of the facts on page 3, they mentioned subsequently."
1968.672,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3019.537,3021.445,And you fully exhaust them?
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,3021.445,3021.725,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.672,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3021.725,3024.038,I mean there's no issue about that?
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,3024.038,3024.54,"No, sir."
1968.672,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3024.54,3025.463,Between you and your --
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,3025.463,3025.686,No.
1968.672,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3025.686,3028.414,-- brother?
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,3028.414,3040.448,All of the available remedies have been exhausted and proceedings of the correctional records are of course are in the appendix.
1968.672,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3069.905,3097.296,"Well, I suppose that your position that if the Government says that -- if the statute says its sovereign immunity is waived with respect to this category of claims against the United States then that's a waiver that makes -- that opens the door to whatever remedy a court may apply, is that your position?"
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,3097.296,3098.057,Yes.
1968.672,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3098.057,3119.861,"Now, on the other hand, I suppose that the argument is that the United States waived sovereign immunity but only for purposes of permitting a judgment for money and not for purposes of obtaining declaratory relief."
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,3119.861,3121.875,That's my understanding.
1968.672,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3121.875,3150.803,"And your position is that once a Government has waived sovereign immunity with respect to a particular subject matter, the restriction on the form of action is of no consequence."
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,3150.803,3176.992,As to form of action Justice Fortas it would be a consequence but I'm thinking of the language of describing what a declaratory proceeding is that is not a proceeding in equity or a law but a sui generis.
1968.672,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3187.906,3223.897,"Well, that's really the issue here, it seems to me I'm not sure that I'm help by talking about it in terms of jurisdiction that the question maybe here whether the waiver of sovereign immunity by in the statute which is a consent to be sued for money judgment also operates as a consent to be sued and declaratory judgment action."
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,3223.897,3250.53,"It would be respondent's position Justice Fortas that where you have consent to sue such as in the Tucker Act which gives you the jurisdictional to leave, to proceed for judicial relief that this waiver in the Tucker Act does accord the claimant the right to seek declaratory relief."
1968.672,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3250.53,3251.071,"Oh, yes."
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,3251.071,3292.532,"As the form of action or as incidental portion of his claim, of his monetary claim and as what's stated in the Pennsylvanian Railway Company as a procedural step to the accomplishment or the achievement of the receipt or to be put in the position, I believe it was one of the phrases that Judge Davis used below to be put in the position to have this right, to have a judicial statement of his right to the claim or a recognition of his right to a monetary claim."
1968.672,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3292.532,3295.243,"In short, a declaratory judgment."
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,3358.876,3369.365,"I might in response to your second portion of your question, of course the first portion, Justice Fortas my answer is yes that the Act, our position if the Act does apply."
1968.672,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3446.24,3451.203,"Just at the verbal level the statute, the linguistic, the semantic level."
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,3470.463,3470.84,Yes.
1968.672,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3470.84,3478.391,Or upon contract or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases other than tort cases.
1968.672,1,37164,neil_b_kabatchnick,,3478.391,3478.854,That's correct.
1968.672,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3532.56,3539.485,"Mr. Ruckelshaus, if you have something briefly in closing."
1968.672,2,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,3539.485,3541.441,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.672,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3623.764,3625.671,Very well.
