2000.99-1792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.799,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-1792, the Director of Revenue of Missouri v. CoBank ACB."
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,48.572,51.795,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2000.99-1792,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,225.738,230.28,"It has, I take it, been described as such by statute from the very beginning."
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,230.28,241.24,"From the very beginning, Your Honor, and that's significant, because even in 1933, what rights or abilities a Federal instrumentality had was unclear."
2000.99-1792,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,242.098,251.655,"But don't we have... isn't the statute... as I understand the statute, it used to say, your bonds are exempt and your income is exempt as long as the stock's being held by the Board of Governors."
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,251.655,251.855,--That's right.
2000.99-1792,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,251.855,252.416,All right.
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,255.489,255.949,That's right.
2000.99-1792,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,255.949,256.3,All right.
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,257.428,258.079,That's right.
2000.99-1792,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,258.079,261.783,"And what you rather brilliantly say is, ha ha, that means McCulloch clicks in."
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,261.783,262.424,Well--
2000.99-1792,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,262.424,267.719,"And since McCulloch clicks in, since it doesn't say it doesn't, they're exempt anyway as a Federal instrumentality."
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,267.719,268.11,"--Well, I think that's what they say."
2000.99-1792,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,269.612,270.023,Right.
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,271.051,272.152,We would say that they're not--
2000.99-1792,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,272.152,272.493,"Exactly, right."
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,272.493,279.268,"--That's right, and this Court, and in fact Congress has never suggested that there could be this kind of a hybrid provision for exemption."
2000.99-1792,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,289.253,289.514,All right.
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,295.768,310.959,"Well, first off that... the McCulloch... well, McCulloch holds that a Federal instrumentality cannot be taxed discriminatorily and in fact goes beyond that to say you can't import... impose certain kinds of taxes."
2000.99-1792,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,317.073,321.337,One obvious reason... one obvious reason would be because they're not a Federal instrumentality.
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,322.148,322.767,That's A.
2000.99-1792,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,322.767,325.701,"Now, is there a second argument lurking here, that--"
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,325.701,325.96,Yes.
2000.99-1792,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,325.96,326.891,--That's what I'm--
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,326.891,337.8,"That McCulloch is restricted to an instrumentality of the type that this Court addressed in the New Mexico case, and we can see the comparison fairly bluntly here."
2000.99-1792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,426.989,444.239,"--Well, I guess on the side of your opponent is the fact that these banks were created to perform an important governmental function by extending reliable credit to farmers at the lowest possible cost."
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,444.239,445.539,And that's certainly true.
2000.99-1792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,445.539,445.929,Right?
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,448.541,448.751,Yes.
2000.99-1792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,448.751,455.777,"And by subjecting them to taxation, it's going to drive up that cost."
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,455.777,458.048,"Well, it may or may not drive up that cost."
2000.99-1792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,463.221,464.313,Assuming it does--
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,464.313,473.64,"--Assuming it does, assuming that it does drive up the cost, then that would certainly affect the ability of these entities to fulfill that interest in which the Government has an interest, yes, it would."
2000.99-1792,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,473.64,475.953,"--Is that enough, then, to exempt them from that interest?"
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,475.953,476.782,"No, it is not."
2000.99-1792,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,486.808,493.483,"Would you amend your answer to say, anything the Government calls an instrumentality?"
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,493.483,494.553,"Well, no."
2000.99-1792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.763,512.495,"Did the statute in McCulloch say... use the term, instrumentality of the United States?"
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,512.495,512.726,No.
2000.99-1792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.299,519.722,"No, I mean, but the statute creating the Bank of the United States."
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,519.722,521.572,"As far as I know, it did not."
2000.99-1792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,521.572,522.443,Did it call it an instrumentality of the United States?
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,522.443,522.794,No.
2000.99-1792,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.794,523.856,My recollection is that it didn't.
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,523.856,534.832,"I... there's no mention in the case suggesting that it did, and that matters in the sense that... well, not just that it didn't use that phrase, but there's no exemption statute at issue in McCulloch."
2000.99-1792,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,551.444,576.19,"Mr. Layton, there's a reason that the other side gives for the exemption of the debt obligations, because, they say, those obligations are held not in the hands of CoBank but in the hands of the lenders, so you need an exemption so that those lenders, who are private and not government instrumentalities, won't be taxed."
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,576.19,597.744,"Well, it's curious that they make that claim in a brief where they also cite the Memphis case in section 742 of, I believe it's title 31, which, if this entity is part of the United States, that is, if this bank of cooperatives has the inherent authority that they ascribe to it, then 742 would cover them, and this provision would be superfluous in 2134."
2000.99-1792,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,716.074,728.923,"Do we have some cases that say that if you call it a technical amendment, then we can go back behind the intention of the Congress as, treat it as something of a different order than a straight out repealer?"
2000.99-1792,0,31466,james_r_layton,,728.923,729.002,No.
2000.99-1792,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.567,823.114,"We'll hear from you now, Mr. Frederick."
2000.99-1792,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,823.114,834.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1792,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1064.571,1070.195,"Well, maybe Congress has already created that confusion by using the term inconsistently."
2000.99-1792,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1070.195,1077.271,"Mr. Chief Justice, that is certainly an area that Congress would certainly want to address."
2000.99-1792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1095.993,1110.122,"Yes, but Mr. Frederick, isn't it true that for purposes of deciding this case, if we have to... if we rule in your favor and the favor of the petitioner, we must decide that the mere fact that it's labeled an instrumentality is not sufficient to give a tax exemption?"
2000.99-1792,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1110.122,1111.444,"--No, Justice Stevens."
2000.99-1792,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.776,1153.15,"Well, we would at least have to say that the mere fact they have used the term instrumentality is not sufficient to overcome the statutory argument."
2000.99-1792,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1153.15,1158.425,"--That's correct, where there is express tax exempt language given by Congress."
2000.99-1792,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1166.97,1173.434,So is it your principal submission that we should look at the act in its pre-1985 status?
2000.99-1792,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1173.434,1194.228,"Well, we think that the '85 language which is present here is, in and of itself, sufficient, but it is also supported by the history of the statutory evolution from 1933, which makes perfectly clear Congress did not intend for these entities to be tax exempt when the Government did not own shares in them."
2000.99-1792,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1197.719,1198.48,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1211.6,1214.001,"Perhaps I could clear that up, Your Honor."
2000.99-1792,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1224.078,1225.81,How about from 1989 to 1995?
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1225.81,1232.786,"The bank did, in fact, pay tax, and fairly promptly, beginning with the year 1991 filed refund claims to recover that tax."
2000.99-1792,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1282.699,1300.09,"Well, the question is was there really any congressional determination, considering that when one thing we know for sure from '68 to '85, Congress meant these entities to be subject to income tax, and they were."
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1308.234,1314.669,"Well, let me go through the history briefly of the banks for cooperatives, because I think that answers your question."
2000.99-1792,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1363.32,1367.803,But there was still a provision for the Government to come back and use--
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1367.803,1369.105,--To invest in the stock.
2000.99-1792,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1369.105,1369.325,--Yes.
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1369.325,1395.251,"What changed in 1985 is that the form of potential Government investment changed, and it changed not because of some sense of a difference in the structure of these entities, it changed because Congress determined that a centralized entity, the Farm Credit Capital Corporation, could serve a number of warehousing and centralized financing functions, and it would then become the entry point for Federal investment."
2000.99-1792,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1408.171,1411.453,The infusion would be a loan type--
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1411.453,1416.776,"--It would be a loan, and if you look at the statute, it's a subordinated loan."
2000.99-1792,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1421.699,1422.721,--It's still not up--
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1422.721,1437.911,"It's still not equity, I would agree, but if you... I mean, if you were trying to value the debt versus the equity and compare their security and their claims on the assets, I think you would find that there very little distinction."
2000.99-1792,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1437.911,1442.152,"--You only tax the income earned equity, don't you?"
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1447.668,1455.652,"The income goes... the income of the bank is used for four purposes, and these are provided in the statute."
2000.99-1792,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1502.673,1518.173,"No, but I mean, my point is simply, if I own your bank... you might be very nice... I would expect the State to tax the income, but if the Government owns the bank, probably it wouldn't, and that's what the statute seemed to say."
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1530.79,1532.583,"But it's not the bank's income, either."
2000.99-1792,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1532.583,1533.274,Whose is it?
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1533.274,1535.124,It is the members' income.
2000.99-1792,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1535.124,1535.355,All right.
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1535.355,1537.585,That's the very nature of a cooperative.
2000.99-1792,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1539.756,1541.219,What was the fourth purpose?
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1543.432,1564.844,"--The fourth would be, and this is because we are a cooperative, would be a distribution to our member borrowers according to the business they did with the bank, not according to their capital, and as this Court pointed out in Kiowa County, the purpose for that distribution is not a purpose to return an investment to the borrower."
2000.99-1792,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1575.182,1586.63,"--If your client had never been financed by the Federal Government, the fact that it had those priorities for distribution wouldn't entitle it to any sort of a tax exemption, would it?"
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1586.63,1594.237,"No, but I think they make the point that the bank itself is not a for profit entity."
2000.99-1792,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1596.226,1599.478,Why does that bear on its tax immunity?
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1599.478,1606.204,"Well, it bears on why Congress would give the bank a designation as a federally chartered instrumentality of the United States."
2000.99-1792,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1619.723,1631.281,"All right, but the lowest possible cost argument would not have washed before the '85 amendment, because before the '85 amendment it was very... as I understand the statute it was very explicit."
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1644.768,1645.119,Right.
2000.99-1792,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1645.119,1651.464,"And once the United States dropped out, we didn't care whether it made the loans more expensive."
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1663.892,1666.445,"Well, I don't think Congress was any less sensitive."
2000.99-1792,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1731.578,1740.604,"Okay, but Congress was saying before 1985, as long as we are an owner, our interest comes before the State interest."
2000.99-1792,2,39519,richard_a_hanson,,1740.604,1741.263,Yes.
2000.99-1792,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1741.263,1743.594,That isn't necessarily a cheap loan policy.
2000.99-1792,3,31466,james_r_layton,,2987.223,3006.504,"I'll note first that I believe that the banks for cooperatives were subject to Federal income tax prior to 1985, but I'd also note the franchise tax that counsel referred to."
2000.99-1792,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3116.878,3125.292,"Mr. Frederick, what is the effect of Congress' calling an institution a Federal instrumentality?"
2000.99-1792,3,31466,james_r_layton,,3131.867,3132.217,--Well--
2000.99-1792,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3132.217,3134.298,What other effect does it have?
2000.99-1792,3,31466,james_r_layton,,3140.974,3149.408,--I think one reason is to ensure that that entity... in the tax context one reason is to ensure that that entity cannot be subjected to discriminatory taxation.
2000.99-1792,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3331.439,3332.53,"Thank you, Mr. Layton."
