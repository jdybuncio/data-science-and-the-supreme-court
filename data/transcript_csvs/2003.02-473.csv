2003.02-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.763,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-473, the United States v. LaShawn Lowell Banks."
2003.02-473,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,8.878,14.079,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-473,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,70.057,74.719,Did the court here say that these were the only... the only four factors?
2003.02-473,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,74.719,76.288,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-473,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,133.213,136.762,And... and it says that... that those factors are not exclusive.
2003.02-473,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,139.613,140.017,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-473,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,206.774,208.632,Doesn't... excuse me.
2003.02-473,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,208.632,209.169,Go ahead.
2003.02-473,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,209.169,209.475,"No, please."
2003.02-473,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,209.475,214.659,I just had this... I was just curious about one aspect of property damage and so forth.
2003.02-473,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,218.674,239.274,"Well, Your Honor, there is... there is a statute that Congress has enacted and that is 31 U.S.C. 3724, and that authorizes the Attorney General to pay out sums of money up to, I believe, $50,000 to pay for any damage to property that may result from law enforcement activities."
2003.02-473,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,265.214,266.29,I see.
2003.02-473,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,266.29,267.072,--for any property that is damaged.
2003.02-473,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,275.245,276.814,"Of course, that would have... that would not apply."
2003.02-473,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,279.869,280.695,"This was a joint search, Your Honor."
2003.02-473,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,304.927,305.382,--I see.
2003.02-473,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,305.382,313.555,Do they pay the claim if... if in fact the... the person is arrested and is there and is... and does have marijuana?
2003.02-473,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,313.555,314.958,Your Honor--
2003.02-473,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.958,317.52,Do... do you pay only if you're... do you get paid only if you're innocent?
2003.02-473,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,317.52,318.596,"--It... it depends, Your Honor."
2003.02-473,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,343.033,343.505,Well--
2003.02-473,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,343.505,345.512,"And even when there's not, they often do as well."
2003.02-473,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,345.512,353.89,"--Well, this is a background issue, and... and I don't mean to take you away from talking about the Ninth Circuit's case in response to Justice Scalia's question."
2003.02-473,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,353.89,358.348,"Mr. Salmons, may I ask you one question on... on your timing point?"
2003.02-473,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,418.413,440.787,"We submit, no, Your Honor, and for the following reason, that in... typically the... the standard would... that would be applied in this kind of a context would be whether the officers had waited sufficiently long so that they could reasonably conclude that there was a constructive denial of admittance or that, as you indicate, other law enforcement... excuse me... other law enforcement concerns may justify a more prompt entry."
2003.02-473,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,461.675,467.082,But when... when you're dealing... let's... let's take the case in which the exigency develops while you're waiting.
2003.02-473,0,21494,david_b_salmons,,512.119,516.866,"I mean, I think the distinction Your Honor makes between those types of cases is a legitimate one."
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,1670.108,1675.93,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court:"
2003.02-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1739.748,1745.321,"Well, now, wasn't Ramirez a no-knock entry where the door--"
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,1745.321,1745.504,--That's true.
2003.02-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1745.504,1746.601,--was bashed in?
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,1746.601,1747.428,That's true.
2003.02-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1749.08,1752.962,And this Court said that could comply with the Fourth Amendment?
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,1752.962,1753.622,--Yes.
2003.02-473,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1773.767,1776.534,But we didn't apply the statute literally there.
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,1776.534,1777.732,--No.
2003.02-473,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1786.853,1799.28,"Ramirez was a break-in... a... an entry into not the house of the person who was... who was sought, but someone else's house where he was thought to be staying."
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,1803.86,1806.544,"Well, he wasn't concededly--"
2003.02-473,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.544,1809.061,"Well, he had a... he was a felon in possession they found."
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,1809.061,1809.97,--That is correct.
2003.02-473,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1822.064,1835.605,"One thing I thought that the Ninth Circuit opinion really was contrary to Ramirez was its stress on property damage, which... which Ramirez made quite clear was not determinative."
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,1835.605,1853.605,"Well, I think that the circuit, Ninth Circuit, has focused on property damage as, you know, we have a statute that talks about breaking, and it sees that in... in the context of delay as requiring more time."
2003.02-473,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1853.605,1862.204,"Well, we also have an opinion, e.g., Ramirez, which the Ninth Circuit didn't even cite, which says that property damage is not controlling."
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,1862.204,1866.441,"Well, and that's true and I... I concede that is so."
2003.02-473,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1896.079,1900.826,"When you say it's wrong, well, the argument the other way is what they said."
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,1955.235,1962.832,"Well, the response would be that, yes, the modern marvel of indoor plumbing does provide an avenue for the destruction of evidence."
2003.02-473,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1974.554,1988.029,"So your view is the Fourth Amendment then says even though you have a warrant, probable cause for believing there are drugs there, and it's easy to get rid of them, there's just nothing the police can do about it except not prosecute the drug cases in these situations."
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,1988.029,1992.015,--15 seconds is a... is virtually no time at all to respond to a door.
2003.02-473,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1992.015,1992.653,Why is--
2003.02-473,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.653,1993.751,--What does the shower have to do with it?
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,1999.983,2002.955,"No, but that's the kind of--"
2003.02-473,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2002.955,2004.441,"Well, then... then of what relevance is the shower?"
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,2004.441,2005.556,--The relevance--
2003.02-473,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.556,2007.292,It seems to me it's of no relevance at all.
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,2014.229,2014.701,--I agree.
2003.02-473,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.701,2017.406,And presumably dry himself and presumably put on a towel.
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,2017.406,2019.197,Grab a towel.
2003.02-473,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.604,2032.888,We don't know and we don't care because that surely does not determine what's a reasonable time to wait.
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,2032.888,2033.26,--Right.
2003.02-473,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2057.37,2057.741,"First, just a quibble."
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,2123.416,2134.069,"All of the cases that were cited in the briefs I tried to distinguish as having differences that were fundamental to the case, the sole occupant, for instance, they know--"
2003.02-473,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2134.069,2137.988,"Well, why don't we take the Ninth Circuit's own subsequent case where it has a footnote?"
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,2141.665,2142.741,"--Right, Your Honor."
2003.02-473,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.741,2146.866,"--where the court said, Banks appears to be a departure from our prior decisions."
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,2155.001,2173.41,"I think that the court in Chavez-Miranda focused on the fact there were numerous occupants in the... in the residence and that even if... if one or two were engaged in some kind of private activity, the others would be able to respond quickly to the door."
2003.02-473,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2173.41,2185.632,"But why is... isn't 15 to 20 seconds ample, if the question is reasonable time, in a small apartment to get to the door to open it?"
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,2185.632,2189.097,It's not reasonable because it's virtually no time at all.
2003.02-473,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2192.978,2200.243,It's the time... it is the time in which a telephone would ring at least twice and perhaps three times.
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,2214.982,2224.27,"--Well, there are plenty of times that you may be home and you don't get to the phone in time because you're engaged in some activity that... that prevents you from immediately responding."
2003.02-473,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2227.779,2244.126,"No, but isn't... isn't the problem that... that Justice Ginsburg is asking you about what is a reasonable time, and your answers always get to the point of saying, well, there are particular facts that might have taken somebody longer than a reasonable time."
2003.02-473,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2244.126,2246.932,"And... and that, of course, is always true."
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,2264.726,2269.889,--I believe that we cannot simply measure the... the test from the eyes of the officer.
2003.02-473,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2271.042,2273.642,"Well, they're the ones who have to decide how long to wait."
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,2273.642,2275.583,"--Right, and they... what did they know?"
2003.02-473,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2280.459,2280.713,"Yes, but--"
2003.02-473,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2280.713,2285.781,"--They... they knew they were dealing with drugs, that the warrant was to search for drugs."
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,2285.781,2291.37,"--They knew that they were searching for drugs, yes, and not grand pianos."
2003.02-473,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2304.069,2317.981,"You don't get rid of it, but as I suggested to Mr. Salmons, maybe there isn't this dichotomy between exigent and nonexigent, but that it's not exigent enough to avoid knock and announce altogether."
2003.02-473,1,40369,randall_j_roske,,2323.016,2340.372,"Well, if you look at the appendix, joint appendix, at page 75, and see what the officer said about why he entered, he simply said that he thought that 15 seconds was reasonable and that this case might go Federal and they've heard about problems with this."
2003.02-473,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2353.004,2355.233,Let me... let me talk about the small apartment.
2003.02-473,2,21494,david_b_salmons,,3315.456,3316.282,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-473,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.74,3328.17,I have a question just with regard to your opposing counsel's last assertion.
2003.02-473,2,21494,david_b_salmons,,3338.08,3352.569,"Well, Your Honor, what I do know is that as this Court indicated in its decision in Wilson where it incorporated the common law tradition into the Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness, that the standard at common law was a flexible one."
2003.02-473,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3373.662,3378.742,But you don't disagree with the fact that the... or the... the claim that the statute does apply?
2003.02-473,2,21494,david_b_salmons,,3380.971,3381.918,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-473,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3384.519,3386.831,"Thank you, Mr. Salmons."
