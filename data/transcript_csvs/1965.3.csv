1965.3,0,28815,john_j_abt,,14.887,17.063,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1965.3,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,2724.837,2728.819,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.3,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3053.817,3065.573,"Well, Mr. Maroney, at page 25 in your brief, you say we do -- excuse me."
1965.3,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,3076.309,3076.532,That's correct.
1965.3,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3076.532,3090.174,"Now, is it or isn't -- is it or is it not the Government's position that 4 (f) as enacted is an -- is an effect of immunity provision."
1965.3,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,3090.174,3108.872,"No, sir, not -- not in the sense of the normal immunity statute such as that involved for example in the Olman case where -- where the Congress legislates that a person cannot be prosecuted for -- or in connection with any offense concerning which he is compelled to testify."

1965.3,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,3118.584,3133.253,"Our position here is that Congress has provided, effectively provided, that the fact of registration cannot be used in evidence in any criminal prosecution against a registrant."
1965.3,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3197.485,3215.854,"Well, as I understand it -- as I understand what you've come down to then is not an argument that there is an effect of immunity provision here with an argument to the effect that the act of registration is meaningless."
1965.3,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,3215.854,3224.745,"Not meaningless, Your Honor, but that it -- it -- it cannot put them in any danger in view of the circumstances -- in view of Section 4 (f) and the Board proceeding, which has preceded this requirement that they're register."
