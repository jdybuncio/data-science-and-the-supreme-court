2011.10-1016,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.135,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1016, Coleman v. The Court of Appeals of Maryland."
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,9.511,13.103,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1016,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,88.164,110.096,"Well, Mr. Foreman, I -- I guess the question in this case is what this particular statutory provision has to do with gender discrimination and the history of gender discrimination: Whether Congress was aiming to eradicate gender discrimination through this provision, or whether it was trying to do something else entirely."
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,110.096,120.714,--And -- and it was directly attempting to address these gender-based stereotypes in a couple different ways as a practical matter.
2011.10-1016,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,180.724,182.471,"Where -- where are you reading from, counsel?"
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,182.471,190.157,"--I am reading from appendix A to the brief, and it is -- that"
2011.10-1016,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,234.779,260.472,"Well, following up on Justice Kagan's question, I have -- I have difficulty seeing how providing 12 weeks of leave for self-care for both men and women affects the incentive of an employer who we will assume has an inclination to discriminate against women based on the possibility that a -- a woman applicant for employment may become pregnant."
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,268.03,286.945,"--The rationale of Congress at that point was that they could address this issue several different ways; they -- and they passed (A), (B), and (C): The birth of the child, the adoption of the child, and the Family and Medical Leave Act, against -- again, addressing gender-based stereotypes."
2011.10-1016,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,286.945,288.615,"Well, (A) is not at issue, right?"
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,335.857,340.248,But one of the things Congress tried to do is to take that incentive away.
2011.10-1016,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,340.248,341.418,But how does it do that?
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,350.07,358.766,It affects the incentive by providing -- it becomes the equal opportunity employer.
2011.10-1016,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,383.914,386.566,"But women don't get sick less often than men, do they?"
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,386.566,387.034,"No, absolutely."
2011.10-1016,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,387.034,393.905,So you're just adding something to both sides of the balance and it doesn't affect the employer's incentive.
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,408.274,416.709,"But under (A), (B), and (C) after the Family and Medical Leave, an employer would look and say both men can take leave now."
2011.10-1016,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,419.174,423.175,"And that's why (A), (B), and (C) go to the problem, but what does (D) have to do with it?"
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,436.356,445.617,--There's nothing in the record that demonstrates that there's a differential rate between the self-care rate for men and women.
2011.10-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.129,533.921,"Mr. Foreman, I think everyone has been trying to get you to focus on the health care sickness leave alone, and in the -- in the portions of the act that this Court upheld, the Congress said there is this close association of women with children; we think it's going to be good for everybody if fathers recognize their responsibility for elderly parents, sick children, sick spouse."
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,580.31,602.378,"--I think it is the same linkage trying to address -- it's addressing a difference there, but it's addressing the linkage that women will in fact take pregnancy-based leave or pregnancy-based disabilities and therefore are less attractive, less -- employed; and that is what self-care was intended to do."
2011.10-1016,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,602.378,603.926,So you are saying -- let me just make sure I understand.
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,626.432,628.865,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2011.10-1016,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,686.687,689.779,Do you have any evidence that Congress in fact was thinking about either of these two things?
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,694.607,698.604,"Yes, there -- there is, Your Honor."
2011.10-1016,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,793.791,814.427,"Counselor, I -- I take your argument, but if you look at the legislative record, the reports, the findings, et cetera, and the statements repeatedly by many congresspeople, there appears to be -- have been a dual motive for this provision."
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,867.499,879.775,"Justice Sotomayor, I -- I think the way you judge it is rely on what Congress's expressed findings and provisions are."
2011.10-1016,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,951.183,953.354,"Well, with respect to the Commerce Clause, could I ask you this."
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,973.987,996.585,"Justice Alito, I think what you're -- you'll clearly correct me if I am wrong, but I think what you are responding to, is there an Ex parte Young action here that would be able to be made consistent with the Commerce Clause, under the Commerce Clause?"
2011.10-1016,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1015.502,1023.952,"Here the district court completely dismissed your FMLA claim, not just insofar as you sought damages."
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1030.761,1031.588,--That's right.
2011.10-1016,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1031.588,1032.742,"But you are not contesting that, are you?"
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1032.742,1039.742,We are not contesting it consistent with any Ex parte Young claim.
2011.10-1016,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1063.091,1064.074,Because this is for money damages.
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1064.074,1064.667,--Pardon?
2011.10-1016,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1064.667,1066.044,Because this is for money damages.
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1073.695,1074.634,Correct.
2011.10-1016,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1074.634,1075.445,And it's not Ex parte Young.
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1075.445,1076.365,Correct.
2011.10-1016,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1108.478,1110.12,You said in this case.
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1131.625,1142.591,"--I think you would have to make that accommodation, but, with respect, Your Honor, I think that would be an incorrect approach."
2011.10-1016,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1147.603,1149.852,I am trying to be a little bit helpful to you.
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1149.852,1154.836,--And apparently I missed that and I apologize.
2011.10-1016,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1154.836,1155.163,Okay.
2011.10-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1155.163,1157.191,What relief did you ask for?
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1166.284,1172.874,"In the complaint itself, it does not ask for injunctive relief pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act."
2011.10-1016,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1174.294,1179.964,"I thought you did, but maybe I'm reading your complaint more generously than you read it yourself."
2011.10-1016,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1179.964,1183.93,I would go with Justice Alito here.
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1183.93,1188.149,"--If that is your reading of it, we will certainly accept your reading."
2011.10-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1188.149,1191.975,You must have asked for such other and further relief.
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1191.975,1217.902,"But again back to the Ex parte Young, in the case Nelson v. The University of Tennessee -- Texas, the case that dealt exactly with this issue of abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity, and they found that there was valid abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment immunity, the State of Texas -- then the court was required to address the Ex parte Young issue."
2011.10-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1249.998,1256.558,"Well, Congress must have thought that giving the woman back her job was an important part."
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1268.366,1274.173,"It is extremely important, but Congress did not stop there."
2011.10-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1352.174,1352.736,When you--
2011.10-1016,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1352.736,1353.972,Can I -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1353.972,1378.32,"--When you say you're concerned about a disincentive to hire women, but the Pregnancy Discrimination Act makes that unlawful, so if an employer decides I don't want to hire women of child-bearing age, that is an out-and-out violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, isn't it?"
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1378.32,1385.612,"That is, Your Honor, but the Pregnancy Discrimination Act did not fill the other gap which the Family and Medical--"
2011.10-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1385.612,1391.408,"But you are relying on the incentive, the disincentive to hire women of child-bearing age."
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1405.918,1415.962,--What the Pregnancy Discrimination Act provided was that you needed to treat pregnancy-related disabilities as you would other short-term disabilities.
2011.10-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1419.522,1428.348,"I'm just asking you about -- your -- your argument rests on an employer acting unlawfully, you see."
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1455.429,1460.974,--I don't want to make that assumption in my incentive argument.
2011.10-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1472.376,1487.308,But your argument to a large extent depends -- or you say Congress did this because they wanted to eliminate or at least reduce one kind of discrimination against women in the job market.
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1487.308,1490.619,Yes.
2011.10-1016,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1490.619,1497.832,And that -- that discrimination was refusing to hire women of child-bearing age.
2011.10-1016,0,35782,michael_l_foreman,,1518.216,1523.917,I -- I don't think that was Congress's intent.
2011.10-1016,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1572.267,1573.129,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,1582.296,1586.06,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1016,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1600.421,1601.502,Need go no further?
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,1602.157,1604.843,"--I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-1016,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1644.595,1645.968,"If I could just stop you there, Mr. Howard, for a second."
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,1688.952,1701.975,"--Congress, Justice Kagan, did not I think take that stereotype or perception that Mr. Foreman referred to into account."
2011.10-1016,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1735.041,1758.593,"But, there certainly was -- there was certainly much conversation and testimony that, whether they in fact took the same amount of leave time or not, that women who were pregnant or were perceived as capable of getting pregnant were hired less frequently because subjectively the employers thought that they were more likely to take the time."
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,1792.721,1798.095,"--Well, I would make a couple of points in response to that, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-1016,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1888.135,1896.461,They couldn't -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act says you have to treat pregnancy like any other disability.
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,1937.335,1942.959,"Yes, I agree, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-1016,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1975.597,2004.228,"Assume for the sake of argument that for the applicants for particular provisions -- particular positions, I should say -- where the applicants are typically of a certain age, men tend to take less sick leave than women, because women also take sick leave for pregnancy-related illnesses."
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2034.683,2047.317,"--Justice Alito, I think that one could argue that that is connected with eliminating pregnancy disability discrimination."
2011.10-1016,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2075.272,2085.817,"Well, I don't think -- I have difficulty with the incentives argument either, honestly, either as the (D) or as to (C)."
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2109.507,2114.428,"Yes, Justice Alito, and I think what--"
2011.10-1016,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2114.428,2117.223,"What would the answer to that be, that that's not intentional discrimination?"
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2117.223,2133.048,"--That would certainly be part of the answer, and what I was going to say was that what you are describing is a disproportionate impact on women as a result of assumptions concerning pregnancy disability."
2011.10-1016,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2146.244,2148.791,Why are you separating the four things.
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2253.688,2254.675,--10.
2011.10-1016,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2254.675,2255.128,10.
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2257.579,2258.297,I like these questions.
2011.10-1016,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.297,2258.827,Perfect.
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2333.513,2341.728,"Well, let me speak first to the second one, the concern about the gap."
2011.10-1016,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2375.655,2378.949,The idea is it's part of one package.
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2442.406,2460.663,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think you can separate (D), on the same analysis that this Court applied in Tennessee v. Lane, in contrast to the Garrett case."
2011.10-1016,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2500.976,2502.726,"Well, it doesn't have to, of course."
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2592.299,2606.185,"Well, with respect to the ratio, I think the premise of that point is that women will take more leave for serious health conditions than men."
2011.10-1016,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2616.695,2639.327,"Well, what if Congress had added three additional subsections here, and said that an employer has to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that an employee can go to a health spa; 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that the employee can travel; 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that the employee can take an educational course."
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2667.548,2685.185,"I think even if one accepted the premise, and we don't, that women take more leave for health conditions, that would further dilute the ratio, to have available all those types of leave."
2011.10-1016,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2688.356,2691.932,I thought Justice Alito was trying to help you.
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2691.932,2693.351,--He was.
2011.10-1016,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2693.351,2696.397,He's absolutely right.
2011.10-1016,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2725.822,2731.254,I'm working from a different proposition than you are in response to this question.
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2752.543,2786.172,"I, I think that if -- even if that were correct, and, and I don't think it is, because I think the overwhelming themes in the legislative record as a whole really were a concern for working families, whether single-income, double-income, and the concern that if a breadwinner falls ill the family's going to have severe financial insecurity."
2011.10-1016,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2858.328,2862.859,"Well, if the State of Maryland thinks this is good social policy, why is it asserting its sovereign immunity?"
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2862.859,2873.653,"--Well, that's a good question, and I think we are here mainly on, we need to defend this on principle."
2011.10-1016,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2884.225,2884.911,You can waive.
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2887.738,2889.926,"--We could, I believe."
2011.10-1016,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2892.534,2896.079,"Well, you can provide this, the kind of relief that's sought here without waiving your immunity, right?"
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2898.984,2900.282,"--Yes, I think that's right, and there--"
2011.10-1016,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2900.282,2906.794,Can I just get back to the discussion before about how (D) relates to the others?
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2906.794,2907.216,--Yes.
2011.10-1016,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2907.216,2910.901,"Who do you think benefits most from subsection (E), men or women?"
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2917.697,2941.388,"I assume, and I haven't studied the history of that, but I assume that, just based on the demographics of -- of the military, it's like -- likely that there are more men in -- in service deployed, and that more women and wives benefit from that provision."
2011.10-1016,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2941.388,2945.403,"Was that -- that wasn't part of the original act, was it?"
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2945.403,2946.215,"No, it was not."
2011.10-1016,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2946.215,2950.559,So it was -- that was -- the concern was a discrete concern for veterans.
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2950.559,2952.322,Yes.
2011.10-1016,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2953.729,2957.118,It wasn't part of the package that was the Family and Medical Leave Act.
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,2957.118,2957.554,--No.
2011.10-1016,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2964.815,2986.933,"And -- and Mr. Howard, I -- I do think that the point about the package is that if you look at (D) alone, you abstract it from everything else, you have a good point, that it seems to be related to economic security, which is not a section 5 issue; that it seems to be related to discrimination against sick people, which would also put us in a different legal universe."
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,3032.585,3069.119,"Well, I -- I would respond in part -- and I'm going to accept your proposition that I should discuss these provisions as part of a single package -- but from the standpoint of States, subsection (D) provides a separate claim, a separate basis to sue States, and we think that claim is incongruent and disproportionate to any conceivable unconstitutional conduct that it might prohibit."
2011.10-1016,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3180.774,3202.701,"There's some focus in the legislative history particularly on the -- the family that has a single parent -- much more often a woman, not a man -- and the devastating impact on that family of the woman getting sick, the sole breadwinner getting sick."
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,3229.927,3231.112,Yes.
2011.10-1016,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3244.215,3245.108,The legislative record here?
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,3245.108,3245.763,--Yes.
2011.10-1016,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3253.73,3257.759,Is that a closed record?
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,3263.273,3269.114,--I -- I am not sure I understand the question.
2011.10-1016,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3269.114,3277.907,"I just find it a strange expression to talk about ""in the record"", when what you're talking about is the legislative history."
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,3277.907,3279.405,I misspoke.
2011.10-1016,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3318.485,3334.571,"But the question of how Congress would do it if they -- if they provided only for the woman who was the single head of the family, then that would be vulnerable under Equal Protection because they didn't provide it for men."
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,3334.571,3348.815,"I think one would need to find, as this Court's cases have emphasized, a widespread pattern of unconstitutional conduct on -- in the part of States."
2011.10-1016,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3360.436,3362.823,But (D) is a remedy for the problem.
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,3369.526,3370.743,--Yes.
2011.10-1016,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3370.743,3374.381,And then the question is how do we remedy that?
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,3374.381,3386.064,"Well, I -- I don't think by providing the very sweeping remedy of (D), which -- I see that my light's on."
2011.10-1016,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3386.439,3387.581,You can finish your sentence.
2011.10-1016,1,30682,john_b_howard_jr,,3387.581,3402.699,"--We think that the remedy in (D) may cover the types of concerns you referred to, but I -- I would emphasize this is a disproportionate incongruent remedy."
2011.10-1016,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3412.693,3413.333,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1016,2,35782,michael_l_foreman,,3417.1,3420.535,This is not responsive to disability-based discrimination.
2011.10-1016,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3494.832,3496.158,Do you think it would be--
2011.10-1016,2,35782,michael_l_foreman,,3496.158,3497.676,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-1016,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3497.676,3502.706,--Do you think it would be -- how -- how would this case come out if we were dealing with -- with from subsection (E)?
2011.10-1016,2,35782,michael_l_foreman,,3506.844,3524.196,"Yes, it should, because it was passed pursuant to a different constitutional power, and they provided in fact a different remedy, recognizing that the Commerce Clause could not -- that Commerce Clause was the appropriate way to deal with this."
2011.10-1016,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3530.568,3544.033,"If -- if we think that you should look at these provisions separately, where with respect to (D) -- and I'm looking at one of our prior precedents -- has Congress unequivocally declared its intent to abrogate sovereign immunity?"
2011.10-1016,2,35782,michael_l_foreman,,3544.033,3544.891,As to--
2011.10-1016,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3544.891,3547.016,--unequivocally.
2011.10-1016,2,35782,michael_l_foreman,,3558.792,3562.025,"--Well, I -- I think it -- yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1016,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3604.334,3614.61,"Well, but your -- your -- the answer you gave to my request depends entirely on the conclusion that (D) is linked to (A), (B), and (C)."
2011.10-1016,2,35782,michael_l_foreman,,3624.203,3626.683,"But you do, Your Honor."
2011.10-1016,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3658.359,3659.704,"Thank you, counsel."
