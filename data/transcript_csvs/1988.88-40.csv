1988.88-40,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.857,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-40, United States against Frank Zolin."
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,9.794,15.838,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-40,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.128,147.284,Mr. Horowitz--
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,162.841,175.351,"Well, we recognize, Justice O'Connor, that this particular restriction that was entered in this case is a narrow one and it's fairly benign, in fact, because the government didn't plan to turn over any information, to the Justice Department."
1988.88-40,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.351,177.631,"Yes, So the IRS wasn't hindered at all by that--"
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,177.631,177.99,The probabilities were--
1988.88-40,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.99,178.35,--as far as I can see it.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,178.35,182.896,--that on the facts of this case... so it would never have occasion to go to the court and nothing would happen.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,200.904,203.668,"Mr. Horowitz, let me interrupt you too."
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,223.41,230.345,"Well, you're hypothesizing that the district court in fact finds that there's legitimate purpose for the summons--"
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,230.345,230.923,It comes down to--
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,230.923,231.329,--that's being issued?
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,231.329,233.953,"--He says, I'm willing to conclude... I've got some doubts in this case."
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,247.776,248.651,Well--
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,248.651,250.917,"Would you... You'd make exactly the same argument, wouldn't you?"
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,250.917,252.414,"--Well, that's a somewhat different case."
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,256.491,257.865,But would you be--
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,257.865,258.49,--the district court's--
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,258.49,261.442,"--Are you better off putting the judge to the absolute choice of saying, Well, I've got enough doubt."
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,262.942,264.504,"--Well, I don't know if--"
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,264.504,264.847,Wouldn't you--
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,264.847,266.05,--We're better off in a particular case.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,285.964,286.667,"--Well, I understand--"
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,286.667,290.181,--monitoring of the investigation and obviously our view was--
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,290.181,290.446,--I understand that you're--
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,290.446,292.118,--that on balance we're better off.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.118,292.274,--argument.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,296.475,296.803,"Well, I--"
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,296.803,298.069,--in that case it doesn't really make much difference.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,298.069,309.298,"--Well, I stress it, I think, because Respondent in their brief has gone on and on about the evidence that was placed before the district court and so I'm suggesting that the district court in fact made such a finding."
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.314,314.889,"Well, but let's assume there are some cases out there where the judge might thing there's... you know, it's a close case."
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,315.483,315.905,--Well--
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,315.905,317.873,--in all close cases just simply rule against the government.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,317.873,321.528,"--I mean, a close case in what sense?"
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,322.778,334.913,"Well, he thinks there is some reason to believe that one government attorney is concerned about the civil action pending in another court and he just isn't a hundred percent sure that there is complete good faith in that sense."
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,339.926,345.814,"--Well, it's our position that... that he needs to make a determination at the time the summons is issued and not to keep--"
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,345.814,346.033,"Well, I--"
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,346.033,346.408,--keep--
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,346.408,346.799,"--Well, how does--"
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,346.799,347.893,--I think if you look--
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,347.893,348.096,--that hurt you?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,349.299,365.87,"--Well, because... because this idea... I was going to quote what the... in response to Justice O'Connor what the court of appeals actually held here, which is that the district court's order in this case created a mechanism whereby the district court court monitor the IRS' use of the summoned documents."
1988.88-40,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,386.752,392.328,I suppose one could ask rhetorically what harm would an injunction do against a person who claims he's going to obey the law anyway?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,392.328,392.875,--Well--
1988.88-40,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,392.875,398.857,"But, still, you're entitled to object to an injunction unless the showings made by law required for injunction are made."
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,398.857,400.418,"--Well, that's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,511.654,519.34,"Mr. Horowitz, in a grand jury context do you think the trial judge would have the authority to condition enforcement of a grand jury's subpoena on some kind of protective order?"
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,523.339,523.558,--Well--
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.558,525.697,--to the government that there are limits on what you can do with the material?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,525.697,531.991,"--I think that if you're talking about a protective order, say... let's say trade secrets which is the example you gave--"
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.991,532.21,But any kind.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,539.974,541.488,"--Well, when we say no limits."
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.469,546.86,Right.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,546.86,547.782,And that's what the district court looks at.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,547.782,549.671,"And there are restrictions on grand jury material, too."
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,549.671,549.921,Yeah.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.421,552.655,Right.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,552.655,553.733,--that's not authorized by Congress.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,561.979,570.069,"Well, he... whatever the protection is... there are cases where judges have imposed additional restrictions on responses to grand jury subpoenas."
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,573.6,574.209,--Well--
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,574.209,578.318,"Because there's no statutory... you know, program for them as there is... when there is another--"
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,578.318,587.938,"--There is a difference between a restriction and enforcing a summons, and a restriction in which the court retains jurisdiction to keep considering whether the IRS is acting properly."
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,602.744,602.932,--Right.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,607.134,608.601,--That's right.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,608.601,609.07,--Either yes or no.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,609.07,612.569,"I mean, the judge's role ends at the time he makes... he makes a decision--"
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,612.569,612.819,Yes.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,612.819,614.942,--on whether the summons should be enforced in a particular respect.
1988.88-40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,642.135,653.866,"Well, what if the... what if the taxpayer being investigated finds out that the government isn't living up to the rules and they exchange information, or that people who have no business knowing it are seeing it?"
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,656.287,658.02,"No, he's not supposed to go back to the judge."
1988.88-40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,660.737,661.597,Go to a new judge?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,661.597,669.126,"Go to a new judge, He's... in that case, he's claiming that there's been a violation of Section 6103 and he's got remedies for that."
1988.88-40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.126,673.047,Then the court has a role in monitoring the IRS' performance?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,673.047,673.561,No.
1988.88-40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.417,683.369,But a judge is going to decide that case.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,683.369,690.211,"A judge is going to decide it, but a judge... that is an independent action in which the... the agents involved may or may not have to pay damages."
1988.88-40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,695.74,698.395,But how about getting an order to stop doing what you're doing?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,698.395,703.455,"--Well, then he would have to go through the usual hoops of getting injunctive relief."
1988.88-40,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.455,703.72,Okay.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,703.72,708.423,In this case I'm not sure he could get it because of the Tax Anti-injunction Acts.
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,721.715,730.382,What about the judge saying the IRS can get this information on the provision that they let no one else see it?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,732.069,738.394,"--I think, Justice Marshall, that would absolutely be erroneous for the court to do that."
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,738.394,738.769,Would be what?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,738.769,741.409,The court does not have the power to do that.
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,744.876,747.251,So... so it's all right for the IRS to give it to the newspapers?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,747.251,749.766,--It's not all right for the IRS to give it to the newspapers because Congress--
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,749.766,750.063,"Well, suppose--"
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,750.063,751.859,--has provided that it does not.
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,751.859,756.153,--that the court says IRS shouldn't get this but you shall not release it to the newspapers?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,756.153,760.292,"Well, that's essentially what we have in this case, the same kind of order."
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,761.151,761.995,And you say that's wrong?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,761.995,762.385,--That's right.
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,769.538,773.91,Does the IRS have the right to turn over confidential material to the newspapers?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,774.77,775.035,--No.
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,784.11,793.263,I don't see why a court doesn't have a right to control its own orders rather than to have the IRS control the court's discretion.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,793.263,794.341,--Well--
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,794.341,795.762,Do you understand what I mean?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,795.762,797.636,--I understand what you're saying.
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,811.428,817.144,What is a procedure to stop the IRS from giving this information to the Justice Department?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,817.144,827.78,"--The procedure is the procedures provided for enforcing Section 6103, which is largely at Section 7431, Damage Action."
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,827.78,830.216,Damage action?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,830.216,830.544,Yes.
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,830.544,831.95,Have you ever seen one of those?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,831.95,832.638,"Yes, I have."
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,832.638,833.95,You're sure?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,833.95,835.872,In the Barrett case that's pending in this Court there is one.
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,835.872,838.355,You've seen one?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,838.355,840.166,"I've seen several of them, actually."
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,846.898,847.147,Do you--
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,847.147,847.849,--chose to enforce--
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,847.849,848.849,--I thought I hadn't seen one I--
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,848.849,853.192,"--Well, we've been trying to spare the Supreme Court from this--"
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,853.192,855.378,--I was in another position; I didn't see it either.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,855.378,859.767,"--The statute, I think, was enacted in 1976."
1988.88-40,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,923.93,926.522,Are you aware of cases in which enforcement has been denied?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,926.522,929.02,--Enforcement of IRS summons?
1988.88-40,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,929.02,929.301,Yes.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,929.301,929.801,Yes.
1988.88-40,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.627,938.329,"But you don't advertise them a lot, right?"
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,939.578,951.823,--I think I'd like to mention one other policy point that's involved here in addition to the delay that can occur.
1988.88-40,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1126.441,1129.002,"Mr. Horowitz, can I... do I understand your position correctly?"
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1145.277,1147.634,"--Well, let me say two things, Justice Scalia."
1988.88-40,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1151.571,1152.054,Right.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1152.054,1154.804,--the nonindependent evidence from these other sources I just mentioned.
1988.88-40,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.804,1155.007,Right.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1155.007,1160.146,"In that case, we recognize that the district court has discretion to deny in camera review."
1988.88-40,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1178.699,1179.981,"Well, that's... that's comforting."
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1183.011,1186.182,I guess I'm not.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1204.128,1205.612,"Well, that may be true."
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1223.041,1226.524,"Well, I'm not sure how to answer that, Justice Stevens."
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.365,1236.928,"So, basically as a practical matter the question is how much evidence--"
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1236.928,1237.238,--Yes.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1237.238,1237.863,--does the government need.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1237.863,1238.223,Yes.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1241.05,1241.315,And what--
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1241.315,1242.487,--In the discretion of the court.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1242.487,1242.706,--And what is your position?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1249.187,1249.625,Yes.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1251.672,1252.935,Then how do we define--
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1252.935,1253.45,--don't really know where to draw the line.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1253.872,1254.075,--And that's the question.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1255.341,1256.902,"--Well, I don't know."
1988.88-40,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.902,1258.262,"But not as a legal matter, just as you still keep on saying."
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1259.809,1260.995,"Well, I'm willing to say--"
1988.88-40,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.995,1261.542,You still won't concede--
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1261.542,1261.948,--they need something.
1988.88-40,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.555,1268.009,--Have you noticed that--
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1268.009,1274.613,--would probably be mistaken in looking at documents with no reason to suspect crime or fraud other than the government begging them to look at them.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.832,1276.067,--And your position is--
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1276.067,1280.034,--But I don't know how to draw the line exactly and it's not an issue in this case.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1280.034,1280.705,--I see.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1289.326,1290.123,"Though, in this case--"
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.123,1290.748,That's basically what--
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1290.748,1294.231,"--As I said, in this case we didn't even... we're not really... well, we did ask for in camera review if the court--"
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.231,1294.653,--Yes.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1294.653,1296.808,--in fact wasn't persuaded by what we submitted.
1988.88-40,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1306.211,1306.492,Yes.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1306.492,1307.601,--this is in probative of--
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1307.601,1312.536,Does the IRS still use outside people to get this information?
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1312.536,1315.332,--Which information?
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1315.332,1316.065,Electronic.
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1316.065,1317.94,"Which information, Justice Marshall?"
1988.88-40,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1317.94,1323.719,"Electronically, does the IRS still shop it out for private people to do it?"
1988.88-40,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1323.719,1324.203,I don't know.
1988.88-40,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.747,1334.105,Very well Mr. Horowitz.
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1335.683,1338.463,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-40,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.042,1384.305,"But the issue is simply whether that evidence can be the communication itself, which the government has gotten ahold of in some other fashion."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1387.725,1408.747,"It should not be the communication itself because otherwise, in the first instance, a party... whether it be the government or an adverse civil litigant... could come into court and just ritualistically intone the terms crime-fraud with respect to privileged communications, and under the scenario which the government outlines--"
1988.88-40,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1408.747,1408.966,No.
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1427.568,1429.193,--It should not be able to.
1988.88-40,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1445.873,1446.17,No.
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1454.369,1471.925,"Well, in fact, Justice Stevens, the trial judge over our objections did look at the massive excerpts from the tape recordings, which are the communications in this particular case, and in fact found that they did not establish a prima facie case of crime or fraud."
1988.88-40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.216,1528.495,"--But what is the standard, though, when you need independent evidence?"
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1532.994,1536.586,"Your Honor, the courts have given slightly different formulations."
1988.88-40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.389,1560.796,--probable cause?
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1560.796,1562.934,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1588.628,1589.627,"Well, but if--"
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1589.627,1590.533,--case of illegality.
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1590.533,1599.046,"--If we sustain the government's position here, the case would go back to the Ninth Circuit for them to review the district court's determination, I suppose."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1599.046,1599.624,That's--
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1599.624,1603.701,"That the tapes themselves... so, it's not as if the thing were totally moot."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1610.149,1613.118,--We don't see any such inconsistency at all.
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.482,1639.951,"Well, does--"
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1639.951,1640.404,And this Court--
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1640.404,1646.714,--The government here is asking for nothing more than consideration along with whatever evidence is--
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1646.714,1654.04,"--However, Justice Rehnquist, the foundation for this Court's decision in Bourjaily was referenced to Rule 104(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence."
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1673.5,1685.932,"--Well, how... how do you know whether they're privileged communications, though, if... if... before you decide this challenge in one way or the other, because the crime-fraud exception says it's not privileged if there is crime-fraud involved?"
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1685.932,1687.182,"--Well, Your Honor, in this way."
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1712.484,1718.295,"Well, what's the authority for... for that line of progression that you're... first, a claim of privilege or prima facie?"
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1723.042,1726.12,"--Your Honor, I'm not basing this on a particular case."
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1726.12,1727.197,What are you basing it on?
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1727.197,1729.477,I'm basing it on what happened in this case.
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1729.477,1732.679,"Well, but maybe... maybe we could have some higher authority than that."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1732.679,1744.22,"Well, Your Honor, I don't have... I'm not sure that there's an authority that specifically addresses the order in which the crime-fraud exception is applied on a claim of privilege."
1988.88-40,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.55,1790.375,"Mr. Hertzberg, I'm... I'm not sure what... what you would require by way of prima facie evidence."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1805.946,1806.415,Yes.
1988.88-40,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.415,1808.648,Because he was there and he overheard it?
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1808.648,1809.163,Yes.
1988.88-40,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1809.163,1811.148,"But if you had a tape of it, that would be no good?"
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1811.148,1812.272,No.
1988.88-40,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1812.272,1813.834,What sense is there in that distinction?
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1815.162,1816.631,"Well, I'll tell you what the difference is."
1988.88-40,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.69,1828.658,And the other one turns on the fortuity of somebody happening to have been present.
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1829.173,1841.73,"If there was a witness... if there is a witness, the witness confirms... I suppose... backing up for one moment, Your Honor."
1988.88-40,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1848.492,1850.227,"--Well, that would seem more logical, I must say."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1850.227,1850.835,Yes.
1988.88-40,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.475,1855.412,You wouldn't let the witness in either?
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1855.412,1859.239,"--No, I would not, because if the rule is to be served--"
1988.88-40,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.239,1862.206,"Well, what kind of evidence do you want of... that the fraud exists?"
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1862.206,1866.002,--The kind of evidence that invariably the government or civil parties have anyway.
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1921.728,1931.178,"But what if the government has in its possession the things that you're claiming are privileged, and it's perfectly evident from examining those documents that there was crime and fraud afoot?"
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1931.178,1948.265,"--Well, if we're addressing this case in particular, Justice Rehnquist, I think that at the least there would have to be a question on remand about whether the government was rightfully in possession of the... of the tapes."
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.794,1954.216,"Well, and certainly not raised by any party to this case."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1954.216,1960.181,--But what we're saying is that the independent evidence test serves a very logical purpose.
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1966.757,1980.377,Why do you need an independent evidence when the government is in possession of the documents for which the privilege is claimed and the documents themselves plainly... just have crime and fraud written all over them?
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1980.377,1985.234,"--Well, first, let me remind the Court that in this case they did not and they were found not to... not to have--"
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1985.234,1985.328,No?
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1985.328,1986.312,--not to have.
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.312,1989.139,"Well, but... but that finding has not been reviewed by the Ninth Circuit."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1989.139,1992.466,"Well, it has in part because the Ninth Circuit found--"
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1992.466,1994.325,"Well, let's not get into... into those side issues."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,1995.902,2013.926,"--Your Honor, we would say that the salutary effect of the independent evidence rule in those rare instances where a party happens to have the confidences to begin with... and that would be extremely rare... normally when the party is seeking access to the attorney/client communications, they don't have them to begin with."
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2027.39,2028.545,But not--
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2028.545,2029.451,To satisfy the court--
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.451,2033.995,--where you can't rely on the documents at all even though the documents virtually scream fraud?
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2035.417,2038.353,"--That the court should not look at them, in the first instance."
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2070.371,2072.668,"Well, there could be an incentive... it could be at fault."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2081.163,2082.382,--Not necessarily.
1988.88-40,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2173.782,2183.498,"In the Stuart case issued just a few years... a few weeks ago, Counsel, we said that once the IRS shows that it's entitled to the order, that's the end of the matter."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2183.498,2185.856,"I... I read that, Your Honor."
1988.88-40,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2324.706,2325.486,"Well, what if it had?"
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2325.486,2326.267,--proceed with an investigation.
1988.88-40,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2326.267,2327.377,What if it had?
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2333.297,2337.998,"That's, I think, a fairly broad question."
1988.88-40,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2348.26,2355.522,"Well, but we have to write the opinion and you're arguing that there should be a rule that gives the district court some authority to control the IRS."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2359.864,2384.385,"--Well, I think that... I think that the dimensions of the rule are that, as I... as I can formulate them, that the Court can fashion an order when it feels that the record warrants it to insure that its process is not abused."
1988.88-40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2403.722,2405.502,What kind of evidence?
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2421.325,2423.933,"Well, presumably he would have a factual record which would warrant applying--"
1988.88-40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.933,2424.73,What kind of facts?
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2424.73,2427.51,--I think the kind of facts--
1988.88-40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.51,2433.211,Actual concrete evidence and here are these other unreliable government attorneys.
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2433.211,2433.774,--Yes.
1988.88-40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.271,2448.518,And you think you made that kind of a record here... that raising a real valid doubt about the veracity and trustworthiness of the testimony in this--
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2448.518,2448.956,Yes.
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.898,2496.452,"--Mr. Hertzberg, on page 26A of the petition for certiorari where it's Judge Hupp's ruling on a motion for reconsideration, he says when the government asked him to reconsider his order conditioning... he says,"
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2518.678,2521.551,"--Now, Justice Rehnquist, our Joint Appendix--"
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2521.551,2524.472,"Well, are you saying this doesn't say what I just read to you?"
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2524.472,2527.065,"--Well, you... I... I was confused."
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2528.235,2532.375,That's exactly what I said... 26A of the petition for certiorari.
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2532.375,2532.672,Right.
1988.88-40,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2555.943,2559.583,"Well, but I think that it's very difficult to read that sentence that way."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2576.029,2594.537,"--Justice Rehnquist, in context... with all due respect, in the context of the record that was adduced, what the court is saying there is that because the government said they wanted it for a tax investigation and because my order would allow the government to use it for that proper purpose but not for an improper purpose, I am imposing the restriction."
1988.88-40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2600.223,2604.315,"Well, that just means that I'm going to make the government obey the law."
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2604.315,2606.126,"--Well, but it's more than that, Justice White."
1988.88-40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.403,2620.949,What page of the Joint Appendix are you--
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2620.949,2622.246,--Page 67.
1988.88-40,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.246,2623.151,--All right.
1988.88-40,1,35970,michael_lee_hertzberg,,2623.151,2628.695,"The colloquy there, particularly that of the court."
1988.88-40,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3170.698,3173.337,My immediate reaction is no.
