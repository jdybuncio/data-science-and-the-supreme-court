1975.75-250,0,46544,william_a_watts,,335.253,346.819,It was negotiated with a private insurance company and the City participated in the program of giving its employees this protection.
1975.75-250,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,363.213,370.782,Would you say Mr. Watts that all of these items then were available to all employees?
1975.75-250,0,46544,william_a_watts,,370.782,381.929,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, we would say that all of these were available for all employees within a single work unit, i.e. the Fire Department."

1975.75-250,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1359.596,1362.006,Mr. Wallas is it a finding or just -- it is not --
1975.75-250,1,33404,jonathan_wallas,,1362.006,1384.085,"Page A-14 of the petition, Your Honor, the very last page I believe, in paragraph four that reads as follows: â€œSo long as the defendants continue without clearly stated in fair standards to withhold moneys from the paychecks of city employees for other purposes, organizations and entities, not specifically required by law."

1975.75-250,2,46544,william_a_watts,,3010.993,3013.385,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
