1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.558,"Mr. Cleary, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,12.558,15.426,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-4,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.439,190.856,Excuse me.
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,195.16,196.36,"Yes, Your Honor, they were."
1987.87-4,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,198.879,203.314,"Not conclusions, but representations, specifically what was contradicted."
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,215.991,216.341,Right.
1987.87-4,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.341,219.943,What factual representation was contradicted?
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,219.943,232.083,"The factual representation was contradicted, first, as to Mr. Iredale being... I mean, Mr. Wheat, the Petitioner, being a possible witness against Mr. Gomez-Barajas, if his deal fell through."
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,259.401,263.472,Were they talking about the prosecution calling him as a witness or the defense?
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,263.472,263.872,No.
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,282.099,284.818,"Well, is that somewhere in the record?"
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,292.241,294.591,"Well, the Government didn't say he was going to be called as a witness."
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,317.689,324.593,"Perhaps I'm just not getting all of it, but in your answer to Justice Scalia's question, you say the Government."
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,329.014,332.716,That's... maybe there's... there's two individuals.
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,338.153,343.09,"But when the Government is speaking before the trial, all they can do is represent as to possibilities."
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,346.308,362.218,"Well, I think in the sequence in this case, sticking to the record that we have on the 22nd of August, the statement of the... at the first time Bravo entered a plea and indicating that now Mr. Iredale is the attorney for the Petitioner, the Government says, at this time, we have no plans to call him."
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.495,380.597,"Then, the Government changed its representation shortly after that, didn't they?"
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,380.597,381.949,That's correct.
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,381.949,387.952,And are you saying that the Government's second representation was contradicted?
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,387.952,388.935,Yes.
1987.87-4,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,472.391,475.26,"Mr. Cleary, did you ask for a hearing?"
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,481.914,506.196,"What happened was, Your Honor, that at first, the previous Thursday is when Bravo, the witness, entered the plea, and the court indicated it had no objection and at that time, the representations were made that all parties involved had consent and the court said, but I will give the Government an opportunity to object if it wishes to object, and what had happened is the Government filed the written paper, the memoranda, on the following Monday."
1987.87-4,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,528.995,531.495,Am I correct that you did not ask for an evidentiary hearing?
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,533.863,540.101,"I think that they asked for the question of taking a waiver, but I think the judge foreclosed it by saying waivers are not possible."
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,615.851,625.307,"Mr. Cleary, you're not suggesting that in a voluntary knowing waiver on the part of a defendant is the final answer to any conflict, are you?"
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,629.175,635.264,"--I am suggesting that a knowing intelligent and voluntary waiver, I mean one fully explored by the court,--"
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,635.264,639.382,"I think the question asked you can be answered yes or no, and then you can explain your answer."
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,639.382,640.216,--Yes.
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,640.216,645.636,You say that a voluntary knowing intelligent waiver can concludes the matter?
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,645.636,647.572,Yes.
1987.87-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.572,655.392,Even though you could say there would be a conflict?
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,655.392,655.928,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.961,657.394,Yes.
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,657.394,667.134,"The famous Loeb Leopold case was two University of Chicago law students who murdered a young boy, and they both made accusations, one accusing the other."
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,700.707,706.527,"But how about, you know, the ABA standards on conflicts, state bar standards on conflicts?"
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,711.729,721.37,"The standards the Court refers to is that they lean towards, and I would say as a general rule, the preference is to have separate counsel, and to that extent, where I track the other lawyers."
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,730.726,733.761,Even in the face of a known conflict?
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,733.761,736.046,Even in the face of a known conflict.
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,745.652,753.341,"Yes, but you can carry that to... you can say, you know, my real favorite is someone who isn't admitted to the bar."
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,762.447,753.341,Your Honor is correct.
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,764.68,766.232,Why?
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,778.04,796.768,"--I would have to stick to the terms of the Constitution which said counsel, and I think that the meaning and understanding of counsel at the time it was adopted in 1791 would mean a lawyer, and also at that time would mean also the right to choose a lawyer because this Court really didn't evolve the alternative appointed counsel until Powell v. Alabama."
1987.87-4,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,796.768,813.296,"Mr. Cleary, do you think the public has no right to have a trial proceeding that appears in all respects to be fair, including not having an attorney represent two defendants if there is an apparent conflict of interest?"
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,813.296,817.765,I think that the public's interest has to be balanced against those on trial.
1987.87-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,861.111,869.717,Do you base your alleged right entirely on the Sixth Amendment?
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,869.717,870.367,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-4,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,907.258,919.315,"The Government takes the position that the right to counsel of choice, if it exists at all, is not found in the Sixth Amendment, but in due process."
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,919.315,931.973,I would suggest that the argument was evolved by this Court in the context of the due process application because the only way it could be extended to the states would be through the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause.
1987.87-4,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,946.3,954.989,"Yes, but the Government says that entitles you to adequate legal representation, but doesn't extend to a choice."
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,954.989,966.88,"I would say that I am not in a position to comment on the due process clause under the Fifth as was applied in the case when I had the Sixth, which, in historic traditional concept, gives the right to counsel of choice."
1987.87-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,966.88,980.723,"Do you think the Court before... before the Court grants the request to appoint this counsel, can demand a waiver?"
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,990.746,993.281,"Well, I don't think that it can be asserted in unreasonable fashion."
1987.87-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,997.865,999.351,What kind of limits?
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,999.351,1001.719,"--Well, I can only use the rule of thumb of reasonable."
1987.87-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.29,1013.444,"Well, I know, but can the court insist on a waiver of what appears to be a conflict of interest?"
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1013.444,1019.848,"--If the court makes the inquiry in a federal context under Rule 44(c), the court can ask if there's a waiver."
1987.87-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.121,1034.608,"Well, so, he could... the court could turn it down, if there's... if a waiver is declined?"
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1034.608,1038.476,"If a waiver... if there is not an intelligent waiver, the court doesn't have to accept it."
1987.87-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1040.028,1066.06,"I take it then on your position that if one of these persons is convicted and the other is acquitted, the person who is convicted is a fellow who got the waiver, that he is stuck with it, he just can never come back and say, look, that judge shouldn't have allowed this, there was obvious conflict, I was denied due process."
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1066.06,1077.518,"--That was the situation in Cuyler v. Sullivan, where the one who was convicted and two were acquitted, and the question was this Court, and I think it was over two dissents or at least commentary that there should have been an inquiry by the court."
1987.87-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.55,1122.063,"Well, at least you would certainly have to, in my example, you certainly then have to at least relitigate again voluntariness, whether you were really intelligent and whether you were informed of all the circumstances, and whether you really were aware of the seriousness of the conflict when you went in."
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1122.063,1126.367,"I think that there has to be an inquiry, and it wouldn't have to take very long."
1987.87-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.461,1179.669,I suppose... would he also waive any claim of ineffectiveness by the counsel's performance during trial?
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1183.537,1188.691,"I think the right to counsel of choice is different than the right to effective assistance of counsel, and I think one is--"
1987.87-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.691,1200.348,"Well, when trial counsel fails to object to testimony or lets some in because it favors one of his clients but not the other, is that ineffectiveness?"
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1200.348,1213.925,"--I think that the Court, to the extent that it would ask the person, do you want to fly under your own flag, and I think we see judges do this all the time, do you want attorney X representing you, and they say unequivocally yes, then I think we should give the individual that choice, and I think an effective--"
1987.87-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.925,1232.22,I don't know how you're going to really protect the court system from two or three more trials about counsel if you permit... if a judge is just foreclosed from turning down this choice where there are conflicts.
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1232.22,1238.374,"--I think, Your Honor, that what we're trying to suggest is that in this case, the judge used the atom bomb to disqualification."
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1267.143,1278.266,"Mr. Cleary, in Faretta, we have seen many examples since Faretta of relitigating a question of whether the court was justified in letting them proceed on their own."
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1278.266,1278.633,"Your Honor,--"
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1278.633,1282.402,The trial court can't win in some of these situations.
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1295.727,1298.929,--I think we all have to assume risks that are made in waivers.
1987.87-4,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1307.185,1316.458,"If I thought we'd have to live with it, I could easily accept the argument you're making with this, but I cannot imagine that you really think that these people are going to live with the waivers they make."
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1343.893,1353.416,"First of all, I think the Court denigrates the role of defense counsel because most of us are not going to put ourselves in that situation, and in Cuyler, there was a representation that certain deferences were going to be."
1987.87-4,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1359.087,1366.306,We have no problem if we posit that no defense counsel will ever put himself in a situation of a bad conflict.
1987.87-4,0,29619,john_j_cleary,,1371.044,1399.295,"--But I think there has to be some point where the individual... in the context of this case, we have the Government using it as a tactical advantage to knock out counsel who face the same witnesses, and when you have the reason to want this particular attorney and you see not demanipulative, not be stumbling, not be mistaken guidance but a firm choice, even though it has with it certain risks, and the Court is correct, I think just the same way we have pleas of guilty, can't everybody say that the plea of guilty is wrong and that's why we have a Rule 11 hearing."
1987.87-4,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.933,1431.866,"Thank you, Mr. Cleary."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1441.307,1444.342,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1644.622,1649.407,"Mr. Kellogg, let me throw out a question that troubles me about the case to be sure you don't overlook it."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1672.622,1679.628,"Well, first of all, from the record, it's not actually clear whether Iredale was going to represent him by himself or whether he was just--"
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1679.628,1693.853,"He originally wanted to do it by himself, but it seemed to me that it was rather clear that he was willing to serve as additional counsel and just cross examine these witnesses that seemed so important to him, and I hope you cover that point as fully as you can before you get through because that's what troubles me about this case."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1693.853,1700.874,"--Well, it raises problems because he was representing the other two defendants alone."
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1756.711,1765.151,But I don't see why the other lawyer wouldn't be perfectly able to look out for all the pitfalls that would concern the Court in that situation.
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1777.708,1805.942,"Well, Rule 44(c) does say that the primary burden is placed on the lawyer to anticipate conflicts that are likely to develop, but there's a number of reasons why they can't do that, and Rule 44(c) goes on to state that even the defense counsel is not going to be able to anticipate all the sorts of conflicts that might arise at trial because he's not going to know fully what the nature of the Government's case is."
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1834.895,1835.961,Clarify one thing for me.
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1841.115,1841.699,--Iredale.
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1841.699,1846.269,"--Iredale, was not going to represent another defendant during that same trial, was he?"
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1846.269,1846.686,No.
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1847.353,1856.911,"If the trial had been almost terminated and a plea taken, but during the hearing itself, there wasn't any possibility of conflict of that kind."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1856.911,1860.278,"--Well, he would have been representing a witness against Petitioner."
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.278,1863.914,"But the witness would have been, in effect, a former client."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1863.914,1864.314,Yes.
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1864.314,1865.414,But the other lawyer--
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1865.414,1866.416,He had not yet been sentenced.
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1866.416,1875.472,"--And if it looked like it was really... he was not doing an effective job, why couldn't the court say, well, I think we better have the other lawyer examine this particular witness."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1875.472,1877.055,"Well, that would have been one option."
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1877.055,1880.09,Why wouldn't that have been an adequate option?
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1897.536,1903.122,"There is, but the concerns here are really twofold."
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1921.936,1926.971,"Now, that argument would support a rule that will never respect a waiver because it may have litigation about it later."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1950.186,1952.638,I think it certainly... it could be.
1987.87-4,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2000.119,2003.388,What was that substantial likelihood here?
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2003.388,2013.696,"Substantial likelihood was created by, first, as I mentioned, disparate positions of the defendants in a criminal conspiracy."
1987.87-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2039.411,2041.513,You mean the lawyer representing the lesser defendant?
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2041.513,2042.196,--That's correct.
1987.87-4,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2049.219,2068.347,"Well, in almost every criminal trial, there is one dominant and one secondary character, and, so, you would almost say that there is an absolute rule that the judge is never required to accept a waiver when there are two defendants, one of whom is dominant."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2068.347,2087.975,"If there is reason to think that there is a hierarchial relationship between them, I would say that the potential for conflict is sufficient that the District Court would have discretion under those circumstances to disqualify the joint representation."
1987.87-4,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2157.321,2170.545,"Well, Mr. Cleary takes the position, the rather clear position that waiver is always permitted, and that, at first blush, sounds like a hard rule."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2191.642,2192.411,--I think not.
1987.87-4,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2216.776,2219.978,"Mr. Kellogg, perhaps I misunderstood your position."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2234.071,2235.238,He could allow it.
1987.87-4,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2255.568,2258.686,"Well, I'm sort of hung up on Justice Stevens' point."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2291.242,2310.738,"Well, first, with respect to Bravo, who is going to be the witness at trial against Wheat, Iredale would have received confidential information in the course of representing Bravo."
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.78,2355.867,"Yes, but before you leave that witness, in fact, they didn't even cross examine him, did they?"
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2355.867,2356.767,"--No, they did not."
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.184,2360.402,"So, this is totally conjectural."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2360.402,2365.54,--I don't think it's conjectural because the decision has to be made in advance of trial.
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2366.492,2367.275,But that's my point.
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2385.036,2385.403,"--Well, he--"
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.403,2387.405,Based on that particular argument.
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2387.405,2391.357,--The judge knew what the witness was going to say because the judge had taken his guilty plea.
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.357,2396.094,"Then, why not... then, there was no need for cross... well, I'm sorry, I shouldn't--"
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2396.094,2402.915,Bravo did provide evidence adverse to Petitioner.
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2411.687,2414.972,--And the Petitioner didn't dispute those two overt acts?
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2417.34,2421.126,That's correct.
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2487.521,2489.771,And who would that hurt except the Government?
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2489.771,2490.204,--Pardon?
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2490.204,2495.941,"That would hurt the Government, not bringing that out, but how would that hurt either of the defendants?"
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2495.941,2505.315,"Well, I think there's an independent interest here in the fairness and integrity of the criminal justice system which would not be served by allowing such an appearance of impropriety."
1987.87-4,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2517.873,2520.158,What about the other witness?
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2522.492,2529.014,"--Well, Gomez-Barajas, as I noted, was the lead defendant in the case."
1987.87-4,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.488,2545.107,What is the status of his case at this point?
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2545.107,2552.261,He had been acquitted on the main marijuana conspiracy and several substantive counts.
1987.87-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.434,2599.86,"I think your substantial likelihood test might be satisfied in the case in the sense that there would be a substantial likelihood of the conflict, but the trial judge could, nevertheless, take the waiver."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2599.86,2601.91,"Well, certainly if the court--"
1987.87-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2601.91,2607.764,I know you submit the trial judge would have discretion not to take the waiver in that circumstance.
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2609.466,2620.857,"--If there is a substantial likelihood of a serious conflict of interest, the trial judge still has a possibility of being able to cure that short of a waiver."
1987.87-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2625.409,2628.427,"Well, there wasn't going to be any question of a severance in this case?"
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2628.427,2629.463,No.
1987.87-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.463,2639.585,"These were going to be trials on end, I guess, end to end."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2643.854,2644.806,Yes.
1987.87-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2644.806,2645.506,And--
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2645.506,2648.941,Assuming he can do something to protect against conflict.
1987.87-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.941,2676.694,"--And is it also your position that where there are joint trials, two people at the same trial or two people who have been charged in the same charge but going to be tried one after another, are you saying that there are circumstances involving those facts that would not present a substantial likelihood of conflict?"
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2676.694,2677.127,Yes.
1987.87-4,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2685.014,2687.733,This is not it.
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2687.733,2690.002,But this is not it.
1987.87-4,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2819.636,2823.754,And tell me again why must prejudice be shown.
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2823.754,2825.123,Pardon?
1987.87-4,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2825.123,2828.325,Tell me again why must prejudice be shown.
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2828.325,2850.089,It must be shown because of this Court's statements in Strickland and Cronic as... that the purpose of the Sixth Amendment is served as long as Petitioner received a fair trial at which he received the assistance of competent counsel so as not to cast any doubt on the reliability of the verdict.
1987.87-4,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2868.467,2871.771,"How would one ever prove prejudice, really?"
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2871.771,2890.066,One would prove it by showing that the trial one actually had was unfair within the meaning of Strickland because the performance of one's counsel fell measurably below the standards of the profession and undermines the reliability of the verdict.
1987.87-4,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2890.066,2892.435,"Well, then, you get a new trial anyway."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2892.435,2896.819,That's correct.
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2896.819,2918.216,"That really means there's no remedy whatsoever for violating the right that's asserted here, if there is such a right, because if you require that standard, you... the judge... what the trial judge should always do is disqualify counsel, and he... as long as he's got somebody out there who crosses the threshold of minimum effectiveness, he cannot commit reversible error."
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2918.216,2921.87,"That's true, but there's no reason to think that the trial judge would not conscientiously--"
1987.87-4,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2921.87,2925.989,There's a lot of trial judges I know who don't like to be reversed.
1987.87-4,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2925.989,2941.831,"--But in this respect, the right to counsel of choice would not be really any different from, for example, a District Court's decision on the severance motion or a discovery motion, which is reviewable only in the context of general review of a fair trial."
1987.87-4,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2944.617,2945.985,"Thank you, Mr. Kellogg."
1987.87-4,2,29619,john_j_cleary,,2948.119,2951.473,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1987.87-4,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3025.621,3032.925,I don't see what his agreement not to... he promises that he won't cross examine which one was it?
1987.87-4,2,29619,john_j_cleary,,3032.925,3033.475,"Bravo, Your Honor."
1987.87-4,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3033.475,3034.793,Bravo.
1987.87-4,2,29619,john_j_cleary,,3042.281,3042.816,"Well, I think--"
1987.87-4,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.816,3043.249,"I mean,--"
1987.87-4,2,29619,john_j_cleary,,3043.249,3051.589,"--I understand the Court's position and that we're getting into certain imponderables, except that in this case, he had the advantage of two separate defense counsels."
1987.87-4,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.874,3057.825,--Another thing.
1987.87-4,2,29619,john_j_cleary,,3079.906,3091.714,"I think the only one would be as to Bravo, and I think it could be easily sanitized as an alternative other than total disqualification to say that he cannot examine Bravo, and in the context of this case, I think that would have been reasonable."
1987.87-4,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3205.286,3206.236,"Thank you, Mr. Cleary."
