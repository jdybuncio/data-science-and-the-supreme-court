2000.99-1551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.634,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-1551, Semtek International Incorporated v. Lockheed Martin Corporation."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,11.044,16.523,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,92.256,119.067,"Would it have been... would the California judgment have been binding on Maryland if the same issues were involved, i.e., the statute of limitations are about the same, and the question was when the tolling period... whether there was a tolling period or something like that, and the California court had ruled on the merits in the sense of... on the issue, on the issue of whether or not there was tolling?"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,119.067,119.823,--Well--
2000.99-1551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,119.823,128.452,"Then I take it Maryland, a) would have and b) perhaps must give credit to the earlier judgment?"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,128.452,135.676,"--Well, certainly if it... if Maryland was borrowing the California statute of limitations it would certainly have to give credit, but even if it was relying--"
2000.99-1551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,135.676,141.993,"No, suppose the statutes were exactly parallel, and the issues were exactly parallel, but a disputed issue of fact as to whether or not there had been tolling?"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,141.993,145.581,"--Well, I think if it was a disputed issue of fact it would probably be collaterally estopped."
2000.99-1551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.3,171.715,So there is some instance in which California's judgment has extraterritorial effect.
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,172.959,173.307,Yes.
2000.99-1551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.863,202.899,"If it's an ordinary statute of limitations; but suppose it was what was once called a built-in statute of limitations, a proscription period that bars not merely the remedy, but the very right."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,202.899,211.879,"Well, surely, if California had a statute and it was construed to mean that it bars the right, then yes, that would preclude you going to another State."
2000.99-1551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.846,275.713,"Well, isn't the position of your opponents here, Mr. Gottesman, that there is a Federal rule as to res judicata issue preclusion?"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,283.465,290.826,"Well, that's... as this Court has said in the O'Melveny & Myers case, it's... you know, it... there's a little riddle attached to that."
2000.99-1551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,314.843,321.072,"Your opponents also argue, I think with some merit, that Dupasseur has been superseded by the Rules of Civil Procedure."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,322.706,340.74,"Well, absolutely, that we regard as the critical... for us, the critical threshold question is, we must persuade you that Rule 41(b) is not a rule of preclusion, or that if it is, it violates the Rules Enabling Act, because it is substantive, and so let me turn to that."
2000.99-1551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.904,351.307,"May I ask you, before you--"
2000.99-1551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,351.307,354.505,"--Before you say that, do you mean issue preclusion or claims preclusion, or does that make a difference?"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,354.505,355.5,"Well, it doesn't--"
2000.99-1551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,355.5,358.761,"I mean, can we say that it is a rule of issue preclusion and you still prevail?"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,358.761,371.09,"--Well, I mean yes, we would prevail if you said that in this case, but I don't think that that's... analytically it's not our position that it is a rule of preclusion, but only issue preclusion."
2000.99-1551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,371.854,390.128,"It isn't termed as a rule of issue preclusion, because Rule 41(b) says that unless it's a jurisdictional thing it counts as a dismissal on the merits, even though nothing may have been adjudicated, so it may be that 41(b) would be applicable despite the absence of any specific issue of adjudication."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,390.128,399.116,"--Well, that's correct, Your Honor, surely, but I understand the question to be, what if an issue was adjudicated, would the party be barred from relitigating that issue."
2000.99-1551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,411.762,413.962,"Well, you had five reasons and I sidetracked you."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,414.319,416.582,"--Yes, five reasons."
2000.99-1551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,553.166,568.352,"So what happens if we have a litigated case, a litigated diversity case in the Federal court and a judgment is entered, and then a question arises as to the preclusive effect of that judgment, any of the many different issues surrounding res judicata?"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,577.388,581.979,"Well, if they were State matters that were adjudicated we would suggest it would be State law."
2000.99-1551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,582.408,585.509,I'm asking... it must arise fairly often.
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,607.992,611.978,"--Well, we believe that the judge looks to State law."
2000.99-1551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.509,620.725,"Federal law renvoi, so to speak."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,620.725,621.927,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2000.99-1551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.927,623.777,"Federal law renvoi, so to speak."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,625.139,626.309,"Yes, Your Honor, good phrase for it."
2000.99-1551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,630.83,633.39,"--Yes, and if there is a precedent, I mean, the obvious thing is they should be treated similarly."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,634.385,634.886,--Right.
2000.99-1551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,634.886,637.525,So I was just looking for a precedent on that and I didn't find it.
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,637.525,649.219,"I don't know of a case like that, and part of... one of the reasons is that in all 50 States if you had a case litigated on the true merits to a judgment, everybody would regard that as claim-preclusive, so the issue would never arise."
2000.99-1551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,649.219,651.929,"No, no, no, there are all kinds of... you know, peripheral matters--"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,651.929,652.27,Right.
2000.99-1551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,652.27,657.391,"--and my law clerk told me that it's split on that, that there's a split in the circuits."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,657.391,659.375,"In the circuits, just as there is a split on this."
2000.99-1551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,659.375,662.436,"Well, then we're really deciding that when we decide this, I guess."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,662.436,669.391,"Well, the first step is to decide whether Rule 41(b) is the controlling answer."
2000.99-1551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,683.42,702.333,"Mr. Gottesman, at least 41(b) would govern if you tried to bring the very same case back in the district court in California, would you agree that far, that this would operate as an adjudication on the merits, it would be preclusive of any further claim?"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,709.431,713.76,"We would agree that it would be preclusive, but not because 41(b) says so."
2000.99-1551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,720.579,720.88,All right.
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,743.578,771.463,"--We think it doesn't matter whether the second suit is filed in the State court or a Federal court, that either way preclusion is determined by the law of the place where the original judgment was rendered, because it's there that a ruling or judgment gets its preclusive effect, and whatever court is receiving that, or is considering that in a second case, must refer back to the first case to determine that."
2000.99-1551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,795.598,802.918,"Can this question be answered en masse, or doesn't it depend upon what the dismissal was for?"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,826.074,830.747,"Well, we think in that case the dismissal is not for a reason of State law."
2000.99-1551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.247,891.707,"Well, what if a case is dismissed on the grounds of frivolousness, and that's an application of State law."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,898.222,909.054,"If the frivolous... if it is a penalty sanction, if adjudication is simply, you have obviously not stated a claim--"
2000.99-1551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,909.054,910.655,Yes.
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,910.655,918.893,"--under State law, then because it is under State law it is the State preclusion rule that would apply."
2000.99-1551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,933.752,948.515,"No, where that's likely to come up, I think would be, you could imagine a Federal court dismissing on the ground that this is no legal issue, that the State has a rule that if it was a pro se litigant you get two or three chances."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,949.766,956.177,"--It gets harder, Your Honor."
2000.99-1551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,978.256,979.291,But it wouldn't be--
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,979.291,980.406,Once you move... and that's our case.
2000.99-1551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,988.821,1021.038,"Well, isn't that example that Justice Breyer just gave, it's a Federal procedural policy that isn't going to go very... won't be very effective if the recalcitrant litigant or the frivolous litigant can bring the very same case somewhere else, Federal or State, so don't you have to look at the particular reason for the dismissal, and you can't say it's always State law, it's always Federal law, but at least... well, let me give you another concrete example."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1056.618,1067.202,"--That is, I think, a difficult middle ground case, and it was actually addressed by the advisory committee to the rules, not in the case of Rule 13, which is what Your Honor is referring to."
2000.99-1551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.914,1131.887,"--Mr. Gottesman, I hope you can spend some time on what happens if we agree with you that Rule 41(b) does not answer the question."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1133.536,1133.918,Yes.
2000.99-1551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1214.828,1229.234,"Has the California court ever given any explanation of this doctrine, that it's a State law question, you're barred under State law by the statute of limitations, but the right isn't extinguished?"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1232.551,1234.591,"--Yes, they have, Your Honor."
2000.99-1551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1297.276,1299.365,"No, I wouldn't ask any question like that."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1300.072,1301.37,Okay.
2000.99-1551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1302.151,1314.378,"Mr. Gottesman, I would have thought that the rule, Rule 41, does appear expressly to cover this situation."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1324.337,1325.324,--Right.
2000.99-1551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1325.324,1345.368,And Hannah seems to say that a Federal diversity court should apply a Federal rule of civil procedure to the case before it whenever the rule covers the point in dispute and isn't unlawful under the Rules Enabling Act or the Constitution.
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1357.085,1359.523,"If this rule is a rule of preclusion, then--"
2000.99-1551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1359.523,1366.285,"So you have to persuade us, 1) the rule doesn't cover it, if it does, it's unlawful."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1366.285,1373.606,"--Correct, or that, 3) that we are in fact covered under the exception in the rule, but that argument I'd prefer to leave to the briefs."
2000.99-1551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1399.677,1400.289,What about Justice--
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1400.289,1400.719,--I'm sorry.
2000.99-1551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1400.719,1409.31,"--I just don't want you to lose, before you sit down, Justice O'Connor's argument that she just asked about, why would it be a violation of Erie?"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1427.635,1428.287,Well--
2000.99-1551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1428.287,1435.321,"If it says on the merits, it means on the merits, and what you all want is something that wasn't on the merits."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1435.321,1438.917,"--Well, but that's not the... again, the... California has law in this, too."
2000.99-1551,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1440.933,1450.72,"Yes, but if... I'm just trying to get you to respond to the question of, assuming you lost on the point about what it means, then would this in fact violate Erie, et cetera?"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1450.72,1456.086,"--Well, it would... I mean, I think on the merits in Rule 41(b) it has a fixed meaning."
2000.99-1551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1468.159,1476.851,"Mr. Gottesman, let me pursue one more thing that I think bears on what I'm interested in and perhaps what Justice Breyer's asking about."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1514.148,1516.468,"--Well, surely they had the opportunity."
2000.99-1551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1535.783,1538.246,Didn't you go back to the district court at some point--
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1538.246,1538.555,--Yes.
2000.99-1551,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1538.555,1540.729,--after the litigation in Maryland and the district court refused to say--
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1540.729,1541.064,Yes.
2000.99-1551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1548.595,1554.632,"--I don't want to use up your rebuttal time, but Mr. Dellinger's brief says, and he's going to get up here and say they're running away from Rule 41."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1562.734,1566.114,"--Well, that actually turns on the question--"
2000.99-1551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1566.114,1566.926,I missed it.
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1571.301,1579.9,"--Well, certainly this... if all 41(b) is is issue preclusion, then yes, this issue is different, because the issue here is, is it timely under Maryland's statute of limitations."
2000.99-1551,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1579.9,1586.654,"Yes, but that... isn't that a pretty tough argument, because the text of the rule says, operates as an adjudication on the merits--"
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1586.654,1586.947,Right.
2000.99-1551,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1586.947,1591.605,"--which sounds like issue-preclusion language, and I guess that... which leads to my question."
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1591.605,1592.235,Claim preclusion.
2000.99-1551,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1592.235,1594.131,Is... yeah.
2000.99-1551,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1605.066,1611.238,"Well, first of all it is there because it informs whatever the rule preclusion rule is."
2000.99-1551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.049,1652.203,"Very well, Mr. Gottesman."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1655.073,1660.161,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1719.891,1722.41,"But the question is, on the merits of what?"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1744.758,1748.795,"With all due respect, Justice Kennedy, two responses."
2000.99-1551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1800.459,1807.117,But that was because they were trying to reopen the judgment on the same grounds that the judgment was granted.
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1807.117,1809.525,"--I understand that, and I will come to that point."
2000.99-1551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.958,1855.884,"Mr. Dellinger, I don't think your colleague contests that."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1896.648,1911.166,"--Yes, and since there are two issues on the table, 1) that they should win because this should be only claim-preclusive, which is what Justice Kennedy asked, and your question, they should win because this is a diversity case."
2000.99-1551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1911.166,1912.371,"I'm talking the whole hog, right."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1912.371,1933.643,"On the whole... and if I could just make the most critical point to Justice Kennedy, and then I'll return, which is that the structure of Rule 41(b) says that all dismissals, involuntary dismissals are on the merits except those for lack of jurisdiction, lack of venue, and failure to join an indispensable party."
2000.99-1551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.338,1966.275,"No, I'm not saying it should not only operate."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1992.619,1994.93,"--Well, let's be precise about this."
2000.99-1551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.88,2004.638,Federal cause of action is what I mean by Federal--
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2004.638,2005.714,--In only Federal causes of action.
2000.99-1551,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2021.167,2023.216,"--It would be quite contrary to Hannah to say so, wouldn't it?"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2023.216,2030.865,"--It would be contrary to Hannah to say so, because Hannah, the plain text of the rule covers both of these."
2000.99-1551,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2123.708,2125.158,But access to what?
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2212.307,2232.966,"I agree with the question that California doesn't have much of an interest here, and if you think of this, if we get to it in Erie terms, and I think because this is a Hannah case with a Federal rule squarely on point we never get to Erie, but if you think of it as an Erie case, you're exactly right that California doesn't have an interest."
2000.99-1551,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2260.272,2265.192,"But that's nothing, I mean, at all unusual conjecture."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2276.932,2279.371,My point is this.
2000.99-1551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2303.38,2303.745,"Well, why?"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2304.253,2304.906,--Because--
2000.99-1551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2304.906,2305.287,Yes.
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2323.816,2325.091,"--Yes, right."
2000.99-1551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2325.091,2326.756,"That's all, and they didn't say it."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2330.017,2330.358,Yes.
2000.99-1551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2330.358,2334.569,"I mean, I thought your point was, you know, a dismissal on the merits is a dismissal on the merits--"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2334.569,2335.165,It could well--
2000.99-1551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2335.165,2339.329,"--and maybe they're right, therefore the thing to do is say, judge... you see, that's--"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2339.329,2343.363,"--No, no, that's exactly where I'm going, after noting--"
2000.99-1551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2343.363,2345.596,"--Can I throw a question in, just one here?"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2367.561,2374.267,--Not if you have an indication that the judge is otherwise specified--
2000.99-1551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2374.267,2375.948,He enters the same judgment he enters in this case.
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2375.948,2380.927,--I would think that that is a bar.
2000.99-1551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2392.11,2396.759,"So it's a matter of subjective intent of the judgment, of the judge who enters the judgment?"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2396.759,2399.326,"--Well, I think that's a possibility, but I would go with--"
2000.99-1551,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2399.326,2407.422,"How could you, if you're relying on 41(b) and 41(b) says, unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies--"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2407.422,2409.448,--Otherwise specifies would suggest that you--
2000.99-1551,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2409.448,2411.049,--It would have to be within the four corners of the order.
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2411.049,2421.457,"--But you ought to stay within the four corners of the order, and if the judge doesn't specify otherwise, it is claim-preclusive, and there is an opportunity at that moment--"
2000.99-1551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2421.457,2421.702,"Oh, excuse me."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2473.713,2474.189,--Yes.
2000.99-1551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2474.189,2475.232,It does?
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2475.232,2475.637,It does.
2000.99-1551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2477.246,2485.989,So you're dictating the... California's own res judicata effect as to what should be the effect of a judgment?
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2485.989,2499.475,"--That is right, because the Federal court system sets its own rule for when a dismissal is on the merits and precludes further litigation of that claim."
2000.99-1551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2501.196,2503.731,"But isn't... again, isn't your answer the same as before?"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2524.154,2524.817,--Let me go--
2000.99-1551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2524.817,2525.723,"Now, is that right, or--"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2525.723,2526.048,--Yes.
2000.99-1551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2526.048,2527.202,"--Don't say I'm right if I'm not, please."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2527.202,2527.888,Let me go directly to that point.
2000.99-1551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2572.43,2588.646,"And you're saying because they didn't, what would not have been preclusive under State law has now been made preclusive by this Federal judgment, and that brings you right up against the proposition that Rule 41(b) cannot make any substantive change."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2610.762,2618.713,--That's because what is at issue here is not a determination of what the law of business torts ought to be in California.
2000.99-1551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2724.489,2728.922,What is the Federal interest that in effect supports your entire argument?
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2739.358,2742.348,"--It seems to me, Justice Souter, that there are two Federal interests."
2000.99-1551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2752.741,2755.501,You would have a clear determination if you simply followed the California rule.
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2758.408,2759.439,"No, it is not--"
2000.99-1551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2759.439,2761.943,The only time you need it is if the State doesn't have a rule.
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2761.943,2766.312,"--Well, it is not clear to me that the State of California has a clear rule, but let me put that to one side."
2000.99-1551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2766.312,2767.634,"All right, but we're assuming it does."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2769.642,2776.031,"If you assume for a moment that it does, there's also a Federal interest in not providing moot court opportunities for litigants."
2000.99-1551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2776.906,2779.856,"In other words, you say, we don't want the Federal court used twice."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2790.352,2800.266,--Because it would certainly lead to a too-casual resort to Federal court if the judgment was not going to be preclusive.
2000.99-1551,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2801.3,2801.657,The point--
2000.99-1551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2802.429,2802.826,--Exactly.
2000.99-1551,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2802.826,2820.468,"This was removed by the defendant, and that's why this is... the position you're taking, frankly, is so troublesome, because it's the defendant who's forum-shopping, and there is a reason for... you hesitated, why does California say, we don't care if Maryland wants to entertain it longer."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2843.527,2844.986,--You raise a State interest.
2000.99-1551,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2857.514,2857.92,Well--
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2857.92,2860.264,"--Rule 41, but I'm happy to engage in it, if I--"
2000.99-1551,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2860.264,2870.166,"--Mr. Dellinger, to what extent should we be guided by an opinion of this Court called Walker v. Armco Steel?"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2923.949,2926.204,"--It does, but we still win."
2000.99-1551,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2987.093,2993.41,"No, I don't think so, not... because Gasperini was talking about the way Federal judges uniformly will operate."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3006.799,3007.538,Yes.
2000.99-1551,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3007.538,3032.177,"There's a big difference between leaving it in the hands of each individual district judge and saying, as in the case of Rule 3, when this Court interpreted that rule, not for one district judge but for all them it says, your clock doesn't start ticking until you actually serve the summons and complaint because we want to honor State policies."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3032.177,3059.547,"I appreciate the distinction, but it's important to remember that any argument you have with what Judge Collins should have done in the Federal district court is an argument that should have been made before her and taken up on the court of appeals, so that if in the future you wanted to tell district judges that they always had to defer to State statute of limitations the way to do that is on direct review of a diversity case."
2000.99-1551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3121.684,3122.481,That's... can you answer my other question that I had before?
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3164.702,3168.856,"That's a very good question, and it clarifies a point that they make."
2000.99-1551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3215.67,3220.949,"Well, you're just saying that, then, it's only changing a very tiny bit of substantive law."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3261.799,3268.952,"Justice Scalia, if that is considered an alteration of substantive law it would raise havoc with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
2000.99-1551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3294.508,3295.311,--It seems to me your--
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3295.311,3297.479,--but we have to worry about ordering people's private lives.
2000.99-1551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3304.224,3313.38,"--Was your answer to me, then, that the words, on the merits, are not peripheral because if they mean anything they mean claim preclusion--"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3313.38,3314.263,If they mean any--
2000.99-1551,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3314.263,3328.35,"--and therefore, if you apply it, you can't just look to State law because that would make the words meaningless in that Heartland issue, and if you put that... you applied it where it's not applied, that's just a mistake like any other court, any other Federal court."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3329.889,3330.645,--That's exactly right.
2000.99-1551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3330.645,3332.765,"But that's not a good answer, because they wouldn't--"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3333.273,3336.231,I didn't say it was a good answer.
2000.99-1551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3336.231,3349.665,"They would not make the words meaningless, you acknowledge, in those cases where you're dealing with a Federal cause of action and where it is within the power of the Federal courts to say what the effect of a judgment on the merits is."
2000.99-1551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3353.203,3360.047,It would also finally resolve the merits of the question whether the statute... whether the claim is barred by the California statute of limitations.
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3362.461,3380.632,"Well, this Court has never held that a Federal rule simply doesn't apply in diversity cases when the plain text of the rule says it applies to, you know, all suits of a civil nature under Rule 1, and there's just no way to tease that out of the rule."
2000.99-1551,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3397.66,3405.62,"Mr. Dellinger, it is the normal rule, and I think you're well aware that in the... the Ryder Miller Treatise puts this very issue."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3415.421,3438.592,"Justice Ginsburg, if I may interrupt, as a matter of full faith and credit, but increasingly... as a matter of full faith and credit if there's not been a first lawsuit, a State... the second... the second State in a case like Sun Oil, the second case can apply its own longer statute of limitations, period, even though the first State has a shorter limitations period and is providing the cause of action."
2000.99-1551,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3438.592,3440.169,"Well, I wish that you hadn't interrupted--"
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3440.169,3440.526,I'm sorry.
2000.99-1551,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3440.526,3453.551,"--only for this reason, because the next sentence goes on to say, Civil Rule 41(b) is even more clearly inapposite to these problems than to the many other difficult preclusion questions it may seem to touch."
2000.99-1551,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3453.551,3454.778,"Thank you, Mr. Dellinger."
2000.99-1551,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3454.778,3455.111,Thank you.
2000.99-1551,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3455.111,3458.922,"Mr. Gottesman, you have 3 minutes left."
2000.99-1551,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3458.922,3459.989,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2000.99-1551,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3526.956,3532.136,But the recognition court must look to the rendition court to find out what the preclusive effect--
2000.99-1551,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3532.136,3532.454,--Right.
2000.99-1551,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3612.544,3613.315,"Thank you, Mr. Gottesman."
