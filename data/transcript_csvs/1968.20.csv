1968.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,34.644,"Number 20, Joyce C. Thorpe, petitioner, versus Housing Authority of the City of Durham."
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,37.097,40.233,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,114.57,121.039,Is that really the issue or an underlying issue here?
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,134.593,135.085,"No, Your Honor."
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,136.832,137.331,"Well, where do you get --"
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,137.331,140.624,I said more fortunate citizens and their contacts with the government.
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,140.624,142.872,"That -- well, tell me about that."
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,151.804,176.547,"It's our position, may it please the Court, that it's a common place of administrative law when, in all sorts of situations, when a professional man's license is threatened to with revocation, when a security, as in the Goldsmith case or in the Willner case last year, if -- to get a notice in a hearing, it --"
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,176.547,182.885,"Well, let's take a comparable case if we can think of one."
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,222.207,236.771,"Well, the thing that I -- the difference I perceive is the difference in the purpose of the program because the purpose of this program under the Housing Act is to provide housing for poor people."
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,249.413,250.368,I know --
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,250.368,253.357,Programs could -- incidental to the management of government buildings.
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,256.29,270.153,"Well, I don't think that's important, Mr. Nabrit and this is a terrible important and new area of Constitutional Law to which you're addressing yourself now."
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,352.298,362.224,"Well, I agree that these issues about the rights of the poor are a challenge to us all, but there are none without difficulties."
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,412.48,412.834,"Well, what --"
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,412.834,413.97,"Now, let's look at the --"
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,413.97,431.105,"Mr. Nabrit, I'm going to leave you alone after this, but it's a problem of fundamental consequence in this and other cases, many other cases, and I suggest to you that perhaps two possible lines of approach."
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,495.411,497.265,"Mr. Justice Fortas, I think I agree with that."
1968.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,856.183,863.839,Could you tell us how the Housing Authority is constituted?
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,863.839,864.938,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,864.938,866.474,Would you do that briefly please?
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,866.474,867.691,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,917.213,919.409,How did the Commissioners select --
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,919.409,932.077,How are they chosen?
1968.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,938.938,940.226,Alright.
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,943.933,947.146,The mayor of the council here.
1968.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,947.277,947.856,What page --
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,947.856,951.329,157-4 which is the statute.
1968.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,951.329,951.814,"Yes, what page is that in?"
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,951.814,955.951,It's page 9 (a) in the petitioner's brief.
1968.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,955.951,956.337,Yes.
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,956.337,965.414,9 (a) appendix.
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1106.57,1115.636,But that assumes that there's something -- some sort of right other than the rights conferred by the lease here.
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1115.636,1115.949,It's --
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1115.949,1127.092,"And that is a proposition, if you're -- until you get to the other phase of your case, that's a proposition that, I suggest, you got to face up to."
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1134.559,1135.154,Yes.
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1141.073,1141.285,"Well, that's all --"
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1141.285,1150.011,By the governmental agency when it's determining whether or not to terminate your benefits under a federal benefit program is the right --
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1150.011,1150.159,Well --
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1150.159,1153.164,It's the right -- the right to fair procedures.
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1153.164,1173.842,"Here, the parties entered into a lease and the -- so far as the lease is concerned, Mrs. Thorpe may have been -- her lease may have been allowed, it may have terminated just because they were tired of having her there, no reason at all."
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1197.02,1209.314,"Well, to address myself, if I may, Mr. Justice Fortas, to the first part of your question as to whether or not they can terminate just because they were tired of having her here -- or having here there."
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1233.64,1233.816,Right.
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1233.816,1235.896,"But, the Housing Authority can't have these reasons."
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1235.896,1236.135,"No, that's --"
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1236.135,1236.288,The purpose of the program --
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1236.288,1238.351,That's exactly what they want.
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1238.351,1247.371,"Yes, the purpose of the program is to house poor people, and they can't leave it vacant and obey their duty under the statute."
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1247.371,1258.018,"Well, what you're saying is that, from the fact of that, the purpose of the program is to provide housing for poor people."
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1286.017,1286.761,That's right.
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1291.757,1291.915,"Well, the statute --"
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1291.915,1292.167,There would have to be a --
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1292.167,1294.263,What statute say about it?
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1296.161,1325.098,"Well, the statute does give us some guidelines, Section 1410 (g) which is in our brief at 14 -- page 3 (a) of the appendix, 1410 (g) (2), does layout the general considerations that the government once considered in this program."
1968.20,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1400.597,1417.238,"Mr. Nabrit, when I assume that if Mrs. Thorpe is -- what happens, she'll be replaced with another for a family exactly the same position that she's in?"
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1417.238,1418.393,"Yes, that's correct."
1968.20,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1420.93,1428.897,"Well, exactly what constitutional provision do you rely on for your due process argument?"
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1428.897,1448.548,"Mr. Justice Marshall, your question suggests to me that it's relevant to analyze what the tenant has at stake in this, what the Authority has at stake in determining what procedures fairness requires."
1968.20,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1482.649,1484.998,Maybe I have not made myself clear.
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1500.865,1522.858,"I think that the issue we're -- the First Amendment component is a part of our case, but my answer is yes because these authorities contend that they have the right to kick people out without telling time any reason why and I think that, alone, raises the due process question, the question of procedural facts."
1968.20,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1522.858,1522.968,It's --
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1522.968,1523.213,Why wouldn't it be?
1968.20,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1523.213,1527.545,Only because it's federal money.
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1527.545,1532.177,Because it's federal -- yes.
1968.20,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1532.177,1547.647,"So that a member of the Authority who has a private building to put somebody out without a hearing, but he could not vote to put somebody out in a public effect without a hearing?"
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1547.647,1550.882,I can assume that that's so and I can assume that argument.
1968.20,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1554.212,1566.421,"Well, you don't recognize the fact that when a private citizen makes a contract with another private citizen for a rental of an apartment in which he agrees that he can be thrown out without notice, that that can't be enforced?"
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1566.421,1568.026,I agreed with that.
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1627.16,1627.481,Your time --
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1627.481,1630.693,"What's at stake is the right to have -- I'm sorry, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1630.693,1631.294,I'm sorry.
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1657.257,1659.05,"It's what the Court below held, yes."
1968.20,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1659.05,1671.956,"And the Court below held that and can't we dispose of the case if we should conclude that the, as we read this re-construed direction of HEW, it is retroactive."
1968.20,0,32207,james_m_nabrit_iii,,1675.426,1677.362,I believe that would be open to the Court.
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2425.684,2429.11,"Mr. Chief Justice and, if the Court please."
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2546.799,2551.998,"Well, I'm sure, Mr. Edwards, you understood my questioning of Mr. Nabrit."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2573.567,2580.098,"And, I'm sure that it does not because they are placed on an equal basis here."
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2595.513,2596.625,Or HEW.
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2608.564,2613.544,"The heard circular is the thing that I would like to take up next then, if I may."
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2613.544,2615.024,"Mr. Edwards, before you get to it --"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2615.024,2616.408,Yes.
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2616.408,2628.008,You do recognize the difference between a housing authority operating under state and federal auspices and a private apartment of its own.
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2628.008,2629.873,There are differences.
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2680.879,2684.048,"Well, are you familiar with the Wilmington Bus case?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2684.048,2684.604,Sir?
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2684.604,2687.323,The Wilmington Bus situation?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2687.323,2689.244,Wilmington --
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2689.244,2699.199,"Well, obviously you don't, but I mean that, once the state takes over, it's not a private business any longer."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2699.199,2699.769,That's --
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2699.769,2705.718,"And, you do recognize the right of HUD to set rules and regulations or not?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2705.718,2706.941,"No, sir."
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2706.941,2708.63,You don't recognize that?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2708.63,2716.822,"Within the limits of their annual contributions contracts, they do have that right and privilege."
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2719.408,2728.045,"Well, that's why I wanted to get this preliminary to this circular, because it want to know whether you say this circular is binding or not."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2728.045,2729.805,I say it's not.
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2729.805,2729.943,"It's not, why?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2729.943,2732.006,"And, the reasons for that are these."
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2903.986,2907.324,Is the Durham Housing Authority abiding by that --
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2907.324,2907.478,It is --
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2907.478,2907.874,Or not?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2907.874,2909.429,It is right now.
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2909.429,2910.677,It is abiding by it?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2910.677,2911.982,"It is, yes, sir."
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2911.982,2914.523,But it doesn't consider it to be retroactive?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2914.523,2916.301,It does not consider to be retroactive and --
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2916.301,2929.136,"Well, as of tomorrow, a person -- Mrs. Thorpe, if she's put back on a regular stay, that she couldn't be put out without a due process hearing?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2929.136,2937.399,"We -- I think, as a matter of policy, what the housing authority would do as they're now doing would be to follow the procedures set out in the HUD."
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2937.399,2947.678,"Well since this case is still being litigated, wouldn't the best way to be is just to get about this?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2947.678,2949.839,To forget about the conviction --
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2949.839,2952.902,"About this one woman, Mrs. Thorpe."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2952.902,2966.871,"I think that, as a practical matter, the -- unless the Court wants to establish some new concept and make some pronouncements as to constitutional law about the thing, why, that won't be true."
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2966.871,2977.833,"But couldn't your clients, without any Constitutional Law, pronounce if there's anything else, moot the states?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2977.833,2979.586,They could.
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2979.586,2980.84,But it hasn't?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,2980.84,2983.511,"They haven't done so, that's correct."
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2983.511,2985.906,"Mr. Edwards, perhaps I don't understand you."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3008.265,3008.879,"I do, sir."
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3011.513,3029.248,On page 31 (a) of the petitioner's brief is an excerpt from the low-rent housing manual.
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3047.844,3055.115,"Not necessarily, the -- I think that the annual contributions contract, that HUD rights --"
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3055.115,3058.028,That exhausts its authority?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3058.028,3064.789,"That -- the HUD rights, the annual contributions contract and the authority enters into that contract with them."
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3064.789,3068.141,And that exhausts the HUD's authority?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3068.141,3079.647,"That does, unless the contract provides that it shall be -- that certain things shall be done pursuant to HUD's, from time to time, directive and advice."
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3079.647,3088.632,Does the contract contain any reference to the manual or to circulars or regulations to be issued by --
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3088.632,3089.003,"No, sir."
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3089.003,3091.221,By HUD?
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3091.221,3095.838,"No sir, it does not provide that HUD be given the authority to --"
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3095.838,3113.823,"It says, you note in the same page, the PHA manuals, which are now HUD I guess, contain the requirements which supplement the provisions of the contracts between the local authority and the PHA."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3116.316,3131.054,"I tell you, no, sir, because I think that what they're talking about are those areas where there needs to be some rulemaking and there's, for example, with respect to keeping the records."
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3131.054,3146.122,"That didn't so -- I suggest if you look at page 32 (a) subparagraph 4, it seems to be just as broad as it could be with respect to the operation of the projects after initial occupancy."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3146.122,3148.446,That's the PHA requirements.
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3175.135,3198.856,"Well, to pursue my brother Marshall questions, if you assume, contrary to your present argument, if you assume that this circular is binding on the local Housing Authority, there's no question that it would require notice, etcetera, to Mrs. -- to a tenant upon termination of her tenancy."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3198.856,3208.78,"I don't think it would, sir but necessarily as a matter of law and, for this reason, you analyze the circular itself."
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3307.149,3324.457,"So, you think we really have to decide the constitutional question here because the circular -- you think this circular is just a statement of the belief which may or may not be regarded by the local authorities praise-worthy, but certainly is not binding on it."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3324.457,3326.123,I think that's correct.
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3326.123,3328.562,"Mr. Edwards, let me ask you this question."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3429.838,3430.195,"No, sir."
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3443.571,3454.87,"Well, then, why shouldn't he be entitled to know if that was the reason for his ejection or if it wasn't?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3454.87,3459.289,"In Court, I think he would be entitled to inquire into the matter, and that's where --"
1968.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3459.289,3461.166,In your eviction process?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3461.166,3462.148,In the eviction process.
1968.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3488.605,3495.661,"Then, the Supremacy Clause would also require consideration of any binding rules of the Federal Authority."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3495.661,3501.595,"Exactly so, and so you have to consider in this course, it's no -- there's no question about it."
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3510.971,3511.088,Well --
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3511.088,3512.327,"And, in fact -- excuse me sir."
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3512.327,3537.966,"I understood that you thought that, because that made a contract in connection with this tenancy, that there was no substantial difference between the case where the government is the landlo -- is the owner and the case where the land owner is a private individual."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3537.966,3538.521,I'm think --
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3538.521,3555.838,"That all he'd have to show would be that “my contract with this tenant is to the effect that on 15-days notice, I can terminate the tenancy and I don't have to give any reason at all for it.”"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3555.838,3556.17,"No, sir."
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3587.199,3599.43,It isn't true then that the Courts of North Carolina held that all they had to show was that the 15-days notice had been given.
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3599.43,3599.74,"No, sir."
1968.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3640.29,3661.263,"Is the difference between you and your adversary that you claim that these rights should be raised in the Court and they claim a right under the constitution, we can say that the constitution requires that they be given -- they give no -- the agent of the Authority give notice to them before they go to Court?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3661.263,3662.541,"That is our difference, yes, sir."
1968.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3662.541,3670.743,"And the statute required that, as it does in these states, you would of course have to prove that notice had been given or you couldn't evict."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3670.743,3672.6,"Well, we did give notice."
1968.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3672.6,3673.682,"Well, I don't understand that."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3674.88,3674.992,"Yes, sir."
1968.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3674.992,3688.512,"Claiming that you ought to have a right to try it in the Court whether or not you give them notice and, if you didn't, if the contract required it, or the policy of the Act required it, then you think that she would win in the Court because she hadn't been given notice."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3688.512,3689.544,That's correct.
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3689.544,3694.223,Where do we find that articulated in your brief?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3694.223,3720.49,"The -- on page 8, we talk about the adequacy of the trial below, sir, in which adequate hearing was provided in the trial below, if that's the point that you were referring to."
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3720.49,3729.011,But is there a concession in your brief that that they are entitled to?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3729.011,3729.731,"Yes, sir."
1968.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3779.275,3782.236,"You could utilize her by throwing her out, but you haven't done that."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3782.236,3821.337,"That's correct, and we concede that and we say that that is a -- it was found to be relevant by the Trial Court and passed upon by the Trial Court and when it -- of course, when it was here before, there were some language in the opinion of the Supreme Court that indicated that it might be considering it irrelevant that such an issue be raised, but when it went back for re-hearing, the Court reviewed them out and said, in effect, that the Trial Court had before it whether her First Amendment rights have been violated and so on, and that the Court -- the Trial Court decided issue on competent evidence and it should be sustained."
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3821.337,3821.864,Mr. --
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3821.864,3822.144,What's --
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3822.144,3839.466,"Mr. Edwards, would you take the same position if this were -- housing project were privately owned and you have exactly the same facts, or let's take the more ex -- dramatic illustration that the Chief Justice put to you."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3870.33,3905.003,"If I were representing the tenants or if I were a judge considering the matter, I would say they would have a valid right under Shelley versus Kraemer or the cases of that sort in which they go into the State Court and ask the Court to enforce something such as a trespass criminal case or an eviction proceeding and say that you -- and would say that the constitution forbids the State Courts from taking this kind of governmental action to implement that kind of denial of constitutions."
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3905.003,3925.552,"So that, this is a qualification of the property owner's right in his property, that is, the qualification being that he cannot discriminate on the grounds of race --"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3925.552,3926.32,Certainly --
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3926.32,3933.149,Stand terminating the tenancy of pers -- of tenants because they are Negros.
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3933.149,3936.572,"It would certainly be arguable and, of course, the --"
1968.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3936.572,3937.89,"Well, I wouldn't argue anything."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,3987.328,4009.035,"And, the only answer I can give is that some of these -- most of the cases in the past have said that the fact that it is a governmental agency is relevant to that issue, that the restrictions of the constitution were framed to restrain government because it had unusual powers."
1968.20,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4009.035,4013.311,The only reason that this is a constitutional right is because this is government.
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4018.26,4025.233,"That's correct and the -- but, I'm saying, too, that in the Shelley versus Kraemer situation where you go into the Courts and just say --"
1968.20,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4025.233,4026.683,"Well, that would also be covered."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4031.665,4031.888,Right.
1968.20,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4031.888,4034.258,"And under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, that would probably --"
1968.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4034.258,4048.466,"Can I ask you if in the -- you say that the eviction hearing -- in the eviction hearing, federal issues may be raised and litigated and disposed of, and you seem to say that it would be required."
1968.20,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4084.268,4085.113,"No, sir."
1968.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4085.113,4086.118,Does he have to answer the question?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4086.118,4088.758,I think you'd have to answer the question --
1968.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4088.758,4089.112,"And, what if he said --"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4089.112,4090.307,In the cross-examination.
1968.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4090.307,4096.246,What if he says “No reason at all I just didn't like you.”?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4096.246,4097.912,Then he would've answered the question.
1968.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4103.359,4105.404,"But then, how does the eviction hearing come out?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4105.404,4112.889,"I think that the Housing Authority would succeed that, if there was no reason at all, her con -- there was no constitutional --"
1968.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4112.889,4119.839,"Unless there were some federal rule that says some reasons, there has to be some good reason."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4119.839,4125.16,"That's correct, and then we're saying that, as the matter now stands and has in the past --"
1968.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4125.16,4130.523,"Well, there aren't any sp -- un -- there aren't any banned reason except constitutional right."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4130.523,4144.033,The bad reasonings are the constitutional ones and we can't -- the statute doesn't say there has to be any other kind of reasons and we don't think that the constitution says that you have to have other kind of reasons.
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4178.871,4183.37,"Can I ask you, why is -- why are they appointed by the mayor?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4183.37,4183.796,Sir?
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4183.796,4191.326,"If it's just like a private organization, renting company, why is it appointed by the mayor?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4191.326,4193.34,Because it's handling public funds.
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4194.306,4196.534,"Well, when it's handling public funds, it's different."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4198.092,4200.718,"That is one point but, I take it, the --"
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4200.718,4204.402,"It's the point as the constitution, is it not?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4204.402,4224.645,"I was -- my position was, sir, that some of at least he restrictions of the constitution between this -- between an individual and the government, they were designed to prevent government through its greater thought, its greater power, and so forth, from imposing on the individual."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4272.692,4276.159,"I just -- there's something wrong but, I think, legally, no, there's nothing wrong with it."
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4276.159,4281.096,"But you could do it, the Durham Housing Authority couldn't make such a rule."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4281.096,4282.628,"That is correct, I'm sure."
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4282.628,4284.416,"Well, that's another difference, isn't it?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4284.416,4285.495,"That's correct, sir."
1968.20,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4285.495,4288.919,"And, isn't that what's involved in this case?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4288.919,4305.674,"That is involved in this case and it was decided in this case because of the prese -- the petitioner presented her contention of what right was being violated, the Court listened on the evidence on it and decided against the petition. That is this case."
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4305.674,4317.977,Let me read to you from the findings of the Court that I get from the transcript.
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4385.932,4386.673,"Yes, that's right."
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4389.543,4393.749,No that's on appeal to the Superior Court.
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4393.749,4402.762,"That was the judgment of the Supreme Court in North Carolina, what you just read, per curiam opinion in the first case."
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4404.819,4404.941,Yes.
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4404.941,4406.231,Supreme Court of North Carolina twice.
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4406.231,4406.769,"Yes, that's true."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4406.769,4408.036,That's the first time.
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4408.036,4414.121,But where do they ever -- where did they ever say that she had a constitutional right to test these other matters?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4414.121,4422.061,"On their -- when it went back on re-hearing, they considered that matter and the Supreme Court of North Carolina --"
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4422.061,4423.149,Where do we find that?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4423.149,4427.822,On re-hearing -- it's page 39 -- wait a minute.
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4427.822,4428.863,Yes?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4428.863,4434.095,"The -- wherever the opinion is of the Court, I believe it's --"
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4435.426,4434.095,Yes.
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4438.694,4439.066,Find it.
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4439.066,4440.68,Whether --
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4440.68,4445.901,The Court on re-hearing said this.
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4477.736,4481.172,"Now, where did Judge Picket so find?"
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4481.172,4490.851,"In the Superior Court judgment which -- in this appendix here, that was upon --"
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4490.851,4492.941,Is that language that I just read?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4492.941,4493.511,"No, sir."
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4493.511,4495.577,Is that page 28?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4495.577,4500.485,The language that you just read was one of the findings it is true.
1968.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4500.485,4501.908,On page 21?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4501.908,4536.49,"21, finding number 10 says this is the finding of the Court below that the plaintiff, Housing Authority to the City of Durham, acting through C.S. Oldham, its Manager and Executive Director, gave notice to the defendant to vacate said premises, not because she had engaged in efforts to organize the tenants of McDougald Terrace nor because she was elected president of a group organizing McDougald Terrace on August 10, 1965 that these were not the reason the said notice was given and eviction undertaken."
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4537.71,4541.575,"That's the finding, but the judgment says that's immaterial."
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4541.575,4541.769,The --
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4541.769,4542.879,It makes no difference.
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4567.612,4574.552,"That, of course, if Your Honor please, is not the opinion or not the judgment in the Trial Court."
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4581.124,4581.39,Well --
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4581.39,4592.399,"As it appeared when the case was first heard in that Supreme Court, but what I'm saying is that when it went back to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, they added --"
1968.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4592.399,4593.812,Do you mean on our remand?
1968.20,1,20804,daniel_k_edwards,,4593.812,4595.564,"On your remand, yes, sir."
