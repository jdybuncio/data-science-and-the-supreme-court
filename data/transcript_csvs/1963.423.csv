1963.423,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.05,1016.455,Is interest one of them?
1963.423,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1016.455,1027.734,"Interest, I would say, would be one that -- that I -- I -- my contention on one part of this case is that interest during the bankruptcy proceedings is not provable at all."
