1977.76-1629,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,26.751,29.606,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1629,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,364.434,366.096,Can I ask you one question.
1977.76-1629,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,370.815,372.305,Who pays for the Tribal Courts?
1977.76-1629,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,372.305,372.598,Yeah.
1977.76-1629,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,372.598,381.979,"The Tribal Courts, Tribal Judges are paid by the tribe, tribal courts, the buildings --"
1977.76-1629,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,381.979,384.307,You are sure they are not paid by the Federal Government.
1977.76-1629,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,384.307,391.996,"No, they are paid in the -- this is not in the record, but the Navajo Tribal Court, their judges are paid by the Tribe."
1977.76-1629,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,399.361,401.283,"Yeah, that is what I thought."
1977.76-1629,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,401.283,404.601,-- which go towards the payment of judicial salaries and the clerk salaries.
1977.76-1629,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,404.601,407.107,"And that is not broken down, so it would not have plenty of --"
1977.76-1629,0,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,407.107,416.799,"Well, the point I want to make with that is there are, as I understand it, no conditions imposed on payment of these appropriations for judges."
1977.76-1629,1,43167,thomas_w_otoole,,1389.678,1391.742,Thank you Your Honor.
1977.76-1629,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1506.409,1510.311,Would that have much to do with jurisdiction?
1977.76-1629,1,43167,thomas_w_otoole,,1510.311,1520.207,"Well, Your honor, this is merely an example of the pervasive control of the Federal Government over all aspects of tribal life."
1977.76-1629,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1520.207,1530.201,"I agree, it is historically true that there has been pervasive control in many many respects but it does not really go to the heart of jurisdiction, does it?"
1977.76-1629,1,43167,thomas_w_otoole,,1530.201,1538.934,"Well, I submit Your Honor, that the key to this case is whether Indian tribes are sovereign like states in the Federal Government and the very --"
1977.76-1629,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1538.934,1543.845,They are not sovereign or like the Federal Government or like states.
1977.76-1629,1,43167,thomas_w_otoole,,1543.845,1556.207,"Well, as this court has long recognized the dual sovereignty exception, never has been applied out of a context of successive state and federal prosecutions."
1977.76-1629,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1572.527,1576.683,"It does not have any residual sovereignty, does it?"
1977.76-1629,1,43167,thomas_w_otoole,,1579.97,1580.61,"That is correct, it emanates."
1977.76-1629,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1580.61,1582.593,Sovereignty in the first place.
1977.76-1629,1,43167,thomas_w_otoole,,1582.593,1586.616,"That is correct, it emanates from a grant of power from the constitution."
1977.76-1629,2,42194,stephen_l_urbanczyk,,3420.56,3424.265,Just one or two very short points Mr. Chief Justice Thank you.
