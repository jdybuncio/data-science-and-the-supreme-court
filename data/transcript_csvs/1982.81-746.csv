1982.81-746,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.226,We will hear arguments next in City of Akron against Akron Center for Reproductive Health.
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,78.17,119.341,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the principal issues presented in this case are whether the state may reasonably regulate in the area of abortion in a manner designed to ensure an informed decision by a pregnant woman in a situation where there in fact is no physician-patient relationship; likewise, whether the state may require parental consent or judicial consent as a prerequisite to an abortion to be performed upon an immature minor; and finally, exactly what is the standard of review that should be applied in the testing of abortion-related legislation."
1982.81-746,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,236.544,249.226,"When you suggested that no patient was challenging the statute, did you mean to suggest that only a patient could challenge the statute?"
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,249.226,249.975,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,447.519,456.281,"Counsel, is the city relying on all four of the alleged state interests that you described in this instance?"
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,456.281,457.72,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,457.72,458.141,Okay.
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,459.187,461.546,There is another aspect to abortion--
1982.81-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,461.546,462.248,Mr. Segedy--
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,462.248,462.716,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,462.716,470.494,"--may I ask, the district court on the parental consent provision held it unconstitutional, did it not?"
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,470.494,472.476,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,472.476,475.276,And who took it to the court of appeals?
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,476.243,489.159,"Your Honor, the... in what was effectively a cooperative effort, the defendant intervenors raised the specific question within their briefs as to the parental consent provision."
1982.81-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,495.031,499.796,"Well, now, the intervenors didn't bring... didn't come here."
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,499.796,519.052,"Your Honor, the intervenors petitioned this Court also on that question, and we can only speculate whether this Court denied that petition because it was a duplication of the city's petition, and therefore, not being aware of any possible standing arguments, simply determined that--"
1982.81-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,519.052,525.989,"But I am correct then that you litigated the issue in the district court and lost, correct?"
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,525.989,527.393,"--When you say ""you"", Your Honor, you mean--"
1982.81-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,527.393,527.97,The city.
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,527.97,528.629,--the City of Akron?
1982.81-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,528.629,529.721,"That's true, isn't it?"
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,529.721,531.565,That's correct.
1982.81-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,531.565,535.641,And then the City of Akron did not formally appeal to the court of appeals in that event.
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,538.218,542.231,"Well, the City of Akron did also, Your Honor, in terms of raising it on oral argument."
1982.81-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,542.231,546.216,"Well, I... but you didn't file a formal appeal from that aspect of--"
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,546.216,546.669,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,546.669,547.995,--You appealed from some ruling.
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,547.995,550.743,"There are numerous questions in the case, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,550.743,551.461,"Yes, I should say there are."
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,552.244,553.492,Even more than there are now.
1982.81-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,553.492,557.567,"Well, did you appeal from the judgment against you in the district court?"
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,557.567,558.476,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,563.113,570.721,Did you appeal from the parental consent for minors ruling?
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,570.721,572.846,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,572.846,580.746,"Well, I take it you appeal from a judgment, and then you may assign errors or points to be relied on in the court of appeals."
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,580.746,581.167,The questions presented--
1982.81-746,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,581.167,582.185,"Yes, questions presented."
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,589.4,590.9,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.054,788.758,Where did Dr. Bliss reside?
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,788.758,790.24,"In Cincinnati, Ohio."
1982.81-746,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,811.058,827.055,"May I ask, is it a fact that under Ohio law, the court that has jurisdiction is the juvenile court, and that also under your law the juvenile court would have to inform the parent in every case?"
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,827.055,829.711,"Your Honor, we would submit that that is not true."
1982.81-746,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,841.264,843.436,Does the statute on its face require the notice?
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,843.436,851.419,"The rule, the Juvenile rule provides for information or notice to be given to the parents."
1982.81-746,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,851.419,855.649,"To the parent, and you are saying that in light of decisions of this Court, that would be invalidated?"
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,855.649,865.695,"Your Honor, we would submit, first of all, that the juvenile court could disregard that provision as applied to a pregnant minor seeking an abortion."
1982.81-746,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,889.887,894.524,But you do have the alternative of an independent decision-maker--
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,894.524,904.928,"That's correct, Your Honor, through the juvenile court, and the purpose of the juvenile court under the Ohio statutes, in 2151.01, the very first statute, is to protect the minor."
1982.81-746,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,904.928,920.81,"--But under Bellotti 2 and Matheson, certainly the view that at least four Justices expressed, notice to the parent required as a matter of law would present a difficulty for your case, would it not?"
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,920.81,923.138,"If that were the case, Your Honor--"
1982.81-746,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,923.138,923.528,Yes.
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,923.528,924.389,--for minors under 15.
1982.81-746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,939.817,945.876,You mentioned the young age involved here.
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,952.373,971.336,"Your Honor, in Planned Parenthood versus Danforth, this Court noted that not all minors, regardless of age or maturity, are capable of consenting to an abortion, and I think that it is possible for the state to make a determination at some point that parental consent may be required."
1982.81-746,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.336,977.239,Are you arguing in this case that Danforth does not apply in the ages below 15?
1982.81-746,0,16960,alan_g_segedy,,977.239,978.893,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1042.338,1050.411,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to address the issue of the standard of review."
1982.81-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1273.193,1274.768,May I ask you this question?
1982.81-746,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1274.768,1275.174,Yes.
1982.81-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1275.174,1282.626,"Supposing the record of the Akron proceedings, and I am not familiar with it, show a total failure to consider the question of maternal health."
1982.81-746,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1286.904,1291.185,"The argument would still apply, though there might be another consideration that would come in at that point."
1982.81-746,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1441.855,1446.588,"Mr. Solicitor General, are you asking that Roe v. Wade be overruled?"
1982.81-746,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1446.588,1448.09,"I am not, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1982.81-746,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1448.09,1448.667,Why not?
1982.81-746,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1448.667,1456.879,"That is not one of the issues presented in this case, and as amicus appearing before the Court, that would not be a proper function for us."
1982.81-746,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1456.879,1464.269,It seems to me that your brief in essence asks either that or the overruling of Marbury against Madison.
1982.81-746,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1464.269,1466.987,Neither.
1982.81-746,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1509.453,1511.204,May I ask one other question?
1982.81-746,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1522.867,1523.413,--Yes.
1982.81-746,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1674.165,1676.883,"Mr. Lee, did you write this brief personally?"
1982.81-746,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1676.883,1679.897,"Very substantial parts of it, Justice Blackmun."
1982.81-746,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1679.897,1685.411,Mr. Landsman?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,1685.411,1702.935,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Akron ordinance before the Court today requires that when any woman seeks an abortion in the City of Akron, she and her physician must comply with at least 14 separate and distinct requirements before the procedure may be performed."
1982.81-746,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1791.006,1795.709,Didn't the Court make it clear in Roe that the right is not an unqualified right?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,1795.709,1797.412,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1799.865,1803.27,Only that limitation?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,1803.27,1813.108,"Your Honor, with respect to further steps, one would have to ask what particular stage of the pregnancy we are at and a variety of other things."
1982.81-746,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1813.108,1822.744,"Do you suggest that the use of that language, that it is not unqualified, doesn't mean that it isn't qualified by some state interests?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,1822.744,1826.994,"Your Honor, this Court clearly indicated that it is qualified by state interest of--"
1982.81-746,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1826.994,1829.24,Not just what the doctor tells her.
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,1829.24,1830.289,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2138.304,2149.14,"Mr. Landsman, how do you respond to the argument that in the abortion clinic setting, the danger is of one-sided information of the other kind, and the statute is intended to equalize the scales?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2149.14,2156.358,"Your Honor, there is absolutely no evidence in this record that the information provided by the clinic is at all one-sided."
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.444,2187.047,"Is it not true that at least insofar as people who are motivated by economic incentives, that there would be at least arguably a risk of one-sided presentation by the person who has an interest, a financial interest in having the abortion performed?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2187.047,2190.186,"Again, there is simply no evidence in this record that that is the case, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2190.186,2197.513,"When you say the record, do you include the record of the discussions before the Akron legislative body, whatever it was, that adopted the ordinance?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2197.513,2197.997,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2206.557,2208.382,Are they a matter of public record?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2208.382,2212.32,"Your Honor, I believe that there are tapes of those proceedings."
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.958,2216.411,They were not presented to the lower court by either side?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2216.411,2217.491,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2218.209,2218.739,I see.
1982.81-746,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2218.739,2234.059,"Well, when you try to clear a registration statement with the SEC, they insist that the issue of put in all of the bad news in effect, and simply leave it up to the issuer to put in good news if he wants to, but the SEC's only concern is with the disadvantages of the thing."
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2236.2,2256.735,"Your Honor, ironically, I believe that the good news of abortion, the safety of the technique and so forth, may in fact not be possible for the physician to say, because the seven scripted statements must be spoken, and it is unclear whether the physician can indeed contradict those statements where they are incorrect or provide material that corrects their misimpressions."
1982.81-746,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2267.544,2270.964,Did any of your... Do you represent the doctor in the case?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2270.964,2271.807,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2271.807,2275.465,"Did he ever try to comply with the statute, or was this just a declarative--"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2275.465,2278.525,"Your Honor, this was enjoined before it was ever to be enforced."
1982.81-746,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2279.664,2290.005,"--Counsel, did I understand you to say that in each of these clinics, there was an hour-long consultation with the patient prior to the abortion?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2290.005,2297.314,"--At a minimum, there is an hour-long consultation between a counselor or a registered nurse and each patient, but in addition--"
1982.81-746,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2297.314,2298.534,Not the physician?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2298.534,2309.137,"--The physician had informed consent discussions with each patient, as the district court held, for a minimum of, I think the record says five minutes, before any further procedures are done."
1982.81-746,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2314.558,2315.104,In five minutes?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2315.104,2317.774,"--Your Honor, approximately five minutes in each case."
1982.81-746,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2323.756,2327.441,Is the one-hour discussion conducted by a registered nurse?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2327.441,2333.969,"Your Honor, in at least two of the clinics the informed consent section of that discussion is with a registered nurse."
1982.81-746,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2338.703,2352.698,"Is it one on one, or is it conducted in groups, as in a clinic we had here from Boston a few years ago in Bellotti, where there would be six or eight women of varying ages with varying problems?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2355.479,2358.15,"The record indicates that both are done, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2358.15,2358.618,Sir?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2358.618,2362.272,That it is done both on a one on one basis and that it is done in a group setting.
1982.81-746,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2362.272,2362.755,In groups.
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2362.755,2375.203,"Now, part of the time is spent individually with each woman, especially when the informed consent is signed, but part is spent in a group setting, although some women may just get the individualized counseling."
1982.81-746,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2525.471,2534.92,Do you think it would have been appropriate and constitutional if the cooling off period as you describe it was before the signing of the consent?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2534.92,2535.594,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2586.946,2599.846,"Mr. Landsman, supposing we were to agree with you on Subsection (b), that the information was one-sided and therefore that violated the Constitution, and what remained was just hay that said there had to be something signed as an intelligent consent."
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2603.909,2605.563,"Your Honor, would the waiting period still be bad?"
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.563,2606.109,Yes.
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2606.109,2606.689,Yes.
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.689,2607.89,If you just had a waiting period from--
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2607.89,2610.858,"Your Honor, the waiting period would still be unconstitutional."
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2610.858,2615.483,--And why would it be bad if you didn't have a one-sided presentation in the interval?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2615.483,2625.883,"Because it imposes a significant number of burdens on women seeking abortions without, as the court of appeals said, any medical basis therefore at all."
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2627.009,2629.24,"Well, but they don't argue medical basis for this."
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2638.564,2647.748,"--Your Honor, I believe that the appropriate standard is, does it conform to a compelling state interest, and is it narrowly drawn to meet that interest?"
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.462,2661.071,"--Well, that is because you are not open seven days a week."
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2661.071,2666.491,"No, Your Honor, it is more because of the privacy concerns of the women involved, and because--"
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2666.491,2670.177,"Well, but is it not correct that neither of these clinics is open seven days a week?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2670.177,2671.05,--That is absolutely true.
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2671.05,2671.678,They are open two or three days.
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2671.678,2672.505,"That's right, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2672.505,2678.705,"So if someone comes in at 5:00 o'clock on Friday afternoon, say, isn't there a danger that the person will be told, come back Monday?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2678.705,2686.029,"But that is only a small part of the problem, because for each woman, she has family obligations, and she has employment obligations as well."
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2686.029,2686.516,"Well, for instance--"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2686.516,2687.889,It is not a matter of clinic convenience.
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2696.277,2701.758,--You can't say that every person who is asked to wait 24 hours is going to have these serious adverse consequences.
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2701.758,2703.774,"--Your Honor, a substantial number."
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2715.63,2715.988,In Tennessee.
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2715.988,2716.644,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2717.096,2718.8,"This is Akron, Ohio."
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2718.8,2732.87,"--The evidence in our case is precisely the same, Your Honor, that because of familial concerns, because of employment concerns, as well as the medical efficiency concerns, these delays are not going to be 24 hours in almost any case."
1982.81-746,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2808.279,2824.644,"How do you think this compares, if that is the right term, with the rather repeated disclaimers in the holdings of the court that the court was not endorsing abortion on demand?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,2836.643,2837.86,"I think not, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3091.632,3103.019,Can an out-patient clinic in Akron or in Ohio generally be licensed in the sense that they can be licensed in the first case?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3103.019,3107.764,There is no significant licensing provision from the state of Ohio.
1982.81-746,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3107.764,3109.796,Only traditional hospitals can be licensed as--
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3109.796,3111.313,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3119.026,3128.724,"--Counsel, you referred to the standards of the American College that allows abortions up to age 18 weeks."
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3147.797,3153.529,"Your Honor, from the record as we have it here, one of the plaintiff's experts examined the clinics."
1982.81-746,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3166.756,3169.131,"In light of the College standards, did you say?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3169.131,3169.599,--That's right.
1982.81-746,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3170.695,3173.272,That is a freestanding surgical clinic?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3173.272,3177.363,--I am not entirely sure of all of the requirements that--
1982.81-746,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3177.363,3189.498,"Would those requirements include a governing board, an administrative supervisor, a physician, a registered nurse, specify very elaborate equipment?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3189.498,3195.917,"--Your Honor, I believe that those requirements do specify a number of special considerations."
1982.81-746,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3195.917,3198.151,"Yes, but my question... You brought up the College standards."
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3200.619,3211.382,"Your Honor, I am not sure that the clinics comply in each and every regard, but it is my belief that without any difficulty they could come into compliance with those standards if they were allowed to do so."
1982.81-746,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3295.518,3315.745,"In Ohio, if a 12 or 13-year-old girl goes to a hospital or to a doctor and he diagnoses that she has an acute appendix problem which requires surgery, will a hospital permit the surgery without the consent of the parents?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3315.745,3328.457,"--Your Honor, the testimony in this case with respect to obstetrics and gynecological care is that obstetricians and gynecologists in Akron and throughout the state, as a matter of fact, will provide such care without the parents' permission."
1982.81-746,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3328.457,3331.253,An appendectomy?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3331.253,3334.876,"Your Honor, there is no evidence in the record with respect to appendectomy."
1982.81-746,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3334.876,3337.391,I am asking as a question of law.
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3337.391,3340.92,"As a matter of law, I do not know the answer, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3386.747,3390.105,You said that the defendants didn't appeal the ruling of the district court.
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3395.728,3396.695,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3396.695,3398.476,Did they file a notice of appeal from the judgment?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3398.476,3399.537,"Yes, they did, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3399.537,3404.38,"Are you saying, then, in effect, that they didn't argue this to the court of appeals?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3404.38,3409.11,"No, in order to perfect an appeal, you have to identify the questions presented."
1982.81-746,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3414.094,3420.153,"So although they appealed the judgment, they didn't put this as a question presented in their brief."
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3420.153,3420.762,That's right.
1982.81-746,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3422.186,3426.338,"The parties... they were parties to the case, though, in the court of appeals?"
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3426.338,3428.463,"Your Honor, they did appeal on other matters."
1982.81-746,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3429.29,3431.712,And they argued it in the court of appeals?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3431.712,3432.539,Your Honor--
1982.81-746,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3432.539,3434.274,And they were permitted to argue it.
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3434.274,3436.322,"--They were permitted to argue, but they did--"
1982.81-746,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3436.322,3440.224,And the court of appeals did not object to their being there?
1982.81-746,2,41684,stephan_landsman,,3440.224,3441.94,"--Mr. Chief Justice, may I answer?"
1982.81-746,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3441.94,3444.424,We will resume at 1:00 o'clock.
1982.81-746,3,16960,alan_g_segedy,,3466.418,3478.397,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to briefly discuss with the Court some of the points that are shown in the record with respect to the operation of the abortion clinics in Akron."
1982.81-746,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3577.089,3580.384,Why do these doctors testify under a pseudonym?
1982.81-746,3,16960,alan_g_segedy,,3580.384,3584.697,"Your Honor, I believe it was because they were afraid of harassment or such."
1982.81-746,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3763.902,3765.918,"Your time has expired now, counsel."
1982.81-746,3,16960,alan_g_segedy,,3765.918,3766.698,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1982.81-746,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3766.698,3768.543,"Thank you, gentlemen."
