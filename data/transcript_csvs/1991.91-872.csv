1991.91-872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.986,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-872, United States against Salerno."
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,10.137,13.33,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,46.482,51.007,Did the court of appeals question whether or not there was a similar motive?
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,51.007,52.368,"No, they did not."
1991.91-872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,79.616,85.362,"Mr. Feldman, the district court found the Government did not have a similar motive."
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,86.143,86.754,That's correct.
1991.91-872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,86.754,93.92,"Was that a determination that there was no similar motive as a matter of law, or as a matter of fact?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,93.92,98.163,I believe that was largely a determination of fact.
1991.91-872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.945,109.231,It reads as though the district court decided as a matter of law that there never would be a similar motive at the grand jury proceeding.
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,110.242,117.698,--I think the factors that influenced the district court... a lot of those factors would probably be present in other cases.
1991.91-872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,133.039,134.929,"Well, do you think it's an issue of fact?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,134.929,136.852,"Yes, I do think it's an issue of fact."
1991.91-872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.852,143.477,And so on a case-by-case basis the court would have to determine whether there is similar motive.
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,143.477,154.054,"I think that... I think that as a general matter that's certainly... that's certainly true under Rule 804(b)(1), as the rule would be applied to a variety of different former proceedings."
1991.91-872,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.542,206.499,"Have the circuit courts discussed the question of the test for and the definition of similar motive, or is this still a very newly emergent doctrine?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,206.499,213.742,I think... I guess... I think it would be fair to say that it's been seen as largely a case-by-case factual determination.
1991.91-872,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,233.155,251.858,"If the Government decided that it wanted to question a witness extensively in order to lay the background for a perjury prosecution, but the objectives were... and the course of questioning was the same as would be pursued in the trial, is that a similar motive or a different motive?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,251.858,273.543,"I think, if I understand the hypothetical right, it would be a similar motive... at least... if what... if you have a particular piece of testimony that someone has given, the question is what is the Government's motive to discredit that testimony, and what is the Government's motive to discredit it by confronting that witness with a full cross-examination, as opposed to by just introducing contrary evidence when the witness leaves the grand jury."
1991.91-872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,296.368,298.238,"Mr. Feldman, can I ask you a question there?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,317.643,326.159,I would quibble with the question just insofar as I'm not sure that the Government did have much of a motive to discredit these witnesses.
1991.91-872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,326.159,328.931,"Well, if they thought they were lying, and that there really was this conspiracy, they surely had a motive."
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,336.367,337.038,That's right.
1991.91-872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,337.318,341.312,And they didn't have any motive to show that perjurers on the grand jury were liars.
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,341.312,345.726,"--Well, I... the Government may have some... maybe I... the Government may have some motive to show that."
1991.91-872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,360.615,360.755,"Well, that may be true."
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,370.242,375.688,"I... well, the rule requires similarity of motive, not total absence of motive."
1991.91-872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,403.56,404.178,Those are all good reasons.
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,409.263,410.333,I believe they are.
1991.91-872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.715,460.643,"Could you also just... while I've interrupted you... comment on the similarity of the situation for a defense... a witness at a preliminary hearing where the defendant decides, for tactical reasons, not to cross-examine?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,462.205,467.308,"I... again, I don't really want to make broad rules for all of these things."
1991.91-872,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.736,528.879,"Mr. Feldman, don't you think a similar motive means similar in degree?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,545.33,547.631,"--No, I... Your Honor, I don't think it does."
1991.91-872,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.635,566.068,"You mean similar in degree, as well as in time."
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,566.068,566.978,--I think it should be similar both in type and degree.
1991.91-872,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.449,575.235,And I don't understand your argument that you think this whole thing should be considered under (b)(5) instead of under (b)(1)?
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,594.817,596.961,I tend to think that it can.
1991.91-872,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,615.656,618.25,"You mean the district court can say, well, this is really not a similar motive."
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,627.796,640.225,"I believe... well, I think a district court could say we're going to look at this testimony and look at all of its characteristics, including the relationship of the declarant to the defendants, to the Government, the circumstances under which the declarant testified."
1991.91-872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.022,664.231,"Well, Mr. Feldman, is it still the law as it was when I went to law school and when I practiced that the district court... the trial court is given a considerable amount of discretion in deciding whether or not a particular piece of evidence is relevant or not?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,664.231,664.692,Yes.
1991.91-872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,664.692,671.697,"That a district court could decide some of these questions either way, and should not be reversed by a court of appeals?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,671.697,673.448,I think that's right.
1991.91-872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,842.492,843.784,May I just raise one question?
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,846.857,847.656,--That's right.
1991.91-872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.656,850.888,"And, of course, their theory was that the witness was unavailable."
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,851.719,853.9,"No, we agree, actually."
1991.91-872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.725,860.906,Right.
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,860.906,868.99,"And the... therefore, in order for the defendants to get the... the evidence in in this case, there had to be a finding that the witness is unavailable."
1991.91-872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.99,871.504,"Actually, they were unavailable to the defendant, but not to the Government, was their theory."
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,871.504,872.052,Right.
1991.91-872,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.562,991.958,"Well, but as I understand the court of appeals, the court of appeals saying, well, that may be, but the Government has no basis to complain about that because the Government has the remedy right in its pocket."
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,991.958,993.2,That's--
1991.91-872,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,993.2,997.244,"If you don't think it's reliable enough, then give them immunity."
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,997.244,999.105,--That's what the court of appeals said.
1991.91-872,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.539,1047.16,"Well, if you... I suppose... I suppose the Government would have to tell a defendant where a particular witness is, if the defendant didn't know."
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1047.16,1051.332,--I think it would depend on the circumstances.
1991.91-872,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1058.38,1065.405,"But if the witness is hiding somewhere, and the defendant can't find him, and the Government knows where he is, you would have to tell, I suppose?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1065.405,1073.379,"--I think... I would think that that would come something under... if there's a Brady obligation to do so, I think... yeah, under those circumstances."
1991.91-872,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1073.379,1073.95,"Well, is it a Brady obligation or not?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1073.95,1076.674,"I think under the right circumstances, yeah, there would be."
1991.91-872,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.674,1078.084,You mean not always.
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1081.636,1086.512,I don't... the only reason I don't want to answer that categorically is because it might depend on the--
1991.91-872,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1086.512,1090.515,"Well, you don't think that's somewhat similar to this situation?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1094.719,1095.58,--That's right.
1991.91-872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1154.45,1159.453,"You certainly were not agreeing with Justice White that you always have a duty to tell the whereabouts of witnesses, are you?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1159.453,1159.993,No.
1991.91-872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.993,1163.266,"I mean you've got a Witness Protection Program out there, I suppose."
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1163.266,1164.097,"Right, so that's what I was saying."
1991.91-872,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1175.294,1181.36,Did the defendant have the precise transcript of the grand jury testimony available to them?
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1181.36,1185.304,"No, the defendant didn't... they didn't have that, actually, until after the court of appeals' decision."
1991.91-872,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1185.304,1192.149,They just had information... did they have formal communication from you that there was exculpatory testimony?
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1192.149,1194.221,"Yes, that's what they had."
1991.91-872,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1210.566,1219.651,"If this is a factual question to be decided by the district court, they're at something of a disadvantage in arguing about the motive, aren't they?"
1991.91-872,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1229.418,1235.262,"No, I think as a general matter, that also... that, itself, is a decision the district court has to make in light of Rule 6(e)."
1991.91-872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1298.239,1299.648,"--Very well, Mr. Feldman."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1301.25,1311.168,"Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1379.122,1383.094,"Mr. Tigar, do I have the question presented wrong?"
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1404.469,1412.335,"Under the question presented, Justice Scalia, the answer is clearly yes, because the question presented misstates the rule."
1991.91-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1412.916,1413.537,"--Well, it's an easy case, then."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1417.01,1417.17,--Yes.
1991.91-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.17,1419.263,You're telling us it's an easy case.
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1419.263,1427.398,"Justice Scalia, it's an easy case on the question presented because the rule doesn't require a motive to cross-examine, it requires a motive to develop the testimony."
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1448.052,1450.554,"Yes, but we don't have to decide the case."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1455.649,1458.952,"--The Court has the power, Justice White--"
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1458.952,1459.57,"Yes, I agree."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1459.57,1459.941,--to do that.
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.941,1460.772,I agree with you.
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1462.965,1468.568,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, I am comfortable with the merits."
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.963,1494.457,But this wasn't the ground that the court of appeals relied on.
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1494.457,1495.756,"No, well the ground that the--"
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1495.756,1497.098,"Well, are you defending that or not?"
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1497.098,1498.8,"--I do defend that, Justice White."
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.8,1500.19,"Well, I think you better get with that for a while."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1500.19,1500.411,"Yes, Sir."
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1609.611,1624.5,I take it your bottom line is if we... the Government's position really requires a decision on whether the rule is constitutional.
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1624.5,1625.452,If the--
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.452,1627.453,"And it isn't, you would say?"
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1627.453,1630.565,"--If the Government's position is accepted, Justice White;--"
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.565,1630.775,Yes.
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1630.775,1636.401,"--if this adversarial fairness doctrine, which is routinely used is not invoked, it is unconstitutional."
1991.91-872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.732,1644.585,"But no, that was never suggested, even in the court of appeals, was it, that it was unconstitutional?"
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1644.585,1646.428,"--Yes, it was, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1991.91-872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1786.059,1793.365,"Your position, Mr. Tigar, is that the Government opens the door when it begins cross-examination in the grand jury?"
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1793.365,1797.258,"--No, Justice Kennedy, we do not take that position."
1991.91-872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1797.258,1799.099,When does this door get opened?
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1799.099,1806.694,"The door is opened, one... and the court of appeals went through this in Bahadar, so I'm not making it up as I go along."
1991.91-872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1840.231,1846.585,But the doctrine about opening the door so that you don't take an inconsistent position before the same trier of the fact.
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1847.816,1850.687,"--The inconsistent position, Justice Kennedy--"
1991.91-872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1850.687,1850.847,The trial jury.
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1850.847,1860.054,"--is that the Government indicted these defendants and said, members of the trial jury, there is a conspiracy here to rig bids."
1991.91-872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1880.249,1881.939,"Well, I'm still having trouble opening the door."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1883.461,1887.715,"--I apologize for the... I apologize to the... for the metaphor, sir."
1991.91-872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1887.715,1901.693,"I just... I'm aware of no doctrine of opening the door other than to avoid taking an inconsistent position before a trier of fact, which confuses the trier of fact."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1902.845,1912.292,"The door-opening concept... for example, in cases like Walder and Jones, the accused's statements are suppressed."
1991.91-872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2002.046,2007.381,"Well, your argument really boils down to the fact that the Government was obligated to immunize these people, doesn't it?"
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2007.381,2010.932,"No, Chief Justice Rehnquist, it does not."
1991.91-872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2054.333,2057.786,"But you're not saying it was involved in this case, then?"
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2057.786,2057.996,--That's right.
1991.91-872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2064.674,2078.692,"Well, I'm trying to figure out... you're saying, then... if you're not saying that in this case the Government has to immunize the witness, you're saying then that you simply agree with the court of appeals' interpretation of the rule that we're talking about?"
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2078.692,2079.774,--That's correct.
1991.91-872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2079.774,2083.257,That the similar motive requirement evaporates under certain circumstances?
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2083.257,2085.109,I'm saying three things:
1991.91-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2193.39,2195.463,"I don't know what you mean by derisory, Mr. Tigar."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2195.904,2203.049,"Oh, derisory... I am thinking of the Anita Isaacs episode in Ohio v. Roberts, Justice Scalia."
1991.91-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2258.128,2262.309,"--I don't want to use derisory, but I think you're not using the right word."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2262.91,2264.442,"I think, Justice Scalia--"
1991.91-872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2264.442,2265.552,"Cursory, I think."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2265.552,2266.653,--I'm sorry.
1991.91-872,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.741,2468.691,"I have one other question, Mr. Tigar."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2468.691,2468.961,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1991.91-872,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.961,2480.681,"I don't know if you've responded to it or not, but the Government argues that the... their motive in maintaining the security of the grand jury proceeding is of sufficient importance to negate the similar-motive requirement."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2486.755,2493.691,Their... we would not say that in every case grand jury testimony comes in.
1991.91-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.842,2664.47,"Mr. Tigar, did the court of appeals reach the question of whether the district court was clearly erroneous in finding no similar motive?"
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2666.52,2677.948,"What it said was it assumed, arguendo, that the... there was no similar motive to, quote, cross-examine, close quote."
1991.91-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2704.028,2715.106,"Well, it doesn't meet the de novo requirement, but it meets enough of the requirement to say that the court of appeals did not find enough basis on the facts to reverse the district court."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2715.917,2716.127,The court of appeals--
1991.91-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2716.127,2719.54,"--there may have been no motive, as the rule requires."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2719.54,2746.009,"--Justice Scalia, if the Court believes... now that the record has seen the light of day... that the court of appeals... if this Court believes the court of appeals' utterance is as delphic as is suggested by your question, then the proper course would be to remand, to ask the court of appeals what it would have done were all of this testimony now in the light of day so that it could really be argued about."
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.488,2768.643,So I take it you... you weren't... you don't think we're entitled to judge this case on the basis that there was no similar motive?
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2800.705,2812.724,"--Justice White, it is our position that they did not say ignore the rule, that they said that the bar of the rule cannot be relied on by the Government under these circumstances, as often happens."
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2812.724,2812.875,All right.
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2818.878,2821.028,"No, indeed, Justice White."
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2821.028,2821.439,Why?
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2821.439,2828.614,Because the record of this case contains the indisputable evidence of the way in which they developed the testimony.
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2828.614,2829.875,I know but we're reviewing a court of appeals' decision.
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2842.854,2858.596,"And I respectfully suggest, Chief Justice Rehnquist, as I said in my brief, that the theoretical statements in the petition for certiorari about the interests of the Government turn out to evaporate when you look at this testimony."
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2879.659,2885.472,"But to do that, we have to read that entire bundle of papers you've just thrown on your desk there."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2885.472,2887.325,The Government--
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2887.325,2887.634,Right?
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2888.936,2890.878,--I invite the Court to do so.
1991.91-872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2890.878,2892.04,"Yes, I know you do."
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2892.04,2899.425,"But the Government has not challenged my summary of it in my brief, and therefore I think that the Court can rely on what was said there."
1991.91-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.774,2918.577,I have one more... you mentioned that one of the two witnesses was given immunity for future testimony as well.
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2920.328,2921.547,--The other... yes.
1991.91-872,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2922.659,2925.06,"Well, then why was... why was he unavailable?"
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2925.06,2930.984,"--Well, the Government admitted in oral argument in the Second Circuit that neither witness was unavailable."
1991.91-872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2984.723,2988.684,"Well, I take it... were both witnesses called at the trial court and declined to testify?"
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2988.684,2992.557,"Yes, both witnesses were called an invoked their privilege against self-incrimination."
1991.91-872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3006.208,3009.758,"Well, was the immunity use immunity?"
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3009.758,3016.704,"Yes, it was for statutory immunity, approved by an Assistant Attorney General of the United States, as required by the statute."
1991.91-872,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3019.756,3028.163,But was the use... do we know whether the use immunity was confined to the immunity... to the testimony that was developed before the grand jury?
1991.91-872,1,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3028.163,3034.435,"The terms of the immunity grant, as read to the witness, DeMatteis, include all proceedings resulting therefrom or ancillary thereto."
1991.91-872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3056.965,3059.278,"Thank you, Mr. Tiger."
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3077.793,3082.657,It was really just to... show the background of this... of the case--
1991.91-872,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3082.657,3084.057,You didn't think that was an issue before the Court?
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3084.057,3100.758,"--We did not think... moreover, the first point I actually was going to make is if you look at the... for instance, page 19A of the petition appendix, the court of appeals' exact statement, and they only, I think, say this is the only statement about whether the Government had similar motive: While we agree that the Government may have--"
1991.91-872,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3100.758,3102.02,Where are you reading from?
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3102.02,3104.541,"--I'm sorry, it's page 19A of the petition appendix."
1991.91-872,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3104.541,3107.002,Whereabouts on that page?
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3107.002,3107.292,At the very bottom of the page.
1991.91-872,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3135.064,3135.571,"No, I understand that's what the court of appeals said."
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3138.105,3148.08,"Well, frankly, we thought that... we knew that this Court... it is possible that this Court could reach an issue that wasn't reached by the court of appeals, and we expected that respondents would raise that issue, and wanted to provide--"
1991.91-872,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3148.08,3158.928,"And really, we don't reach the issue presented by the question in the certiorari petition, unless we're satisfied that there was, in fact, a similar motive... or that there was not a similar motive."
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3158.928,3160.568,"--No, I don't think that's correct."
1991.91-872,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3223.133,3236.113,"Well, do you disagree with your opponent's representation that as to the witness DeMatteis that the immunity extended to trial?"
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3236.113,3236.714,"--Yes, we do."
1991.91-872,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3253.858,3258.432,"Was there a grant of immunity to him for all future proceedings, or all further proceedings?"
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3258.432,3266.257,"The form of the immunity grant is, I think, is accurately set out, as he quote... as the respondents... as Mr. Tigar quoted it in the respondents' brief."
1991.91-872,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3267.278,3271.672,"Well, why isn't a trial a further proceeding in relation to the grand jury?"
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3271.672,3274.314,--It could be a further proceeding.
1991.91-872,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3283.21,3284.992,I thought it was a grant of immunity.
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3284.992,3288.735,--There was a grant of... there was a grant of--
1991.91-872,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3288.735,3292.247,"That included further proceedings, which included the trial."
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3296.821,3299.113,"--I think... yeah, I think that's not correct."
1991.91-872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3331.386,3338.159,And there was no counter-argument made by your opposing counsel to that conclusion.
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3338.97,3351.119,I don't recall whether in the appellate briefs... I don't think that in the appellate briefs there was a specific... a specific argument that these declarants already were immunized.
1991.91-872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3355.383,3362.74,"Maybe it doesn't matter, but is it your position, then, that the reference in the original terms of the immunity to further proceedings is simply surplusage?"
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3362.74,3364.379,Yes.
1991.91-872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3364.379,3366.482,Why is it there?
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3366.782,3367.473,It would be--
1991.91-872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3367.473,3368.234,--Who's responsible for that?
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3379.212,3385.227,"--Well, the district court enters an immunity order, but it has to be presented to the court."
1991.91-872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3389.189,3395.474,But did an assistant attorney general of the United States approve a request for immunity on these terms?
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3395.474,3395.972,Yes.
1991.91-872,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3395.972,3397.634,"I.e., including the terms future proceedings?"
1991.91-872,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3397.634,3397.845,Yes.
1991.91-872,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3433.708,3434.319,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
