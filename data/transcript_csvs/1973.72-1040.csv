1973.72-1040,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.579,"Immediately after lunch we will take up number 72 1040, Communist Party of Indiana against Whitcomb."
1973.72-1040,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,17.151,20.593,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1973.72-1040,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,712.238,718.746,What do you understand the meaning of the phrase compelling interest to be?
1973.72-1040,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,718.746,753.791,"As I understand it to mean the state has to come forward with an interest that-- I don’t want to use the term outbalances, well I think the court's analysis in the Robel case of how legislation is to evaluated in terms of compelling interest is perhaps is the most apt, as I recall it was in a footnote, in the Robel case that the court discussed the fact that it wasn’t talking about balancing as such, it recognized on the one hand that freedom of speech is an important interest to our society and our government."
1973.72-1040,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,792.236,812.034,"Now that’s the availability of alternative means as it is something else, but I did not mean that, my question was an easy one, because I was really asking for information by the way and for help, what do you think the phrase compelling interest means constitutionally?"
1973.72-1040,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,812.034,859.104,"Alright, constitutionally I think it first means that a burden of proof is shifted, a burden of constitutional proof, whereas initially one who comes in to challenge a state law, has the burden of demonstrating that the state law is bad, wholly on his or her shoulders, when you establish a fundamental interest or if you are dealing with the equal protect clause of course of suspect classification, then the burden of proof shifts. First the burden of going forward, if you want to talk in evidentiary terms shifts to the government to come up with some legitimate reasons, some reasons that go beyond mere rationality which would be the ordinary standard to be applied in the equal protection or the due process area."
1973.72-1040,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,893.055,910.623,Do you think the phrase or the concept or the notion of whatever that phrase may mean or reflect compelling interests has any relevance at all in any area outside of the area of the equal protection clause?
1973.72-1040,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,910.623,930.701,"Yes, I think so I think Robel indicates that it has some relevance outside of that area, I know that it first originated in the equal protection clause but as it seems to me in the later decisions of the court to be something of a spillover into a First Amendment area because of the parallelity in the two tests--"
1973.72-1040,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,930.701,939.538,"Of course the state, anyways this is semantics but it seems to me a little more than that and a little more fundamental than that."
1973.72-1040,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,949.597,950.531,Certainly.
1973.72-1040,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,950.531,957.946,Because the law is simply unconstitutional that is regardless of how compelling the state interest might be.
1973.72-1040,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,957.946,965.589,I would certainly argue that Your Honor but the state I am sure would come back and try to fantasize circumstances in which a law could be justifies even--
1973.72-1040,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,965.589,967.968,Could be unconstitutional and still constitutional?
1973.72-1040,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,967.968,968.445,Precisely.
1973.72-1040,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,968.445,970.448,But I don’t understand.
1973.72-1040,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,970.448,985.04,"And I would not want to try to meet the hypotheticals at this point that the state might attempt to articulate, but I agree with you Mr. Justice Stewart that if it is an invasion of the First Amendment--"
1973.72-1040,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,985.04,986.376,That they entered.
1973.72-1040,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,986.376,1000.606,"That should be the end of it. However once you move to through the opinions of this court, we are caught up with sometimes analysis that talks about compelling interest and sometimes analysis that talks about least restrictive alternative."
1973.72-1040,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1016.894,1019.034,Well those are First Amendment concepts.
1973.72-1040,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1034.406,1044.54,"No, I would say that that is a secondary argument that we would agree with your initial agreement that is if this is an invasion of the First Amendment and over breath--"
1973.72-1040,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1044.54,1046.159,I was not arguing I am asking question?
1973.72-1040,0,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,1046.159,1074.611,"Excuse me a question that would be the end of it, if the court is compelled then by its own decisions or by its own analysis of the issues to look beyond that into something like a compelling state interest or compelling governmental analysis interest notion or a least restrictive alternative notion then we would suggest the state can not meet the burden of proof of constitutional proof that would lodged on its shoulders."
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,1688.945,1692.762,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1973.72-1040,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2007.298,2030.841,"Mr. Sendak, what is it, the State's position as you represented here, with respect to whether the Indiana Election Commissioners could refuse a place on the ballot to a party that signed the oath as upheld by the District Court just because the Election Commissioners felt that perhaps the oath was not truthful?"
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2030.841,2045.984,"The State's position is being changed by the District Court below and our failure to get jurisdiction for docketed here on the other issue, but a basic law in Indiana is that the State Election Board must strictly comply with that requirement."
1973.72-1040,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2112.252,2129.117,"As my brother Rehnquist was asking, suppose there was strict compliance and the party did not exclude an affidavit precisely the form that the law requires, but the Election Board thought that it was an untrue affidavit?"
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2129.117,2136.68,The Election Board being obligated to comply strictly would have to put them on a ballot.
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.68,2141.119,Is there anything in the record on this that a law was passed.
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2141.119,2142.13,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2148.838,2151.79,I thought I said -- you said that it applied to all parties equally?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2151.79,2152.405,Yes sir.
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2152.405,2156.145,"Well, you had Republican and Democrat parties long before then, didn't you?"
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2156.145,2159.37,"Yes sir, but they had to submit this affidavit in 1945 to be on the ballot --"
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2159.37,2160.818,They didn't before that?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2160.818,2161.605,No party did before.
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2161.605,2162.832,That is what I meant.
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2162.832,2167.385,But it applies to all equally and it is a continuing requirement now.
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2167.385,2170.498,When did the Communist Party first start operating in Indiana?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2170.498,2170.648,In Indiana?
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.648,2171.727,Around the same time?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2171.727,2172.355,Sir?
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2172.355,2176.093,Around the same time?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2176.093,2181.743,"I believe the Communist Party started in Indiana long before that, long around 1919 and 1920."
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2212.226,2214.645,Communist Party was operating before than --
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2214.645,2216.603,"Not as a Political Party, no sir."
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2217.334,2218.901,That was my question.
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2218.901,2219.945,"I am sorry, I misunderstood."
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2219.945,2223.822,Thank you.
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2223.822,2244.103,"If I may, I would like to proceed to the State's interests, the Bullock case to which counsel for appellants refer, makes the statement of the State has in interest, if not a duty to protect the integrity of its political processes from frivolous or fraudulent candidacies."
1973.72-1040,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.036,2377.493,"Well, let us assume that an oath requiring a candidate to oppose the over throw of the government by force and violence, were constitutional --"
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2377.493,2378.545,"Well, in this Court it is."
1973.72-1040,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.545,2383.04,"As Cole wasn't a candidate, but he was an employee."
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2383.04,2383.524,Yes Sir.
1973.72-1040,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.524,2397.045,"Suppose for a candidate that was constitutional, would that subsume or cover this oath of yours, namely that I will not advocate."
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2397.045,2401.874,I believe the Cole versus Richardson explanation goes even beyond ours.
1973.72-1040,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.021,2422.838,"Well, I suppose then that the state would be equally satisfied with an oath to the effect that I will -- that I will oppose overthrow?"
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2422.838,2432.023,"Well I would assume so, but the state legislature has passed Act here and it simply said that I do not advocate the overthrow --"
1973.72-1040,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2432.023,2433.906,If I gather Mr. Attorney General --
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2433.906,2434.369,Sir?
1973.72-1040,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2434.369,2443.151,As I gather they were substituted for the prescribed form of oath in the form of a Cole versus Richardson you do (Inaudible).
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2444.694,2446.789,"The State Election Board would have no choice, it has to follow."
1973.72-1040,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2446.789,2448.281,(Voice overlap) reject it.
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2448.281,2448.657,Yes sir.
1973.72-1040,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2448.657,2449.108,Yeah.
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2449.108,2455.85,But I thought perhaps Mr. Justice like many of the state legislator of Indiana where we have such an oath it would be fine.
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2780.95,2786.652,"What does advocate mean, advocate?"
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2786.652,2788.427,In its dictionary sense or our sense?
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2788.427,2791.953,"No sir, what it means, what does it mean in this statute?"
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2791.953,2807.063,"In this statute as construed by the Indiana Supreme Court, it means promoting the taking of illegal action either now or something in the future."
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2807.063,2811.103,So advocacy and promotion are identical?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2811.103,2812.225,In that strict sense.
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2812.225,2815.164,What do you mean by promotion?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2815.164,2820.383,"Taking active steps to incite, the word incitement would be more appropriate perhaps."
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2820.383,2821.874,But it is not here?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2821.874,2822.327,Sir?
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2822.327,2824.243,The word incitement is not in that?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2824.243,2827.824,"No, but this is the construction put on Your Honor by the Indiana Supreme Court."
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2827.824,2840.47,Well suppose somebody said I think the things are so horrible may be the only way anything can happen is to somebody else overthrow the government?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2840.47,2842.572,Anybody is free to say that in Indiana or anywhere else.
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2847.892,2853.08,"That person would be barred from taking the oath, you don't mind?"
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2853.08,2854.475,I don't that think so.
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2854.475,2857.859,If somebody just said there is a possibility?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2857.859,2860.819,Well anything is possibility sir in these days.
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2861.037,2865.879,But isn't advocacy -- there is a great problem with the word advocacy?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2865.879,2867.168,You are right sir.
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2867.168,2870.066,I just don't know what it means.
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2870.066,2876.069,Well to me it means as the three young persons took the oath here that they would support the constitution.
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2878.483,2883.15,"That would be a lot, does it not, advocacy and support?"
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2883.15,2892.521,"In that sense of the word, but advocacy in the sense the word as contemplated by this statute and has construed by the Indiana Supreme Court means promoting the incitement."
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2892.521,2896.919,"Is a person who teaches an advocate, is he an advocate?"
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2896.919,2899.459,In a sense he is yes.
1973.72-1040,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2899.459,2905.65,So if a person who teaches military discipline?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2907.645,2915.001,"Depends on the context, what are in the context of combat arena of politics and struggle for the reigns of the government."
1973.72-1040,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2926.73,2929.954,Are there any other states that have an oath similar to this?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2929.954,2939.997,"Yes sir, this Court considered one in Ohio in a Gilligan case last year and their case as much I don't want to depreciate theirs, but ours is much more strict."
1973.72-1040,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2939.997,2943.444,"Oath as this, Ohio doesn't have it anymore, do they?"
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2943.444,2950.344,"Well, they may have changed it legislatively but at the time this case came up in 1972 it had."
1973.72-1040,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2950.344,2952.295,Any others that you know off?
1973.72-1040,1,43343,theodore_l_sendak,,2952.295,2959.502,"I think other states do, I have not researched all that -- so I can't honestly answer that."
1973.72-1040,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2961.879,2964.237,"Thank you, Attorney General."
1973.72-1040,2,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,2968.477,2984.558,"In answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's question about other states that may have similar statutes, I think is as compendium note in Emerson, Haber & Dorsen at pages 315 on the choice to collect states, but that's out of date."
1973.72-1040,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2988.824,2990.19,They were at the time --
1973.72-1040,2,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,2990.19,2991.462,Yes I believe so.
1973.72-1040,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3101.749,3117.026,Have there been any suggestion in this case anywhere along the line that the Federal Courts abstain for the purpose of permitting the Indiana courts to give an authoritative construction of this of the meaning of these words?
1973.72-1040,2,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,3117.026,3120.693,No there has been such suggestion as I note in the proceedings.
1973.72-1040,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3144.946,3149.318,"It's one of the problems that, excuse me, I am sorry I didn't mean to interpret you."
1973.72-1040,2,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,3149.318,3150.505,Excuse me.
1973.72-1040,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3150.505,3165.017,It seems to me fair as I understand you and you are broader on the other side that one of the problems here is that you disagree as to what these words mean as a matter of Indiana law.
1973.72-1040,2,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,3184.41,3192.58,"I think you have it, it seem to me in the colloquy that just proceeded my rebuttal with Justice Marshall, the Attorney General came right back to an agreement."
1973.72-1040,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3192.58,3194.025,"Incitement, no he said incitement --"
1973.72-1040,2,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,3194.025,3197.289,No he also agreed that other --
1973.72-1040,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3197.289,3203.575,"Well, I would -- since you already told that the Attorney General does not have the power to construe it?"
1973.72-1040,2,41969,sanford_jay_rosen,,3203.575,3204.694,"Technically, he has his --"
1973.72-1040,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3204.694,3206.77,"So whatever is that, it's not binding?"
