1963.168,1,29266,j_m_breckenridge,,1678.896,1679.1,That would --
1963.168,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1679.1,1684.775,-- we should deny a constitutional hearing a constitutional right because something of that kind was not done here?
1963.168,1,29266,j_m_breckenridge,,1684.775,1700.807,"Well, as the Court has said, the -- this is bound and bound volumes and when paper is stapled on it maybe of a greater texture that will not withstand and will not stand the test of time and will not make a permanent record."
