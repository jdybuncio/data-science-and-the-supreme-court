1965.104,1,38581,richard_arens,,1987.636,1989.236,"I would argue in rebuttal, if it please --"
1965.104,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1989.236,1990.239,In rebuttal.
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,1994.916,1999.485,May it please the Court.
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2046.648,2049.089,Does the statute tell what not to investigate?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2049.089,2049.693,"No, it doesn't."
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2051.103,2054.514,(Voice Overlap) problem is here of what investigation means?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2054.514,2057.495,It may be a problem in certain cases --
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2057.495,2058.94,"Well, whether --"
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2058.94,2059.224,Because --
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2059.224,2070.949,"-- as I understand it to -- always correctly and apparently those panels in the Court of Appeals seem to put a different content into the requirement for investigation, don't they?"
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2070.949,2072.175,I do not think so.
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2072.175,2074.132,Alright.
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2074.132,2078.568,Let me first direct my attention to this point about the conflict.
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2112.423,2114.939,But what does the lawyer doing -- that have anything to do with it?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2114.939,2120.028,Because that's why they point in Black to what happened in Kent.
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2152.633,2154.079,I suppose we can give you more time --
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2154.079,2154.539,That's right.

1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2165.309,2171.106,It was immediately prior to the -- when this case was (Voice Overlap).
1965.104,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2172.633,2179.218,What investigation did the Juvenile Court make before denying these orders?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2179.218,2183.433,"As a matter of fact, the District Court, of the Juvenile Court--"
1965.104,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2183.433,2184.071,"Criminal Court, I mean."
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2184.071,2187.761,"-- made a full investigation, Your Honor."
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2209.79,2211.306,Why do you keep saying that?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2211.306,2213.135,There's no question about what it was.
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2213.135,2214.256,What was done?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2214.256,2218.332,"Actually, what was done at that time was he was put on probation."
1965.104,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2290.478,2291.532,He was 13 or 14 years old?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2291.532,2295.241,He was 14 years of age at that time.
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2296.271,2301.247,Does the record show whether the lawyer he had at that time saw all this (Voice Overlap) --
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2301.247,2302.633,I don't know.
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2306.612,2308.503,Do you know what the practice is in the Juvenile Court?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2310.269,2322.231,"No, the lawyer does not usually see this and I will come to -- that's an issue of course in this case but there are reasons why lawyer does not always see this."
1965.104,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2322.231,2323.813,What are the reasons?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2323.813,2333.603,"Well, there are number of reasons because first of all the part of this information of course is hearsay, it's not the kind of information which is developed."
1965.104,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2335.868,2340.65,So the judge acts on hearsay but doesn't give any chance to rebut the hearsay.
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2340.65,2343.174,"Does not quite accurate in this case, Your Honor."
1965.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2405.374,2412.392,From whom does the judge get advice on the -- these waiver matters?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2412.392,2414.384,"Well, the other staff --"
1965.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.384,2415.248,Who were they?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2415.248,2426.504,"They are staff probation officers, social workers, they also have test, a clinic doctor, and they also go the --"

1965.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2431.829,2436.644,Is there any lawyers on the staff or juvenile judge?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2436.644,2437.392,"Well, no."
1965.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.24,2440.838,Social Workers?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2440.838,2442.082,They're mostly social workers.
1965.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.082,2446.238,"Well, do you know who gives them advice on waiver matters, anyone of them or all of them?"
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2446.238,2448.323,"On legal matters, no, I don't think they --"
1965.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2448.323,2449.999,On waiver matters?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2449.999,2452.278,"They give advice on waiver matters, yes."
1965.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2452.278,2453.179,Which one?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2453.179,2458.053,The social workers and the final report usually says what they think.
1965.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.439,2488.301,And then what do you -- why is that do you say that the lawyer for a juvenile offender isn't entitled to see the social file -- the social files?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2488.301,2496.561,"Well, the social files, the social records are the type of material -- I don't say they're not always entitled to it."
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2519.962,2522.022,But given to the lawyer?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2522.583,2523.669,"And as a matter of fact, the statute --"
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2523.669,2526.305,How does it get to the public if it was given to the --
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2526.305,2526.534,"Well, there --"
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2526.534,2527.604,-- juvenile's lawyer?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2527.604,2528.444,"Well, I don't know."
1965.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.198,2534.729,Or any more than a social (Voice Overlap) --
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2534.729,2535.493,As a matter of fact --
1965.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.493,2536.677,-- the social workers have it.
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2536.677,2554.9,"As a matter of fact what really happens, you see, in these cases, when they get to the District Court and they get to a district judge, he throws up his hands in court at the problem of deciding what to give to counsel and he actually gives in the whole file."
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2557.177,2557.955,You mean in this case?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2557.955,2560.274,-- and as a matter of fact that's what happened in this case.
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2560.274,2560.59,You mean --
1965.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.59,2561.335,In the District Court?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2561.335,2562.982,"In the District Court, he got the whole file."
1965.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.982,2563.804,-- not the Juvenile Court --
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2563.804,2565.132,-- not for a waiver.
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2572.187,2577.296,"That's interesting, why is it that the district judge will do that and the Juvenile Court judge feels he can't?"
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2577.296,2582.063,It isn't that the juvenile judge feels that he cannot.
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2582.281,2583.383,"Well, this practice is not --"
1965.104,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2583.383,2584.678,What does he feel?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2584.678,2586.186,Because that I mean --
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2586.186,2587.34,"Well, this practice is not (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2587.34,2588.084,That's right.
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2588.084,2588.867,"Well, why?"
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2591.246,2594.1,"I think the statute -- well, there are two things."
1965.104,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2624.262,2632.641,"Well, you mean they make it in the sense that states affirmatively that the lawyer may have the court record but silent as to what shall be the case (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2632.641,2656.746,"Well, no it's not quite that silent because if you read the history and we have outlined it in our brief, you will find that the reason to prompt the part about the social records would put in to the statute was that that then juvenile judge at the time felt that she could not give social records to anyone."
1965.104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.735,2686.706,Did this request for the social worker has ever actually reached the judge?
1965.104,2,42705,theodore_george_gilinsky,,2686.706,2689.27,I assume so.
1965.104,3,38581,richard_arens,,5968.243,5972.357,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.104,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5983.101,5989.197,"Mr. Arens, if you gather -- it's two -- about three minutes to two, if you'd rather start at after lunch, you may do so."
1965.104,3,38581,richard_arens,,5989.197,5989.923,That's a good one.
1965.104,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5989.923,5991.0,Would you want to do that?
1965.104,3,38581,richard_arens,,5991.0,5991.412,I will.
1965.104,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5991.412,6000.764,"Very well, we'll return."
1965.104,3,38581,richard_arens,,6003.423,6007.836,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
