1986.85-782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.241,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 85-782, Immigration and Naturalization Service versus Luz Marina Cardoza-Fonseca."
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,13.424,16.926,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-782,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,238.754,249.712,"Mr. Wallace, am I correct in understanding that in the Sevic case, whatever it is, the Court assumed the standards were different?"
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,249.712,255.782,"It assumed for purposes of decision, but it expressly left the question open."
1986.85-782,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,271.743,288.437,"Mr. Wallace, I'm also concerned by the fact that Congress considered an express requirement that applicants for asylum meet the same standard required for withholding deportation and rejected it."
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,300.311,320.558,"Well, of course it can be considered, but there were no circumstances connected with that particular incident that indicated that Congress clearly thought a different standard did apply."
1986.85-782,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,335.151,348.827,"At one juncture, at least, the Board didn't think there was any practical or meaningful distinction between probability and well-founded, did it not?"
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,348.827,350.36,--That is still the Board's position.
1986.85-782,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,380.013,381.715,And do you still support the Board?
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,381.715,382.982,That is our position.
1986.85-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,500.292,502.244,"Mr. Wallace, could I interrupt you for just a moment."
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,524.924,529.561,"--That is entirely correct, and the Court pointed that out in Stevic."
1986.85-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,579.344,592.901,"Yes, but isn't it true that if your opponent's construction of the statute were taken as correct, that there then could be an opportunity for the Attorney General to decide exactly what standard should govern that newly--"
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,592.901,605.228,"--There certainly could, Mr. Justice, and there is a plausible argument to be made that a coherent way of looking at the statute would be to rely on that distinction."
1986.85-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,634.095,643.853,"--Well, do you think, if Congress intended that there be two different standards, it would have been within the Board's discretion to say, well, we'll just adopt the same standard for both?"
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,646.722,646.972,No.
1986.85-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.994,661.232,Do they have any more expertise on a question like that than a court does?
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,661.232,670.338,"Well, the Board does have expertise on this, because over a period of years it has dealt with thousands of claims that--"
1986.85-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,670.338,673.872,"Yes, but I mean expertise on what Congress meant, not expertise on handling claims."
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,675.505,683.228,"--Well, it has expertise because the Department of Justice was an active participant in the legislation as it developed."
1986.85-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,732.244,736.946,"Mr. Wallace, I have a question that's along the same lines."
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,771.719,777.373,We certainly would argue that that would be within the Attorney General's authority.
1986.85-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,786.213,788.165,"By these Respondents, do you think?"
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,798.603,802.055,"--Well, I'll have to let them speak for themselves on that."
1986.85-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,871.485,888.53,"Mr. Wallace, if your first answer to Justice Scalia is correct, then the Attorney General would have the power under the statute to adopt a regulation substantially adopting the standard, perhaps saying except in very exceptional cases on a particularized showing or something like that, you must meet the same standard."
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,896.75,897.386,"Well, we recognize that."
1986.85-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.396,957.357,"So you also have retained a hole card, Mr. Wallace, because ultimately you're arguing you have discretion in interpreting the statute, so that in the future your client might exercise that discretion to interpret the statute differently if he wants to, I presume."
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,957.357,960.476,"Well, there is that possibility."
1986.85-782,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,974.034,975.652,"Well, Mr. Wallace, may I just ask this question."
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,975.652,976.219,--Of course.
1986.85-782,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,976.219,979.338,Does asylum usually lead to citizenship?
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,979.338,984.658,That is the other major difference between asylum and deportation.
1986.85-782,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1155.054,1155.604,"Excuse me, Mr. Wallace."
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1166.861,1170.896,--That's just an example of the difference.
1986.85-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1220.812,1237.941,"But isn't it true that if they had satisfied the higher standard of proof and found to have a statutory right not to be deported back to Afghanistan, you still could have, under either approach, you could have exercised discretion and said, we'll ask them to go to Pakistan instead?"
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1237.941,1239.308,"That's right, the discretion could be exercised."
1986.85-782,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.483,1258.604,"Well, and if the Attorney General exercises discretion not to do so."
1986.85-782,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1258.604,1269.579,"--Well, there's always the possibility that the Attorney General will achieve the same result we are saying the statute achieves, through an exercise of discretion that gets back to that point."
1986.85-782,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1561.368,1562.334,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,1565.07,1571.556,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1605.98,1621.858,"Ms. Keener, Mr. Wallace, in response to a question from, I believe it was, Justice Stevens, said that, for example, the National Labor Relations Board had been deferred to when it was construing even a provision of the Act, not that its view was final but that it was given deference."
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,1628.928,1629.678,--No.
1986.85-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.284,1650.775,"Well, my question to you was, which I don't think you've yet answered, is is the agency entitled to no deference because what it is construing is a term of the statute?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,1650.775,1653.227,I think that answer is probably correct.
1986.85-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1661.649,1664.601,"Well, is deference one of those factors or not?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,1664.601,1674.041,"Well, it can be if a standard is not a question of pure law, if it is an application of the law to a specific set of facts."
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1681.895,1682.628,What was Chevron?
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,1696.454,1701.858,"There was a technical gap in Chevron, and it was involved in the implementation."
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.346,1740.399,"What you're arguing, if I understand you, is that the agency's interpretation is not a reasonable one."
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,1740.399,1741.533,It is unreasonable here.
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1741.533,1741.935,All right.
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,1752.224,1754.557,That's correct.
1986.85-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1940.528,1951.067,"Ms. Keener, do you agree that if you were to prevail here that the discretion of the agency would enable it to accomplish the same thing?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,1951.067,1951.6,I do not.
1986.85-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1976.499,1986.64,"Well, Ms. Keener, is it your position that the Attorney General, in exercising his discretion in those situations, could not lay down any general rule?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,1986.64,1988.841,Most likely that would be inconsistent.
1986.85-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1989.708,1991.308,Inconsistent with what?
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,1991.308,1993.793,--With a case by case determination.
1986.85-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1993.793,2003.435,"Well, what is it in the statute that mandates a case by case determination, as opposed to a determination based on some more general guidelines?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2003.435,2008.403,It's inherent in the exercise of discretion that every case be evaluate on its individual facts.
1986.85-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.189,2021.98,"Well, Ms. Keener, how do you evaluate a case on its individual facts without knowing what rule to apply once you've ascertained what facts are there?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2023.83,2026.449,--This Court will set the rule in this case.
1986.85-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2034.47,2035.437,"Ms. Keener, let me interrupt you if I may."
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2067.259,2073.762,"I don't see a problem with the policy decision, as long as individual cases are then reviewed to see that they fall correctly within that policy."
1986.85-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.614,2082.351,"--So he could adopt regulations that would establish broad categories as a way to treat these cases, perhaps a different statement of proof on some?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2082.351,2088.938,"The State Department now participates in evaluation of country conditions, which is a very important aspect of the asylum determination."
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.717,2125.98,"Would that discretion, whether you say it can be exercised generically or must be exercised case by case, either way, would that include the discretion to say, even though this individual or this category of individuals have good reason to fear within the minimal meaning of the statute, I'm still not going to give them asylum?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2125.98,2127.416,That's what I think would be inappropriate.
1986.85-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.416,2127.916,Why?
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2144.342,2145.794,That's not irrational.
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.794,2155.916,"Your response to that argument, your principal response in your brief, is no, it's not irrational because the standard for purposes of asylum is a discretionary one."
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2175.961,2177.011,I didn't mean to be saying that.
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2206.23,2218.388,"Well, but you're still saying that he cannot say, even though this category of people have a well-founded fear of persecution, I am not going to grant them asylum."
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2218.388,2221.776,I believe that would fly in the face of Congress' clear intent.
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.916,2235.283,"That's fine, that may well be true."
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2238.301,2239.82,"--It is discretionary, however."
1986.85-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2256.346,2261.317,"Well, how do you tell what the merits of a case are, Ms. Keener, without having some guideline?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2261.317,2263.017,"Well, that's within the agency's expertise."
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2284.348,2288.55,But the substantial probability standard is discretionary in that sense.
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2288.55,2289.917,What the Attorney General is doing--
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2289.917,2292.502,It's no more discretionary than the substantial probability standard.
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2302.144,2315.551,"--Because... and it was pointed out in Stevic quite clearly... by meeting the definition of refugee, someone who has a well-founded fear of persecution, that does not automatically require a grant of asylum."
1986.85-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.195,2361.813,"Ms. Keener, I think you're arguing the next case rather than this case."
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2364.682,2367.467,That seemed to be what Justice Scalia was interested in.
1986.85-782,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.154,2404.925,What do you do with their argument that there's a lot of material in the legislative history that says that conforming with the protocol really would not change the law?
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2404.925,2416.983,"The answer to that I believe is found also in Stevic, that because refugee admissions were not required our accession to the protocol back in 1967 did not affect our refugee admissions procedures."
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.636,2623.248,"Ms. Keener, I wonder of you would address one argument of the Government that troubles me some, which is that if this is a different standard from more likely than not, what does it consist of?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2635.222,2637.122,I don't want my comments to be characterized that way.
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2639.674,2646.53,"--He can say, even though you have demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution, I'm not going to let you in?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2646.53,2647.23,"Yes, he can."
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2668.944,2669.494,All right.
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2674.597,2680.834,A well-founded fear of persecution is really quite simply a reasonable person standard.
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2687.857,2688.624,Well now--
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2688.624,2689.09,The courts--
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.09,2697.01,"--let's assume that the persecution in the country you're talking about is very... it's horrible persecution, it's torture; it isn't just incarceration."
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2707.385,2714.038,--It depends on whether it would be reasonable to have that fear in view of the small chance that something is going to happen.
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.038,2717.49,"I know it would, and what's the answer?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2717.49,2724.327,The answer is that the tryer of fact should look at the specific facts which you put forth to show the objective situation.
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.327,2725.779,"You see, I don't know the answer to that."
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2727.798,2729.381,"One in a thousand, I'm sure it's not."
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.381,2730.583,I can tell more likely than not.
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2744.975,2747.81,"If you can handle torture you wouldn't be applying for asylum, all kidding aside."
1986.85-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2800.327,2805.113,Why do we assume that Congress was aware of the criteria set forth in the handbook?
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2805.113,2807.398,--That's what the Assistant Attorney General said.
1986.85-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2807.398,2808.965,"Oh, you were just repeating his language?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2808.965,2810.183,"Yes, that was a quote."
1986.85-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2823.824,2827.109,Do you know why he assumed it?
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2827.109,2832.346,"I don't know the basis for his remarks, I am sorry."
1986.85-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2867.166,2875.439,Your quarrel is with the agency's insistence that you establish a reasonable likelihood?
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2875.439,2891.634,The focus on probability takes out of consideration the focus on subjective feelings and beliefs which is a critical element in the refugee status definition because of the fact that it recognizes the everyday realities of refugees proving their cases.
1986.85-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2898.455,2899.038,"Well, wait a minute."
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2916.266,2916.649,Exactly.
1986.85-782,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2916.649,2918.468,--language that you object to?
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2918.468,2928.974,"Because likelihood implies probability, and in fact in the history of the Immigration Act realistic likelihood has teen a synonym for clear probability or more likely than not."
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2964.48,2978.673,"You sure you wouldn't have a well-founded fear if the regime in question has systematically said, every Tuesday we are selecting one out of 1,000 people and shooting them, and that's the regime that I'm going to deport you back to?"
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2978.673,2982.109,I would say that most judges would assume that my fear--
1986.85-782,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.109,2983.06,Is not well-founded?
1986.85-782,1,21100,dana_marks_keener,,2983.06,2988.528,--is not a reasoned... it's not a reasonable possibility that I will be one in a thousand.
1986.85-782,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3024.068,3025.637,"Thank you, Ms. Keener."
1986.85-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3028.172,3029.789,Please.
1986.85-782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3029.789,3033.993,"Mr. Wallace, before you start, I just want to give you a question to be sure you get time to answer it."
1986.85-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3040.497,3043.032,We simply don't agree that a different standard applies.
1986.85-782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3049.253,3051.788,"You agree that the word ""refugee"" of course applies to both?"
1986.85-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3051.788,3052.171,Yes.
1986.85-782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3052.171,3056.573,"And what do you say to her argument that 207 was derived from 203(a)(7), in which there was a--"
1986.85-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3056.573,3061.061,We said it in our reply brief on pages 11 and 12.
1986.85-782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3071.415,3072.515,"--Good reason, good reason to fear."
1986.85-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3072.515,3074.784,"That's right, but that's not well-founded."
1986.85-782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3085.675,3090.71,So your view is 203(a)(7) had the same standard that you maintain is appropriate here?
1986.85-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3090.71,3093.095,"--Well, we think there's some basis to that view."
1986.85-782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3098.732,3099.851,I just want to be sure I understand.
1986.85-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3103.303,3103.97,It's a different standard.
1986.85-782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3103.97,3104.286,Different.
1986.85-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3104.286,3109.04,"Although... well, there's some basis for thinking that in practice it was applied the same way."
1986.85-782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3111.576,3112.476,"Well, I understand that."
1986.85-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3112.476,3113.092,That's our main point.
1986.85-782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3157.538,3160.073,"Let me just be sure I understand, because it's going a little fast for me."
1986.85-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3164.259,3165.561,"208 and 207, yes."
1986.85-782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3167.077,3169.429,And you also say that the 207 standard is the same as the old 203--
1986.85-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3169.429,3172.364,"No, we never said that, nor do we say it now."
1986.85-782,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3180.72,3186.124,--So that 207 adopted a different standard than prevailed previously with respect to refugees processed abroad.
1986.85-782,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3186.124,3186.974,"That is correct, that is correct."
1986.85-782,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3325.381,3326.731,"Your time is expired, Mr. Wallace."
