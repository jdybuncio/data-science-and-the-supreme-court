1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.51,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in the opinion of the Court, and first this morning is No. 87-578, The Bank of Nova Scotia v. The United States; No. 87-602, William Kilpatrick against The United States."
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,16.342,38.667,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the question presented by this case is whether a District Court may exercise supervisory authority to dismiss an indictment before trial before that District Court finds that the indictment was procured by deliberate, pervasive, intentional misconduct."
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,59.702,62.654,You are talking about dismissal before trial?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,62.654,64.063,"Yes, we are, Justice."
1987.87-578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,109.663,135.761,"Mr. Nesland, may I inquire of whether... if we think that some sort of prejudice is required to be shown, or that some sort of grave doubt about whether the grand jury's decision to indict was influenced here, could you meet that standard, and did you meet that standard below?"
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,135.761,147.157,"Your Honor, I might answer it this way and say the Court of Appeals in the majority opinion held that we had not established substantial prejudice."
1987.87-578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.465,179.589,"But we have to take it, the case here, on the assumption that there as no prejudice?"
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,179.589,190.257,"That is correct, Your Honor, because the issue is foreclosed by this Court's denial of certiorari on the issue of both a methodology and the standard of proof below."
1987.87-578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.257,190.895,Thank you.
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,190.895,204.886,The second issue we believe that is raised by this question is in what circumstances can the Court exercise that supervisory authority when there is no prejudice.
1987.87-578,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,260.353,265.025,What kind of misconduct wouldn't qualify under that standard?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,281.456,282.095,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-578,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,356.815,362.648,"Mr. Nesland, I think you refer to a number of alleged items of misconduct."
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,364.12,370.723,"Your Honor, we rely on all of those that were found by the District Court, and undisturbed by the Court of Appeals."
1987.87-578,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,370.723,371.894,They being?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,371.894,407.498,"Well, the swearings of the agents of the grand jury, and the use of those agents in a manner which led, and misled, I suggest, the grand jury to believe that these people were not acting as IRS agents anymore, that they were fiduciaries of the grand jury, and they allowed those IRS agents in violation of Rule 6(d) to represent virtually the entire case that was presented from the first grand jury to the second grand jury without the attorneys being available, being present, most of the time."
1987.87-578,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,418.615,419.436,What else?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,419.436,461.074,"Then we have the 6(e) violations, Justice Brennan, in which the government for purposes of prejudicing these defendants were disclosing that they were under investigation, were disclosing that they were under investigation in tax shelters, and they were disclosing that outside the grand jury to people who were working with the tax shelter operation, to people that were investing in a tax shelter operation, and the purpose was found that that was to prejudice to try to interfere with and stop the tax shelter program long before, long before, the indictment was handed down."
1987.87-578,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,461.074,461.915,Anything more?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,461.915,462.744,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,511.306,532.26,"Mr. Nesland, I have read the record, and I must say it discloses a certain amount of arrogance on the part of the Tax Commission, which anyone who has practiced in the provinces is familiar with, but it doesn't seem to me to show the sort of flagrant type of thing that you are suggesting."
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,532.26,540.916,"--Your Honor, what was presented to the Court below, and what the District Court has to look at, was the totality of circumstances in this case."
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,586.697,591.76,Is that a ground for dismissing an indictment?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,593.769,603.446,"Your Honor, I don't think in United States the Costello... the question was whether or not misinformation was presented to that grand jury."
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,607.179,618.587,But supposing... can one challenge an indictment after it has been returned on the grounds that a witness who testified before the jury gave false testimony?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,618.587,629.623,"Well, there are certain Courts of Appeals, Your Honor, that do allow that, but I would suggest it would be different if the prosecutors knowingly presented perjury to the grand jury."
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,629.623,631.947,Do you think that is open to challenge to the indictment?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,634.147,656.12,"There is no Court of Appeals... there is no Supreme Court decision holding that, but we would suggest that that is the kind of case that the supervisory authority is intended to reach where the government purposely violates the law, purposely tries to prejudice by abusive practices, the grand jury's decision-making responsibility."
1987.87-578,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.12,659.644,But did the District Court find that there was a knowing use of perjury testimony?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,659.644,662.926,I think that is a semantical difference.
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,772.016,774.919,"Well, but that isn't the same thing as knowingly presented perjured testimony."
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,779.363,794.083,"--Well, we certainly did not know whether or not Mr. Waters' testimony was perjurious from his point of view, but they certainly knew that it was unreliable, and yet they went ahead."
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,794.083,801.956,"Is that grounds for challenging an indictment returned by a grand jury that one of the witnesses gave ""unreliable"" testimony?"
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,801.956,804.017,No.
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,834.418,840.592,"Yeah, but you could say that hearsay testimony was unreliable, which is what we said you couldn't challenge in Costello."
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,840.592,846.786,The question there was not whether or not hearsay testimony was or was not reliable.
1987.87-578,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.096,974.27,What did they suggest prejudice might be?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,982.435,989.01,"Well, the Court of Appeals was concerned with the independence of the grand jury, and that's what it focused on."
1987.87-578,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.01,994.864,"Well, I know, but what kind of prejudice wa the government talking about?"
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,999.265,1008.111,"Well, first of all, the government never conceded at any point along the line that there was any prejudice."
1987.87-578,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1008.111,1010.231,"I agree with you, but what were they talking about?"
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1012.943,1023.381,They were talking about whether or not the independence of the grand jury was infringed by their misconduct as opposed to the outcome of the grand jury was infringed.
1987.87-578,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.381,1025.502,All right.
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1028.083,1028.734,Right.
1987.87-578,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1048.398,1060.444,"The Tenth Circuit, it ruled that on these facts, on... even with this misconduct, that its judgment was that the independence of the grand jury was not threatened."
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1060.444,1062.867,"That's correct, that's what the Court of Appeals held."
1987.87-578,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1062.867,1065.269,"Mr. Nesland, I don't understand the distinction."
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1071.594,1074.934,If it comes out of a grand jury that is not independent?
1987.87-578,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1074.934,1075.465,That's right.
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1075.465,1077.277,"I believe that would be one taint, yes."
1987.87-578,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1077.277,1084.39,"I mean, I don't separate that from some other errors that go to whether the indictment was correct or not."
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1091.736,1092.976,That's correct.
1987.87-578,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1092.976,1094.618,And that leads me to another point.
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1136.285,1176.17,"It seems to me, Justice Scalia, that the issue is whether or not a Court below, the District Courts, and the Courts of Appeals, should be able to look at the misconduct, and to be able to deter misconduct that reflects upon the grand jury process, that reflects upon the criminal justice system, because of the way the government operates, because of the way the government conducted itself irrespective of whether or not these particular defendants were prejudiced by this particular activity."
1987.87-578,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1177.172,1196.083,"I understand that, but do you know any case of this Court that is inconsistent with the proposition that we... that the Courts have some indirect supervisory effect; that is, to the extent they throw away an indictment that has been affected by misconduct."
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1231.957,1258.073,"--I don't believe so in the grand jury context simply because it is virtually impossible, and I think this case proves it, it is virtually impossible to carry the burden of establishing that conduct, no matter how outrageous, no matter how flagrant, no matter how egregious, would ever infringe the grand jury's independence, would ever substantially influence its outcome."
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1301.784,1312.52,"But the ultimate... surely the ultimate rule for which you argue must be based on the idea that if these errors hadn't occurred, the grant jury wouldn't have indicted."
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1332.582,1338.627,"Because the body of law... we are not trying to create here a new body of law, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1351.085,1351.636,Protect... from what?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1352.945,1363.063,"To protect it from this kind of misconduct because there is nothing else to protect the grand jury process, and respect for the grand jury process, except this kind of sanction."
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1363.063,1375.001,Then you are seeking a rule which would go further than just focus on whether the grand jury's conduct was influenced by whether or not an indictment was returned.
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1387.41,1390.181,I'm not suggesting they should discipline these people.
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1455.844,1459.969,And to refuse to indict where the government has not shown probable cause.
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1486.714,1499.823,"Well, the causal link is that it's the kind of misconduct that is intended to prejudice the grand jury; it is intended to influence; it is intended to misuse this process."
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1499.823,1502.405,But by hypothesis has failed of that intent.
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1502.405,1518.597,"The problem with the rule as it exists today in the circuits, except for the Second Circuit, and perhaps the D.C. Circuit, and Eleventh Circuit, is that success, or that failure... excuse me... failure is success."
1987.87-578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1541.902,1547.314,"Well, Mr. Nesland, what is the proper test of prejudice in your view?"
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1559.754,1567.969,"Well, I would suggest that the standard was the one that you articulated in your concurring opinion."
1987.87-578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1567.969,1569.658,In Mechanik?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1569.658,1570.299,In Mechanik.
1987.87-578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1571.09,1581.666,"Do you think that just can't ever be met, that you can show there is grave doubt about whether the decision of the grand jury was affected?"
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1581.666,1585.269,--Let me answer that two ways.
1987.87-578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1585.269,1591.333,"Because I thought you answered me at the outset, that you thought in this case that standard could have been met."
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1591.333,1601.609,"I'm not sure if the Court of Appeals would have exercised that standard, it would have come to a different conclusion or not."
1987.87-578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1601.609,1603.832,Did the Court of Appeals apply that standard?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1603.832,1604.483,No.
1987.87-578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1607.235,1607.542,What standard do you think they apply?
1987.87-578,0,32182,james_e_nesland,,1607.542,1608.595,--infringement of the independence.
1987.87-578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.553,1680.735,"Thank you, Mr. Nesland."
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1682.355,1686.389,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1987.87-578,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1736.25,1742.963,"Mr. Bryson, what do you think the standard for prejudice should be in this context?"
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1742.963,1747.407,I think the standard for prejudice is was there an effect on the charging decision; that is to say--
1987.87-578,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1747.407,1753.782,Do you agree with the standard set forth in the concurring opinion in Mechanik?
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1753.782,1755.252,"--That is correct, we do."
1987.87-578,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1755.252,1758.814,"And did the Court below apply that test, or standard?"
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1758.814,1759.876,We believe they did.
1987.87-578,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1767.971,1770.492,Did it apply the grave doubt standard?
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1770.492,1774.665,--I don't recall whether they used the term grave doubt in point--
1987.87-578,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1774.665,1776.656,"No, I don't think they did, but I think that it was applied."
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1776.656,1781.948,--They made clear that what they were looking at is was there an effect on the charging decision.
1987.87-578,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1781.948,1792.297,Can you look at the cumulative effect of all the errors in determining whether you have grave doubt about the effect on the decision?
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1792.297,1792.958,I think so.
1987.87-578,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1819.364,1825.607,"In your view, Mr. Bryson, was there any misconduct by the government or its agents in this case?"
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1825.607,1827.83,"Yes, Your Honor, we think that there were errors."
1987.87-578,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1848.514,1852.606,Is that the most egregious example of misconduct in your view?
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1852.606,1854.208,--I think you could call it misconduct.
1987.87-578,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1854.819,1857.769,"Is that the most egregious one that occurred in this case, in your view?"
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1857.769,1870.547,--I think that is probably the one incident in which... which is not subject to an explanation other than it is simply a flat error of judgment on the part of the prosecutor.
1987.87-578,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1870.547,1880.204,And what about the reference to the grand jury proceedings by tax agents and tax auditors in other civil audits?
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1883.206,1885.738,"Well, Your Honor, there are a couple of things."
1987.87-578,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1923.232,1929.626,"Were there any sanctions, or reprimands issued to any government officials as a result of the conduct in this case?"
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1929.626,1936.3,There was an extensive investigation by... internal investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility.
1987.87-578,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1972.566,1980.429,And in your view there are adequate sanctions other than dismissing the indictment in circumstances such as these?
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1980.429,1981.48,We certainly think so.
1987.87-578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.035,2059.119,"Mr. Bryson, before you go on, what about the testimony of this witness Mendrop, about the bank's knowledge, do you think that was proper?"
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2059.119,2060.491,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2204.285,2209.19,I know the record so well.
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2229.393,2242.65,"Well, the second is absolutely clearly erroneous because Mendrop simply said the chauffeur said this was true, and in relating what Waters had said, he said that Waters had said that Kilpatrick had said that the visit had occurred."
1987.87-578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2242.65,2246.423,"Do you think... I mean, again, I have great confidence in you."
1987.87-578,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2252.839,2276.444,"I don't think you have to because the Court of Appeals said... while the Court of Appeals did not resolve the question as to whether this had... the source of Mendrop's evidence was misleading... in other words, the Court of Appeals did not look behind the District Court's finding that the grand jury was misled as to whether Mendrop's evidence came from prior evidence presented to the grand jury, or from his own investigations."
