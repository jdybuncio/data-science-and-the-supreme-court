1980.79-6779,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.737,We'll hear arguments next in Little v. Streater.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,62.573,63.356,Thank you.
1980.79-6779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,96.293,109.201,"In your statement of facts... and I was troubled in reading the brief too... I thought in a negative way, if it exonerated putative fathers, it exonerated them 100 percent."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,109.201,115.772,It exonerates 90 percent of innocent putative fathers 100 percent of the time.
1980.79-6779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,140.989,158.801,"Well, I had thought that... maybe the technology has gone beyond my previous knowledge... but I had thought that if you showed that the putative, the accused father had blood of a type different from the child, that he could not be the father."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,158.801,160.234,That is exactly correct.
1980.79-6779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,160.234,162.403,It's just impossible for him to be the father.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,162.403,163.02,And when the blood test--
1980.79-6779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,163.02,165.438,"But if he had the same, it didn't prove that he was or wasn't."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,165.438,166.99,--That is exactly correct.
1980.79-6779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,178.114,178.931,"Well, I thought it was 100 percent."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,178.931,180.514,"No, it is not."
1980.79-6779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,196.54,200.142,"In any event, it's conceded, without getting into the details--"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,200.142,201.177,"Certainly, in fact--"
1980.79-6779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,201.177,204.379,--That it's very probative and useful evidence in this kind of case.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,204.379,206.612,"--Oh, absolutely, and the State does not--"
1980.79-6779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,206.612,209.081,Not question this; right.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,209.081,209.681,--question this in its own brief.
1980.79-6779,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,209.681,229.245,"Well, I suppose, not in the same sense but with the same result, an alibi witness showing that the gentleman was in Angola at the time as a war correspondent would produce a favorable result for him, wouldn't it?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,229.245,234.649,Not in the same way that a blood test evidence produces the favorable result.
1980.79-6779,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,236.265,239.802,"I'm talking about the consequence in terms of the judgment or verdict, as the case may be."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,239.802,250.658,"--No, because blood test evidence of exclusion is tantamount to automatic acquittal of the defendant in practice."
1980.79-6779,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,263.768,272.44,"Is the trier or the triers if it's a jury, compelled to believe any expert testimony?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,277.492,287.949,"Mr. Chief Justice, there is no Connecticut state law on the subject, although the statute we are appealing from speaks in terms of definite exclusion."
1980.79-6779,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,302.809,304.745,And you can't cross-examine a blood test.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,304.745,306.695,"--Well, that's correct; that's correct."
1980.79-6779,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,313.851,321.188,"You can cross-examine the people who make the test, can't you, and isn't there often cross-examination of experts who make tests?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,321.188,340.684,"Well, that is correct, because this is quite a different type of evidence than ordinary expert witness testimony that we're inclined to think of in, for example criminal cases; in, for example, a criminal case where you have psychiatric testimony indicating that the defendant is or is not sane."
1980.79-6779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,382.678,403.425,"In a marijuana case or a drug possession case, for example, a typical type of evidence put on is to show that the packet possessed by the defendant was the same one submitted to the laboratory and is now in court."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,443.066,445.168,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-6779,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,448.303,449.969,But that's not attacking the evidence.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,450.653,452.088,--That's not attacking the evidence itself.
1980.79-6779,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,453.421,456.207,--And it's never been disputed; it's never been disputed.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,456.207,457.159,That's correct.
1980.79-6779,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,461.611,463.729,I didn't say how you could get a witness to say that a blood test isn't accurate.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,463.729,465.096,--That's right.
1980.79-6779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,575.05,585.858,And is the cost of a blood test sampling taxable as costs in a paternity proceeding in which the defendant is acquitted?
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,585.858,590.912,In some states it's discretionary though I believe I mentioned that in a footnote in my brief.
1980.79-6779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,619.765,623.217,And what is the practice in Connecticut?
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,623.217,628.269,I'm not prepared to say.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,644.296,645.546,"Before you get to that, may I just ask this?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,657.87,662.424,--The Court... I have cited a source for that proposition.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,684.104,684.637,When they're negative.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,684.637,685.623,--when they are negative.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,687.056,694.979,"Well, not even... and you cite... it's amazing; it's 31 years ago... an opinion of mine of 31 years ago in New Jersey."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,697.079,699.364,--I think you're thinking of Ross v. Marks--
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,699.364,700.697,--For tetanus.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,702.113,707.184,--I would point out that there is an historical distinction that can be made here.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,707.184,711.986,"Well, if this opinion, which I wrote when I was on the Appellate Division in New Jersey--"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,711.986,712.505,In the Cortese case?
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,712.505,713.771,--Yes; in 1950.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,722.11,722.926,Yes.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,722.926,723.91,It did hold that?
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,723.91,724.16,Yes.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,724.16,725.743,And that the case ended there?
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,725.743,726.693,That's correct.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,726.693,727.112,Either civil or criminal?
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,727.112,727.995,That's correct.
1980.79-6779,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,750.058,752.324,"Mr. Blue, before you leave that--"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,752.324,752.974,--Certainly?
1980.79-6779,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,752.974,759.247,--Can you draw the line as to what the State wouldn't be required to pay for?
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,759.247,762.199,I think that there are two--
1980.79-6779,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,762.199,778.975,"I mean, could you say that if there is an expert in the field of something who is in South Africa, that the State would be obliged to bring him there?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,778.975,780.677,--No.
1980.79-6779,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,780.677,783.112,And the difference is?
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,783.112,784.595,The difference is two-fold.
1980.79-6779,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,805.526,810.263,"Well, suppose the expert could be obtained for $289."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,815.397,829.141,"--Well, I would draw a distinction between the type of evidence which is ordinarily obtainable by the typical nonindigent defendant and the type of evidence which would only be available to more wealthy people which would create a somewhat different equal protection argument."
1980.79-6779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,854.558,861.878,Expert testimony is by its nature and by definition opinion testimony.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,861.878,864.98,--That is correct for the typical expert testimony.
1980.79-6779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,864.98,865.932,"And we're not dealing here with opinion testimony, are we?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,865.932,868.884,But this is not expert opinion testimony.
1980.79-6779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,868.884,869.151,No.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,871.418,872.77,That's correct.
1980.79-6779,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,873.77,874.02,--Only facts.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,874.02,884.142,"--That's absolutely correct, and that's the distinction that I'm trying to draw between the expert that one might... I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?"
1980.79-6779,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,884.142,884.994,Isn't there another answer?
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,893.683,894.449,That's correct.
1980.79-6779,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.449,897.468,"So he has an absolute right, even though it costs a little money."
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,897.468,898.768,"Well, who pays his fee?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,913.995,914.68,That's correct.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,914.68,922.267,"Who pays the expense, even if he may be subpoenaed, of the expert witness who testifies in that respect?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,923.036,933.475,"The question rarely arises because when there is a medical showing of exclusion, typically the defendant will typically withdraw the case, or it would often be a motion for summary judgment that will be granted--"
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,933.475,934.209,"Well, I know, but if you had a--"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,934.209,962.911,"--If the State insists that it cross-examines the expert witness in a case like this where there is a showing of exclusion, I would argue to the right, I'm arguing, the right I'm arguing for would be meaningless if the resources were not provided to bring this expert witness to court, if it was the State was choosing to dispute it in the first place."
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,964.78,966.513,--You say the State would have to pay the expense?
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,966.513,969.732,--If the State chose to dispute that type of evidence.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,969.732,973.719,You would want to offer the result of a blood test?
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,973.719,974.152,That's correct.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,974.152,976.087,Or you would want to have one made?
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,976.087,976.82,That's correct.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,976.82,990.93,"And the State would say, well, we're not so sure that laboratory does these things in the way they ought to be done, and if you're going to do that, you'd better be prepared to put on expert testimony to support the validity of the test and the method by which it was taken."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1000.786,1002.286,"No, I would think not."
1980.79-6779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1020.449,1024.834,"Yes, but doesn't your argument really carry over to the other situation?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1024.834,1027.417,"What do you mean by the other situation, Justice Blackmun?"
1980.79-6779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1027.417,1043.646,"Well, take a purely private paternity action, and if the blood test is so crucial and so conclusive, on your theory if the putative father is indigent, shouldn't the State pay for that also?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1043.646,1055.269,"In due process terms I think it makes a great deal of difference whether the plaintiff, the actual plaintiff is the State or a purely private person."
1980.79-6779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1099.382,1102.667,"Well, you're taking the Boddie approach, Boddie v. Connecticut."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1106.202,1121.062,"That is in large part correct, because the fact of the matter is that like the would-be plaintiffs in Boddie, who were would-be plaintiffs, there is no alternative to the judicial process for the defendant in this case."
1980.79-6779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1137.007,1141.875,"Well, my inquiry is really whether if we go along with you here we're not on a slippery slope, wondering where we stop."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1141.875,1146.279,"--Well, I'm trying to draw... I understand your... I appreciate--"
1980.79-6779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.279,1148.981,"We got on it in Boddie, didn't we?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1148.981,1152.1,"--Well, you quickly got off in Kras and Ortwein."
1980.79-6779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.1,1152.833,"Yes, indeed."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1152.833,1163.289,"But the way you got off, and the distinction that you drew to get off, was the distinction between voluntary and involuntary litigants."
1980.79-6779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.0,1209.703,"But in Cuyler v. Sullivan, last year, in which this Court held that the standard for performance of counsel retained was the same as the counsel appointed, because the resulting judgment was the judgment of a state court imposing a certain penalty on a person, and therefore it was state action."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1209.703,1211.055,Like in Shelley v. Kramer?
1980.79-6779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.055,1211.721,Yes.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1229.85,1244.693,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is a legitimate argument, and the Court might well rightfully hold that the same result should pertain to all defendants, whether or not they're prosecuted by the State."
1980.79-6779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1257.75,1260.202,"Well, didn't the State also require this suit?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1260.202,1266.789,"Oh, it's absolutely mandated by state law which is, in turn, mandated by federal law, although the state law--"
1980.79-6779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.789,1271.593,"Because the mother, to get benefits, must reveal--"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1271.593,1272.043,--That's correct.
1980.79-6779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1272.043,1274.462,--the putative father and bring action.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1274.462,1275.712,That's absolutely correct.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1275.712,1276.612,"Well, she doesn't bring it."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1278.628,1278.845,That's right.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1279.345,1280.73,That's really the State of Connecticut.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1280.73,1282.414,--That's right.
1980.79-6779,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1282.414,1289.503,"And this case wasn't... the State suffered some expenses which were then taxed as costs, were they not, against the appellant?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1289.503,1291.455,"In this case, yes."
1980.79-6779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1297.775,1302.077,"You've made an extensive survey of these cases, I note in your brief."
1980.79-6779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1302.077,1307.631,Maybe you know the answer to this.
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1337.151,1342.22,"That's a question I would like for you, very much to see you ask my colleague, Mr. McGovern."
1980.79-6779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1350.41,1355.695,"Well, there are limits to res judicata, when there hasn't been a fair trial or something."
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1355.695,1356.647,"--Oh, absolutely."
1980.79-6779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.551,1364.718,"Well, how about around the country, or do you know?"
1980.79-6779,0,28980,jon_c_blue,,1364.718,1367.67,"I don't know, and I'm not sure that the question has even come up."
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,1990.686,1995.756,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it may please the Court:"
1980.79-6779,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2013.134,2015.919,"Well, that's what you call them, but are they really civil?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2015.919,2016.836,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2030.013,2031.813,Let me ask this.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2046.038,2047.89,"No, it isn't, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2133.81,2135.01,"Did you say that he is ""guilty""?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2135.01,2136.262,The only aspect--
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.262,2137.196,Is that right?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2137.196,2138.246,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2162.978,2204.822,"Mr. McGovern, do you understand the gist of your opponent's complaint in this case to be the failure of the State of Connecticut to allow blood grouping tests to be taxed against a state or against the private plaintiff, if it were to go that far, if the blood grouping tests prove to the satisfaction of the trier of fact that the defendant is not the father, or the failure to advance the money necessary to get the blood grouping test?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2204.822,2209.209,"There is no provision in the statute, Your Honor, for the taxing of cost."
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2237.209,2247.399,"Well, if you did, if you put the costs of this blood test in the costs, he would have to pay it, wouldn't he?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2247.399,2248.384,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.384,2249.867,Why didn't you do that?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2258.94,2259.392,I think this is--
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2259.392,2261.292,Doesn't the state do it in all the other costs?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2261.292,2265.712,"--State pays for the attorney, Your Honor--"
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2265.712,2269.83,"And the court, the judge, and everything, didn't they?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2272.866,2273.966,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.966,2275.234,Do they pay--
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2275.234,2276.384,That's just one piece of evidence.
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.103,2278.936,--Do they pay for the lawyer for the defendant?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2284.09,2287.619,The State does not pay for the lawyer.
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.064,2300.033,"--Well, it's the essay... the State is paying the lawyer in this case, for the defendant?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2300.033,2300.633,"--Yes, it is."
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.633,2314.442,"And in any other case, if it goes to contempt proceedings, would the State insure that the defendant in that contempt proceedings which you say is a separate matter has a lawyer?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2314.442,2321.798,"I would say, Your Honor, if he was incarcerated, as is the case here, yes."
1980.79-6779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.058,2352.9,"General McGovern, do you know, in a case that does not involve a nonindigent, say, a defendant had a blood test made and he paid for it, could he recover the cost of the blood test from the plaintiff in his cost-taxing costs of litigation?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2352.9,2356.971,I believe it might be possible that he could.
1980.79-6779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2358.587,2367.077,"Well, let me ask you another question about costs that Justice Marshall's question prompted."
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2382.603,2386.907,"I don't believe he does, Your Honor, no."
1980.79-6779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2386.907,2391.443,"So, any witnesses who would testify on his behalf would be just volunteers?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2391.443,2393.144,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2393.144,2396.929,May I ask this question also?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2407.987,2423.663,"The State in that situation, Your Honor... the case would have been referred to another State agency to bring a reciprocal support action, reciprocal paternity action, and the paternity action would most likely have to be brought in that state."
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2426.448,2427.998,I'm not talking about a different state.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2429.233,2430.7,"--I know, within Connecticut itself--"
1980.79-6779,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2430.7,2433.102,--You can't be 200 miles away in Connecticut and not be in a different state.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2433.102,2435.887,"--Pardon me, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2435.887,2438.006,In Virginia you can be 400 miles away.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2438.006,2445.327,"If the defendant resides in Connecticut, yes."
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2445.327,2446.945,You would pay his expenses?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2455.217,2457.267,"No, no, the State would not pay his expenses."
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.617,2459.502,What would you do?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2465.054,2467.922,"No, default without... he has a right to counsel."
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2467.922,2472.66,He wouldn't be there to testify.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2472.66,2480.681,He's served by a sheriff for him to appear at a date certain under cited court order.
1980.79-6779,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2493.989,2494.723,That would happen--
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2494.723,2498.293,But first he has four months to reopen the judgment.
1980.79-6779,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2498.293,2501.162,--So if the proceeding were brought in New Haven and he lived in Hartford--
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2501.162,2501.829,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2501.829,2506.733,"--Service would be made in Hartford by the sheriff of the county in which Hartford is located, is that it?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2506.733,2508.416,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2508.416,2512.951,"And then this would call upon him to respond in New Haven, appear?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2512.951,2514.32,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2514.32,2519.188,"And the State would not pay his, whatever the cost would be from Hartford to New Haven?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2519.188,2519.505,His transportation fees?
1980.79-6779,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2519.655,2525.29,"In this respect, it would be no different from a traffic violation or a negligence case or any other case, would it?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2525.29,2525.809,Exactly.
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.081,2541.484,"Well, it isn't exactly like civil litigation in a sense because the State requires that this action be brought."
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2541.484,2549.84,What other civil action does the State pay for the lawyer to prosecute the action for a private individual?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2549.84,2555.661,"--I don't believe there's any other, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2555.661,2556.628,Just this one?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2556.628,2557.794,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2557.794,2559.546,But it's still civil?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2559.546,2561.398,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2561.398,2563.798,"We resume there at 1 o'clock, counsel."
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2563.798,2564.517,Thank you.
1980.79-6779,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2565.2,2570.421,"Mr. McGovern, you may continue."
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2570.421,2574.306,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-6779,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2621.77,2630.309,"Under Connecticut law, don't I remember from the briefs that the defendant in an action such as this has something pretty close to the burden of proof?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2630.309,2635.177,"That is true, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.398,2646.652,"So it's not just his burden to disprove the State's case, which would be what cross-examination might do?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2646.652,2649.104,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2649.104,2651.537,He has the affirmative burden of proof.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2651.537,2655.591,The plaintiff has the burden of proof.
1980.79-6779,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2663.428,2667.649,But doesn't the defendant have some sort of an unusual burden in a case like this under Connecticut law?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2667.649,2684.693,"Under Connecticut law, if the plaintiff does remain constant in her accusation, and by preponderance of the evidence, the court may find the defendant to be the father of the child."
1980.79-6779,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2684.693,2685.81,I read these briefs some time ago--
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2685.81,2688.495,--Doesn't he have to do something other than his own testimony?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2693.031,2698.435,"If the plaintiff remains constant in her accusation, yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2698.435,2701.453,So he does have a burden in doing more than the direct testimony.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2701.453,2703.072,He does have the burden of--
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2703.072,2713.427,"Well, what if all the evidence in the case... what if the judge thinks that all the evidence in the case including his testimony and any other evidence is an equipoise?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2713.427,2717.164,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.164,2725.668,"Well, what if it's just evenly balanced, does he have the burden, ultimate burden to convince the judge by a preponderance of the evidence?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2725.668,2726.354,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.354,2727.62,That's what I thought; yes.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2727.62,2728.62,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2744.546,2751.133,"General McGovern, do you disagree though with the general appraisal of the reliability of the blood test that your opponent asserts?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2751.133,2752.668,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2752.668,2755.187,"So if it's available, that really is the most reliable?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2755.187,2756.887,It is the most reliable.
1980.79-6779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2756.887,2774.732,"Let me ask you another question in terms of, we talked about slippery slopes and that sort of thing here, is it possible that there's another interest that should be considered in the whole equation, and that is, the interest of the child makes it especially important that the correct answer be given in a case like this?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2774.732,2776.701,"Well, I would agree with that also, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2781.588,2784.957,It's not typical in litigation between private parties?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2784.957,2786.742,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2786.742,2788.592,"Well, what's the purpose of this inquiry?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2797.097,2807.22,The Supreme Court of Connecticut has stated that paternity action is nothing more than a shifting of economic arrangements from one party to another.
1980.79-6779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2815.909,2823.832,--Is that the same whether the action is initiated by the State or by the private plaintiff?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2823.832,2825.2,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2825.2,2832.77,"And is the burden of proof the same, whether it's initiated by the State or by the private plaintiff?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2832.77,2834.639,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2836.705,2846.697,"I think you've, in your answer to Mr. Justice Stevens, indicated that the child has an interest in this litigation."
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2855.803,2869.127,"I think, if we look at the statute, Your Honor, the statute is written to only allow admissibility of the test to exclude the defendant."
1980.79-6779,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2873.28,2874.53,So?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2874.53,2900.597,"So, I feel, if the statute remains in its current form, the rights of the child can best be protected by having the test paid for by the party who seeks to provide the evidence."
1980.79-6779,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2900.597,2914.171,"Well, here's an indigent who can't afford to pay it, and it might be that the real father is not indigent."
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2919.575,2925.896,"Well, we have to assume, Your Honor, that the mother has named the real father."
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.896,2927.098,Why?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2936.02,2940.055,"There have been errors made, but in the majority of instances, certainly--"
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.055,2943.857,This process would eliminate a good many possible errors.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2943.857,2952.982,"--Certainly, Your Honor, and the majority, in most of the cases, the defendant who is named in the litigation is found to be the father."
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2954.882,2956.017,"Well, why have the hearing?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2980.815,2982.049,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2982.049,2991.005,"How can you be certain when he's never had a blood test, when there is a possibility that the blood test would show that he was not the correct one?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,2991.005,2993.457,"Your Honor, this is civil litigation."
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3011.169,3012.287,I agree with Justice Blackmun.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3016.889,3020.34,"--It was brought by the plaintiff, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3022.042,3026.178,Who gave the plaintiff the lawyer to bring the suit?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3026.178,3029.213,--The state funded the attorney.
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3029.213,3030.648,And the State asked her to bring it.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3034.534,3035.317,Required her?
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3037.502,3038.186,If she wanted benefits.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3040.171,3041.89,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3041.89,3045.425,"Are you going to put ""private"" into quotes?"
1980.79-6779,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3053.079,3072.475,"Well, isn't... going back to one of your previous responses, is there any question about that the purpose of the proceeding is purely economic, to identify the person who is responsible for the future support of the child?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3072.475,3073.525,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3078.629,3093.306,"Well, more accurately, it's to shift, it's to shift the burden of support if they can locate the father from the State, because all this is, she doesn't get any assistance of any kind if in fact they can find the father able to support the child."
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3093.856,3095.939,If... that's correct.
1980.79-6779,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3107.08,3110.549,"Otherwise, the mother, to support the child, would have the benefit of public assistance, wouldn't she?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3110.549,3111.651,Yes.
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3111.651,3119.071,"Mr. McGovern, I'm not clear as to the burden of proof."
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3122.756,3124.391,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3124.391,3130.712,"And does she have the burden of persuasion, the overall burden of proof throughout the trial?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3130.712,3136.516,She has the burden of showing that the defendant is the father by a fair--
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3136.516,3137.949,"Well, that's at issue, isn't it?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3140.199,3142.734,"--Yes, Your Honor, by a fair preponderance of the evidence."
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3142.734,3143.367,All right.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3143.367,3146.536,Not beyond a reasonable doubt--
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3146.536,3147.471,I understand.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3147.471,3151.523,--as in a criminal litigation; by a fair preponderance of the evidence.
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3151.523,3153.875,She has the normal burden in a civil case?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3153.875,3156.141,"That's correct, throughout this trial."
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3156.141,3157.077,That isn't what you said a minute ago.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3158.193,3160.779,"Excuse me, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3160.779,3165.331,"Well, I'm trying to find out your question that led him to say just the opposite, I think, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3178.424,3185.711,She does have have the burden of proof and the defendant can introduce evidence to rebut it.
1980.79-6779,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3185.711,3186.828,Of course.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3191.131,3192.714,The plaintiff.
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.714,3198.135,"Well, you answered me just exactly the reverse a little while ago."
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3204.789,3208.674,"Well, I would state--"
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3208.674,3210.943,--I'll start out this way.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3217.763,3227.702,--His testimony alone is not as long as the plaintiff remains constant in her accusation that the defendant is the father of the child.
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3227.702,3235.908,"--So she always prevails, as long as he doesn't offer any other testimony besides his own?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3235.908,3238.51,"As long... that's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3238.51,3257.072,Can you tell us where in the case materials the statute or decision is that supports the... I too sense somewhat differing answers to the questions.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3257.072,3261.126,"No, I can't point to the statute, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3261.126,3264.428,"Well, how can you answer the question then?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3272.331,3289.876,"The case law of Connecticut states that the mother of the child if she remains constant in her accusation that defendant is the father of the child, paternity is an issue."
1980.79-6779,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3300.084,3306.42,"Well, does that mean this, that she takes the stand, she said, he's the father, he's the father, he's the father, he's the father."
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3321.197,3324.899,"--If that was the testimony, she would win."
1980.79-6779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3324.899,3330.452,--What case is it in Connecticut that says--
1980.79-6779,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3330.452,3338.224,"--The case law begins, discussion of it begins on page 33 of the appellant's brief, going back first to"
1980.79-6779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3357.186,3359.055,"Thank you, counsel."
1980.79-6779,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3359.055,3369.744,That's at least where my impression came from.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3375.397,3389.824,The fact that other states have chosen to fund the cost of blood grouping tests does not mean that the State of Connecticut should be made to do likewise.
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3412.939,3421.145,Who pays for the witnesses for the plaintiff?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3421.145,3427.782,In this action there were no witnesses other than the--
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3427.782,3429.568,"But, normally, who would pay?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3429.568,3431.584,--The party--
1980.79-6779,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3431.584,3432.52,The State would.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3435.12,3436.905,"--The State would probably... yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3440.273,3456.717,"Mr. McGovern, the most recent case cited in the appellant's brief, to which my brother Stewart has referred, is a case called, cited as 6 Connecticut Circuit Court 516."
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3459.818,3463.638,The circuit court no longer exists in Connecticut.
1980.79-6779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3491.206,3499.478,And what is the most recent decision of the highest court of the State of Connecticut on the subject?
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3499.478,3502.947,Of blood grouping tests?
1980.79-6779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3502.947,3503.347,Yes.
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3509.834,3521.242,"Could I suggest that your colleague at the bottom of page 34 of his brief cites a Connecticut Supreme Court case, Mosher v. Bennett?"
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3521.242,3522.042,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3522.042,3523.261,And that quote is this:
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3542.322,3544.757,"Currently that is the law of Connecticut, Your Honor."
1980.79-6779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3544.757,3546.959,That's a 1929 case.
1980.79-6779,1,41788,stephen_j_mcgovern,,3548.326,3549.742,"No, it hasn't."
1980.79-6779,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3652.476,3661.498,"Thank you, gentlemen."
