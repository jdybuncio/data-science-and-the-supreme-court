2010.09-11556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.86,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-11556, Tolentino v. New York."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,9.71,12.453,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-11556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,87.227,100.94,"Was -- was -- was the poisonous fruit the DMV records, or was the poisonous fruit the fact that this person who is contained in the records was the one driving the car?"
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,119.114,125.596,"Well, Justice Scalia, that is also a fruit of the poisonous tree."
2010.09-11556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,126.476,127.939,I would agree with you on that fruit.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,131.78,136.503,"--Yes, that was asked for in the -- in the motion at the trial level."
2010.09-11556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.882,139.345,"But that's not what's before us here, right?"
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,139.345,156.65,"--That's right, and that's because the court below decided that -- in deciding the case only addressed the DMV record, and -- and indicated that the DMV records were not properly suppressible fruit."
2010.09-11556,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,156.65,157.197,Suppose that the--
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,157.197,158.013,And that's the issue.
2010.09-11556,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,158.013,176.001,--Suppose that -- that you had won at the trial level; the judge suppresses everything and dismisses the indictment; and Mr. Tolentino walks out of the courtroom and is observed by the officer that conducted the stop in this case.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,184.279,186.455,"Yes, Justice Alito, he could."
2010.09-11556,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,186.455,198.241,Even though the officer would have no reason to know that this particular person has a suspended license were it not for the chain of events that followed from the initial allegedly illegal stop?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,198.241,216.713,"Well, although that initial stop provided the tainted information that he didn't have a license, the subsequent reoffense would certainly taint the -- the illegality of the first stop and make the second offense properly--"
2010.09-11556,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,216.713,217.046,All right.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,245.137,253.914,"--Well, that -- I believe that under those circumstances it would be entirely proper to prosecute the case."
2010.09-11556,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,257.923,265.868,"Well, I mean, in light of those two answers, it does seem to me that your real problem here is not with the -- the DMV records."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,273.598,282.163,"Well, Justice Alito, again, all of -- there's lots of evidence that could be properly the fruit of the poisonous tree."
2010.09-11556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,300.929,321.16,"Is there -- is there any case in this Court where what was suppressed was information that was lawfully in the government's possession, as opposed to evidence that was acquired originally through the search?"
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,338.086,338.882,Yes.
2010.09-11556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,395.555,416.619,"Suppose the police following Mr. Tolentino had noted down his license plate, and then got this information, not as a result of his driver's license, but from the plate on the car?"
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,416.619,429.868,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the -- the plates of the car would not indicate the -- the driver's license of the driver, and in this case Mr. Tolentino--"
2010.09-11556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.868,431.848,They might show him as the owner of the car.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,431.848,432.711,--The owner of the car.
2010.09-11556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,453.541,465.145,"This -- this goes back to a question Justice Alito asked in a probably more artful way, but I'm not quite sure what's supposed to happen under your view after this stop."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,477.811,480.403,"No, Justice Kennedy, that's not what would happen."
2010.09-11556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,498.041,500.837,"Well, why isn't impounding the car the fruit of the illegal search?"
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,500.837,509.199,"--Because the -- the impoundment statutes are based on a public safety interest, and so it doesn't--"
2010.09-11556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,509.199,520.068,But why doesn't the public safety interest then permit us to use this evidence in order to protect the public safety further by punishing him for -- not driving?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,521.052,533.068,"--Because in order to do that, it would be tantamount to sanctioning a -- a fishing expedition in this case, Justice Kennedy, because it would be allowing the police without reasonable suspicion--"
2010.09-11556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,533.068,534.697,"Well, why wouldn't you say the same thing about impounding the car?"
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,534.697,547.78,"--Because the -- the -- the interests are different and because it's not a forever removal of the Petitioner's right to get the car, whoever the -- the rightful owner is."
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,595.093,598.602,I don't understand the answer you gave to Justice Alito.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,604.453,605.083,Uh-huh.
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,605.083,606.183,So illegal stop.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,613.944,614.444,Yes.
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,614.444,619.379,So that shouldn't be introduced into his trial for driving without a license.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,619.379,620.362,Yes.
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,620.362,620.842,All right.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,633.878,636.137,Well--
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,636.137,636.934,Is that right?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,651.533,658.878,"--Justice Breyer, what I -- what I meant to say is the attenuation doctrine would apply."
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,670.997,672.044,So therefore they couldn't arrest him.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,674.423,675.385,"Well, yes, but--"
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,675.385,682.867,"They see -- they see he -- they stopped him, they get the records, wrongly."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,693.607,697.079,--Except I just have to remind you that they -- they could--
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,697.079,697.563,Is that right or not?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,698.013,698.626,--impound the car.
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,698.626,701.385,I -- how could they -- they can impound the car.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,701.385,702.185,Impound the car.
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,702.185,702.702,Because?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,702.702,703.098,So--
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,703.098,703.548,Because?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,703.548,718.477,"--Because of the statutory rights, the Court -- because they now know that he has no license to drive, so either the car will -- if there's another person who can properly take possession of the vehicle, then that person can drive off with the car."
2010.09-11556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,724.078,725.558,"Ms. Schwarz, suppose--"
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,725.558,726.024,And--
2010.09-11556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,726.024,726.421,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,726.421,728.55,"--Well, I'm done."
2010.09-11556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,728.55,745.189,"Ms. Schwarz, suppose the police arrest the guy, find out who he is, don't -- stop the guy, find out who he is, don't arrest him, but then now they know that this is the kind of guy who drives without a license."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,752.919,767.548,"Justice Kagan, I think the answer would be yes, and the reason why is because if they see him on a subsequent occasion and they're seeing him re-offend, that would attenuate the taint of the first--"
2010.09-11556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,767.548,771.308,So the re-offense -- the re-offense just cuts off the original taint?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,771.308,773.567,"--I believe so, yes."
2010.09-11556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,779.419,787.0,So the only way that the police can prevent an unlicensed driver from driving in this situation is to take away his car?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,791.205,792.668,Well--
2010.09-11556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,792.668,798.769,"Unless they want -- for any offense, you know, expired driver's license."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,827.777,832.083,--If the -- if the stop was--
2010.09-11556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,832.083,834.426,Totally illegal.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,834.426,834.942,--Totally illegal--
2010.09-11556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,834.942,835.526,"Totally, yes."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,835.526,841.74,--Then I don't think that -- if there were -- I don't think that they could prosecute that case.
2010.09-11556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,843.886,849.721,And the only way to prevent him from reoffending immediately is to impound the car?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,857.702,860.478,"--Well, again, that would be attenuation analysis."
2010.09-11556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,886.893,887.793,Why not?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,888.356,889.523,--Because of the impoundment statutes.
2010.09-11556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,889.523,893.745,"--Is that your answer, then: They've got to impound the car every time or let the guy just go?"
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,893.745,907.874,"Well, they -- they could drive the person home to his house or take him to the corner or tell him not to drive until he cleared up his license."
2010.09-11556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,909.004,912.68,They could tell him not to drive until he clears up his license?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,912.68,914.689,I -- yes.
2010.09-11556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,940.225,941.688,How much time do they have to wait?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,951.511,952.044,--Yes.
2010.09-11556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,952.044,972.159,"You -- I think now you have answered, he gets back into the car, drives it away, they can do nothing because it's too close to when they discovered his record of -- his suspended license."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,978.86,998.044,"Well, that would be -- attenuation would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, Justice Ginsburg, but I would think if, even an hour later, if the Petitioner brazenly drove by those same officers, you know, thumbing his nose at them, hi, that would be -- attenuation analysis would apply at that point."
2010.09-11556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,998.044,1016.515,"Because you could say that if he got back in the car right after the stop, if the police for some reason did not impound the car and he got back in the car, that's another offense, and so by your theory, then they could properly arrest him and use all of this knowledge in a prosecution?"
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1016.515,1020.92,And a court very well -- very well may agree with you on that.
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1035.616,1038.375,"Well, what -- what is that word, the ""bad faith""?"
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1056.43,1056.726,No.
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1057.71,1058.023,What?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1060.919,1061.349,You can.
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1061.349,1061.932,What?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1062.494,1066.503,"Well, the -- the warrants are entirely different--"
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1066.503,1066.966,Why?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1066.966,1068.763,--because of the Ker-Frisbie doctrine.
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1078.836,1097.771,"So if, in fact, a policeman stops a person without cause and learns as a result of that that there are many warrants outstanding against him, he then can arrest the person, and -- but can he introduce those warrants into court as evidence or whatever if it's relevant?"
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1097.771,1099.567,"--Absolutely, he can bring them in."
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1101.447,1120.048,"Suppose the way that the policeman stops the person and gets the information illegally is he takes an axe and breaks into the house, the policeman, and thereby -- what I'm showing -- I just think this case has lots of implications, and I'm looking for a rule here that's going to work in a lot of different situations."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1120.048,1126.862,"Well, there's -- actually, I'm sorry, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure I follow."
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1126.862,1134.594,"Well, you say that if, in fact, he learns that this man from the public records is a triple axe murderer--"
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1134.594,1135.227,Right.
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1135.227,1138.119,"--he can do nothing about it, I said?"
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1141.545,1142.361,Okay.
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.496,1171.736,"It happens to be a description of the individual, not a warrant, he gets from the public record which is read off to him when he calls in, a description: A red tie."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1198.152,1202.374,"--The New York Court of Appeals rule categorically removes it, that's true."
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1202.374,1203.374,"Yes, and I was testing that."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1208.226,1208.859,No.
2010.09-11556,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1211.039,1213.13,"I mean, not an incorrect rule, the opposite rule."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1213.797,1235.408,"--Well, it's -- the problem with that rule, the categorical rule, is that it will create a fresh incentive for police officers to make these kind of suspicionless stops, and so it will encourage police to violate the Fourth Amendment, and not only--"
2010.09-11556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.408,1245.548,Not -- not if you allow the suppression of the policeman's identification of the individual driving the car.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1269.538,1274.259,--Because--
2010.09-11556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1274.259,1276.519,"What I'm saying is, you're getting at it from the wrong end."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1283.471,1283.917,--Ah.
2010.09-11556,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1301.471,1303.684,But that's not the argument you seem to be making.
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1335.868,1346.108,"Well, again, our position is that both of those items are properly suppressible."
2010.09-11556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1366.839,1373.773,I thought there was some rule about not being able to suppress a person's identity?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1398.143,1413.189,"--That -- that is a restatement of the Ker-Frisbie doctrine, that essentially says that a person cannot suppress himself, his body, in order to defeat the jurisdiction of the court."
2010.09-11556,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1413.189,1419.836,And so how does that fit with your earlier answers that his identity here could be suppressed?
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1432.205,1445.206,"There's -- there's a distinction between the identity and the elicitation of his name, and the elicitation of his name which led to the DMV records."
2010.09-11556,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1445.206,1451.407,"Well, it -- it gets you nowhere to say John Smith."
2010.09-11556,0,33979,kristina_schwarz,,1484.037,1497.97,"Well, this Court has always defined evidentiary fruit as something that -- of evidentiary value which the public authorities have caused an arrested person to yield to them during an illegal detention, and that's from the Davis case."
2010.09-11556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1534.893,1535.922,"Thank you, Ms. Schwarz."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1539.68,1542.939,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-11556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1580.845,1592.214,"You're suggesting that it's okay for the police to walk up to any citizen, anywhere, and say, you're under arrest until you give me your name?"
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1592.214,1593.677,"--Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2010.09-11556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1593.677,1598.482,"Well, there's -- there's been no doubt here that it was a stop without suspicion."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1604.35,1605.083,Because--
2010.09-11556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1605.083,1612.861,"--That they took a person randomly, detained them without any suspicion, and said give me your name."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1615.491,1616.12,"--No, I'm not."
2010.09-11556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1620.942,1621.292,I am presuming.
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1623.305,1640.692,"We are not at all challenging this Court's decisions, certainly not Delaware v. Prouse or any others, which hold that the police may not stop someone without basis and may not certainly enforce the sort of statute that was at issue in Hiibel without some basis for asking for identification--"
2010.09-11556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1640.692,1650.783,So isn't the eliciting of the name as a result of an unlawful stop something that could be suppressed?
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1650.783,1659.347,"--It should not be subject to suppression, and that's a distinct question from whether or not there was a constitutional violation that occurred in the stop and the asking of the name."
2010.09-11556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1659.347,1664.449,"The name is different than the person, the body of the person, which has to do with the Court's jurisdiction."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1701.223,1706.159,"Because it has a unique status, as this Court recognized in Hiibel, in the criminal justice system."
2010.09-11556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1720.871,1728.073,"What's the difference between stopping a car and stopping a person on the street, as Justice Sotomayor asked?"
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1750.796,1756.064,"I think it is the same in terms of what the Fourth Amendment requires, and Delaware v. Prouse holds that."
2010.09-11556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1767.138,1773.786,"So, Ms. Halligan, suppose -- you're suggesting there should be an exception for knowledge of identity."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1814.217,1818.886,"In your hypothetical I'm not sure whether there would be any Fifth Amendment issues that would be at play, but--"
2010.09-11556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1818.886,1826.55,"No, they find out this person's alias as the result of the illegal search, and that allows them to build a substantial criminal case."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1826.55,1831.339,"--If all that is obtained is the name, then the exclusionary rule should not be applied."
2010.09-11556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1831.339,1836.411,"So there's a diary, and it says: I am John Smith."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1846.847,1849.773,"The diary itself, the document would be suppressible."
2010.09-11556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1859.134,1880.66,"Suppose that when -- when the police stopped this particular car, they saw that Mr. Tolentino was smoking marijuana or snorting cocaine or drinking from a bottle of alcohol or he had somebody tied up, bound and gagged on the back seat of the car."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1890.271,1891.401,"That's correct, and--"
2010.09-11556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1891.401,1895.54,"Even though they were in plain view, they would all be suppressed, right?"
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1895.54,1896.585,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-11556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1896.585,1904.15,"But you're saying that the observation that Mr. Tolentino is at the wheel of the car, that is not suppressed?"
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1904.15,1917.566,"I would like to distinguish between the observation of the person driving the car, to the extent that you might have a case in which that observation is made after the stop as opposed to before the stop; that's a different and distinct question."
2010.09-11556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1955.055,1957.118,He made a mistake and said: I'm driving the car.
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1957.118,1958.397,Pardon?
2010.09-11556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1958.397,1959.61,He made a mistake.
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1967.675,1968.387,Well--
2010.09-11556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1968.387,1970.433,So now you're saying why does this case even come up?
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1981.007,1983.682,"--Well, that's right, and that's why part of why a name should not be--"
2010.09-11556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1983.682,1987.608,"So this case shouldn't be a special rule, it should just be a case of -- what is it called?"
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1991.164,2000.274,--You could resolve the case on the theory that by definition government records that are previously held--
2010.09-11556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2000.274,2006.793,But they're only inevitably discovered if he makes a mistake of saying what his name is.
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2016.616,2022.718,--In this case the question of any observations of the defendant is waived.
2010.09-11556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2026.744,2027.19,--Wait.
2010.09-11556,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.64,2028.057,I was going to ask that.
2010.09-11556,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2028.64,2029.057,--Why is--
2010.09-11556,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.057,2032.612,--your -- your friend said that it was raised below.
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2034.659,2045.778,"What happened is this: In the suppression motion initially, the defendant sought to suppress a number of things, including the observations of the police."
2010.09-11556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2116.164,2121.386,Do you -- is your position that they can do anything in terms of the search of a name?
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2127.17,2134.135,"I think that would be correct, Your Honor, but here you have records that not only are in the government's possession -- and this Court never has suggested--"
2010.09-11556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2134.135,2142.449,"I know -- I know it raises a different question, but you know, you keep saying they're just -- or you know, you're just talking about the name, but names are meaningless in the abstract."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2146.921,2147.521,--The--
2010.09-11556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2147.521,2155.153,"And these days there's so many electronic databases, you can find out an awful lot just, you know, with the punch of a few -- a few buttons."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2155.153,2166.106,"--You could, and I think that that's why if the Court was concerned about the potential breadth of that holding, it could narrow it to the use of the name to link to government records."
2010.09-11556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2175.716,2178.559,"No, but it's not limited to suggesting danger or whatever."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2185.594,2197.114,"--That's right, and that's because you are in the process of conducting some sort of investigation, and to suppress the knowledge of someone's identity would -- would blink reality."
2010.09-11556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2197.114,2200.753,"Well, they're not suppressing the knowledge of someone's identity."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2206.437,2211.659,I think it's very different than when you have drugs in a car which could clearly be subject to suppression.
2010.09-11556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2232.156,2232.852,Could I go back and--
2010.09-11556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2232.852,2238.157,"I think that that's not right, Ms. Halligan, because the search is the poisonous tree."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2252.286,2254.333,"Two points, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-11556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2284.82,2285.07,Why does it--
2010.09-11556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2285.07,2296.773,--Could I go back and ask you to -- to explain what -- how you -- you think the -- the request for suppression of the police officer's observation was waived?
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2302.578,2302.941,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-11556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2302.941,2318.504,"Now, the -- the New York Supreme Court apparently didn't understand that that issue was in the case and ruled only on suppression of the records and tangible evidence, is that right, 78A?"
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2318.504,2319.3,Yes.
2010.09-11556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2319.3,2327.281,What is the -- what is Mr. Tolentino supposed to do at that point to preserve the issue of the suppression of a police officer's observation?
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2327.281,2337.205,"To preserve the issue, Mr. Tolentino should have raised that fact to the judge, should have pointed it out pursuant to CPLR 71070, subsection (2)."
2010.09-11556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2349.074,2354.842,"The defendant raises an issue before the trial judge, the trial judge ignores that issue, misses the issue--"
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2354.842,2356.888,And then the defendant pleads guilty.
2010.09-11556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2356.888,2363.157,"--and then the defendant waives the issue unless the defendant says by the way, you missed -- you failed to address one of the arguments that I made?"
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2363.157,2366.963,"At the point at which the defendant pleads guilty, that is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-11556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2393.878,2398.1,You -- you make the point that these records are already in the government's possession.
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2398.1,2398.829,Yes.
2010.09-11556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2398.829,2403.535,"I mean, isn't that true of everything that's available on any type of database?"
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2414.276,2430.117,"Well, this is in the government's possession in the literal sense of the word, and in fact to correct something that was said previously, although it's not in the record, the DMV records, along with other records, such as arrest warrants, are in fact in the NYPD's possession."
2010.09-11556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2437.385,2439.728,"Well, it can't make a difference on whose server it is, does it?"
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2439.728,2441.987,"--No, I'm simply saying that it is in their possession."
2010.09-11556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2441.987,2447.125,"It is information that they can get if they have the correct way of searching it, which is here by name."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2447.125,2458.079,And -- and the fact that they are drawn to the records because they have stopped this individual and they have this name does not disqualify them from using those records.
2010.09-11556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2498.434,2501.526,May I ask you something about the practice in New York?
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2512.546,2513.896,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-11556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2513.896,2521.739,"But the police said it was lawful, because the radio was blasting so loud."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2554.339,2558.265,The prosecutor made two arguments on the -- in response to the suppression motion.
2010.09-11556,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2573.69,2575.236,It does seem rather strange.
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2596.799,2603.031,"I'm not sure that anyone realized that this case would -- would eventually come before this Court, but that is the way this particular case."
2010.09-11556,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2603.031,2604.031,Of course we know it's too loud.
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2604.91,2610.233,"There's actually a provision of the New York City Administrative Code, Your Honor, which is on point--"
2010.09-11556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2610.233,2612.658,Are these things public records?
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2618.326,2621.086,"--Frankly, I think that's a difficult question, Your Honor."
2010.09-11556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2649.564,2662.98,"--Your government records argument, is it limited to New York City records or does it also apply to FBI records, to records of other cities and states which, presumably, would be available on a reciprocal basis?"
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2662.98,2666.156,"I think it would apply to records available on a reciprocal basis, Your Honor."
2010.09-11556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2668.285,2690.412,"Counsel, do you see no difference between Crews and Bynum, in the typical case where the evidence against the defendant is not developed as a result of an illegal stop -- it exists independent of that stop -- and one in which the stop itself creates the ground for arrest?"
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2694.367,2703.228,"--I guess I would say that what creates the grounds for arrest here is the fact that the individual was driving with a suspended license, and no--"
2010.09-11556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2703.228,2707.283,But there was no suspicion of that when that person was stopped.
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2714.182,2715.215,"--But so, too, with Bynum."
2010.09-11556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2721.746,2725.938,But all of the evidence at trial really had nothing to do with the fingerprint.
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2733.152,2737.375,"--I believe in Bynum, Your Honor, the prints were critical, and here the only element--"
2010.09-11556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2737.375,2738.421,In the arrest.
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2738.421,2740.301,"--No, in the adjudication itself."
2010.09-11556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2753.467,2754.68,"Thank you, Ms. Halligan."
2010.09-11556,1,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2754.68,2755.643,Thank you.
2010.09-11556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2755.643,2765.966,Mr. Shah.
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2765.966,2769.142,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-11556,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2801.113,2801.546,Are you--
2010.09-11556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2801.546,2809.473,Is everything that the government has access to through any database considered in the government's possession?
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2809.473,2814.742,"No, I don't -- I don't think I would go that far in terms of our government records argument."
2010.09-11556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2816.455,2819.881,"Well, you said -- as you phrased it, I thought it was in the government's possession."
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2819.881,2823.685,"--Right, effectively in the government's possession I think would be the standard."
2010.09-11556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2829.371,2830.404,"Well, what's the difference?"
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2838.934,2845.116,"I think for the governmental records part of our argument, that rationale is an independent rationale."
2010.09-11556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2860.662,2862.041,"Well, what if -- I'm sorry, go ahead."
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2862.041,2870.235,--That something might be -- that something that could be found by using Google was already in the government's possession before the violation occurred.
2010.09-11556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2870.235,2880.976,"Well, what if it's in the -- the government of Colorado's possession, and they have an arrangement with New York that they will let them check their files to find out, you know, whatever it is, nationwide or something?"
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2882.689,2883.484,I think it could.
2010.09-11556,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2894.938,2899.03,How about private databases that are going to be available to the government upon request?
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2899.03,2902.336,I think -- I think that's stretching it a little bit further.
2010.09-11556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2927.956,2928.834,Why?
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2938.529,2939.109,--Okay.
2010.09-11556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2939.109,2941.668,"And there, he sees on the desk the name is Dagwood."
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2954.621,2958.51,I think if I understand your--
2010.09-11556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2958.51,2961.935,"I mean, that's how they -- they knew the name, they got the evidence, they get to the place."
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2964.028,2964.844,--Right.
2010.09-11556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2964.844,2965.241,Okay.
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2966.954,2970.796,"If I understand the hypothetical, they break into someone's house--"
2010.09-11556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2970.796,2971.276,"Yes, illegally."
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2972.389,2973.289,"--Right, and they find--"
2010.09-11556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2973.289,2974.184,His name.
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2974.184,2976.481,--They find the defendant's name?
2010.09-11556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2976.481,2977.21,"Yes, correct."
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2977.21,2977.794,Right.
2010.09-11556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2980.703,2998.888,"I just wondered if you were going to also say in my example, which I could make more realistic with more time, which you don't want to give me, the -- but -- that he uses the name, and as a result gets all kinds of evidence in the form of drugs, murder victims, whatever you want."
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3001.564,3006.618,--I think the government could have an argument that the fruits would not be suppressible.
2010.09-11556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3006.618,3009.561,They're not suppressible simply because you get them through a name?
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3023.757,3024.823,"A couple of responses, Your Honor."
2010.09-11556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3028.562,3029.609,"Okay, okay."
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3031.655,3032.188,--Right.
2010.09-11556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3032.188,3033.747,Now assume it's the opposite response.
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3042.145,3044.321,Okay.
2010.09-11556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3053.848,3054.894,I know.
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3077.438,3077.718,Right.
2010.09-11556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3094.392,3109.188,"Suppose they -- they -- they break into the house with an axe, and they find out the name, they see this guy is Dagwood, and so they run that through their -- their database, and they find this is the guy we've been looking for, for the last 20 years."
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3131.049,3131.928,"--No, no, Your Honor."
2010.09-11556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3176.899,3211.592,"You mentioned some -- before you finish, you -- you said a name is not suppressible, and that's because this Court held -- we started out by saying the observation of the person that dropped out of this case, so we're talking only about records, but the extraction of a name, you say that's not suppressible, even though it was unlawfully extracted because there were no reasonable suspicions that this person did anything wrong?"
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3211.592,3228.101,"Yes -- yes, Your Honor, we would say that a name is different, that it's not suppressible, and we would rely on the language this Court used in Lopez-Mendoza, which says the respondent's body or identity is never suppressible, even if it's obtained as a result of an illegal search, seizure or interrogation."
2010.09-11556,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3237.424,3239.137,"Mr. Shah, how would you think about this problem?"
2010.09-11556,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3259.117,3270.738,"Your Honor, I think other types of biometric evidence that you suggest, for example, of blood evidence, might well implicate competing considerations that would dictate a different result."
2010.09-11556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3370.768,3371.818,"Thank you, Mr. Shah."
2010.09-11556,3,33979,kristina_schwarz,,3374.194,3386.86,"I would first just like to address Justice Breyer's concern about what the rule should be, and -- excuse me."
2010.09-11556,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3545.639,3549.862,"And I suppose would subject the police officers to liability, though, right?"
2010.09-11556,3,33979,kristina_schwarz,,3550.908,3589.36,"Well, again, this is a classic case where there's a clear relationship, a causal relationship, so this is the sort of case where this Court has continued allegiance to application of the exclusionary rule where the exclusionary rule is very strong; and so why would the Court say that the second sister of the exclusionary rule, in this circumstance where there's sufficiently deliberate, that exclusion would be meaningful and sufficiently culpable, that the evidence would be -- that application of the rule would be worth the cost?"
2010.09-11556,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3592.702,3601.563,"Counsel, are you agreeing with your adversary that you abandoned and are not entitled to raise the suppressibility of the observation?"
2010.09-11556,3,33979,kristina_schwarz,,3601.563,3602.776,No.
2010.09-11556,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3603.572,3611.82,"And if you're not, in what ways is it tied to the question presented about identity, which is the issue you sought cert on?"
2010.09-11556,3,33979,kristina_schwarz,,3611.82,3612.22,--Right.
2010.09-11556,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3633.996,3634.793,Why?
2010.09-11556,3,33979,kristina_schwarz,,3645.199,3661.958,"Well, but at the suppression hearing, the -- the court would be free to consider all of the suppressible fruit, including the -- the statement that was made and the observations and also the DMV records."
2010.09-11556,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3662.521,3663.204,"Thank you, counsel."
