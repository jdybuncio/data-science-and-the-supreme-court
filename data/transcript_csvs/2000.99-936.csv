2000.99-936,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.513,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-936, Crystal Ferguson v. The City of Charleston."
2000.99-936,0,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,9.572,12.676,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-936,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,73.247,86.437,"Ms. Smith, with respect to the first of your reasons you point out that it is quite true, in a sense, that the law enforcement component of the whole scheme was necessary for success."
2000.99-936,0,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,142.766,155.203,"If there were no law enforcement scheme there would be a search that was being done, but it would be a search that was only done for medical purposes, Your Honor, and therefore, as it was before the policy was--"
2000.99-936,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,155.203,155.385,Right.
2000.99-936,0,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,155.385,156.121,Right.
2000.99-936,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,156.121,155.385,Yes.
2000.99-936,0,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,156.323,155.385,"--implemented, right, and therefore it would have been consented to, because there was consent to treatment in that context."
2000.99-936,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,175.307,194.437,"Well, they had no... I'll grant you that the treating physicians had no special need, I guess, to get people into drug treatment programs, necessarily, but they did have a special need to discover the facts and, in fact, to get the evidence that ultimately was turned over to the police."
2000.99-936,0,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,195.695,199.855,--In some cases there may have been a need to do medical testing.
2000.99-936,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,201.182,202.281,"Well, didn't they do it... maybe I'm wrong."
2000.99-936,0,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,203.377,209.411,"--They did medical testing prior to the policy for about 3 to 6 months, Your Honor."
2000.99-936,1,39444,robert_h_hood,,1605.017,1610.258,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-936,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1620.916,1629.018,"May I just, at that very point, I thought we had to assume for purposes of analyzing this issue that there was no consent."
2000.99-936,1,39444,robert_h_hood,,1629.018,1633.608,"Your Honor, we raised the issue of consent at trial."
2000.99-936,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1637.8,1639.184,The jury found consent.
2000.99-936,1,39444,robert_h_hood,,1639.184,1639.563,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-936,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.563,1645.437,But then in affirming the jury verdict the court of appeals did not reach the issue of consent and said--
2000.99-936,1,39444,robert_h_hood,,1645.437,1645.831,Correct.
2000.99-936,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.831,1652.712,"--and in fact held that even if there were no consent, these searches were proper under the special needs doctrine, is that not right?"
2000.99-936,1,39444,robert_h_hood,,1652.712,1652.712,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
2000.99-936,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1652.712,1667.252,"So don't we have to assume for purposes of analyzing the legal issue that there was no consent, and if there's an issue to be... if we disagreed with the court of appeals, in other words, we'd send it back to say whether there was evidence supporting the jury verdict."
2000.99-936,1,39444,robert_h_hood,,1667.252,1680.282,"Well, sir, I don't agree with that, because I believe under the United States v. New York Telephone Company, decided in 1977, the Court is not limited to affirm on an issue that is not really--"
2000.99-936,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1680.282,1681.167,"Well, no, we could affirm--"
2000.99-936,1,39444,robert_h_hood,,1681.167,1681.731,"Yes, sir."
2000.99-936,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.731,1687.005,"--on the ground that there was consent, but the special needs... and then we wouldn't need to reach the issue of special needs."
2000.99-936,1,39444,robert_h_hood,,1687.005,1687.005,Correct.
2000.99-936,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1687.005,1700.341,"But if we were to confront the issue of special needs, we do that on the assumption that we don't have to decide whether there was consent or not, which is tantamount as a matter of law to saying we assume, in analyzing this issue, that there was no consent."
2000.99-936,1,39444,robert_h_hood,,1700.341,1703.057,"Correct, and that's what the Fourth Circuit did, Your Honor."
2000.99-936,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1710.241,1726.121,"How did that work when the woman in question was no longer pregnant, had given birth to the child, and was taken from the hospital just after birth?"
2000.99-936,1,39444,robert_h_hood,,1756.152,1757.946,"No, Your Honor."
2000.99-936,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1778.337,1793.549,I may have misspoken when I said most. Were there women among these plaintiffs who were tested at the time of childbirth and who were sent to jail the day after the child was born?
2000.99-936,1,39444,robert_h_hood,,1793.549,1795.4,"--Yes, Your Honor, there were."
2000.99-936,2,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3414.671,3416.755,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2000.99-936,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3620.797,3621.542,"Thank you, Ms. Smith."
2000.99-936,2,38302,priscilla_j_smith,,3621.542,3622.363,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2000.99-936,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3622.363,3622.993,The case is submitted.
