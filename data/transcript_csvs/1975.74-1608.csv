1975.74-1608,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,44.47,"We hear arguments next in 1619, Federal Power Commission against the NAACP and 1608, NAACP against the Federal Power Commission."
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,45.875,49.813,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1608,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,111.128,123.034,"Mr. Journey, your statement at what you now require from this Court is such and such raises a question in my mind that bothered me while reading the briefs and bothering the Court of Appeals opinion."
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,161.401,172.104,"You Honor, if you look at the history of this, the PG&E case which is quoted in the Commission’s Declaratory Order Number 623."
1975.74-1608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.734,457.397,"Do you mean the Court Appeals is saying that in an individual proceeding, you could look into employment practices as such or only in connection with the cost?M"
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,457.397,459.207,The ladder -- but we—
1975.74-1608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.207,467.381,"And if you thought that, you concluded that if they had the legal employment practices their cost might be lower."
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,470.25,488.632,"Your Honor, we think that the Court of Appeals decision suggests that we can, one, either deny rate relief or deny a certificate because of what might be our independent views of what should be their employment practices."
1975.74-1608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,488.632,492.525,"But, yes, but only because of its impact on cost."
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,492.525,503.923,Cost impact and service impact but the way the equal employment opportunity laws are structured and the way the regulatory laws are structured.
1975.74-1608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,513.429,516.145,I understand that but let me get your position clear.
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,550.584,556.203,If the legality question had been determined in the forum --
1975.74-1608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.203,557.079,I am not asking you that.
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,560.136,562.593,I believe not in the first instance.
1975.74-1608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.122,588.023,What if somebody comes in to one of your rate proceedings and one of the customers of the utility and complains that the utility – that some of the cost claimed by the utility are forbidden by law?
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,588.023,590.212,If they are forbidden by law there is—
1975.74-1608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.212,591.539,Would you inquire into that?
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,591.539,599.655,"Yes, sir, but we think your Honor that is not what this case is about and in historical context --"
1975.74-1608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,599.655,606.052,"But only because there is another mechanism for determining, whether there are legal costs?"
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,606.052,618.102,We think that that is the orderly way to relate the equal employment opportunity control machinery versus the economic regulatory machinery.
1975.74-1608,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,618.102,630.544,"Pursuing my Brother White’s inquiry a little bit, let us say a costumer comes in and says some of this cause are forbidden by law because they were bribes, they were bribes of municipal officials."
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,640.735,660.014,I am saying your Honor that for cost purposes Account 426.5 would disallow that for FPC rate purposes upon a showing of substantial evidence and relating it to the questions of rate making under the Power and the Gas Acts.
1975.74-1608,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,701.267,713.636,"What if a customer comes in a rate proceeding Mr. Journey and says the utility defended a lawsuit and then paid $350,000.00 in lawyer’s fee and we do not think it should have defended that lawsuit."
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,721.715,738.142,"Yes sir, there has been a litigation on that question on legal fees and we have determined that the commission makes a determination on a cost basis supplying the just and reasonable standards whether it should be allowed for rate purposes or disallowed."
1975.74-1608,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,749.646,758.46,But supposing the utility shows that it followed the advice of a lawyer in deciding to defend the action and there is no question about the size of the fee.
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,770.048,779.912,We have had that question Your Honor and we have disallowed some of the costs and that has gone up through the Fourth Circuit.
1975.74-1608,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,781.572,783.501,What standard do you apply in disallowing those -- .
1975.74-1608,0,21045,drexel_d_journey,,783.501,787.754,That just and reasonable standard and the prudency test.
1975.74-1608,1,27137,howard_a_glickstein,,1777.547,1781.382,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.74-1608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1825.31,1842.182,(Inaudible) in your view should prevail in the Federal Power Commission undertakes these evaluations and the EEOC and the complaining parties all disagree with it.
1975.74-1608,1,27137,howard_a_glickstein,,1856.53,1868.11,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, if the Federal Power Commission refused to disallow a specific cost and against the utility in a ratemaking proceeding for example—"
1975.74-1608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1868.11,1876.852,"Now what you want them pass on, namely to get in the substantive of aspect forbidden employment?"
1975.74-1608,1,27137,howard_a_glickstein,,1876.852,1881.126,We concede Mr. Chief Justice that there are remedies before the equal employment commission.
1975.74-1608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1896.365,1901.779,"Let me make my question clear, they do just what you ask them to do."
1975.74-1608,1,27137,howard_a_glickstein,,1929.803,1939.627,"If the Court were to hold that, the FPC had jurisdiction in this area and a particular rate was challenged as including cost that related to employment discrimination."
1975.74-1608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1957.277,1961.709,"Just as you would in any other – in a rate case or any other issue, is that it?"
1975.74-1608,1,27137,howard_a_glickstein,,1961.709,1962.366,That is right.
1975.74-1608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1962.366,1978.566,"But I do not think you have answered at least what I understood that Chief Justice question to be and that is, if the Federal Power Commission does what you asked it to investigate discrimination and employment on the practice of the utility and concludes there was no discriminatory practice here."
1975.74-1608,1,27137,howard_a_glickstein,,1988.106,1990.94,"Yes, they may, they certainly may."
1975.74-1608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.464,2011.633,(Inaudible) that the FPC would have the power to enjoin certain employment practice or order reinstatement or back pay or things like that?
1975.74-1608,1,27137,howard_a_glickstein,,2011.633,2026.487,"I think they would have the power to disallow cost related to the fact, -- in addition to that Mr. Justice White, it is not merely in the ratemaking proceeding where the Court of Appeals said that the Federal Power Commission has jurisdiction to consider this question."
1975.74-1608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.035,2051.362,"Well, you are not -- do you think that you are barred from raising those issues in licensing proceedings now?"
1975.74-1608,1,27137,howard_a_glickstein,,2051.362,2057.559,"Well, we are barred your Honor because the FPC has prohibited the raising of such an issue in the licensing proceeding."
1975.74-1608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.934,2062.232,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1608,1,27137,howard_a_glickstein,,2062.232,2069.091,In both the Federal Power Commission has barred the raising of such issues.
1975.74-1608,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2069.091,2077.032,"Would the same argument apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is it not?"
1975.74-1608,1,27137,howard_a_glickstein,,2077.032,2105.029,"Well, I think the factors that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would be considering in granting a license for a nuclear regulatory plant would be somewhat different than the factors of the Federal Power Commission considers when it grants licenses of set rates, to the extent that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has the authority to consider whether or not consumers are being exploited, whether or not unjust and unreasonable costs are being passed on then I suspect it would apply."
1975.74-1608,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2105.029,2111.978,(Inaudible) or have you raised it with the ICC for example in the Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity.
1975.74-1608,1,27137,howard_a_glickstein,,2111.978,2119.835,"Mr. Chief Justice, the ICC has published a notice of rulemaking and we have the same problem."
1975.74-1608,2,21045,drexel_d_journey,,3448.284,3460.663,"I would just say Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court that the commissions’ briefs, I believe have covered the constitution points."
1975.74-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3513.537,3535.167,"I take it that Judge McGowan (ph) writing for the Court of Appeals indicated that your task and I am reading, in protecting the consumer against exploitation can be alternatively described as a task of saying that no necessary or illegitimate cost are passed along with the consumer, to the costumer, that is the way he described your job."
1975.74-1608,2,21045,drexel_d_journey,,3535.167,3536.056,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3536.056,3546.942,And then he went and said without attempting the exhaustive enumeration we identified at least the following as indicative of those arguably within the commissions’ range of concern.
1975.74-1608,2,21045,drexel_d_journey,,3564.81,3574.615,I spoke about that question earlier and said that for whatever reason if back pay and duplicate labor was involved the auditors would pick that up.
1975.74-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3574.615,3578.247,"So this issue – this is just not an issue, do you not think—?"
1975.74-1608,2,21045,drexel_d_journey,,3578.247,3582.255,Not for ratemaking purposes in terms of cost that is lost.
1975.74-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3582.255,3588.367,Even though it is back pay with respect to this – a discriminatory practice that has been adjudicated by somebody else.
1975.74-1608,2,21045,drexel_d_journey,,3588.367,3594.857,"It has been resolved, just as Mr. Chief Justice said somebody’s relative on the payroll."
1975.74-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3594.857,3600.472,"All right, how about the – three, the cost of legal proceedings in either of these two categories?"
1975.74-1608,2,21045,drexel_d_journey,,3600.472,3604.9,The cost of legal proceedings has been the subject of litigation and the—
1975.74-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3604.9,3609.324,"But you do not contend, you do not – you would not have jurisdiction or that you should not consider those."
1975.74-1608,2,21045,drexel_d_journey,,3609.324,3610.879,"We do not for cost purposes, no."
1975.74-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3610.879,3619.23,"It seems to me that several of these things he enlists, there is no real question about either your power or your order desirability of considering them."
1975.74-1608,2,21045,drexel_d_journey,,3619.23,3631.589,If you are looking at the rate regulatory process is the mechanism by which you adjust the economic relation between the producer of gas and energy and the consumer.
1975.74-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3659.152,3669.4,But the Court of Appeals said that it was way beyond your power or authority to adjudicate individual instances of discrimination that is what the Court said.
1975.74-1608,2,21045,drexel_d_journey,,3669.4,3670.075,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1608,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3670.075,3671.151,But it has been suggested.
1975.74-1608,2,21045,drexel_d_journey,,3697.248,3697.875,That is what I am—
1975.74-1608,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3697.875,3698.502,And that is what you object to.
1975.74-1608,2,21045,drexel_d_journey,,3698.502,3701.078,That is what I understood to be the argument.
1975.74-1608,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3702.526,3703.309,Thank you gentlemen.
