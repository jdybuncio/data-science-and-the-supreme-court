2012.12-96,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.237,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-96, Shelby County v. Holder."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,7.237,15.276,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,60.139,61.539,May I ask you a question?
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,73.212,74.564,"Well, I--"
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,74.564,85.856,"In -- in the period we're talking about, it has many more discriminating -- 240 discriminatory voting laws that were blocked by Section 5 objections."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,95.562,100.449,"--Well, this is an on-face challenge, and might I say, Justice Sotomayor--"
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,100.449,101.666,But that's the standard.
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,112.689,123.895,"--Well, I don't agree with your premises, but let me just say, number one, when I said the South has changed, that is the statement that is made by the eight Justices in the Northwest Austin case."
2012.12-96,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,124.697,126.614,"And Congress -- Congress said that, too."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,171.878,183.702,"--Justice Ginsburg, Judge Williams said that, as he assessed various measures in the record, he thought those States might be distinguished."
2012.12-96,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,194.491,202.764,"But think about this State that you're representing, it's about a quarter black, but Alabama has no black statewide elected officials."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,237.42,244.941,"--Well, if -- if I might respond, because I think Justice Sotomayor had a similar question, and that is why should this be approached on face."
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,277.062,280.616,But facial challenges are generally disfavored in our law.
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,301.863,303.43,--There -- there are two separate questions.
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,330.616,339.805,"Interestingly enough, in Katzenbach the Court didn't do what you're asking us to do, which is to look at the record of all the other States or all of the other counties."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,351.362,352.045,I don't think that--
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,352.045,358.116,"You're asking us to do something, which is to ignore your record and look at everybody else's."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,358.116,360.551,--I don't think that's a fair reading of Katzenbach.
2012.12-96,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,443.472,457.732,"I suppose the thrust of the questions so far has been if you would be covered under any formula that most likely would be drawn, why are you injured under this one?"
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,457.732,461.934,"Well, we don't agree that we would be covered under any formula."
2012.12-96,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,461.934,464.136,But that's -- that's the hypothesis.
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,474.341,512.283,"Well, I think that if -- if Congress has the power to look at jurisdictions like Shelby County individually and without regard to how they stand against other States -- other counties, other States, in other words, what is the discrimination here among the jurisdictions, and after thoroughly considering each and every one comes up with a list and says this list greatly troubles us, that might present a vehicle for saying this is a way to sort out the covered jurisdictions--"
2012.12-96,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,512.283,523.072,"Suppose Congress passed a law that said, everyone whose last name begins with A shall pay a special tax of $1,000 a year."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,542.569,551.591,"--No, because that would just invent another statute, and this is all a debate as to whether somebody might invent a statute which has a formula that is rational."
2012.12-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.591,553.324,I was about to ask a similar question.
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,568.87,570.57,"No, I agree with you."
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,570.57,586.165,"The problem with those hypotheticals is obvious that it starts from a predicate that the application has no basis in any record, but there's no question that Alabama was rightly included in the original Voting Rights Act."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,598.639,600.489,"Well, I mean--"
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,600.489,610.797,"It's not like there's some made-up reason for why the $1,000 is being applied to you or why a different crime is going to be charged against you."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,616.101,631.044,"--Justice Sotomayor, with all respect, the question whether Alabama was properly placed under the act in 1964 was -- it was answered in Katzenbach, because it came under a formula then deemed to be rational in theory and in practice."
2012.12-96,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,644.884,652.624,"Now, the reason for the formula -- of course, part of the formula looks back to what happened in 1965."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,664.03,664.948,--That's correct.
2012.12-96,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,665.465,673.804,"So when Congress in fact reenacted this in 2005, it knew what it was doing was picking out Alabama."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,750.804,751.538,Thank you.
2012.12-96,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,772.317,775.019,"But this is then the question, does it justify?"
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,783.459,784.292,Justice Breyer--
2012.12-96,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,784.292,793.065,"And if you have a statute that sunsets, you might say: I don't want it to sunset if it's worked, as long as the problem is still there to some degree."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,795.967,798.652,--If you base it on the findings of 1965.
2012.12-96,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,824.269,825.186,You keep -- you keep--
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,825.186,827.554,--to which if you apply those metrics -- excuse me.
2012.12-96,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,827.554,834.325,"--Mr. Rein, you keep emphasizing over and over again in your brief registration and you said it a couple of times this morning."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,858.94,863.911,"Let me speak to that, because I think that that highlights one of the weaknesses here."
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,880.621,895.38,"Counsel, the reason Section 5 was created was because States were moving faster than litigation permitted to catch the new forms of discriminatory practices that were being developed."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,943.277,944.863,--Justice Sotomayor--
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,944.863,953.652,"I mean, I don't know what the difference is except that this Court or some may think that secondary is not important."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,958.723,966.477,"--When Congress is addressing a new evil, it needs then -- and assuming it can find this evil to a level justifying--"
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,966.477,967.912,But that's not--
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,967.912,969.029,--the extraordinary remedy--
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,969.029,970.012,--what it did with Section 5.
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,973.215,975.365,--I think we're dealing with two different questions.
2012.12-96,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1000.216,1026.267,"And in 1986 -- or excuse me, 2006 -- Congress went back to the problem, developed a very substantial record, a 15,000-page legislative record, talked about what problems had been solved, talked about what problems had yet to be solved, and decided that, although the problem had changed, the problem was still evident enough that the act should continue."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1034.021,1036.889,"--Well, I'm not questioning whether Congress did its best."
2012.12-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1041.793,1062.373,"Indeed, Congress must have found that the situation was even clearer and the violations even more evident than originally, because originally, the vote in the Senate, for example, was something like 79 to 18, and in the 2006 extension, it was 98 to nothing."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1071.879,1073.096,No.
2012.12-96,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1074.848,1077.2,"Well, that sounds like a good argument to me, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1087.156,1095.927,"Or decided that perhaps they'd better not vote against it, that there's nothing, that there's no -- none of their interests in voting against it."
2012.12-96,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1095.927,1109.337,"I don't know what they're thinking exactly, but it seems to me one might reasonably think this: It's an old disease, it's gotten a lot better, a lot better, but it's still there."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1117.441,1118.11,--Well--
2012.12-96,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1118.11,1128.066,"Or would you not at least say that a person who wants to keep that remedy, which has worked for that old disease which is not yet dead, let's keep it going."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1130.435,1139.79,"--That is a hypothetical that doesn't address what happened, because what happened is the old disease, limiting people's right to register and vote, to have--"
2012.12-96,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1139.79,1140.19,"No, I'm sorry."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1149.162,1158.435,"--But the focus of the Congress in 1965 and in Katzenbach in 1964 and in Katzenbach was on registration and voting, precluding--"
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1158.435,1159.954,It was on voter dilution as well.
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1164.089,1172.944,"--I beg your pardon, but I think, Justice Sotomayor, that this Court has never decided that the Fifteenth Amendment governs vote dilution."
2012.12-96,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1177.148,1180.017,"Well, the Fifteenth Amendment says “ denial or abridgement ”."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1182.567,1194.527,"Well, “ abridgement ” might mean, for example, I let you vote in one election but not in another; for example, separate primary rules from election rules."
2012.12-96,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1213.088,1213.671,"Well, some of--"
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1213.671,1214.955,But I think that's not what happened.
2012.12-96,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1214.955,1222.96,"--Some of the questions asked to this point I think mirror what the Government says toward the end of its brief, page 48 and page 49."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1244.458,1246.41,"No, I think it is not."
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1325.095,1326.778,"Counsel, are you--"
2012.12-96,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1326.778,1333.615,"Suppose -- suppose there were and suppose that's the rationale, because that's what I got from the Government's brief and what I'm getting -- getting from some of the questions from the bench."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1335.382,1357.913,"If -- if there was a record sufficient for each of those States to sacrifice their -- their inherent core power to preclearance, to prior restraint, I think that you certainly could argue that, well, how Congress described them, as long as it's rational, might work."
2012.12-96,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1360.782,1364.067,"Well, and -- and I don't know why -- why you even go that far."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1375.292,1376.325,"--Well, I think that--"
2012.12-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1376.325,1379.41,I thought -- I thought the same thing.
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1393.52,1394.672,"--Justice Scalia, I agree with that."
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1396.572,1396.955,--Why?
2012.12-96,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1399.824,1401.759,I would like to hear the answer to the question.
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1401.759,1402.209,--Okay.
2012.12-96,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1424.857,1425.774,"Well, the formula that has--"
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1425.774,1426.724,So we accept Katzenbach.
2012.12-96,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1434.563,1450.507,"--Well, Mr. Rein, the formula that -- that is applied right now, under that formula covered jurisdictions, which have less than 25 percent of the nation's total population, they account for 56 percent of all successful published Section 2 lawsuits."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1477.426,1482.294,"There are -- there are two fallacies, Justice Kagan, in -- in that statement."
2012.12-96,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1494.619,1498.24,"Well, all formulas are underinclusive and all formulas are overinclusive."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1513.765,1519.753,"Well, if -- if you look at the analysis State by State done by Judge Williams, that isn't true."
2012.12-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1554.326,1557.111,And it happens not to be the method that Congress selected.
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1557.111,1557.728,Correct.
2012.12-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1557.728,1561.33,"If they selected that, you could say they used a rationale that works."
2012.12-96,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1569.936,1572.038,Your time is--
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1572.038,1572.988,Thank you.
2012.12-96,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1572.988,1576.09,--about ready to expire for the rebuttal period.
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1596.836,1597.269,Well--
2012.12-96,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1597.269,1600.721,Is this an effective remedy?
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1600.721,1603.673,"--It is -- number one, it is effective."
2012.12-96,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1689.446,1700.671,"Mr. Rein, I just remind, because it's something we said about equal footing, in Katzenbach the Court said:"
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1728.323,1732.475,I think that that referred in Katzenbach -- I'm familiar with that statement.
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1757.607,1779.023,"I'm going to have a hard time with that because you can't be suggesting that the Government sees a problem in one or more States and decides it's going to do something for them and not for others, like emergency relief, and that that somehow violates the equal footing doctrine."
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1787.861,1795.632,"Well, I think when Congress uses the powers delegated under Article I, Section 8, it has substantial latitude in how it exercises the power."
2012.12-96,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1809.408,1816.129,Would you tell me what you think is left of the rational means test in Katzenbach and City of Rome?
2012.12-96,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1826.753,1844.381,"--Justice Sotomayor, I think that the two tests have a lot in common because in City of Boerne, the Katzenbach decision was pointed out as a model of asking the questions that Congress in proportionality asked us to address."
2012.12-96,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1910.938,1912.356,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1919.929,1922.312,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1992.641,1994.841,Can I ask you just a little bit about that record.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2000.828,2003.347,"--I don't know the precise number, but many thousands."
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2004.28,2006.149,3700.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2008.834,2009.884,There was one in that year.
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2009.884,2011.969,"One, so one out of 3700."
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2011.969,2028.231,"But I think -- but, Mr. Chief Justice, that is why I made the point a minute ago that the key way in which Section 5 -- it has to be the case, everyone agrees, that the significant progress that we've made is principally because of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act."
2012.12-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.466,2037.086,That will always be true forever into the future.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2057.415,2058.034,No.
2012.12-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.034,2058.984,Is that the argument you are making?
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2058.984,2059.8,That is not the argument.
2012.12-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.619,2062.052,I thought that was the argument you were just making.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2062.052,2062.702,--It is not.
2012.12-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.843,2073.826,That's a different argument.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2073.826,2074.96,--But they are related.
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2076.145,2084.317,Just to get the -- do you know which State has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to African American voter turnout?
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2084.317,2085.134,I do not.

2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2094.79,2095.959,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."

2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2111.485,2112.652,--I do not know that.
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2112.652,2113.235,Massachusetts.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2120.407,2127.761,"But when Congress -- the choice Congress faced when it -- Congress wasn't writing on a blank slate in 2006, Mr. Chief Justice."

2012.12-96,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2161.984,2162.551,--There's no question--
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2162.551,2163.434,Justice Alito.
2012.12-96,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2163.434,2167.988,--There is no question that the Voting Rights Act has done enormous good.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2221.473,2226.594,"No, but what Congress did in 2006 was different than what Congress did in 1965."
2012.12-96,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2278.892,2292.052,"This reverse engineering that you seem so proud of, it seems to me that that obscures the -- the real purpose of -- of the statute."
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2305.127,2313.733,I think the -- the formula was -- was rational and effective in 1965.
2012.12-96,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2316.952,2322.155,"Well, the Marshall Plan was very good, too, the Morale Act, the Northwest Ordinance, but times change."
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2322.155,2335.148,And -- but the question is whether times had changed enough and whether the differential between the covered jurisdictions and the rest of the country had changed enough that Congress could confidently make the judgment that this was no longer needed.
2012.12-96,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2335.148,2335.948,General Verrilli--
2012.12-96,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2335.948,2336.548,What the question--
2012.12-96,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2336.548,2346.537,"--General Verrilli, could you respond to the question that Justice Kennedy asked earlier, which was for why isn't Section 2 enough now?"
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2361.046,2361.546,Yes.
2012.12-96,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2413.515,2425.473,"Well, I -- I do think the evidence is very clear that Section -- that individual suits under Section 2 type litigation were just insufficient and that Section 5 was utterly necessary in 1965."
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2426.306,2427.241,And I think it remains--
2012.12-96,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2427.241,2452.123,"But with -- with a modern understanding of -- of the dangers of polling place changes, with prospective injunctions, with preliminary injunctions, it's not clear -- and -- and with the fact that the Government itself can commence these suits, it's not clear to me that there's that much difference in a Section 2 suit now and preclearance."
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2455.308,2458.294,--I -- I don't -- I don't really think that that conclusion follows.
2012.12-96,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2542.116,2549.37,Can you tell us how many attorneys and how many staff in the Justice Department are involved in the preclearance process?
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2550.989,2552.806,--It's a -- it's a very substantial number and--
2012.12-96,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2552.806,2554.341,"Well, what does that mean?"
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2554.341,2559.512,"--It means I don't know the exact number, Justice Kennedy."
2012.12-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2559.512,2559.961,Hundreds?
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2561.078,2561.995,I think it's dozens.
2012.12-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.485,2571.902,Right.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2571.902,2585.979,"But that doesn't answer the mail, I submit, because it's still -- you're never going to get at all these thousands of under-the-radar changes and you're still going to be in the position where the question will be whether preliminary injunctions are available to do the job."
2012.12-96,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2604.206,2606.473,Then why shouldn't it apply everywhere in the country?
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2606.473,2619.8,"Well, because I think Congress made a reasonable judgment that the problem -- that in 2006, that its prior judgments, that there -- that there was more of a risk in the covered jurisdictions continued to be validated by the Section 2 evidence."
2012.12-96,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2619.8,2628.322,"Well, you do really think there was -- that the record in 2006 supports the proposition that -- let's just take the question of changing the location of polling places."
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2636.928,2669.665,"I think the combination of the history, which I concede is not dispositive, but is relevant, because it suggests caution is in order and that's a reasonable judgment on the part of Congress, the combination of that history and the fact that there is a very significant disproportion in successful Section 2 results in the covered jurisdictions as compared to the rest of the country, that Congress was justified in concluding that there -- that it -- there was reason to think that there continued to be a serious enough differential problem to justify--"
2012.12-96,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2669.665,2686.791,"Well, the statistics that I have before me show that in, let's say the 5 years prior to reauthorization, the gap between success in Section 2 suits in the covered and the non-covered jurisdiction narrowed and eventually was eliminated."
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2687.61,2695.297,"--Well, I think the -- the -- you have to look at it, and Congress appropriately looked at it through a broader -- in a -- in a broader timeframe, and it made judgments."
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2720.848,2726.235,"General, is it -- is it the government's submission that the citizens in the South are more racist than citizens in the North?"
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2726.235,2731.053,"--It is not, and I do not know the answer to that, Your Honor, but I do think it was reasonable for Congress--"
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2731.053,2733.339,"Well, once you said it is not, and you don't know the answer to it."
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2733.339,2735.691,--I -- it's not our submission.
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2760.573,2760.992,A need to do what?
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2760.992,2768.595,"To maintain the deterrent and constraining effect of the Section 5 preclearance process in the covered jurisdictions, and that--"
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2768.595,2770.947,And not -- and not impose it on everyone else?
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2770.947,2774.999,"--And -- that's right, given the differential in Section 2 litigation, there was a basis for Congress to do that."
2012.12-96,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2774.999,2775.668,--So what's the answer?
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2890.024,2893.209,"Let me give two responses, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2937.488,2942.891,I don't -- I don't understand the distinction between facial and as-applied when you are talking about a formula.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2962.47,2970.909,--Congress's decision in 2006 to reenact the geographic coverage was congruent and proportional because Congress had evidence--
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2970.909,2975.879,To -- to the problem or -- or was the formula congruent and proportional to the remedy?
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2975.879,2978.581,--The Court has upheld the formula in four different applications.
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2989.789,2990.839,Well -- I'm sorry.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2990.839,3000.595,"--were true even back in City of Rome, because of course the tests and devices were eliminated by the statute, so no -- no jurisdiction could have tests and devices."
2012.12-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3030.781,3032.966,"Well, maybe it was making that judgment, Mr. Verrilli."
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3194.922,3198.291,You have an extra 5 minutes.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3198.291,3198.724,Thank you.
2012.12-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3280.178,3281.511,We looked behind it in Boerne.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3286.999,3296.638,"--And -- but -- but I do think that the deference that Congress is owed, as City of Boerne said, “ much deference ” -- Katzenbach said “ much deference ”."
2012.12-96,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3342.585,3346.889,Do you think the preclearance device could be enacted for the entire United States.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3346.889,3350.007,I don't think there is a record that would substantiate that.
2012.12-96,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3351.557,3364.684,And that is because that there is a federalism interest in each State being responsible to ensure that it has a political system that acts in a democratic and a civil and a decent and a proper and a constitutional way.
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3364.684,3369.586,"--And we agree with that, we respect that, we acknowledge that Northwest Austin requires an inquiry into that."
2012.12-96,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3369.586,3387.047,"But if -- if Alabama wants to have monuments to the heros of the Civil Rights Movement, if it wants to acknowledge the wrongs of its past, is it better off doing that if it's an own independent sovereign or if it's under the trusteeship of the United States Government?"
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3387.047,3390.316,Of course it would be better in the former situation.
2012.12-96,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3444.317,3452.323,"Before your time expires, I would like to make sure I understand your position on this as-applied versus facial issue."
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3463.461,3464.047,No.
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3499.169,3500.571,"Thank you, General."
2012.12-96,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3500.571,3501.454,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-96,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3501.454,3508.576,Mr. Adegbile.
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3508.576,3511.361,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-96,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3550.169,3551.786,"But that's true in every State, isn't it?"
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3551.786,3554.471,Justice Scalia--
2012.12-96,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3554.471,3560.109,"I mean, you know, I don't think anybody is contesting that it's more effective if you use Section 5."
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3563.411,3564.746,--Fair enough.
2012.12-96,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3602.469,3613.344,"But a Section 2 case can, in effect, have an order for bail-in, correct me if I'm wrong, under Section 3 and then you basically have a mini -- something that replicates Section 5."
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3613.344,3619.164,The bail-in is available -- bail-in is available if there's an actual finding of a constitutional violation.
2012.12-96,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3702.818,3708.388,Do you agree with the reverse engineering argument that the United States has made today?
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3708.388,3710.24,"I would frame it slightly differently, Chief Justice Roberts."
2012.12-96,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3738.441,3746.513,I guess -- I guess the question is whether or not that disparity is sufficient to justify the differential treatment under Section 5.
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3760.94,3767.427,"--This Court in Northwest Austin said that it needs to be sufficiently related, and I think there are two principal sources of evidence."
2012.12-96,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3767.427,3772.381,"Well, we also said congruent and proportional."
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3772.381,3772.898,Indeed.
2012.12-96,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3801.083,3810.189,"Well, the Fifteenth Amendment is limited to intentional discrimination, and, of course, the preclearance requirement is not so limited, right?"
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3810.189,3810.689,--That's correct.
2012.12-96,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3845.962,3859.789,"Well, Section 5 -- the Section 5 activity may show that there's a problem in the jurisdictions covered by Section 5, but it says nothing about the presence or absence of similar problems in noncovered jurisdictions, isn't that right?"
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3859.789,3860.956,"--Absolutely, Justice Alito."
2012.12-96,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3860.956,3861.172,All right.
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3861.172,3862.724,And so I come to my second category.
2012.12-96,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3898.231,3904.468,All of the noncovered states are worse in that regard than the nine covered states; is that correct?
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3904.468,3905.251,--Justice Scalia--
2012.12-96,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3905.251,3906.92,Every -- every one of them is worse.
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3906.92,3910.638,"--Justice Scalia, it's -- it's a fair question, and -- and I was speaking to the aggregate--"
2012.12-96,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3910.638,3913.406,"It's not just a fair one, it's the crucial question."
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,3920.077,3929.283,"--What we see in the evidence is that of the top eight States with section -- favorable Section 2 outcomes, seven of them, seven of them are the covered jurisdictions."
2012.12-96,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3942.191,3954.067,"Yeah, but his point, I think the point is this: If you draw a red line around the States that are in, at least some of those States have a better record than some of the States that are out."
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,4044.408,4046.593,"--Fair enough, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-96,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4117.689,4123.343,"Have there been episodes, egregious episodes of the kind you are talking about in States that are not covered?"
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,4123.343,4125.362,"Absolutely, Chief Justice Roberts."
2012.12-96,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4125.362,4132.699,"Well, then it doesn't seem to help you make the point that the differential between covered and noncovered continues to be justified."
2012.12-96,2,20489,debo_p_adegbile,,4132.699,4139.12,"But the great weight of evidence -- I think that it's fair to look at -- on some level you have to look piece by piece, State by State."
2012.12-96,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4188.368,4189.22,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-96,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,4191.07,4197.324,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-96,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4197.324,4203.294,Do you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement in Section 5?
2012.12-96,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,4203.294,4204.38,No.
2012.12-96,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4207.598,4209.048,I asked a different question.
2012.12-96,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,4213.585,4214.785,"--Well, Congress--"
2012.12-96,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4214.785,4217.22,Do you think there was no basis to find that--
2012.12-96,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,4217.22,4225.226,--was reacting -- may I say Congress was reacting in 1964 to a problem of race discrimination which it thought was prevalent in certain jurisdictions.
2012.12-96,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4238.301,4244.288,"--Do you think that racial discrimination in voting has ended, that there is none anywhere?"
2012.12-96,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,4244.288,4247.157,--I think that the world is not perfect.
2012.12-96,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4257.264,4257.864,But shouldn't--
2012.12-96,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,4257.864,4258.93,--We are not trying--
2012.12-96,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4258.93,4264.118,"--You've given me some statistics that Alabama hasn't, but there are others that are very compelling that it has."

2012.12-96,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4298.774,4303.845,How many other States have 240 successful Section 2 and Section 5--
2012.12-96,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,4303.845,4312.349,"--Justice Sotomayor, I could parse statistics, but we are not here to try Alabama or Massachusetts or any other State."
2012.12-96,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4343.136,4346.088,Don't change horses.
2012.12-96,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,4348.707,4349.107,Right.
2012.12-96,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4349.107,4352.576,"--where it works, as long as the problem isn't solved."
2012.12-96,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,4353.309,4358.83,"Well, and I think the problem to which the Voting Rights Act was addressed is solved."
2012.12-96,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4381.609,4382.445,"Well, Mr. Rein--"
2012.12-96,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,4382.445,4382.795,I wouldn't--
2012.12-96,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4382.795,4383.945,"--that is the question, isn't it?"
2012.12-96,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,4392.567,4393.834,"--Well, it is certainly not me."
2012.12-96,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4395.019,4396.969,That's a good answer.
2012.12-96,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,4398.138,4410.461,"But I think the question is Congress can examine it, Congress makes a record; it is up to the Court to determine whether the problem indeed has been solved and whether the new problem, if there is one--"
2012.12-96,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4410.461,4418.715,"Well, that's a big, new power that you are giving us, that we have the power now to decide whether racial discrimination has been solved?"
2012.12-96,3,17998,bert_w_rein,,4421.317,4422.769,"--I did not claim that power, Justice Kagan."
2012.12-96,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4433.492,4436.427,"But there is this difference, which I think is a key difference."
