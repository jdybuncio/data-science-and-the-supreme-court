1993.93-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.297,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-518, Florence Dolan v. the City of Tigard."
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,10.458,13.04,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,54.747,62.791,"Mr. Smith, are you going to comment on the question of whether the City would have been within its rights to deny the building permit entirely?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,62.791,64.242,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,84.607,87.138,We... we take the case on the assumption that the City could have denied it?
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,87.138,89.291,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1993.93-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,154.273,169.594,"Well, so far as the finding about the flood plain is concerned, there was a finding that if you pave over with asphalt things that have been previously green or growing in some way, you're going to have a more rapid runoff."
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,173.096,185.195,"--Mr. Chief Justice, there is indeed common sense to tell us that if one increases the amount of a per... impervious surface on a piece of property, that there will indeed be more runoff."
1993.93-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,224.402,236.8,"So, you say the City has to... has to quantify something like that, do some sort of empirical studies that would show the portion for which this increase in her usage... or her increased pavement is responsible?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,236.8,238.132,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,277.646,290.846,Is there any reason to believe that creating impervious surface closer to the flood plain causes more of a problem than creating impervious surface further away from the flood plain?
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,290.846,293.498,"No, Justice Scalia, there is not."
1993.93-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.498,298.242,"And yet, people who did that further away would not have to dedicate any of their land to the public use?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,298.242,300.023,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,314.444,316.284,But isn't there... excuse me... isn't there some sort of attenuation?
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,328.863,330.774,"--Yes, Your Honor, we would agree with that."
1993.93-518,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,330.774,339.6,Assume that the additional runoff would require that some vegetation remain alongside of the creek.
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,342.592,345.604,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1993.93-518,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,375.304,381.428,"When we hear about the greenway, is that simply part of the bike path, of is that also part of the flood plain?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,381.428,384.961,"Your Honor, that is part of the... the flood plain."
1993.93-518,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,419.184,430.632,"Well, would it be your position that if vegetation must be there, assuming there is some additional runoff and there is a relation between that, that you're entitled to keep vegetation that's other than what would be in the greenway?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,434.125,435.945,Your Honor--
1993.93-518,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,435.945,436.636,If all they ask is grass.
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,436.636,447.353,--I don't believe that the regulatory impositions that were imposed on Mrs. Dolan for maintaining open space and vegetated area on her property were unreasonable.
1993.93-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,451.605,455.508,"Well, what... what... what could she do then that she cannot do now?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,455.508,466.366,"Your Honor, what has occurred now is that she may not construct her larger store and demolish her old store until such--"
1993.93-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,466.366,466.866,"No, no."
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,477.534,487.971,"--Your Honor, there are a number of non-developmental uses to which she could have put the land in the greenway, which might have added value and amenity to... to her larger store."
1993.93-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.528,503.042,Doesn't the... fill me in... doesn't the public have access to the greenway?
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,506.264,516.45,"Your Honor, the public does not have access to the lan... to Mrs. Dolan's land at this time, with the exception of the access for her business."
1993.93-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.45,524.955,"No, I mean after... after she complied with the condition for the... for the permit, would the public have had access to the greenway?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,524.955,525.796,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,525.796,532.42,"Well, that's... that's one thing she couldn't... she could do now and couldn't do afterwards, which is keep other people out."
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,532.42,534.271,That is absolutely correct.
1993.93-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.271,535.522,Which is pretty important.
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,535.522,536.632,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1993.93-518,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,536.632,546.51,Did the City require an easement or the fee to this area?
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,546.51,552.674,"Your Honor, the... the City in its actual findings required the dedication of a fee."
1993.93-518,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,577.881,578.232,Right.
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,585.298,586.256,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1993.93-518,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,588.367,588.718,All right.
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,594.371,609.21,"Your Honor, the City's findings at the petition for cert at appendix G... at page G-28, specifically require the construction."
1993.93-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.051,651.449,"Well, do you rest your case on the difference between whether an easement had been given or whether she had to convey the... didn't... Nollan involved an easement, as I recall, rather than an outright conveyance, didn't it?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,651.449,653.081,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,660.375,662.856,"And an easement is... is a right in property, isn't it?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,664.589,666.219,"Yes, Your Honor, it is, well recognized in law."
1993.93-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.219,668.851,Would the case be the same if it had been a license rather than an easement?
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,668.851,689.173,"Your Honor, I believe that if the... the requirement had been that that license mandated the continuous passage of the public, it would have been just as burdensome an imposition upon Mrs. Dolan as was the beach easement was on Mr. and Mrs.--"
1993.93-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,689.173,690.044,"In other words, your answer is yes?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,690.044,690.665,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.265,696.77,I in fact thought that a license to... to use land is the definition of an easement.
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,703.373,707.346,"I believe that Justice Stevens says the answer to that question is yes, and I would defer to his judgment."
1993.93-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,709.897,712.509,"At least it was in my first year property course, which was some years ago."
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,713.611,742.008,"If I could turn again... once again to the issue of proportionality, I think that one of the important points to be noted in this case is that if there had been a... a clear understanding on the part of the... of the Oregon Supreme Court and the City of Tigard that there was a requirement for proportionality embedded within this Court's 1987 decision in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, that the outcome of the case might have been significantly different."
1993.93-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.786,806.974,"Assuming that there is some degree of proportionality, do you insist on, you know, actual empirical demonstration of adverse effects?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,806.974,810.195,"No, Your Honor, we do not."
1993.93-518,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,856.424,861.246,How would you articulate such a test in... in simple terms?
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,867.251,878.54,"--Justice O'Connor, it's difficult to articulate the test in simple terms, mostly because the... the courts across the country... the State courts... have not chosen to use simple terms."
1993.93-518,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,878.54,880.111,"But if you can't do it, how do you expect us to?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,881.533,888.676,"I would submit that to find proportionality, that there are about three things that need to be done."
1993.93-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,922.038,931.724,"Well, specifically in this case, what should the City of Tigard have done that it didn't do in order to justify the demands it made on your client for her property?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,931.724,945.123,"Mr. Chief Justice, in the... the first instance, what the City should have done is they should have quantified the actual storm water runoffs that had... were going to occur from the 17,600-square-foot building."
1993.93-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,957.972,961.064,May I... may I raise the question that troubles me about just really the whole case.
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,985.748,1002.17,"Justice Stevens, in that instance, I believe that what would occur would not be a dedication of real property as some sort of permit condition, but in fact would be a regulatory restriction upon development as regularly happens within 100-year flood plains, geologic hazard areas."
1993.93-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1004.522,1011.777,"Well, but you've acknowledged they could deny the permit outright if they were concerned in sort of... they just think there's a danger there, but they're not sure they're able to quantify it."
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1014.318,1015.219,"--Yes, Your Honor, we have."
1993.93-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1015.219,1024.153,"But you say they can't say, well, if you want to go ahead and build, because we're unsure about what's happened, we're going to insist that you make these perhaps exaggerated precautions?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1025.484,1044.309,"Your Honor, if the exaggerated precautions involve the dedication of an interest in real property, I believe that it is incumbent on the Government, in order to fulfill this Court's requirements laid down in 1960 in Armstrong, that it do more than merely speculate or hypothesize."
1993.93-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1058.677,1070.935,"Mr. Smith, I... I assume you don't concede that a proportionality requirement is necessarily in addition to a rational basis requirement?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1081.392,1097.653,"Your Honor, we would... we believe that... that the rational basis... or rational relationship test, if we should call it that, as it was applied by the Oregon Supreme Court and was applied by the City of Tigard, is in fact no test at all."
1993.93-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1120.718,1130.673,"In 1971, the Supreme Court decided that you couldn't make arbitrary distinctions between men and women because that violated the rational basis test."
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1130.673,1133.814,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1133.814,1138.539,You said it was no test at all; it seemed to be a pretty significant test in the case of Reed v. Reed.
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1138.539,1141.261,"I would agree, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1172.221,1173.613,How do you formulate that?
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1179.075,1201.73,"Justice Ginsburg, I believe that, as this Court set forth in Nollan, that it said that what was required was a substantial advancement of legitimate State interests; that that substantial advancement test is in fact given context and given substance by virtue of a requirement for proportionality."
1993.93-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1201.73,1211.718,"That's kind of a submiddle tier, because the stock formula, equal protection/due process, is substantial relationship to an important Government interest."
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1219.383,1220.954,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1993.93-518,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1220.954,1237.125,"Mr. Smith, is there any difference, do you think, in the justification the City can offer for the flood control problem and the justification for the bike path, insofar as Mrs. Dolan's property is concerned?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1237.125,1238.845,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1284.807,1286.827,Is Tigard in Multnomah County?
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1286.827,1288.65,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1292.231,1296.795,"Mr. Smith, I don't want to be picky; I think I'm going to sound that way, though."
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1340.693,1342.003,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1351.57,1355.994,How do you go... how do you... how do you determine what your denominator is?
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1378.739,1389.274,"In the City of Tigard, Your Honor, the... the snapshot was taken in 1983, when the City's comprehensive plan was adopted."
1993.93-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1411.53,1422.066,"So, it would be the amount of legitimate increase that could be projected from '83, as the denominator, and the portion of that attributable to this change in use as the numerator?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1422.066,1423.348,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1993.93-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.93,1444.993,"I assume the time you take the snapshot ought to depend on the time when the restriction for which this is the exaction was imposed... that is, the time the zoning requirement, which this exaction is... is meant to justify a waiver from, was imposed... that is when you'd take the snapshot, I assume?"
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1444.993,1446.042,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1447.414,1449.726,"Very well, Mr. Smith."
1993.93-518,0,21518,david_b_smith,,1449.726,1450.356,"Thank you, sir."
1993.93-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1450.356,1452.307,"Mr. Ramis, we'll hear from you."
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1452.307,1458.291,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1484.53,1493.096,"This property owner had to pay some money for the increased congestion; wasn't there an assessment, the $14,000, that was mentioned?"
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1493.096,1494.655,"Yes, there was a payment made--"
1993.93-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1494.655,1495.667,And this is in addition to that?
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1495.667,1497.266,"--Made for... it is, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.029,1563.441,"What would happen if somebody two lots back from this property, two lots further away from the flood plain, who increased business to the same extent by... by an expansion of the building, and who paid $14,000 similarly, but didn't have any flood plain land to contribute to a bike... to a bike path?"
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1565.141,1574.037,"That property owner would also be expected to make a contribution or to demonstrate, in the language of our comprehensive plan, that there are adequate public facilities and services available."
1993.93-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1582.913,1592.499,"And this property, there is something peculiar about this property, by being next to the flood plain, adequate services are not available, so that you have to contribute a bike... a bike path?"
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1592.499,1593.341,It's not--
1993.93-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1593.341,1596.062,"But if you're further away, what... what would be done to a property further away?"
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1596.062,1598.683,--Another property might reconstruct the sidewalk.
1993.93-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1621.098,1622.44,And the solution to that was a bike path?
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1622.44,1627.942,--The solution was to offset those car trips by an alternative system of transportation.
1993.93-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.942,1629.692,People are going to go to the hardware store on their bike?
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1629.692,1630.634,"No, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1631.966,1634.427,"That isn't even contended by the City, is it?"
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1638.428,1644.512,"Your Honor, the relationship is that this project is a retail project that puts additional cars on the road."
1993.93-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1650.329,1658.123,"I see, people who would otherwise be driving their cars for recreation will instead ride bicycles for recreation; is that the--"
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1658.123,1659.042,"No, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1659.042,1659.563,--Is that the notion?
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1659.563,1660.274,"No, Your Honor."

1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1690.454,1692.054,--The record--
1993.93-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.054,1693.486,"Perhaps city planners, I guess they--"

1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1753.635,1759.22,"--There are two features of the City's code which I'd like to describe, which I believe address... address your question."
1993.93-518,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1771.618,1789.319,"Well, but is... correct me if I'm wrong, as I understand it, the Petitioner here would not have been allowed by the City to come in and say there's... there's plenty of room for the creek to flow and there's... there's plenty of capacity in the streets and sidewalks."
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1794.142,1795.334,"--That's not the case, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1795.334,1796.102,--Okay.
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1796.102,1799.017,And that's the second point I wante to make about the operation of the code.
1993.93-518,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1815.507,1816.038,Okay.
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1819.27,1829.895,"Well, Your Honor, if they cannot prove that there are adequate public facilities and services, they would be conditioned to provide them, and then they would have to ask for a variance."
1993.93-518,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1829.895,1830.486,Okay.
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1846.746,1861.506,"Your Honor, the... the upstream property owner, the uphill property owner, would also have... have to ask for a variance in the event that the staff sought to impose, for example, a bus pullout to address traffic problems."
1993.93-518,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.558,1886.753,"But supposing that the upstream property owner or the uphill property owner, the one out of the flood plain or littoral, he wants... he wants to enlarge his business the same way that Mrs. Dolan did, would the City demand of him something in the way of an easement... something corresponding to the flood plain easement which they asked of Mrs. Dolan?"
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1886.753,1887.474,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1887.474,1888.684,What something is it?
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1888.684,1892.497,That is a water storage facility.
1993.93-518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1929.653,1932.885,Suppose... suppose Mrs. Dolan said that she was willing to build a storage facility?
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1932.885,1936.818,Then she would not have to dedicate the land for the greenway.
1993.93-518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1936.818,1938.239,Was she given that... was... did she have that option?
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,1938.239,1942.151,She did have that option and did not choose to seek it.

1993.93-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.578,2062.429,Fine.
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,2062.429,2067.19,Step two is at page B-63 of our appendix.

1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,2086.716,2088.416,"--Yes, in the red brief, Your Honor."
1993.93-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2090.967,2091.688,Yes.

1993.93-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2098.244,2098.814,Thank you.
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,2098.814,2099.953,Yes.
1993.93-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.537,2132.414,"Sure, I think what that means is if the pipe that's going into the municipal conduit that goes down to this stream would be overloaded, so that there's not... not enough capacity in that pipe to carry it off, you have to store it and then let it out at another time."
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,2143.683,2160.563,"--The reason that... that it wouldn't work for an applicant to come in and say, I can get a pipe to the municipal system, is that you wouldn't be able to comply with... with policy 7.1.2, which says you must provide adequate public facilities."
1993.93-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2172.813,2177.094,"But if you haven't overloaded it, then there's no such problem or requirement, right?"
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,2177.094,2177.955,That's exactly right.
1993.93-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2177.955,2178.876,And that's a possibility?
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,2178.876,2179.456,Yes.
1993.93-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2179.456,2182.277,But it isn't a possibility for Mrs. Dolan?
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,2182.277,2193.025,"It is, Your Honor, because under the... the policy at page four, Mrs. Dolan was required to come in with a drainage analysis."
1993.93-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2207.755,2208.995,"Well, let me ask you this."
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,2212.667,2213.949,--Yes.
1993.93-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2233.911,2234.532,Then no bike path?
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,2234.532,2235.411,Yes.
1993.93-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2235.802,2241.147,"Now, how about other property owners that are not adjacent to the creek, are they required to build a bike path?"
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,2241.147,2243.048,--No.
1993.93-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2246.09,2247.192,But never a bike path?
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,2247.192,2249.572,Not unless the bike path goes by their property.
1993.93-518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2256.195,2260.309,Is it your representation to us that Mrs. Dolan had all of the options of an uphill property owner?
1993.93-518,1,43245,timothy_v_ramis,,2260.309,2261.22,--Yes.
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2580.174,2583.917,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-518,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2653.903,2655.366,What... what benefits--
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2655.366,2667.395,"--It will prevent the... will prevent the... the plan is to widen the channel and to reinforce the slopes, so that the channel will have a greater carrying capacity in large floods."
1993.93-518,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2674.538,2683.934,"--Is there something in the record that indicates that, had the channel not been widened in some relatively expectable flood, her property would have been hurt?"
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2683.934,2684.545,Yes.
1993.93-518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2690.789,2697.341,Does it benefit only riparian property owners who want to expand their facilities?
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2697.341,2698.473,"No, but it--"
1993.93-518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2698.473,2710.923,"It's sort of a haphazard way of... of assessing a benefit, right, when you want to expand your facilities, since we're... we're helping you on the flood plain, we're going to... we're going to make you dedicate... only if you want to expand your facilities."
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2710.923,2715.694,"--Well, one... one of the important aspects of flood plain reg... flood plain regulation came in about 20 years ago."
1993.93-518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.818,2729.743,But the nexus that's... that our opinions require is... is not a nexus to whether you're benefitted or not.
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2738.191,2738.751,"Right, and--"
1993.93-518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.751,2740.492,And I don't see any nexus to the permit.
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2740.492,2741.163,"--Right, I--"
1993.93-518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.163,2745.745,"And the fact that you're benefitted is very interesting, but, it seems to me, irrelevant to the nexus requirement."
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2745.745,2747.437,"--Right, I... and that's the next point I wanted to get to."
1993.93-518,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2755.742,2765.646,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, a moment ago in your response to my question about whether there was a showing in the record that Mrs. Dolan's property would be hurt in the foreseeable future, you referred me to page six--"
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2765.646,2766.247,"I'm sorry, I misspoke."
1993.93-518,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2768.689,2781.338,"--Well, page seven has a finding in the drainage plan that there would be flooding in several areas along Fanno Creek, including areas near Petitioner's property."
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2784.34,2791.894,"Immediately... immediately adjacent... adjacent to the indentation on page eight, it says upstream of Hall Boulevard, which is the stretch where her property is located."
1993.93-518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2830.599,2842.839,"Is that all, just... just... you really think that's... that Nollan said, for... suppose the City is worried about urban congestion and pollution and someone who has a factory wants to... wants to expand it infinitesimally, just a very little bit."
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2850.363,2851.263,No.
1993.93-518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2851.894,2852.866,It serves the same purpose.
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2852.866,2866.974,"--As we suggested in our brief, if the... if... and, in fact, Respondent seems to agree with this at page 19 of our reply brief, with our formulation, which is if... if the landowner can show that the conditions being imposed is wholly out of relation to the... to the adverse impact--"
1993.93-518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2866.974,2868.985,There is a proportionality element?
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2868.985,2871.587,--But... but... we think not in its own right.
1993.93-518,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2944.865,2955.012,"So, there's no proportionality requirement, but... but proportionality is a subject of evidence to indicate whether in fact the required relationship... i.e., serving the same purpose... is present or not?"
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2955.012,2955.713,That... that's correct.
1993.93-518,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2965.22,2972.161,"That seems to kind of ignore the word ""substantial"" in the test articulated in Nollan."
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2972.161,2985.302,"--But in... in our view, the word ""substantial""... substantially advancing a governmental purpose... to the extent it means something other than a reasonable relationship, we think goes to the question of whether the overall regulatory scheme furthers a governmental interest."
1993.93-518,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2991.535,2995.47,"Well, I hadn't read it that way, but I guess that's a way one could read it."
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2995.47,3007.037,"--Well, Nollan does... does... if we take as a given that the permit denial would substantially further the governmental interest, and if the permit condition serves the same purpose, it's lesser included, and therefore would substantially further the same purpose."
1993.93-518,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3012.74,3016.47,"The burden, I assume, would be... on your theory, would be on the landowner to show the disproportionality?"
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3016.47,3017.121,--Correct.
1993.93-518,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3028.68,3039.836,And are these tests relevant to an ultimate determination of whether what the City is doing is simply a pretext for furthering its own goals that do not proportionally relate to the property?
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3039.836,3044.501,Right... we don't think it's necessary to inquire into the actual subjective motivation.
1993.93-518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3057.439,3059.32,Can... could I come back to who the burden is on?
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3076.081,3076.702,No--
1993.93-518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3076.702,3077.453,Why should the burden be on her?
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3077.453,3083.466,"--The City... the City can't just assert that with... without foundation, I think."
1993.93-518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3087.397,3088.478,"Well, what do you mean without foundation?"
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3088.478,3088.859,--Well--
1993.93-518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.859,3092.161,Why isn't the burden on the City to demonstrate some rough proportionality?
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3092.161,3105.119,"--What the City did was to adopt a code of general applicability, which... which states, for example, that... that increasing impervious surfaces will increase runoff and increase flooding, as one example."
1993.93-518,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3110.932,3113.805,"That just shows you're in the same general ball park, flood control."
1993.93-518,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3134.327,3142.013,"The question is not principally one of quantification, but logical relatedness of the condition to the... to the impact being addressed."
1993.93-518,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3142.013,3143.484,"--Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1993.93-518,3,21518,david_b_smith,,3146.165,3150.149,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-518,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3150.149,3154.413,Will you cover some of the contentions about the variances and so forth?
1993.93-518,3,21518,david_b_smith,,3154.413,3156.784,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-518,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3194.117,3203.223,"Well, what about the availability of conditions... of... of alternatives that she could have invoked and that the City would have had to accept as a matter of right?"
1993.93-518,3,21518,david_b_smith,,3203.223,3209.538,"Your Honor, I don't believe that there were such alternatives."
1993.93-518,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3290.973,3298.616,"Do you agree with your colleague that the Oregon Supreme Court didn't consider the availability of variances, and they were not argued to the Oregon Supreme Court?"
1993.93-518,3,21518,david_b_smith,,3298.616,3300.828,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-518,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3348.129,3356.276,Do the other State plans that you referred to in your main presentation... New Jersey and elsewhere... do they provide for some proportionality?
1993.93-518,3,21518,david_b_smith,,3356.276,3358.607,"Yes, Your Honor, they do."
