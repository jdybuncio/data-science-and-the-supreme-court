1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,25.006,27.877,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.47,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,27.877,29.161,Mr. Hearn.
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,29.161,31.476,Thank you sir.
1965.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,81.35,83.276,How much were the costs?
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,83.276,87.644,$230.95 sir.
1965.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,101.984,104.603,What does this cost cover?
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,104.603,106.228,"Most sir, were witness fees."
1965.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,117.124,118.596,There's no transcript cost?
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,118.596,121.001,"No, sir, there is not."
1965.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,121.001,126.67,No ordinarily is that the case?
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,126.67,134.522,"Well sir, I cannot speak from personal experience as to whether that is or is not as a matter of custom in other cases included."
1965.47,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,134.522,143.092,When justice of peace received a part of his salary from the fees of this kind?
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,143.092,155.296,"Well, sir, I know that in Philadelphia County, he does not from which I come, but in Chester County from which this case comes, I believe he does but I'm not certain."
1965.47,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,155.296,159.647,I see.
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,159.647,164.884,The statute itself contains no standard whatsoever on its face.
1965.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,189.392,191.942,How old is this case?
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,191.942,195.574,The particular statute was enacted in 1860.
1965.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,352.657,354.483,"Well, how is this done Mr. Hearn?"
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,366.902,368.214,"I believe it's the latter, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1965.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,368.214,370.166,It is?
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,371.149,371.775,"Yes, sir."
1965.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,371.775,375.646,Who computes it?
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,375.646,379.032,"Well, it is -- it's the question that --"
1965.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,379.032,380.754,"Well, here is $230."
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,380.754,381.445,"Yes, sir."
1965.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,381.445,387.643,"Now, what was before the jury that made up $230?"
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,387.643,394.503,Well I can -- there was a charge of the clerk of the court for $10 --
1965.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,394.503,398.985,"No, but it was -- was the jury told that?"
1965.47,0,37955,peter_hearn,,398.985,423.367,"On in -- only the portion of the charge -- of the court's charge which dealt with cost has been transcribed in this case and it does not appear in there so that I -- I cannot, but I believe the practice is that the -- it appears from that portion of the charge that the question of costs is dealt with -- in just those terms."
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1027.846,1031.365,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1073.893,1079.393,Do you agree with your colleague that the prosecutor by that is meant to be private complainant?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1079.393,1083.801,I cannot -- Mr. Justice Stewart.
1965.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1111.189,1115.661,What do you -- what do you call a lawyer who tries the case for the prosecution?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1115.661,1117.576,Prosecutor District Attorney.
1965.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1117.576,1120.291,Do you call him a prosecutor too?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1120.291,1121.401,Not usually.
1965.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1121.401,1121.997,Alright.
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1128.22,1128.48,No.
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1152.429,1154.488,"Testify as to what, Mr. Halsted?"
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1154.488,1154.721,Beg your pardon?
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1154.721,1157.08,Testify as to what at the trial?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1157.08,1159.394,Of any fact.
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1159.394,1161.073,That is bearing on guilt or innocence?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1161.073,1161.82,Yes.
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1166.779,1173.364,"Now what evidence, if there is any, of actual out-of-pocket costs does the jury hear?"
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1173.364,1174.348,They have none.
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1192.649,1199.945,And that's true where there was the misdemeanor prosecution and acquittal of the accused?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1204.42,1204.692,Yes.
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1204.692,1205.461,-- it doesn't know where --
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1205.461,1207.661,It has no idea what the cost amount to.
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1207.661,1211.296,And could these include the other costs of a transcript?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1211.296,1211.579,No.
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1235.495,1244.677,"Well, how -- I think we heard Mr. Hearn was arguing of the -- the couple of cases that where the mouth runs as high -- thousands, couple of thousand dollars?"
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1244.677,1246.051,That is correct and --
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1246.051,1248.077,"Well, how is it get that high?"
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1248.077,1269.815,"These, as Mr. Hearn point out are primarily witness fees because every time a witness appears at grand jury or for trial, every time that he signed in to appear in that case, he is entitled to the statutory witness fee plus mileage and that -- if such a case which involves a lot of witnesses it soon builds up."
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1269.815,1274.698,Does any part of this go to the salary of the justices of peace?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1274.698,1276.078,"Not directly, no."
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1281.735,1283.228,They pay him per case?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1283.228,1283.706,Yes.
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1284.554,1287.239,When the case is finished?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1287.239,1289.047,I believe he's paid immediately.
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1289.047,1290.197,Before it starts?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1290.197,1290.875,That's right.
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1291.379,1292.617,How could they know?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1298.275,1299.081,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1305.277,1305.882,Yes.
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1305.882,1308.096,-- the County sends him a check for that amount.
1965.47,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1308.9,1311.216,It does depend on guilt of finding –-
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1311.216,1312.139,No.
1965.47,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1323.199,1326.158,(Voice Overlap) It's been only applies where you have a jury?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1326.158,1327.066,I beg your pardon sir?
1965.47,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1327.066,1329.06,Only applies where there's a jury?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1329.06,1329.576,That's correct.
1965.47,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1329.576,1337.308,"Then they have a free alternatives, One, the complaining witness, two, the prosecutor, and three, the defendant himself even though they find him not guilty?"
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1337.308,1348.957,That's correct or if they may split them between the prosecutor and the defendant if they find it was sort of a backyard fight or something of that nature then they -- they can both bear the costs.
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1348.957,1353.139,What -- do you mean the jury comes in with the verdict then cost to be equally divided or something?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1353.139,1353.714,Yes.
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1353.714,1354.195,I see.
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1354.195,1358.374,"Or they can say one-third, two-thirds of -- it's entirely up to them."
1965.47,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1358.374,1363.313,"How do they know whose the complaining witnesses, is that always prove them or does that -- difference but --"
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1363.313,1370.158,"In the court's charge, the court will say on -- so and so is endorsed as a prosecutor on this bill of indictment."
1965.47,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1381.317,1384.394,"Because most of these cases they have a complaining witness, would they not?"
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1384.394,1385.977,That's correct.
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1389.552,1408.3,"So a man might be subpoenaed as -- as a witness for the prosecution and he would testify in accordance to that subpoena, and then the jury might decide that he's a real prosecutor in the case in -- and assess costs against him, is that right?"
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1408.3,1409.283,That's correct.
1965.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.667,1424.986,Are there any statistics on how often that cost are placed some -- on someone other than the county?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1424.986,1426.457,I know of none.
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1431.927,1432.573,Infrequently?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1432.573,1453.7,Infrequently and as the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania observed and it's actually the case of -- it's usually and I don't mean to be factious but it's usually where the defendant is guilty but the jury doesn't think that he should bear the burn of having a record maybe against him –-
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1453.7,1456.974,The juries -- jury says not guilty but said don't do it again.
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1456.974,1464.673,That's correct and that -- that that's actually how it works the majority of the time.
1965.47,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1469.203,1471.498,It's justified against him --
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1471.498,1471.939,Pardon sir?
1965.47,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1471.939,1473.798,They just assess the finding against him though.
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1473.798,1473.976,Yes.
1965.47,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1474.656,1476.54,"-- the fact, those words --"
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1476.54,1482.416,-- the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania observes it -- costs aren't applying because they're separate and apart.
1965.47,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1484.544,1486.25,I just think of it as a practical pay.
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1486.25,1486.934,"Well, that's right."
1965.47,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1488.336,1488.544,Yes.
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1488.544,1490.162,There's no question about that.
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1490.162,1494.457,"If there's any suggestion that -- I must confess, I've never heard of a statute like this before --"
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1494.457,1496.267,Yes.
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1496.267,1499.835,"-– and I understand, this has been on Pennsylvania's books since 1804."
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1499.835,1500.68,That's correct.
1965.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1500.68,1511.18,Is there any suggestions of a reason why in the case of an acquitted defendant this practice was provided?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1511.18,1514.787,You can only speculate from the history of the Act.
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1553.308,1563.057,"Well -- may I ask, this -- is there any reason that it has been stated why they would do this with the jury?"
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1571.916,1581.246,I have no idea unless they felt that the jury were better able to assess what they thought was improper behavior which led to the prosecution.
1965.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1590.44,1599.159,But what -- what was the situation in the ordinary crimes of say in the 16th to 17th Century?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1602.953,1604.294,There -- there some dispute of that.
1965.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.385,1622.924,"This was -- this wasn't an English view, was it?"
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1622.924,1624.036,No.
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1641.652,1643.978,"May I ask just one more question, please."
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1653.685,1654.47,"It does, Your Honor."
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1654.47,1659.097,And is it -- is it followed in those cities?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1659.097,1661.189,"To the best of my knowledge, it is."
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1661.189,1662.864,"It is, alright."
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1662.864,1662.94,I know but I didn't notice --
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1662.94,1665.916,I -- I know but I notice wherever I just -- I just want to --
1965.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1665.916,1667.102,[Inaudible] accept that?
1965.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1667.102,1685.331,"But during -- Mr. Hearn, can you help me at all with respect to the reason why or just the case you would before the differentiation between the misdemeanor and the felony?"
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1689.511,1690.907,If I understand Your Honor's question.
1965.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1695.405,1698.315,Why did the -- why the statute felony on this too?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1698.315,1710.984,Of -- the only thing I can observe is what the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania observed that may the public interest in felony prosecutions was great enough that they would bear the costs in all cases.
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1743.196,1748.191,May -- may I ask just one more question on procedure?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1755.156,1755.427,"No, it does not."
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1755.427,1756.233,-- in the case?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1756.233,1756.75,It does not.
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1756.75,1759.038,How is that determined?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1759.038,1766.428,I suppose only by tradition whatever the costs which the county pays in which there is a record made.
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1775.235,1780.836,There no guidelines at all that -- that the justice of peace must follow?
1965.47,1,30936,john_s_halsted,,1780.836,1781.13,Yes.
1965.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1791.217,1808.648,"Now, I will -- to make specific in this case, I'd like to acknowledge if there's any thing in the statute that -- that prescribes, how this $263, or whatever it is, in this case is made up?"
