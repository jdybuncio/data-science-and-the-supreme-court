1983.82-1256,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.027,We will hear arguments first this morning in Dennis Lynch against Donnelly.
1983.82-1256,0,45459,william_f_mc_mahon,,14.807,18.648,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-1256,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,98.351,103.474,"Has the creche been there for 40 years, used every year for 40 years?"
1983.82-1256,0,45459,william_f_mc_mahon,,104.27,111.531,"Yes, Justice, but the display has not been in that location for those 40 years."
1983.82-1256,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,115.266,118.577,But a creche has been used for 40 years?
1983.82-1256,0,45459,william_f_mc_mahon,,119.31,120.776,"That is correct, Justice."
1983.82-1256,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,204.104,206.822,I am just curious as to one fact.
1983.82-1256,0,45459,william_f_mc_mahon,,210.664,213.99,"--A permanent injunction was issued, yes, Justice."
1983.82-1256,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,213.99,214.926,And it is still in effect?
1983.82-1256,0,45459,william_f_mc_mahon,,214.926,215.959,"That is correct, Justice."
1983.82-1256,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,215.959,219.784,"So that in... This concerned 1980, didn't it?"
1983.82-1256,0,45459,william_f_mc_mahon,,219.784,220.471,That is correct.
1983.82-1256,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,220.471,222.873,So that in 1981 and 1982 you had no creche?
1983.82-1256,0,45459,william_f_mc_mahon,,222.873,224.577,The city has not sponsored a creche.
1983.82-1256,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,260.312,265.187,Has it been on public property in the last two years?
1983.82-1256,0,45459,william_f_mc_mahon,,265.187,270.869,"This has not been on public property, Chief Justice, since 1973."
1983.82-1256,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,291.848,304.81,"Then the city sponsored creche from 1973 up until 1980 was basically not on city property, but the exhibits were put together by the city?"
1983.82-1256,0,45459,william_f_mc_mahon,,304.81,306.249,"--And owned by the city, Justice."
1983.82-1256,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1119.831,1138.811,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to emphasize just briefly two characteristics of Pawtucket's creche that in our view make it a constitutionally permissible governmental acknowledgement of an important part of the American culture and heritage."
1983.82-1256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1312.456,1318.239,"What test in your view should the Court apply, Mr. Lee, in testing these things?"
1983.82-1256,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1318.239,1328.592,"We submit, Justice O'Connor, that the test that ought to be applied is one that is narrowly tailored to the particular First Amendment concerns of religious symbols."
1983.82-1256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1331.949,1350.99,Do you think that the three-part test would perhaps better describe most of the Court's cases if we read the purpose and effect together rather than purpose or effect?
1983.82-1256,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1350.99,1351.568,--I do.
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,1717.978,1732.083,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, with the possible exception of the cross, the nativity scene is one of the most powerful religious symbols in this country, and most certainly one of the most powerful Christian religious symbols in this country."
1983.82-1256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1824.03,1834.729,"Well, Mr. DeLuca, you say that although the property, the real property, I take it, on which the creche is located is private, it is only... it adjacent to city property."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,1851.143,1879.711,"Well, I think that in the... I think that in understanding that the city owns all of the symbols and all of the artifacts that are contained in this display, and assuming that that... the creche were purchased and paid for privately without any other explanation that it is private, then I think it would still violate the establishment clause for the First Amendment, because there is no indication to anyone looking at that that the display or the creche is not part of the broader display which is put up and sponsored by the city."
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1879.711,1895.703,"Would you regard the prayer that I spoke of to your friend in the House or the Senate or in any state legislature as purely symbolic, or is it a matter of substance?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,1895.703,1915.695,"I think that prayer is purely symbolic, and I think this Court made that observation in Marsh versus Chambers, in conjunction with relying on the unique history that this Court found to be applicable to the prayer in Nebraska and generally in legislatures and in Congress."
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1915.695,1926.38,"Now, is it purely symbolic in your view when the chaplain gets up and asks for divine guidance on the members of the legislative body?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,1929.706,1933.017,"Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1977.498,1981.48,"It has nothing to do with any religious faith, in your view?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,1981.48,1984.966,"Well, it most certainly is an acknowledgement of a religious faith."
1983.82-1256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2114.862,2121.846,"Well, that was basically the mayor's reaction to something that your clients had done, I take it."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2128.748,2139.43,"--Well, he may not have done that if it hadn't been challenged, if the suit had not been filed, but I think it is indicative of the purpose and effect of the erection of that display, of the creche."
1983.82-1256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.895,2157.488,"Well, do you say that when the mayor said he was going to"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2171.386,2172.123,I am not suggesting that.
1983.82-1256,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2215.541,2220.899,Don't you think an opinion can be written upholding you side without mentioning the mayor?
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2220.899,2223.304,"--Do I think... Yes, I do, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1983.82-1256,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2223.304,2225.71,"Well, why are you staying on it so long?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2225.71,2241.639,"I brought the mayor's press conference to your attention because I thought it was... had some probative value, but I would also like to suggest that in spite of the mayor's publicly avowed purpose of the creche in the Christmas display--"
1983.82-1256,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2241.639,2243.64,"Well, excuse me for even mentioning it."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2243.64,2253.338,--The city at the trial offered three other reasons for the inclusion of the nativity scene in the annual Christmas display.
1983.82-1256,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2356.608,2360.983,"You mean, you disagree that it had been displayed for 40 years?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2360.983,2369.855,"I don't disagree that it has been displayed, Justice O'Connor, since 1973 in its present locale."
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2398.809,2409.665,"Several years ago, Mr. DeLuca, there was a ceremony held on the Mall, which is federal property, of course."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2432.765,2477.886,"I believe that was on the Elipse across the street from the state... in any event, it was on public property, and I believe... it was my understanding, Mr. Chief Justice, that that property has been used traditionally or historically as a place where people can express their principles, beliefs, or non-beliefs, so that in that context I think that it was inappropriate to have a mass being said by the Pope, because I think that in a sense, that that was an establishment or sponsorship of religion, but at least the argument there that could be made is that it was a forum that was provided to all people, regardless of their beliefs, regardless of their principles, as opposed to a specific sponsorship of a religious symbol, as it is in this case."
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2477.886,2481.057,Then you think it would be all right to put a creche over on the Mall?
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2481.057,2484.228,"No, I don't think it's all right to put a creche over on the Mall."
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2486.524,2487.273,"Well, what's the difference?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2487.273,2487.757,--The difference--
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2487.757,2490.93,How do you distinguish a high mass from a creche?
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2490.93,2495.895,"--Well, I think we have to look at the... as the District Court did in this case, the factual setting."
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2526.432,2544.3,"Well, there was a considerable involvement of government in that ceremony, hundreds of extra policemen on duty, streets closed for traffic control purposes, and all that sort of thing."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2547.22,2567.365,"Yes, it was, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think that I would argue respectfully that it could create or did create excessive government entanglement insofar as the government's relationship with a religious group, most notably the Roman Catholic Church."
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2586.703,2594.232,"But not the thousands of dollars involved in the extra management problems, the policing, the traffic control?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2594.232,2594.809,That's correct.
1983.82-1256,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2627.656,2647.539,"Mr. DeLuca, do you think that any religious effect of the creche display in Pawtucket was diminished by the fact that it included the display of a Christmas tree and a clown and a robot and reindeer and so forth?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2647.539,2651.864,"Well, I think... I have two answers to your question, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-1256,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2743.264,2752.213,"Well, the city then could not display religious paintings or artifacts in its museum under your theory."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2752.213,2756.666,"No, that wouldn't be the case."
1983.82-1256,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2769.176,2774.067,"But according to you the effect would be the same, regardless of the purpose."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2774.067,2775.393,"--Well, but I think--"
1983.82-1256,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2775.393,2784.966,"Children would come to the museum, and be somehow induced to think that the city was supporting the religious symbols that were displayed."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2784.966,2791.322,--But the setting is completely different in a museum as it is from the display in Pawtucket.
1983.82-1256,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2798.727,2805.27,"Well, I suppose museums are developed to try to entice and attract visitors, including children."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2805.27,2806.631,"--Yes, but not in the same way."
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2988.524,2998.552,"Do we know... Do we know that the kind of display that you just suggested at Easter, on Good Friday, would not be permitted?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,2998.552,3003.408,"It would be my suggestion that it would not be permitted, that--"
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3003.408,3004.8,Has this Court ever--
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3004.8,3007.421,"--No, that is why this case is here."
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3007.421,3008.985,"--No, I am talking about Easter now."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3022.667,3024.103,I wouldn't--
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3024.103,3025.152,We don't know judicially.
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3025.152,3029.165,--Based upon... The direct answer is no.
1983.82-1256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.312,3093.514,"But, Mr. DeLuca, isn't that problem also present in your position?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3104.916,3111.21,"If the creche is owned by the city of Pawtucket, yes, it would be illegal, because it is an acknowledgement of a religious symbol."
1983.82-1256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3113.788,3125.014,"Well, if it is so... if it is so obscure that very few of the visitors to the scene even see it, then how do you distinguish the museum case where you've got some religious paintings in the museum?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3125.014,3134.482,"Well, I don't think the obscurity of the symbol has... with all due respect, has anything to do with whether or not government is sponsoring or advancing religion."
1983.82-1256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3134.482,3137.7,"What if they had three wise men and a star in one exhibit, say?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3138.667,3139.853,As a... with a--
1983.82-1256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3139.853,3142.009,You are going to have a line drawing problem no matter what you do.
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3142.009,3142.477,--I'm sorry.
1983.82-1256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3142.477,3148.054,"What if you had an exhibit that had not the creche itself, but just three camels out in a desert and a star up in the sky?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3148.054,3155.19,"Well, then what we need in order to interpret those three symbols or four symbols, the three wise men and the star, is a key."
1983.82-1256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3165.074,3169.293,"Well, a lamb doesn't have any religious significance, and a barn doesn't."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3172.074,3180.493,"--With the exception of the child, the baby Jesus in the manger, and the two... and the Virgin Mary and St. Joseph."
1983.82-1256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3180.493,3182.474,"Well, that could be any mother and father in that--"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3182.474,3200.358,"Well, it could be, but the difference between the nativity scene and separating each one of those symbols and... is that in order to appreciate the religious significance of the star, for example, as I started to say, you need a key to unlock the religious significance of the star."
1983.82-1256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3202.061,3203.434,--I think you need a key for the creche.
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3203.434,3204.015,--No--
1983.82-1256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3204.015,3208.012,I don't think every child who has not been brought up in the Christian tradition would understand its meaning.
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3208.012,3208.667,--No--
1983.82-1256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3208.667,3215.635,"There is nothing self-explanatory about a creche to somebody, as Justice Stevens says, to someone who has never been exposed to the Christian religion."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3215.635,3219.445,"--Well, with all... I would beg to differ, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-1256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3267.409,3274.955,To say someone is on their knees certainly does not import an exclusively religious connotation.
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3280.625,3305.535,"--Well, I think that the creche, and the creche in this case, and any creche that I have ever seen would lend credence to the position that it is not temporal but in fact worshipful, that the appearance of the figures in the display are in a worshipful position, and not simply kneeling down for convenience or for comfort."
1983.82-1256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3308.737,3318.669,"--Well, that is probably true for anyone exposed to the Christian religion, but I think what Justice Stevens was trying to ask you and what I have been trying to ask you is for someone who has not been schooled in that religion."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3318.669,3323.324,For someone who knows nothing about Christianity?
1983.82-1256,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3347.533,3350.423,Mr. DeLuca--
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3350.423,3350.891,Yes?
1983.82-1256,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3350.891,3358.327,"--would the display up on the frieze in this courtroom of the Ten Commandments be unconstitutional then, in your view?"
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3358.327,3361.388,"No, it would not be unconstitutional in my view."
1983.82-1256,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3381.256,3393.703,"Well, that is the argument, of course, of the city, that the display of the nativity scene is there to explain the origins of the Christmas holiday observation."
1983.82-1256,2,16445,amato_a_de_luca,,3393.703,3414.426,"But I think that in this setting here in this courtroom, the Ten Commandments in and of themselves do not suggest or advance religion, nor would anyone suggest that the purpose of having the Ten Commandmets in this courtroom is this Court's attempt to advance religion."
1983.82-1256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3489.85,3492.787,"Do you have anything further, Mr. McMahon?"
1983.82-1256,3,45459,william_f_mc_mahon,,3495.021,3497.115,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1256,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3660.028,3661.089,"Thank you, gentlemen."
