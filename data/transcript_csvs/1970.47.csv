1970.47,0,34049,leg,,28.956,29.104,Thank you Your Honor.
1970.47,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,29.104,29.882,We thank you very much.
1970.47,0,34049,leg,,29.882,38.301,It's my pleasure to be of service.
1970.47,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,38.301,40.801,"Mr. Brumfield, you may proceed whenever youre ready."
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,40.801,47.095,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.47,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,219.821,225.735,"Even if it's not on board, the ship or having anything directly to do with the ship."
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,225.735,246.62,"Even if it has nothing to do with the ship, the ship owner has no knowledge of it, didnt own it, had no control of it as was held in Patterson, may it please Your Honor in the Landmark case, the Court held that that was no defense and that it made the ship unseaworthy."
1970.47,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,394.91,398.962,Were those cases on ship board or on the docks or the piers?
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,398.962,424.986,"On -- Mahnich was a seaman, Crumady was a longshoreman both on ship but in Gutierrez, Mr. Justice White, it occurred on the dock where the beans spilled out of defective containers holding that that caused unseaworthiness to the ship."
1970.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.358,573.394,"If you put your thesis together with Ryan and the -- do you think you'll run into any problems or incongruities in relation to the provisions of the longshoreman in the Harbor Workers Act, these were Stevedores werent they who were heard?"
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,573.394,574.952,True.
1970.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,574.952,577.766,Do you think that gives rise to any problem?
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,577.766,588.64,"No, I dont believe it does may it please Your Honor because this Court has outlined various guidelines to make those determinations because --"
1970.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,588.64,593.064,"Oh, it's certainly gone right down the line up to date on what you're arguing."
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,605.719,629.108,"But may it please Your Honor, insofar as the Stevedores are longshoremans, it is -- it is known and can be taken as a fact that the Sieracki seaman or the people or the workers in that place are doing now work that was traditionally done before by the seaman."
1970.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,803.395,810.52,Thats the reason Mr. Brumfield I dont see why it has -- why the act has to be a negligent act and its under your submission and your theory.
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,810.52,812.626,It does.
1970.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,812.626,830.418,"Are there any act, any very careful act on the part of the seaman on a well equipped and a very seaworthy ship, any very, very careful act that just happens to injure somebody who would under your theory create an unseaworthy ship and create liability on the part of the ship owner for unseaworthiness wouldnt that be correct?"
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,830.418,832.379,"Thats exactly right, may it please Your Honor."
1970.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,910.094,915.398,(Inaudible)
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,915.398,917.497,"Maybe it does, yes."
1970.47,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,917.497,928.138,Well recess for lunch now.
1970.47,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,928.138,930.222,You may continue.
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,930.222,935.685,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.47,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1071.765,1077.254,How long has it been since the first case which you referred was decided?
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,1077.254,1080.116,The Crumady was in 1944.
1970.47,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1080.116,1081.413,What about Mahnich?
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,1081.413,1085.622,I mean Mahnich was 1944.
1970.47,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1103.787,1107.98,If Congress taken any action since those cases were decided?
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,1107.98,1114.405,"No Your Honor, they havent passed any legislation concerning this problems since then."
1970.47,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1143.26,1145.691,Was he on the panel who decided this case?
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,1145.691,1159.3,He was on the panel that decided the Grigsby case in the Fifth Circuit in which they held that operational negligence was brought about unseaworthy condition but it wasn't instantaneous.
1970.47,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1167.337,1169.605,"Factually, that was a very different case than this."
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,1169.605,1170.249,Yes.
1970.47,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1172.521,1175.6,"All of the conduct there was on the desk, true."
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,1175.6,1176.561,True.
1970.47,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1176.561,1186.32,So there's no question about relating it to some fictional aspect of it's being 100 yards away from the vessel.
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,1186.32,1186.692,Right.
1970.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1277.732,1278.334,Mr. Brumfield?
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,1278.334,1281.735,Yes sir.
1970.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1281.735,1287.509,"As I recall, the reversal in Mascuilli cited two cases."
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,1287.509,1288.96,Yes sir.
1970.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.362,1295.678,Do you feel that either of those cases stands for the reversing proposition?
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,1295.678,1310.35,"Yes I do, may it please Your Honor because in both of those cases, Mahnich and in Crumady, it was based upon the fact that operational negligence created the unseaworthy condition."
1970.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1321.506,1326.067,"At least there though, did you not have a defective piece of equipment?"
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,1326.067,1327.244,Yes you did but --
1970.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.244,1330.281,"But here I take it, we have no defective piece of equipment."
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,1330.281,1336.925,"Right, may it please Your Honor but we dont need a defective piece of equipment to make a ship unseaworthy."
1970.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1372.669,1384.832,"Well, I think this is true and I have assumed that your primary here was one of instantaneous negligence and that hence my question about the two supporting cases cited."
1970.47,1,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,1384.832,1410.853,"Well, what I say in those cases, Crumady and in Mahnich, this Court didnt concern itself with going in to the fact or determining what lapse of time was necessary for the choosing of the rotten rope or for the missetting of the electrical cutoff device to make it unseaworthy."
1970.47,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1493.042,1495.41,Mr. Kohlmeyer?
1970.47,2,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,1495.41,1500.056,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.47,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1757.298,1763.505,"But the condition need not have been caused by any negligence or by any fault at all, thats correct, isn't it?"
1970.47,2,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,1763.505,1764.745,This is of course correct.
1970.47,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1764.745,1776.184,"I mean for example the Mitchell case there, there was gurry on the ship's railing -- nobody knew whether that anybody was negligent in causing that condition, that wasnt an element on the case."
1970.47,2,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,1778.124,1783.22,I think that Your Honor is correct in your statement of the end result that was not an element of the case.
1970.47,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1785.844,1789.346,No one knew how it came to be there whether it was through the fault of anybody.
1970.47,2,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,1789.905,1804.763,"Thats correct and I would think that it is proper to state that under the existing law, knowledge of the condition need not be brought home to the ship owner in order to enforce liability on him because it is a liability without fault."
1970.47,3,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,3309.964,3335.076,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please Your Honors, with regard to Mr. Justice Marshall to the dropping of the grease, if the grease is dropped without any negligence whatsoever and a seaman or another stevedore steps on it, my good friend says thats unseaworthy condition which I agree."
1970.47,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3410.307,3414.616,The man operating the winch was not a condition.
1970.47,3,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,3414.616,3415.456,May it please Your Honor.
1970.47,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3415.456,3423.856,The man operating the winch was not a condition than the man operating the winch.
1970.47,3,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,3423.856,3424.709,Right.
1970.47,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3425.887,3428.684,Mr. Kohlmeyer says thats different.
1970.47,3,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,3428.684,3454.159,"I say that the man -- there is no difference and this Court has said so in no uncertain terms in the Waldron case, it makes no difference between the equipment and the personnel because this condition can be brought about by a defective equipment or negligent operation of the equipment or even by non negligent operation of the equipment."
1970.47,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3454.159,3458.753,"Even if it's temporary just for one second, it makes no difference."
1970.47,3,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,3458.753,3462.145,Makes no difference may it please Your Honor because this --
1970.47,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3462.145,3465.349,But that door had been there a long time and --
1970.47,3,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,3465.349,3467.109,"Sir, I beg your pardon."
1970.47,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3467.109,3470.374,The condition had been there quite a while in Mitchell.
1970.47,3,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,3471.18,3475.306,"Well, Your Honor, you didnt even make that determination."
1970.47,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3536.004,3541.483,I believe you said that -- originated that idea or concept originated under Fifth Circuit?
1970.47,3,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,3541.483,3545.451,When the (Inaudible)
1970.47,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3545.451,3547.56,What cases?
1970.47,3,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,3547.56,3548.988,We cite them in our briefs.
1970.47,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3548.988,3549.851,You cited in your brief?
1970.47,3,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,3549.851,3553.891,Yes (Inaudible).
1970.47,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3553.891,3556.122,Who wrote the first one?
1970.47,3,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,3557.803,3591.175,"I sure dont Mr. Justice Black but they concern themselves with a lapse of time whereas nowhere in this Court in this decision at Crumady and Gutierrez where it happened offshore or with a bean bags or the man, those cases, nowhere when this question of negligence or non-negligence creating a condition of unseaworthiness was the time ever considered."
1970.47,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3737.866,3738.463,"I think we are done, Mr. Brumfield."
1970.47,3,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,3738.463,3739.115,Yes.
1970.47,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3742.811,3745.104,"Thank you Mr. Brumfield, thank you Mr. Kohlmeyer."
1970.47,3,26646,h_alva_brumfield,,3746.24,3748.362,Thank you very much.
