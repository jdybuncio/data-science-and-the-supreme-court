2002.01-1289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,9.275,"We'll hear argument in Number 01-1289, State Farm Mutual v. Campbell and others."
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,12.637,15.77,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,63.015,66.25,"Ms. Birnbaum, may I ask you a question about the record?"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,66.25,67.151,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,67.151,77.604,"As I understand the other side, what is at issue is a policy that your company had over the years, I forget the name of it, BP and something or other, and I looked for that policy in the record, and I couldn't find it."
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,79.223,80.013,"It's in the lodging, Your Honor."
2002.01-1289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,80.013,80.837,--It's a lodging?
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,80.837,96.87,"It's at 1506 to 1531 in the lodging, and if you look at the B, so-called PP&R... it's called the Performance Planning and Review Manual... it is a guide."
2002.01-1289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,143.209,153.505,"Nonetheless, if the jury found such a policy, that there was a policy as alleged by the plaintiff, that's not... we have to take that as a given, don't we, Ms. Birnbaum?"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,153.505,175.582,"You may have to take that as a given, Your Honor, but the question becomes, how is that policy related in any way to this decision to try a case in the State of Utah, and how can State Farm be punished for its nationwide conduct, when all this case was about, and should have been about--"
2002.01-1289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,175.582,181.865,"Do you say the evidence of conduct in other jurisdictions should have been excluded, it was inadmissible?"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,181.865,199.645,"--Your Honor, some evidence could have come in under this Court's determination in BMW to show reprehensibility, but evidence that could have come in to show reprehensibility had to be comparable to the conduct that was at stake here."
2002.01-1289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,199.645,220.471,"Well, what do you say to the argument on the other side that the instances of conduct involving facts having nothing to do with settlement within policy limits, all came in, in effect as rebuttal, as admissible rebuttal evidence in response to issues that State Farm raised?"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,220.471,224.957,"Your Honor, the record is replete in our opening brief."
2002.01-1289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,264.721,266.384,"Well, yes, that may be."
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,292.611,293.913,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2002.01-1289,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,293.913,294.054,Okay.
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,294.054,299.457,"And it's all cited in our brief, in our opening brief, many, many times."
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.457,300.22,And why doesn't--
2002.01-1289,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,300.22,301.965,--And were objections made each time?
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,301.965,307.171,"Your Honor, there was not, because that wasn't necessary in the State of Utah."
2002.01-1289,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,316.169,317.151,That was done.
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,317.151,334.784,"--That was many times done, and Your Honor, when this court came down with the case of BMW v. Gore, there was an oral argument made that that kind of evidence was unconstitutional under Gore, because it was dissimilar and extraterritorial."
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.784,363.848,"Ms. Birnbaum, why doesn't it go to reprehensibility if it were true that this failure to settle claims that were quite valid was simply part of a nationwide pattern to pay out less than was due, not just in this context but in every context?"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,365.858,382.94,"Because, Your Honor, if we are... if we permit litigants to create this overriding scheme that you are engaged in fraud in all your business practices, and that you can be punished for that, it is as if in Gore--"
2002.01-1289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,382.94,389.515,"Well, I think it does go to reprehensibility if we're giving some kind of an ethical report card to State Farm."
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,389.515,390.681,--Your Honor--
2002.01-1289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,390.681,397.691,"It does not go to reprehensibility, I would think would be your point, as to the harm suffered by this plaintiff."
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,397.691,398.475,--Absolutely.
2002.01-1289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,398.475,399.677,And that seems to me the difference.
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,399.677,400.455,Absolutely.
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,400.886,411.824,"You say it would go to reprehensibility, and it would go to the harm suffered by this plaintiff, if they introduced evidence of doing the same thing to other plaintiffs in other States, the same thing to other plaintiffs."
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,413.761,415.03,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.03,427.528,"You know, I don't understand how you can possibly say you cannot introduce evidence from other States, and at the same time say, unless it's introduced to show reprehensibility."
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,434.022,454.726,"--Your Honor, because in Gore v. BMW this Court, the majority of this Court held that you can introduce on the reprehensibility question similar conduct that compares to the conduct that occurred to the particular plaintiff in the underlying case."
2002.01-1289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,454.726,456.99,"Of course, that's all that was offered in Gore, of course."
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,456.99,458.885,"But that... but Your Honor, it would be like--"
2002.01-1289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,458.885,460.968,So we didn't really have to reach your question in that case.
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,460.968,482.089,"--Your Honor, but it would be like in Gore saying that there was a plan to maximize profits, and that not only could you introduce and consider the repair issues that occurred in Gore, but you could also show that there was discrimination against minority customers, that there was--"
2002.01-1289,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,482.089,485.095,But the answer is that all that does go to reprehensibility.
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,525.522,527.813,"--I couldn't have said it any better, Your Honor."
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.239,540.054,"Well then, maybe... maybe you can tell me how one defines reprehensibility so that it only includes what you call the same acts."
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,546.82,547.375,"Well, I think--"
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,547.375,553.785,"--other than a policyholder who... you know, who passed five, six cars on the highway?"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,553.785,554.543,--No.
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.584,563.99,"Why isn't cheating all policyholders in all contexts, paying less than they're entitled to, why isn't that similar to what happened here?"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,563.99,567.415,"--Because it had nothing to do with what happened here, and I'd like to explain to you."
2002.01-1289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,628.51,645.043,"How would you formulate the standard that you want us to adopt, the standard which confines the reprehensibility evidence to what you deem to be appropriate in a case such as this?"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,645.043,645.913,I think--
2002.01-1289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,645.913,647.035,What rule do we have?
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,647.035,663.026,"--I think, Your Honor, the proper reprehensibility inquiry is limited to an examination of a defendant's specific misconduct toward the plaintiff and similar conduct by the defendant toward others, but it has to be similar."
2002.01-1289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,666.4,695.492,"And here you're not drawing a line... one of the lines was similar conduct and in the same State, but in the automobile, automobiles, we're a very mobile society, so I don't think... well, perhaps you are, but you said this is, we draw a line around Utah, but suppose the driver who was insured by State Farm was from California, or from New York, where you get more than seven incidents out of 14 years?"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,695.492,700.296,"--But the question here was, was there a bad faith failure to settle?"
2002.01-1289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,722.579,728.93,"Well then, then you have no concern with punishing for acts that took place out of State?"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,728.93,729.844,"No, I--"
2002.01-1289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,729.844,731.958,"You're abandoning that, or--"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,731.958,737.62,--We have not gotten to the ratio of the comparable penalties questions under BMW.
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,740.422,745.843,"--What is similar conduct in BMW, to give some feel for what you mean by similar conduct?"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,745.843,746.323,Exactly what the Court--
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.323,754.685,"Selling cars with scratches on them, or is it selling... what about, you sell cars with defective, knowingly, with defective clutches?"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,755.478,756.208,"--No, it would not."
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.208,759.946,"It would... it has to be cars with scratches, it has to be the same thing?"
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,759.946,760.774,It's the conduct--
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.774,761.13,Wow.
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,761.13,765.03,--It was the conduct that occurred in that case.
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.004,770.057,The car had a scratch.
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,770.057,771.102,--that the car had a--
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.102,775.968,So the only cases that are relevant are other cases where BMW pawned off cars that had scratches?
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,779.087,783.43,"--If you open it up to all kinds of other defects, then you're opening it up--"
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.43,783.726,"You lose, right."
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,783.726,784.856,--You're opening it up--
2002.01-1289,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,809.737,817.482,I thought we had just gotten off the extraterritorial... where you said it wouldn't make any difference if the insured was from California or from Utah.
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,817.482,818.859,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2002.01-1289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,823.799,824.209,Excuse me.
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,827.869,828.481,--Yes.
2002.01-1289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,828.481,829.252,--prong?
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,829.252,832.791,"Under ratio and comparable penalties, Your Honor."
2002.01-1289,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,879.67,881.274,So how do we measure that?
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,886.468,890.594,"--Here, Your Honor, there was a compensatory damage award of a million dollars."
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.787,912.54,"Except that, you know, we say that you can't take into account harm to others, but you can take into account harm to others so long as that is done under the rubric of reprehensibility."
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,912.54,913.128,As long--
2002.01-1289,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.128,916.932,"If you've done the same thing to other people, you can be punished more."
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,933.159,945.684,"--But even if there is a ratio, what reprehensibility does is put you on the continuum of blameworthiness, and this Court has said previously that 4 to 1 is close to the line."
2002.01-1289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.799,986.597,May I just suggest an analogy?
2002.01-1289,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,1021.674,1030.642,"--Could I just first answer this $100 million punitive damage award, because I think that really shows where the Utah Supreme Court is going."
2002.01-1289,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1042.761,1044.135,99 cents?
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1729.461,1743.221,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1289,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1769.8,1771.445,"Well, that was the sole ground of liability, was it not?"
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1771.445,1835.365,"--The sole ground of original liability was objectively unreasonable failure to settle, but phase 2, which was held at the insistence of plaintiffs, who wanted... of the defendants who wanted to bifurcate, phase 2 focused on the question of whether there was an intentional tort, and there was found to be fraud; and the court, the trial court affirmed the judgment partly on the ground of intentional fraud; and the fraud, and it's not a surprise really to the lawyers for the defendants, because they made it clear in their opening statement that they understood the whole theory of this case to be that the insurance policies that were being sold by State Farm, which led people to think that in first and in third party cases the claims adjuster would try to do a reasonably objective job of satisfying the claim if possible, in fact weren't bad at all."
2002.01-1289,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.192,1871.378,"I take it the policy is, pay as little as possible, even if fraud is necessary?"
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1871.378,1873.595,"--And, in fact, it was necessary here."
2002.01-1289,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1876.9,1878.333,"All right, I see that, but what's--"
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1878.333,1889.645,"They made up the fact that... they defamed this dead person and said that he was speeding to meet a pregnant girlfriend, who didn't exist."
2002.01-1289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1924.445,1925.448,--Can I interrupt with a question?
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1925.448,1926.209,Sure.
2002.01-1289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1926.209,1943.611,"I'm sure you're going to get to it, but one can infer... maybe it's not entirely clear... that all of this was established, and there are very, very many, many bad, bad deeds done in all parts of the United States, but that the $145 million is in large part punishment for what was done outside of Utah."
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1943.611,1945.506,"Oh, I don't think so, Justice Stevens."
2002.01-1289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1947.227,1958.621,"The second point that relates to that is that when the Supreme Court of Utah made the comparison to what the criminal penalty might have been, they had to be referring to more than what could have been imposed in Utah."
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1958.621,1959.836,"No, Justice Stevens, what they said was this."
2002.01-1289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.803,1976.654,In Utah?
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1976.654,1987.36,"In Utah, yes, because they didn't draw this fancy distinction between first and third party claims that is being drawn for the convenience of State Farm."
2002.01-1289,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1989.13,1992.942,"That's the basis of the underlying tort, which was the failure... which was the excess."
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1992.942,1994.193,--That was the example--
2002.01-1289,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1994.193,1995.21,Which was the excess.
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1995.21,1995.333,--Justice Kennedy.
2002.01-1289,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2058.658,2063.415,"Of course, companies would have a policy of trying to make as much money as possible."
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2063.415,2064.737,It's not just making as much money--
2002.01-1289,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.737,2066.172,"Well, some companies could add--"
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2066.172,2066.315,--it's stealing.
2002.01-1289,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2066.315,2074.105,"--could add to that, by the way, one way we make money is, we pay out as little as possible and we charge as much as possible."
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2081.429,2081.964,But Justice Breyer--
2002.01-1289,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2081.964,2083.07,There could be such a policy.
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2083.07,2083.427,--Right--
2002.01-1289,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2083.427,2083.809,Now--
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2083.809,2086.918,--and if the policy is sell him a ticket and then turn him away at the door--
2002.01-1289,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2086.918,2088.489,"--Oh, no, no, but by the way--"
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2088.489,2089.313,--pretending to sell him a place--
2002.01-1289,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.313,2132.027,"--it might be that such a policy would even condone doing a lot of bad things to do that, and what's worrying me about permitting that kind of policy to serve as a justification for a $145 million judgment is precisely what I wrote in my concurrence in the BMW case, that the Constitution, indeed the Magna Carta says that you should not take life, liberty, or property without law; and to take 12 people, call them a jury, selected at random, and tell them that they are free to go through the business practices of a company--"
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2132.027,2132.293,--Justice Breyer--
2002.01-1289,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2132.293,2139.924,--to unite them under the name of a policy and then assess $145 million for every bad thing that this jury thinks--
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2139.924,2144.521,"--Justice Breyer, please... I believe in the Magna Carta as much as you do."
2002.01-1289,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2202.974,2214.289,"--Nothing you have said, Mr. Tribe, Professor, persuades me that the jury didn't punish this company for being a bad company quite without reference--"
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2214.289,2214.619,Because of the--
2002.01-1289,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2214.619,2216.498,--to the harm this plaintiff suffered.
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2216.498,2235.784,"--Well, first of all, as to the harm suffered, proposed instruction 40 by State Farm would have told the jury, I think consistent with this Court's jurisprudence and with the history of punitive damages, that they could consider the effect of State Farm's behavior, quote,"
2002.01-1289,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2267.394,2274.537,"Mr. Tribe, maybe fewer, maybe fewer now after a verdict of that size, and isn't that one of the problems?"
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2274.537,2274.686,"--Well, that's the hope."
2002.01-1289,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2274.961,2280.485,Isn't that... now there's an incentive for lawyers to pursue such claims.
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2283.669,2313.469,"--One of the advantages... there may be down sides, but if we prevail, Justice Ginsburg, we're prevailing on a theory that the practice we've identified, which is quite specific, for 20 years of putting these invisible caps that cheat the insured in all kinds of cases throughout the State of Utah, there will no longer be anyone who can recover for those harms, beyond compensatory damages, because the penalty will have been extracted."
2002.01-1289,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2313.469,2315.05,The question that's bothering me--
2002.01-1289,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2315.05,2317.919,--Is that true in New York or Vermont?
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2322.503,2329.445,"I think if they've done this in every State, then they should be exposed to the possibility of punitive damages in other States."
2002.01-1289,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2329.445,2330.063,--So you could multiple that by 50.
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2330.063,2342.904,"Well, you know, it seems to me, if you look at the opinion that was delivered from the bench by the district court after 2 months, in his own words... they accuse us of writing his opinion."
2002.01-1289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.23,2394.957,"Mr. Tribe, you've told me that this is all based on what happened in Utah."
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2403.073,2403.245,--Yes.
2002.01-1289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2403.245,2411.025,"--when they did get into out of State evidence, what proportion, in your judgment, of that evidence related to Utah, and what proportion related to other States?"
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2411.025,2434.91,"I think the overwhelming majority related to Utah, and every time it came in dealing with another State, contrary to what we heard, it was because the door had been opened, and it was specifically found by the trial court that they waived any objection to the testimony in question, despite what we heard about--"
2002.01-1289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2434.91,2438.226,But you're telling me that over half of the evidence related to Utah itself?
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2438.226,2457.261,"--Yes, but let me tell you, Justice Stevens, it was so uniform that the particular examples were picked because they so nicely illustrated the way a particular device like the use of non-OPM parts would interact with the cap that was imposed."
2002.01-1289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2458.467,2464.194,Are they correct in telling us that this... there's only one example of a failure to settle--
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2464.194,2476.539,"--We have no way of knowing, Justice Stevens, because they have erected... the record also shows that since the 1970s, part of their policy of destroying records has included--"
2002.01-1289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2476.539,2477.305,"--Yes, but there must have been a lot of records--"
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2477.305,2478.505,--getting rid of all those records.
2002.01-1289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2478.505,2481.548,--But they didn't destroy all the evidence to have a trial go on this long.
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2481.548,2495.265,"Well, it's because... part of what was said by the trial court was that it took the persistence of a David to bring this particular Goliath to his knees."
2002.01-1289,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2614.555,2616.697,"Well, some people get part of it that weren't hurt at all."
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2616.697,2619.006,--Some lawyers will certainly get part of it.
2002.01-1289,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2619.909,2621.51,I wasn't referring to the lawyers.
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2621.51,2621.973,--I--
2002.01-1289,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2626.223,2629.624,"Well, I was referring to the other people that took an assignment of the claim together with--"
2002.01-1289,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2629.624,2630.774,"--That could be, but--"
2002.01-1289,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2630.774,2651.625,"--I was referring to them, and my problem is that in fact what you have is a system where if you take, let's call it the most evil corporation in the world, and I'm sure there are some such, and they commit a very minor tort in respect to someone, pursuant to their policy of being evil--"
2002.01-1289,2,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,3569.828,3573.745,"Do I have a little time, can I just... left to respond?"
2002.01-1289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3573.745,3574.77,You have about--
2002.01-1289,2,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,3574.77,3576.62,Two minutes?
2002.01-1289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3576.62,3578.426,"--You have, I think, a minute and a half... but let's make it two and a half."
2002.01-1289,2,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,3578.426,3585.053,"Thank you, Your Honor, I appreciate that, because there are certain things that Mr. Tribe said that I think we have to clarify."
2002.01-1289,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3635.072,3637.493,What limiting instruction did you ask for?
2002.01-1289,2,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,3637.493,3650.608,"The only instruction, Your Honor, was the instruction that I previously read to Justice Ginsburg that they should look to the conduct toward the Campbells, and that was the instruction."
2002.01-1289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3687.508,3692.588,Do you disagree with Mr. Tribe's suggestion that over half the evidence related to Utah?
2002.01-1289,2,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,3692.588,3693.317,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.01-1289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3709.282,3712.52,You're saying the Utah evidence was evidence relating to this particular case--
2002.01-1289,2,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,3712.52,3713.198,Absolutely.
2002.01-1289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3713.198,3714.681,--rather than to other Utah policyholders.
2002.01-1289,2,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,3714.681,3721.499,"And if you look at the footnote in their brief, and look at our reply brief, we point out all of that evidence had to do with the underlying case."
2002.01-1289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3753.597,3754.952,"Thank you, Ms. Birnbaum."
2002.01-1289,2,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,3754.952,3755.812,--Thank you so much.
2002.01-1289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3755.812,3757.145,I think we've got your position.
