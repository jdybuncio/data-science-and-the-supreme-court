1968.47,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,34.798,"Number 47, Walter B. Foster, Petitioner versus California."
1968.47,0,33919,kenneth_l_maddy,,36.273,39.432,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,1724.967,1729.48,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2059.161,2074.426,Was there anything about the clothing of this man in the first lineup that would distinguish this man from the others in relation to the crime?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2074.426,2084.447,"No, Your Honor, except for the fact that the petitioner, Mr. Foster had on his own black leather jacket were not asked to try --"
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2084.447,2087.75,That make him that his leather is his own or whose it was.
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2096.46,2101.394,"Well, there was no showing that all of the men were dressed alike in the first lineup."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2114.883,2123.075,"And is that, is that the kind of a jacket that the robbery was supposed to have had owned?"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2123.075,2124.914,"Yes, underneath the coverall."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2124.914,2126.559,"Yes, but it was observed before --"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2126.559,2126.612,"Yes, --"
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2126.612,2127.411,-- at the time of the robbery?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2127.411,2128.294,-- by Mr. David.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2128.294,2130.76,"Yes, did any of the others have on such a coat."
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2130.76,2138.35,"No, neither the coat nor doesn't show that they had on the coats or jacket."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2138.35,2142.657,"What was the relationship of size to these men, four men?"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2142.657,2144.579,The three -- there were three men involved.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2173.332,2174.79,What city jail was that?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2174.79,2175.796,Fresno.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2175.796,2179.556,"Fresno, rather large jail, isn't it?"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2179.556,2182.252,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2182.252,2184.67,"Well, it's the size of community."
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2184.67,2195.305,Well that's true it's larger than some but it is not really Metropolitan area of California.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2233.987,2238.218,"Now, where do we find that tentative identification that you've just mentioned?"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2238.218,2242.7,"That is on page of the appendix, page 33."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2242.7,2243.559,43?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2243.559,2244.333,33.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2244.333,2252.271,33 and let's see just what it did say.
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2255.548,2258.317,We are talking Mr. David's testimony at the trial.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2258.317,2258.526,Yes.
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2258.526,2259.906,As to this.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2259.906,2265.235,"Yes, now the tentative lineup that -- or tentative identification that's what I want to --"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2265.235,2267.168,That was (a) 33.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2267.168,2270.581,And where -- what is the language?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2270.581,2277.641,"That was what I read at the beginning, Your Honor, I didn't specifically say that “This is the man.”"
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2278.69,2280.599,I see.
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2280.599,2286.786,And that is the position that Mr. David has taken through the course of this.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2399.196,2405.11,Was there any distinction as to dress or size of these particular men?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2405.11,2406.936,Not in this lineup.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2406.936,2407.459,I beg your pardon?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2407.459,2411.052,"Not in this lineup, Your Honor."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2469.556,2485.361,Why would you think he would fail on this first lineup after he took another good hard look at them and then talked to them and then seven days later when they put him in another one he identified him now?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2485.361,2498.499,I think the man was extremely cautious individual that he was wanted to be absolutely certain in his own mind that he was accusing the right man.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2647.533,2662.261,"May I ask, Ms. Maier at the second lineup was his co-defendant of the petitioner present when Mr. David made the identification?"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2662.261,2662.98,Yes.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2662.98,2664.345,They were both there together?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2664.345,2676.597,"He did not identify Mr. Grice, the co-defendant because Mr. Grice had been the driver of the getaway car he had never entered the establishment."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2676.597,2677.028,I see.
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2677.028,2687.695,"There were three individuals participating in the robbery, Mr. Clay and Mr. Foster who were the two robbers who had entered the Western Union office and participated in the robbery."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2712.87,2723.743,When with the relation to the first lineup did the co-defendant of this petitioner make his confession?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2725.729,2728.755,"The record is not clear in that, Your Honor."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2737.327,2741.787,Very well.
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2741.787,2757.281,We submit that in this case the petitioner has not won verdict of proving that they're aware of violation of his constitutional rights in the conduct of this lineup.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2837.707,2843.964,What standard do you think this Court set up in Chapman?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2843.964,2867.805,The standard of the error must be such that the Court could say beyond the reasonable doubt that the judgment would have been had other than the -- whether it's a particular evidence to particular error had been committed that notwithstanding this error.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2867.805,2889.328,"Now in this case trying it according to California -- the California rule, what corroborating evidence was there of the co-defendant, that would go to make this as a stand in verdict beyond in the exclusion of a reasonable doubt."
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2889.328,2896.333,I believe you have not alone the testimony of the accomplice plus the corroboration of the description.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2958.173,2960.805,"Well, I'd like to know just what that corroboration is."
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2974.029,2977.594,"Well, you have the testimony of the victim --"
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2977.594,2977.86,The victim?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2977.86,2982.599,That as to the corpus delicti the elements of the offense of robbery.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2993.618,2998.488,"Well, it has to be -- there has to be corroboration over and beyond the corps delicti always?"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2998.488,2999.074,That's correct.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2999.074,2999.324,That's correct.
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,2999.324,2999.898,As to --
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2999.898,3008.598,"Now, what is the -- what is there beyond the corpus delicti that attaches itself directly to this petitioner?"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3008.598,3018.246,The identification of the clothing worn by one of the robbers which was petitioner at the time of the (Inaudible).
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3032.761,3036.034,What was that that was distinctive of this?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3036.034,3044.498,"The coverall, the hat with the brim turned down, the black leather jacket showing out from underneath this coverall, the grayish-white shoes."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3049.711,3051.72,"Well, let's leave out the accomplice."
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3055.562,3060.167,"Well, that's what -- it was I believe, Your Honor that the description --"
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3060.167,3060.647,Yes.
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3060.647,3062.381,-- of the clothing.
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3062.381,3064.929,"And that clothing was in the Court, was it?"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3064.929,3068.308,"That was not introduced as an exhibit, Your Honor."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3068.308,3069.274,"Well, how do you apply --"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3069.274,3069.697,It was testimony --
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3069.697,3072.602,How do you apply that to this petitioner?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3072.602,3078.666,"Well, this testimony came in through the testimony of Mr. David."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3078.666,3092.405,"Well, I know but assuming that Mr. David's testimony is out by reason of then, an unconstitutional identification, what corroborating evidence is there?"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3092.405,3104.184,"Well, if -- Your Honor, Mr. David's testimony only because of his testimony with relation to the evidence developed that the lineups would be out."
1968.47,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3129.145,3131.591,You mean to what he testified he saw and heard --
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3131.591,3132.741,At the scene of the --
1968.47,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3132.741,3133.132,-- at the scene of the crime?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3133.132,3138.944,Scene of the crime.
1968.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3138.944,3154.253,"Perhaps, at least to my mind, we could test out -- test this out by -- if I could ask you what corroboration was they would respect to Mr. Grice, the man was acquitted by the jury?"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3154.253,3157.862,The only corroboration that would have been in the record --
1968.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3157.862,3162.648,Mr. Grice according to his testimony sat in the automobile and never run into the Western Union office.
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3162.648,3175.339,He was the one -- he was only living in the same building with or next door to Mr. Foster in the room.
1968.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3197.274,3200.715,"Well, that's certain -- that certainly wasn't proved against him?"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3200.715,3203.073,No.
1968.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3203.073,3203.094,So?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3203.094,3204.641,But that was the corroboration as this --
1968.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3204.641,3205.792,It was very thin in other words.
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3205.792,3208.308,"Very, very thin."
1968.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3208.308,3208.469,Questionable under --
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3208.469,3214.077,And that there was a question -- it was -- the judge left it as a question of fact to the jury.
1968.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3214.077,3214.848,Oh!
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3218.322,3219.321,Whether there was sufficient --
1968.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3219.321,3220.732,-- the accomplice testimony.
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3220.732,3221.934,Clay's testimony --
1968.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3221.934,3222.508,Clay and that's all.
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3222.508,3228.973,Clay was -- the jury was advised that Clay was an accomplice as a matter of law and that his testimony must be corroborated.
1968.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3228.973,3230.799,Yes.
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3230.799,3237.15,Therefore the question was as to Grice whether there was sufficient corroboration in the jury's mind.
1968.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3237.15,3238.922,And you say the only corroboratory --
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3238.922,3240.202,The only evidence that would have really it had as to --
1968.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3240.202,3242.956,-- evidence was the fact he had live nearby in the apartment?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3242.956,3250.768,"Yes, with Foster."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3342.625,3346.768,"Well, what is that to do so far as this case is concerned?"
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3346.768,3347.627,"Well, this Your Honor --"
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3347.627,3350.858,Should we would apply that on the record are we not as we have it?
1968.47,1,21269,doris_h_maier,,3350.858,3367.742,"But that is correct, Your Honor but we are referring in this to the effect on this case where the question in the primary question is the identification of petitioner."
1968.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3406.886,3407.742,Mr. Maddy.
1968.47,2,33919,kenneth_l_maddy,,3407.742,3409.98,"May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3571.368,3581.23,"Mr. Maddy, before you sit down I would just like to say to you that the Court appreciates your representation of this indigent defendant."
