2012.11-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.237,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1059, Genesis HealthCare v. Symczyk."
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,6.837,10.772,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,31.269,45.045,"Did that offer include admission of liability, or was it just that it was going to pay the amount of damages requested?"
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,45.045,47.228,"That's a good question, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-1059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,67.891,78.516,"So if -- if there were judgment of liability, then that would be preclusive for all other people similarly situated?"
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,78.516,83.42,"Well, I think there is rules of issuing claim conclusion that would flow from the judgment, and it would have--"
2012.11-1059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,83.42,97.494,"Well, that -- so the next case is another employee who claims uncompensated work time, and that's brought on behalf of similarly situated people."
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,106.183,111.718,"--Well, there would be a variety of fact questions that would have to be resolved to determine the extent of the preclusion from the first judgment."
2012.11-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,139.538,153.997,"Counsel, so what am I to make of your transmittal letter which says, in the offer itself, that -- JA 5556, that Petitioners make clear that the offer of judgment, quote,"
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,165.305,166.305,"--Well, let me--"
2012.11-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,166.305,173.142,--when you're now claiming that you would have accepted a judgment of liability?
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,173.142,178.927,"--Well, I don't think that you have to rely on my statements here to say that we would have accepted judgment of liability at that time."
2012.11-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,200.673,202.458,"How did you pick the $7,500?"
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,202.458,206.744,That's detailed later in the joint appendix at pages 77 to 79.
2012.11-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,220.836,228.859,I see in the -- in the FLSA that it also requires an amount for liquidated damages.
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,230.242,232.244,"--Yes, your Honor -- yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,232.244,262.246,"Counsel, what if the district court -- this proceeding -- you filed the suggestion of -- of mootness, whatever, and the judge says, okay, I have this suggestion of mootness; I also want to address the certification issue; the mootness argument is scheduled for three months down the road, the certification issue for two months down the road; isn't this just a question of what order the district court wants to address these two issues?"
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,262.246,262.513,Okay.
2012.11-1059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,298.586,303.657,It was not possible for anything to be done about the certification because you moved immediately.
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,313.113,321.719,"--Well, I think there is two questions to unpack here that -- that are implicit in both what the Chief Justice is commenting on and what you're commenting on, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,352.69,369.516,"Well, it seems as though it's more than housekeeping issue that's involved here because -- I mean, I realize that you have an argument about what happens when the plaintiff's individual claims have been fully satisfied, but the plaintiff continues to want to represent other individuals."
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,387.929,389.046,--Okay.
2012.11-1059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,423.519,440.212,"But there is nothing in Rule 68 -- you're basing the -- your position on a rule that provides as the only sanction if the plaintiff continues and gets less than the offer of proof, then the plaintiff has to pay the costs."
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,446.183,451.17,"--Well, I don't think our position depends on Rule 68 at all for the mootness."
2012.11-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,461.525,463.191,Let me ask you this--
2012.11-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,463.191,463.958,Justice Kennedy.
2012.11-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,463.958,465.643,--Let me ask you just this question.
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,487.39,488.092,--There's--
2012.11-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,488.092,497.298,"--It may be that it's common practice, if the plaintiff doesn't reply and there's an offer that's filed with the court, the court says, I haven't heard anything, I'm going to enter judgment."
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,497.298,510.422,"--I think -- I think that the courts of appeals have taken a variety of approaches to what I'm characterizing as a housekeeping question of, if there's no further controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant how do we move the case off our docket?"
2012.11-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,515.593,518.028,"As a matter of housekeeping, you could--"
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,518.028,520.814,In favor of the plaintiff -- you enter a judgment in favor of the plaintiff -- that needs to be clear -- in favor of the plaintiff--
2012.11-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,520.814,521.23,--Right.
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,521.23,525.031,"--Whether they want a judgment or not, you say: Here's everything you asked for; you must take it."
2012.11-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,534.137,540.541,"Here is what the Court said last in Knox last year, when it said: “ What makes a case moot ”?"
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,570.829,573.095,"Okay, so let -- let me respond to that."
2012.11-1059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,662.553,678.598,What do you do when -- when you have a governing statute that says that an employee may bring suit for and in behalf of himself and other employees similarly situated?
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,709.801,720.423,"I think that the language of the statute, section 216(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, provides compelling guidance for the case that the court of appeals ignored."
2012.11-1059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,749.49,751.525,"Yes, but you have to give the plaintiff an opportunity."
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,751.525,764.952,"--The statute does not say, if a plaintiff files a case and alleges that other people are similarly situated, the case shall not be dismissed until the court has proceeded to conclusively determine the propriety of certification."
2012.11-1059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,765.485,808.545,"Suppose -- suppose the plaintiff had simultaneously with the filing of the complaint moved to have it preliminarily certified as on behalf of other employees situated; so, instead of having the complaint, which was labelled a collective complaint, separate from a motion for certification, they came together; that the plaintiff filed a complaint and immediately filed a motion for certification and a request to discover the names of other people similarly situated."
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,808.545,813.747,I think the answer to that would flow directly from this Court's decision in Geraghty.
2012.11-1059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,839.497,840.714,So your answer is it wouldn't make any difference.
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,840.714,841.682,--It wouldn't make any difference.
2012.11-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,876.689,892.115,"Counsel, I don't know that you've answered my question sometime ago, but what -- if the judge can simply order the two determinations in a way that certification is addressed before mootness, does that take care of your problem?"
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,902.305,906.507,I think that -- that those cases provide a way to analyze that situation.
2012.11-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,920.498,921.683,"Well, there's no doubt that--"
2012.11-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,921.683,922.133,"Counsel, I have--"
2012.11-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,922.133,922.917,--I'm sorry.
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,926.219,927.67,--There is doubt in that case.
2012.11-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,974.734,975.451,"Well, what do you--"
2012.11-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,975.451,979.519,"--Counsel, can I ask a fundamental question under Rule 68?"
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1003.921,1004.821,--So again--
2012.11-1059,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1004.821,1014.542,--especially when the statute gives the plaintiff an absolute statutory right to refuse it at a specific penalty?
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1022.446,1022.912,--Okay.
2012.11-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1051.715,1064.891,"This makes no sense to me because if the offer is for judgment, it has to be proof of validity and amount, because at least you have -- you should be able to get a judgment."
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1064.891,1071.212,"--Well, I think that the offer is not being admitted to prove the validity of the plaintiff's claim or the amount of the plaintiff's claim."
2012.11-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1073.581,1080.501,But didn't you just tell me that an offer results in an admission of liability and a judgment for a particular amount?
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1080.501,1090.257,"--If the plaintiff accepts the offer, then the district judge will enter offer -- will enter judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of the offer."
2012.11-1059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1110.52,1130.084,"Mr. Mann, could I come back to your response to the question of Knox, the statement in Knox that -- you know, where the court can issue -- can provide no relief, there is -- there is no standing."
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1182.533,1184.235,"I think that's correct, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1059,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1213.087,1213.671,"But, Mr. Mann--"
2012.11-1059,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1213.671,1215.504,Can I ask this question?
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1227.145,1228.931,We think that's the appropriate response.
2012.11-1059,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1246.308,1248.642,But where -- where does it say that in Rule 68?
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1248.642,1251.61,--The proceeding isn't under Rule 68.
2012.11-1059,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1251.61,1252.546,What is it under?
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1252.546,1258.616,The proceeding is under Rule 12(b) as a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction because the case is moot.
2012.11-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1263.768,1268.822,Your offer says you hereby offer to allow entry of judgment under Rule 68.
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1268.822,1273.393,--But we don't think that the mootness of the case flows from Rule 68.
2012.11-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1279.446,1284.415,"But the question from Justice Alito was, what happens; does the court have authority to have a hearing?"
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1284.415,1285.583,But the court--
2012.11-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1285.583,1292.021,"And you said, oh, well, this is not under Rule 68; but, you offered to allow entry of judgment under Rule 68."
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1298.841,1302.395,"--Well, because the plaintiff didn't accept the offer."
2012.11-1059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1335.283,1336.9,Was there attorney's fees in that offer?
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1338.318,1338.752,Yes.
2012.11-1059,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1346.758,1352.126,"This, I take it, is a statutory case, not a constitutional case."
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1389.668,1393.137,"--Well, I think there could be constitutional objections depending on the details of the statute--"
2012.11-1059,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.137,1393.739,"No, no, no."
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1415.818,1422.489,--I think the constitutional issues that proposals like that might raise would flow from the decision in Vermont Agency.
2012.11-1059,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1426.091,1455.377,"Oh, we know at least, since we are doing -- I looked up a little bit, but Article III is what was a case or controversy in Westminster in 1788 or 1750 or whenever, that in Westminster, in a court of equity, I found at least two instances, a person dies, there is no case with that person, but it remained in equity on the docket until the other person, the estate, came in."
2012.11-1059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1487.831,1488.366,Equity is wonderful.
2012.11-1059,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1488.366,1489.016,--What?
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1509.863,1514.815,--I think the problem is in that case there is an identifiable person to substitute.
2012.11-1059,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1518.801,1519.035,"No, no."
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1522.253,1534.911,"--The problem in this type of case would be that the Federal proceeding would be moving along for a substantial period of time with no plaintiffs, and the district judge's role would be simply to assist the plaintiff in trying to find -- plaintiff's counsel in trying to find new plaintiffs."
2012.11-1059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1534.911,1545.286,I'll bet you equity could have considered the husband to have been substituted automatically and could have been considered the estate to have been substituted automatically.
2012.11-1059,0,40038,ronald_mann,,1560.462,1563.664,"On that note, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time."
2012.11-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1563.664,1566.532,"--Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1569.984,1574.286,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1592.064,1595.266,I'd like to begin with the question of whether or not you waived that argument.
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1595.266,1596.635,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2012.11-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1596.635,1600.254,No -- did you waive it or not?
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1600.254,1603.955,We did not waive -- we did not waive the -- we did not waive it.
2012.11-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1654.888,1668.564,"Well, that was not the way the case was presented in the body of the petition and I would suppose, if that were your objection, that it wasn't received, wasn't accepted, we might have heard about that, as you suggest."
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1668.564,1669.264,And--
2012.11-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1669.264,1678.187,"And if in fact we thought we were dealing with a case in which the Rule 68 offer was not accepted, we might have thought differently about whether to grant it."
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1678.187,1680.789,"--I completely understand that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-1059,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1706.473,1708.123,"I have a question for you, counsel."
2012.11-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1708.123,1709.491,You rely on the question presented.
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1713.177,1724.4,"--It does have the unaccepted offer feature in the question, and of course this Court's decision in Bray does say that it is the question presented as the Court -- as the Court granted it, that controls."
2012.11-1059,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1724.4,1729.971,"Counsel, there is -- from the beginning, you never accepted the offer."
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1729.971,1731.971,"That's exactly right, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-1059,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1731.971,1740.76,What you appear to have conceded and -- is that the amount of the offer would settle your personal claim.
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1740.76,1743.712,I don't quite think we conceded even that.
2012.11-1059,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1763.043,1770.596,"What do you think the court should do in that circumstance, where a defendant comes forward and says, I'm willing to satisfy the entire claim?"
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1771.915,1782.773,"We think that, just like the Solicitor General, we think that in that circumstance it is possible for the court to enter a default judgment and force relief upon the plaintiff."
2012.11-1059,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1783.206,1786.225,Is this under Rule 68 or is this under some inherent authority?
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1786.225,1792.795,--I think it could work either way so long as the forcing happened within the time period of Rule 68.
2012.11-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1816.844,1820.212,"What, what benefit does this -- why are you arguing so much?"
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1839.026,1840.643,"For two reasons, Your Honor."
2012.11-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1846.446,1846.863,"Well, I know."
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1862.225,1870.129,"And I think it goes back to what then-Justice Rehnquist said in Roper, because what he said is it's not then just about the individual plaintiff."
2012.11-1059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.972,1887.69,"Well, it undermines the collective aspect if she never brings the suit in the first place."
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1915.36,1927.75,"Justice Scalia, we think that the Congress has answered that question at least in 216(b) by providing for both the opportunity to file a complaint on her own behalf, as well as for those that are similarly situated."
2012.11-1059,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1951.033,1963.691,"Mr. Katyal, I'm a little troubled that you have given up or argue that the ability to enter a forced judgment is permissible under Rule 68."
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2004.251,2005.051,Exactly.
2012.11-1059,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2005.051,2005.751,All right.
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2005.751,2006.168,That's precisely right.
2012.11-1059,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2006.168,2024.664,"Let's go from there, at least with me, and that may answer an earlier question about an inquest on damages, because that is a part of the requirements for a default judgment, so that if there is a dispute about damages that can be resolved."
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2055.783,2066.658,"So we think that the corpus of cases that this Court has handled in the class action area such as Geraghty and Gerstein and the like, we don't think that they absolutely control this question."
2012.11-1059,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2105.449,2127.28,"Well, you don't accept the argument that I suggested, that is Rule 16 -- 216, the Fair Labor Standards Act, in saying that you can commence a suit on behalf of others similarly situated, and implicit in that is that there be some decent interval for you to find similarly-situated people?"
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2127.28,2131.183,We absolutely agree with that and we think that's precisely the problem.
2012.11-1059,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2159.501,2167.457,Why didn't -- why didn't you file the motion for certification along with the complaint?
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2167.457,2176.795,"Because the text of 216(b) provides for two different processes, both the filing of the complaint and then a subsequent opt-in process."
2012.11-1059,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2194.441,2202.963,"But you could have done that with the complaint and I don't -- you say you want to get joiners, so why do you have to wait?"
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2216.622,2218.356,"--Your Honor, that is what we did."
2012.11-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2237.018,2242.588,It doesn't matter in terms of what the judge is supposed to do with your motion to certify if nobody else is in the case?
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2252.212,2257.949,"That's precisely, Mr. Chief Justice, why we think the Seventh Circuit rule doesn't make much sense."
2012.11-1059,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.668,2321.274,"Well, you're interpreting -- I think it's true that we're interpreting the statute, and -- and I'm trying to look at what document are we interpreting?"
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2348.274,2348.657,Right.
2012.11-1059,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2360.982,2373.741,"Well, he says the difference in the class action context is, in the class action context you can consider them there, but there isn't a specific sentence somewhere in a statute which says no one shall be a party unless he signs in writing."
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2373.741,2396.255,"--Your Honor, I think nothing turns on their designation as party status or not; rather, the relation-back doctrine, to the extent the Court wants to get into it and deem this offer where we got nothing, somehow they want to deem it against us, but if it does, and wants to get into the relation-back doctrine, I think it would find that it is based on the idea that the cases would otherwise go away, and that you need a bridge plaintiff."
2012.11-1059,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2396.255,2396.774,"Well, why?"
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2397.124,2397.874,And it's a very important reason--
2012.11-1059,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.874,2398.89,Because that's -- why?
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2399.974,2416.002,"--The reason for that goes back to this Court's decision in Flast -- in Flast, in which it said that in the kinds of cases we're talking about here, it's not as if we're risking a merits judgment in which relief is going to be imposed against one party and possibly trench on the separation of powers."
2012.11-1059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2440.117,2454.811,"It -- it's hard for me to accept the relation-back doctrine for your purposes when -- when it's clear under the statute that if parties come in beyond the statute of limitations period, they're not in."
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2461.197,2464.832,"It -- for purposes of the statute of limitations, exactly."
2012.11-1059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.832,2471.088,For purposes of the statute of -- so you want one relation-back doctrine for the statute and a different one for what we're discussing here.
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2471.088,2471.972,Absolutely.
2012.11-1059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.738,2473.654,I know you do.
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2473.654,2478.19,"--And -- and, Justice Scalia, we think that that statute of limitations argument cuts the other way."
2012.11-1059,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2528.373,2536.894,"Mr. Katyal, if we do get to the question that Mr. Mann wants us to raise, you spend a lot of time talking about McLaughlin and talking about Gerstein."
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2544.684,2549.119,"We think that it is a difference, but we don't think it's enough to change this."
2012.11-1059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2593.364,2602.137,Do we take this case on the premise that you would have objected if a judgment had been entered in your favor for the full amount plus attorney's fees?
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2602.137,2602.937,I think you should.
2012.11-1059,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2653.737,2655.189,If I were to -- I'm sorry.
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2670.881,2671.398,--Sure.
2012.11-1059,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2671.398,2672.114,Should I -- yes.
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2672.114,2694.48,"I think that the best way to think about it is the -- the category of cases from Geraghty, Gerstein and Swisher suggest that if the -- if you wanted to hold that offer against us, that you would then say, as Judge Sirica did, the relation-back doctrine looks similar enough to the 216(b) context in this specific area."
2012.11-1059,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2700.55,2709.839,"Well, should I assume that this is the same -- the case would then be the same as if a default judgment had been entered in your favor for that amount?"
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2709.839,2719.595,"I think -- well, it's hard to know how you'd hold that offer against us in that -- and the way in which you did so, I think, informs that second question."
2012.11-1059,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2745.346,2752.935,"--to get the point -- the Court had to evaluate whether the offer actually met your personal damages claim, too."
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2752.935,2754.635,"Oh, absolutely, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-1059,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2754.635,2755.051,And what you're saying--
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2755.051,2755.885,We were proceeding on the hypothetical.
2012.11-1059,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2755.885,2757.92,--in those pages is the Court didn't even do that.
2012.11-1059,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2757.92,2758.453,Exactly.
2012.11-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2780.35,2781.785,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2784.018,2802.116,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2830.183,2841.841,"How does that differ from an employee who says -- he is annoyed for a variety of reasons at the employer and he sues the employer for his pay, for his pay for the month of October."
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2855.5,2862.67,"Well, if you're -- you're -- I'm not sure what the injury would be in that case."
2012.11-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2862.67,2862.954,Okay.
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2868.308,2869.724,"Well, there's a difference--"
2012.11-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2869.724,2870.526,"And he says: Oh, I didn't cash it."
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2870.526,2882.401,"--This -- this I think speaks somewhat to Justice Scalia's point earlier on, which is there -- there are three elements to Article III standing and it also carries through a bit to mootness."
2012.11-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2896.91,2905.183,"Now we have a case if the employer for some reason, a mistake in bookkeeping or something, didn't send the check on time, so it arrived 3 days late."
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2910.285,2917.157,"--Well, if there is a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act -- and I'm not sure that that would be a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act--"
2012.11-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2917.157,2917.641,"No, no."
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2925.395,2930.982,"--Well, if there is a breach of a contract, that is an injury."
2012.11-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2932.667,2935.869,Even though the -- the employer gave him the paycheck.
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2938.487,2941.022,"--If I can just finish, I think it is a past injury."
2012.11-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2957.116,2957.582,I'm not sure I understand.
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2974.561,2975.828,"Well, no."
2012.11-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2990.789,2993.155,"--Well, you would also have what's usually known as no injury."
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2993.155,3000.311,"Well, again, I think it's important to distinguish between injury and something that redresses an injury."
2012.11-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3010.167,3019.457,"So you think a court has to go through the whole process of a trial if the check is a day late and the employer says, I'm sorry, here's, you know, whatever the interest is on the check?"
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3019.457,3020.308,"--No, certainly not."
2012.11-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3041.055,3041.538,I'm sorry.
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3043.924,3045.107,The court can simply enter judgment.
2012.11-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3060.933,3061.349,--Yes.
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3061.349,3063.551,--or I just give up on the merits--
2012.11-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3063.551,3065.353,Or the plaintiff says no -- no standing.
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3065.353,3067.203,"--Well, no."
2012.11-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3077.978,3081.697,"And -- and, as we've said, at every stage of the litigation."
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3081.697,3082.299,Right.
2012.11-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3100.51,3111.616,"So if you're due -- if you're due $100 from your employer, it's a day late, he gives you $100, and he says, well, here's another dollar for interest, that, as you said, doesn't eliminate the past injury?"
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3111.616,3113.451,--It doesn't eliminate the injury.
2012.11-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3202.274,3220.419,"Mr. Yang, would -- would you continue with what you started speaking to, issue preclusion, because I'm -- I'm also -- I think it's questionable whether there would be issue preclusion on the basis of a judgment issued with the concession of the defendant."
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3220.419,3220.854,--Yeah.
2012.11-1059,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3269.167,3275.553,"So, Mr. Yang, do you think it would be -- I -- I mean, I take the point completely that judgment was rendered against the wrong party here."
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3288.996,3289.38,--Right.
2012.11-1059,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3289.38,3292.098,--do you think that that would be an abuse of the court's discretion?
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3298.852,3306.606,"In the context of a collective action, yes, because of the congressional policy that gives plaintiffs a right to proceed collectively."
2012.11-1059,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3383.922,3402.466,"But what you're talking about is imputing into this process a fairness hearing, essentially, to see, by the district court, to determine whether this is a quirky case where you entered a judgment and you don't need collective action or whether or not this is a genuine case that requires joining plaintiffs."
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3402.466,3403.683,May I answer the question?
2012.11-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3403.683,3404.033,Certainly.
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3404.033,3406.002,I don't think it's a fairness hearing.
2012.11-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.047,3423.547,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1059,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3423.547,3424.08,Thank you.
2012.11-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3424.08,3425.947,"Mr. Mann, you have four minutes remaining."
2012.11-1059,3,40038,ronald_mann,,3425.947,3429.284,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1059,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3481.484,3481.834,All right.
2012.11-1059,3,40038,ronald_mann,,3502.347,3506.249,"--Well, that leads me to the second point I wanted to make, which is exactly what is the constitutional problem."
2012.11-1059,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3543.524,3553.48,"Mr. Mann, if this is -- if what Mr. Yang just told us is so, then there would be no issue preclusion because there has been no adjudication of anything."
2012.11-1059,3,40038,ronald_mann,,3596.842,3599.044,--So I spoke unartfully before.
2012.11-1059,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3612.051,3613.553,But there is nothing litigated when you have--
2012.11-1059,3,40038,ronald_mann,,3613.553,3617.172,--Claim preclusion is going to apply because there's a judgment by--
2012.11-1059,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3617.172,3623.242,"--Claim preclusion, but the claim is, for this period of time I wasn't given the compensation."
2012.11-1059,3,40038,ronald_mann,,3624.559,3625.361,--But it is--
2012.11-1059,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3625.361,3628.061,"And then there is another period of time, and there is no issue preclusion."
2012.11-1059,3,40038,ronald_mann,,3628.061,3633.098,"--But in this particular case, there's no further dispute likely to occur between these parties."
2012.11-1059,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3681.745,3682.745,"Thank you, counsel."
