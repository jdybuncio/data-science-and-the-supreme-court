2002.01-1269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.796,"We'll hear argument next in Number 01-1269, the City of Cuyahoga Falls versus Buckeye Community Hope Foundation."
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,52.555,55.499,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1269,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.372,126.34,There's no evidence of some kind of misbehavior on the part of the city other than the bare claim that they refused to issue the permit during the process of the referendum?
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,126.34,127.553,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-1269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,144.618,152.866,"Wasn't there some evidence that some city official was... sought to delay the proceedings for a period of time, not... not officially."
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,158.466,174.759,"Justice Stevens, prior to the city council voting on the... the ordinance to approve the project, there was a lot of public debate, and in that public debate, there were city officials who said we... we need to take time to hear the citizens... citizens' concerns."
2002.01-1269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,181.68,188.969,"Supposing one of those comments said we should fight this because we don't want African-Americans to... to move where they're going to move, would that make any difference?"
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,188.969,190.768,It... it could make a difference.
2002.01-1269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,190.768,199.237,"Because even... if that had happened, it would still be true, as you pointed out earlier, that every official action taken by the city was favorable to the... your opponents."
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,199.237,211.347,"Well, if... if the actions were taken favorably to the opponents, it couldn't make a difference because at that point the alleged statement wouldn't have any connection to an adverse action."
2002.01-1269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,224.578,225.456,So what... I'm trying to be sure I understand.
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,242.25,243.16,--That... that's correct.
2002.01-1269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,243.16,249.918,"--So that really, we don't have to try and draw... to decide whether or not inferences of improper motive can be drawn from those statements."
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,249.918,256.557,"That's correct because in this case, all of the city's actions either favored the project or non-discretionary actions."
2002.01-1269,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,256.557,287.887,"Now, what if the city had taken the same official action that it took in this case, and every official action either favored or was at least neutral, and yet the city officials went out and... and whipped up, in effect, anti-black sentiment and... and urged the filing of the application for the referendum, would the answer... would the... would the result be the same, that... that there would be no way that the city could be held liable?"
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,287.887,292.649,The short answer to that question is the answer would be the same.
2002.01-1269,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,311.258,326.661,"But isn't the... isn't the delay simply a... even the delay in... in an instance in which the ordinance is defeated simply a lesser degree of damage, but which would, nonetheless, be... be subject to a claim?"
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,326.661,328.43,And the answer to that is no.
2002.01-1269,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,339.062,353.016,"Well, it... there's... there's no question that it... it would, but is... is the... is either the... the statute in question here or the Equal Protection Clause blind to an obvious reason for the delay?"
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,370.751,374.851,"--Well, it's a different case, but it's not different outcome here, and the--"
2002.01-1269,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,374.851,376.422,Why shouldn't it be a different outcome?
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,376.422,392.862,"--Well, because under Monell and its progeny, as well as this Court's State action cases, the municipality can be held liable only in damages only if the city... an official with the authority to authorize it has authorized the discriminatory action that you're talking about."
2002.01-1269,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,403.493,406.508,"Well, the mechanism... the mechanism is provided by the city charter."
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,446.168,450.361,"No, because they wouldn't have the authority to do that."
2002.01-1269,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,466.679,467.181,But not--
2002.01-1269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,467.181,476.372,"--Well, supposing, Mr. Nager, that you have, say, a... say, a seven-member city council and it's confronted with a project like this."
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,493.987,495.144,"Well, it shouldn't."
2002.01-1269,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.646,509.157,What if the vote was four to three?
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,509.157,513.037,--Four... if it was four to three in favor of the housing project--
2002.01-1269,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.037,513.212,No.
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,514.133,523.69,"--If... if they had discretionary power, and four of them exercised their discretionary power against the housing project on the basis of racially discriminatory--"
2002.01-1269,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.69,526.929,"Well, only one had the racially discriminatory motive, one of the four."
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,526.929,527.424,--Well--
2002.01-1269,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,527.424,528.991,The other three did it on the merits.
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,528.991,544.684,"--I think there, there would be a good argument that they would still... that... that the plaintiffs would have... would have satisfied their burden of showing but for the racially discriminatory motive, that the housing project would have been approved."
2002.01-1269,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.372,557.27,"And your difference in the two cases is, one, you have an official action taken."
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,611.483,612.781,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.01-1269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,646.096,652.113,"Mr. Nager, I think... I understand your argument as it applies to the city, but am I correct that the mayor is an individual defendant in this case?"
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,652.113,652.832,--He was.
2002.01-1269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,665.974,667.298,But... but wasn't that reversed by the Sixth Circuit?
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,667.298,668.052,"--No, it wasn't."
2002.01-1269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,670.381,671.856,Why is he a petitioner then?
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,671.856,673.754,He's only here in his official capacity.
2002.01-1269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,676.694,677.003,I see.
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,679.852,681.753,"No, not... not--"
2002.01-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,681.753,681.983,Is... is the--
2002.01-1269,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,681.983,691.684,"--I'd like to ask a question, which is these have been very interesting hypotheticals, but are you going to have time to talk about the questions that we granted cert on?"
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,691.684,692.082,--Well--
2002.01-1269,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,692.082,697.99,And I'm interested... what we have in front of us now at this point as issues.
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,697.99,712.733,--The issue that you have before us is the Sixth Circuit's judgment is... is... because under the Sixth Circuit's view there was allegedly evidence of racial bias among the citizens that the municipality could be... somehow be held liable for that.
2002.01-1269,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.708,736.793,Arguably the discriminatory animus on the part of the citizens could invalidate the referendum.
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,736.793,742.498,"--If it was voted on and put into effect, the alleged animus--"
2002.01-1269,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,742.498,742.654,No.
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,764.83,767.409,"--That... that is correct, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-1269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.213,806.803,You're... you're talking about people who vote in a referendum?
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,806.803,816.182,"Well, the... the question is if there's a final product, was the... the final law, was that racially motivated--"
2002.01-1269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,816.182,823.622,"But we... we've never said... we've never tried to examine the motives of... of the citizenry who vote in a referendum on that sort of question, have we?"
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,823.622,827.323,"--No, you haven't, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-1269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,849.065,851.457,"But Arlington Heights was a city council, or--"
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,851.457,851.947,That's correct.
2002.01-1269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,851.947,852.573,--was it not?
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,852.573,853.135,That's correct.
2002.01-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,853.135,853.779,What... what is--
2002.01-1269,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,853.779,856.333,--And here the referendum failed.
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,856.333,863.991,"That... well, the... we don't know the outcome because the respondents asked for the final vote not to be certified."
2002.01-1269,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,881.806,889.797,Did... did the city have discretion here to go ahead and issue building permits while the referendum process was pending?
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,889.797,890.702,"No, it didn't."
2002.01-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,903.54,907.363,So what is the claim in your opinion that we are reviewing?
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,918.226,918.886,Correct.
2002.01-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,918.886,922.142,"What, in your opinion, is the claim that they're reviewing?"
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,951.599,954.356,"Well, the... the Sixth Circuit said it was the former."
2002.01-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,954.356,955.628,Only the first.
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,955.628,956.354,Correct.
2002.01-1269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,964.095,967.285,"May I ask you, Mr. Nager, is the complaint in the record?"
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,972.147,977.244,I don't believe that it is.
2002.01-1269,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,994.307,995.127,"Well, I... I do."
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1000.424,1001.192,"--Well, you did--"
2002.01-1269,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1001.192,1002.916,--Have they given up on the second one?
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1002.916,1010.082,"--Well, they've abandoned their claim that they litigated and prevailed on in the Sixth Circuit, that they could proceed on the disparate impact theory."
2002.01-1269,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1010.082,1012.431,And the last is a due process?
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1012.431,1014.444,A... a substantive due process claim.
2002.01-1269,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1014.444,1016.137,Substantive due process?
2002.01-1269,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1017.014,1029.923,And the Sixth Circuit held that there was a triable question of fact as to whether or not the city had acted rationally in proceeding forward with its referendum petition.
2002.01-1269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1054.381,1056.467,"Very well, Mr. Nager."
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1058.514,1072.231,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1269,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1133.392,1134.203,Suppose it was.
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1181.807,1182.08,"Yes... yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1269,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1189.116,1194.213,--I... I bring it up because I'm confused as to how in your mind you see this thing working.
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1222.791,1223.739,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1269,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1235.146,1236.168,Assume it's a sham.
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1238.057,1238.193,--Yes.
2002.01-1269,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1238.193,1239.169,They're terrible.
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1254.097,1256.518,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-1269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1273.841,1274.589,But what... what--
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1274.589,1276.673,But in the situation where you do have a sham--
2002.01-1269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1276.673,1283.31,--What... what do you mean by saying the petition was genuine as opposed to a sham in these... in this context?
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1283.31,1292.281,"--I... I think genuine here means the same it means in... in the other contexts in which the Court has used the sham doctrine, namely that it was about the First Amendment activity."
2002.01-1269,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1294.389,1297.056,I just... this is such a strange argument.
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1329.466,1337.107,"--Certainly, Your Honor, it... in the event that you have a referendum that's actually enacted into law, the Court would examine it in the way that... that you have articulated."
2002.01-1269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1358.995,1359.38,I don't--
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1359.38,1360.32,--taking advantage of the delay.
2002.01-1269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1360.32,1363.145,--I don't know what you mean by abuse in a situation like this.
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1371.529,1372.902,"That... that is certainly true, Your Honor."
2002.01-1269,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1378.94,1383.17,"The reason I'm worried, in about 2 minutes from now I'm going to hear the other side get up, and they're going to say this is a sham."
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1421.464,1422.674,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1445.384,1446.63,"Well, wait a... what is--"
2002.01-1269,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1446.63,1447.022,--We're trying to find out what is a sham.
2002.01-1269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1451.328,1452.039,--You... you haven't told us.
2002.01-1269,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1452.039,1462.854,"In the antitrust context, I understand it because... because there is the law, and... and you come up with a phony... a phony law, you know, you can say it's a sham."
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1469.408,1470.169,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2002.01-1269,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.169,1471.38,--and thus a sham referendum?
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1472.734,1482.127,"--Your Honor, this Court's sham analysis has to do with whether or not it's actually about the First Amendment activity or it's just about an effort, in this case, to take advantage of the delay to interfere with someone's housing rights."
2002.01-1269,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1506.562,1512.183,So the clerk in that case... the clerk of the court who says I'm putting this on the ballot... he's violated the law in putting it on the ballot?
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1521.286,1531.408,"--Your Honor, I... I'm not necessarily saying that the clerk shouldn't put that on the ballot, but that would be one part of the analysis in determining whether or not the process was being abused and it was just a sham."
2002.01-1269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.408,1534.074,"Well, isn't... wouldn't it be a sham... let me just put this on the table."
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1546.422,1548.575,I... I think that very well may be strong evidence that it was a sham.
2002.01-1269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.969,1586.775,May I ask your view on the hypothetical I asked to the other lawyer?
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1601.197,1604.18,"Potentially, Your Honor."
2002.01-1269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1615.812,1627.42,"Well, there was, but they... they figured it was going to lose in the long run, but nevertheless, let's assume they wanted to delay things for 60, 90 days, whatever it might be, because they wanted to delay it on... on, you know, this... this project."
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1627.42,1628.106,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1628.106,1632.315,"If it... if it were clear because this case is on summary judgment, so really don't know what the facts are--"
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1632.315,1632.786,"Well, but--"
2002.01-1269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.786,1640.522,"--but if there were clear evidence that the mayor and everybody else act up in a racially motivated reason, would there be liability in that situation?"
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1640.522,1648.644,"--I... I think you'd need to examine both the motives in... in your hypothetical not only of the city officials, but also of... of the petition signers."
2002.01-1269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.644,1649.334,Everybody.
2002.01-1269,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.334,1650.822,Are you talking about personal liability or official liability?
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1650.822,1652.198,"I'm talking about the liability of the city, Your Honor."
2002.01-1269,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1652.198,1652.714,--Okay.
2002.01-1269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1653.669,1659.168,--I'm assuming everybody who opposed the project was racially motivated and that could be demonstrated with tape recorder.
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1659.168,1665.075,"I guess the short answer, Your Honor, is that even people with racial motives have the right to petition their government to change the law."
2002.01-1269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1672.194,1672.996,So... so your answer would be no liability in that case.
2002.01-1269,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1672.996,1675.286,"If it was genuine petitioning, that is correct."
2002.01-1269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1676.963,1678.831,"Thank you, Mr. Salmons."
2002.01-1269,2,22589,edward_kramer,,1692.558,1694.846,"It's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-1269,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1754.433,1756.109,How could they do that if they had no choice?
2002.01-1269,2,22589,edward_kramer,,1771.674,1793.027,--We believe that they did have a choice and we cite cases to the Court from the Ohio Supreme Court on page 25 of our brief that indicates that the petitions did not have to be certified by the... the court... by the city.
2002.01-1269,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1793.027,1796.18,"But didn't the lower... the lower courts didn't adopt that proposition, did they?"
2002.01-1269,2,22589,edward_kramer,,1796.18,1807.557,"The lower courts weren't asked that question, Your Honor, because we're really talking about whether or not they... there was an official conduct by the city."
2002.01-1269,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1807.557,1814.066,So didn't they go on the basis that the... that the city officials' action was mandatory?
2002.01-1269,2,22589,edward_kramer,,1816.194,1825.232,"As I said, I don't really believe the Sixth Circuit approached the... the case from... from that particular issue."
2002.01-1269,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1825.232,1826.125,So it didn't--
2002.01-1269,2,22589,edward_kramer,,1826.125,1830.001,"There was discretion, we believe, and we certainly provided evidence."
2002.01-1269,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1856.635,1858.984,"--Well, but that... that's a question of Ohio law, I take it?"
2002.01-1269,2,22589,edward_kramer,,1858.984,1859.768,That's correct.
2002.01-1269,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1859.768,1866.266,And the way you sought to prove it was to get an affidavit from the law director of some suburb of Cleveland?
2002.01-1269,2,22589,edward_kramer,,1866.266,1871.543,"As one element of proof, we indicated that that showed that there was discretion."
2002.01-1269,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1885.693,1886.533,Would it be--
2002.01-1269,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1886.533,1891.834,"--But it rules that way many years... many years after this case was... went to litigation, did it not?"
2002.01-1269,2,22589,edward_kramer,,1891.834,1893.275,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1269,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1893.275,1897.15,"And it had nothing to do with whether it was racist, sexist."
2002.01-1269,2,22589,edward_kramer,,1900.805,1903.244,"That's correct, and it also only had--"
2002.01-1269,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1903.244,1913.974,Do you have... do you have any... do you have any authority to say that there is discretion to reject a petition that is properly legislative?
2002.01-1269,2,22589,edward_kramer,,1913.974,1919.868,"--Well, the... yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.01-1269,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1919.868,1932.886,Suppose... suppose you had a legislative proposal that members of a certain race will never be included in any kind of an equal opportunity law.
2002.01-1269,2,22589,edward_kramer,,1943.349,1958.647,"I don't know of Ohio law, but certainly this Court's decision in Hunter versus Erickson dealing with an Ohio referendum indicates that that type of referendum is unconstitutional."
2002.01-1269,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1958.647,1962.473,"Well now, I don't believe that's a correct statement of the holding in Hunter."
2002.01-1269,2,22589,edward_kramer,,1973.962,1997.879,"Well, with... Mr. Chief Justice, we are talking about the... this Court's jurisprudence that deals with the... simply because it's a referendum, if the legislature could not do this, pass a law that says, for example, that African-Americans cannot own property, like in Buchanan versus Warley--"
2002.01-1269,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.879,2003.744,"If a legislature could do that, would... would we enjoin a legislature from passing an unconstitutional law?"
2002.01-1269,2,22589,edward_kramer,,2003.744,2005.483,--And... no.
2002.01-1269,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.483,2008.975,The Federal... the Federal Congress passes unconstitutional laws all the time.
2002.01-1269,3,25826,glen_d_nager,,3500.344,3503.584,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-1269,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3555.494,3556.258,"Thank you, Mr. Nager."
