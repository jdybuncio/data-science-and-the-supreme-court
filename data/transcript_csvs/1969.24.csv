1969.24,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.065,"Number 24, Waller against the State of Florida."
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,44.067,48.0,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.24,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,343.617,354.344,"I understand Mr. Levinson that there is no dispute about the fact that it's the same defendant, and that it was the same general course of conduct."
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,368.543,370.624,Destruction of city property.
1969.24,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,370.624,381.514,"City property, that was the subject to the first trial under the city ordinances and then the subject to the second trial under the state law was for larceny?"
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,381.514,382.911,"Well Mr. Justice, in both trials --"
1969.24,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,382.911,392.38,"Larceny generally, doesn't -- I mean, the typical congressional larceny case doesn't generally embrace what we think of is disorderly conduct?"
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,392.38,409.413,"Well Mr. Justice, in the felony trial in the Circuit Court, that's the trial for grand larceny, the point was raised by the defendant, that larceny generally consists under Florida law as elsewhere in the stealing of the property."
1969.24,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,507.955,528.584,"I was suggesting by my question that it was that it might be possible in a case, for example, let's assume there was a federal statute that makes it an offense to steal Government property and another statute that makes it an offense to destroy it, federal Government property."
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,550.597,551.73,Well certainly not Mr. Justice.
1969.24,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,581.407,583.668,"Well, what was the -- what property was destroyed?"
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,586.726,590.556,"Mr. Justice, there's no record of the trial in the city court and I was not there personally."
1969.24,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.664,623.889,"Well, I suppose that it is possible that the on that state of facts, it wasn't the painting that was destroyed, but the wall?"
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,623.889,625.237,"Yes, indeed, it is possible."
1969.24,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,625.237,631.235,And that the -- within that the -- what was stolen was painting and what was destroyed is the wall?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,631.235,640.812,This is possible and we concede that it is possible that a single course of conduct may indeed offend a number of statutes at the same time.
1969.24,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.812,644.925,And even maybe different separate acts?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,644.925,646.941,Maybe.
1969.24,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.518,688.886,"Oh, you would say that if in the last case, on the robbery case, robbing several people at the same time that if a defendant goes up to one person and lifts his wallet out of his pocket and goes up to the other person and lifts the wallet out of his pocket but sticks a knife in him at the same time."
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,697.66,701.08,I think that if all the facts are known to the state --
1969.24,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.08,703.447,"Those are all the facts there are, excuse me."
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,703.447,719.066,"I believe that the state under the arguments which we have submitted in our brief and which I wish to elaborate on a little while, the state should join together all the charges in a single trial which may contain numerous counts alleging the various criminal statutes which has been violated."
1969.24,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.066,721.889,"Though, that's critical to your case here, isn't it?"
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,721.889,723.473,This is certainly important.
1969.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1127.53,1133.443,"Now suppose you prevail on that point, what do you suggest be done with this case?"
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1133.443,1135.818,This case I believe should be reversed.
1969.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1140.8,1147.72,"Well I know, but do you -- what is the Florida double jeopardy rule, same transaction or same evidence, what is it?"
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1147.72,1148.553,"Now, the Florida double jeopardy --"
1969.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1148.553,1153.601,"Last time as I read this opinion, they went off on the so-called to sovereign issue?"
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1153.601,1154.201,"Yes, they did Mr. Justice."
1969.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1154.201,1160.178,And they don't tell us what their double jeopardy rule would be if they were advised that they can't apply with this act?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1160.178,1167.544,"Well Mr. Justice, the leading case in Florida on double jeopardy, obviously has to be a case evolving two prosecutions in the state courts."
1969.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1167.544,1167.785,Yes.
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1167.785,1184.041,"Because no other possibility crossed the threshold and in this connection, the Florida case of Stanford versus Faith cited in the brief on pages 30 and 31, decided in 1918, I believe still be definitive of State of Florida law."
1969.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1210.655,1225.352,"Well, that would suggest then that -- as I understand it, as far as you know the identical facts that established the municipal conviction were the facts on which the grand larceny conviction is based?"
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1225.352,1226.18,That's correct.
1969.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1226.18,1235.487,"And you're suggesting that in that set of facts, Stanford holds that there could not have been a grand larceny prosecution?"
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1235.487,1236.783,That's correct.
1969.24,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.783,1250.79,"Are we to say that or should -- if we say the wrong on double -- on the so called two sovereignty, should we send it back to them to let the state courts apply the Stanford rule to this case?"
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1250.79,1255.091,I believe that the case is clear enough that this Court can dispose of it completely.
1969.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1265.273,1268.449,Well on this my question assume the premise that we agree with you?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1268.449,1268.921,Yes.
1969.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1279.719,1283.616,Should we apply the Stanford rule or let the Florida Court's apply it?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1283.616,1302.192,"Since Florida law failed to apply it because they never reached it, I believe that the interest of justice so as to the disposal of this litigation this Court is probably able and certainly has jurisdiction to apply the Stanford rule under its general authority to dispose of the litigation as interest of justice may require."
1969.24,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1312.173,1313.932,What was his first sentence?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1313.932,1318.749,His first sentence was two consecutive 90-day sentences.
1969.24,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1321.871,1324.334,Did he say at the trial --
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1324.334,1337.92,"This is a -- this is the question which is still unfortunately not clear because while he was serving the 6-month city sentence, he was also being held for trial in the state court."
1969.24,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1361.448,1368.97,When he was confined on the city cases had he been tried and convicted of the state case?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1368.97,1369.752,No sir.
1969.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1387.113,1393.153,"Well, if he served a city sentence in one city jail and the state sentence was in state penitentiary or what?"
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1393.153,1404.768,"Well, he was confined to the county jail and it's not unusual for city prisoners to be switched around, even to county jail or even to state penitentiary while they're awaiting trial on state offenses."
1969.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1404.768,1405.256,I see.
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1405.256,1412.201,"And my understanding is that as a matter of Florida law, it's somewhat unclear whether he has yet served the city sentence or not."
1969.24,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1412.201,1415.949,Does the record show what bond do you wish for you to make of?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1415.949,1420.111,"Yes, and as a matter of fact Mr. Justice, there was problem about the bond also."
1969.24,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1429.333,1430.24,A what?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1430.24,1436.428,He turned that to be a defendant who was not given the maximum leniency by the trial court.
1969.24,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1436.428,1438.447,Where the bond was fixed?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1438.447,1440.362,"$2,500.00."
1969.24,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1440.362,1441.58,And he couldn't make it?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1441.58,1442.857,Yes he did make it.
1969.24,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1450.616,1452.025,And not the bond entirely?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1452.025,1472.555,"Yes sir, and as a reported opinion in the Southern Reporter in which a Florida appellate court reversed the trial judge on that matter which suggests amongst other things that the pre-sentence investigation report may have had prejudicial effect on the mind of the trial judge which perhaps will be discussed when I reach the other point of the argument."
1969.24,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1472.555,1473.577,What was it about it?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1478.214,1479.377,Well Mr. Justice --
1969.24,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1479.377,1480.762,What was it that he took?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1480.762,1484.366,He took a mural from the wall of the City Hall.
1969.24,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1484.461,1485.713,What kind of a mural?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1485.713,1486.913,A canvas painting.
1969.24,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1490.289,1490.969,A what?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1490.969,1505.093,A group of Negro musicians were depicted on this painting and he and other members of his group allege that this was an insulting caricature of their race.
1969.24,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1518.597,1520.439,Same transaction?
1969.24,0,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,1520.439,1529.726,"For same transaction, the same course of conduct or in current language the same happening, if I may use the words."
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1621.597,1622.294,Mr. Chief Justice --
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1622.294,1623.469,Mr. Georgieff?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1623.469,1626.747,-- may it please the Court.
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1680.119,1682.136,Where was the mural that he took?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1682.136,1682.948,I Beg your pardon?
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1682.948,1684.965,Where was the mural that he took?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1684.965,1685.892,City Hall in Saint Petersburg.
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1685.892,1687.266,Of what?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1687.979,1703.377,"The City of Saint Petersburg and he was charged there under municipal ordinances with the disturbing of the peace and I don't know the exact wording of the charge on the second one, but it was damaging city property."
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1714.235,1715.952,You mean at the state level?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1715.952,1717.805,At the state level.
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1807.266,1814.55,At what point in time do you say the state offense begun?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1814.55,1821.692,I would say the minute they ripped it off the wall and carry it away and meant to keep it from the property of the --
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1821.692,1832.987,And have it -- had any other offense been committed against any sovereign in your view before they begun to tear it off the wall?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1832.987,1834.501,"Certainly, breech of the peace was."
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1836.586,1838.448,What was the breech?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1843.824,1849.454,"Would you believe Mr. Chief Justice, I can't tell you because there is no record here of it."
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1913.595,1917.399,What was the offense of damaging the wall?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1926.659,1931.354,Chipped the plaster off as I understand it and damaged the painting so.
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1931.354,1938.34,Was that in your view the damage to the wall an offense against the municipality or against the State of Florida?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1938.34,1942.682,"That would have to been against the municipality, it was their property."
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1942.682,1944.46,Did the State of Florida prosecuted it?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1944.46,1946.271,No sir.
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1946.271,1948.494,So that we rule that out.
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1953.724,1956.346,"Yes, of course, that's not here before you."
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1959.241,1961.988,I'm trying to find two separate offenses.
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1961.988,1963.694,Oh yes.
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1970.141,1971.254,At the state?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1971.254,1978.377,"That's right, or disturbing the peace I think they call it, I'm not sure what the exact nomenclature is."
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1978.377,1982.922,Do you have a state statute against malicious destruction of the property?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1982.922,1984.89,Not city property.
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.89,1993.115,Do you have a state statue which makes it a crime to maliciously destruct property?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1993.115,1996.344,I'm sure there are several Mr. Justice.
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.883,2008.784,"So that when they damaged that wall, there was a violation of state law?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2008.784,2010.746,No sir.
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2016.365,2022.936,"Well, if you maliciously destroy a person's private property, isn't that a violation of state law?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2022.936,2024.661,"Yes sir, in Florida."
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2024.661,2029.567,"And it would be the same for the city, wouldn't it?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2029.567,2031.199,"No, I don't think so because --"
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2031.199,2035.63,"Well, that's because it set in sovereignty of business, is that the reason?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2035.63,2036.539,Yes sir.
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2036.539,2037.882,I see.
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2037.882,2039.194,Now --
1969.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2039.194,2040.433,"Mr. Georgieff, may I ask you."
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2046.515,2048.033,That is sir.
1969.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2050.706,2055.415,I gather this -- that it is before the trial than it was --
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2055.415,2056.521,I think so.
1969.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2056.521,2063.978,And to make complete characters referred -- that's final knowledge of the belief?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2086.128,2087.226,That's on the state charge.
1969.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2090.431,2102.498,"Do we have any representation that what we have here is having been offered as evidence on the grand larceny charge, the same evidence that was offered in the District Court?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2102.498,2107.529,"No, you do not sir, no sir."
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2107.529,2120.715,"Suppose he had been tried in the City Hall -- in the city for larceny taking that away and then, could he even tried in the state with same offense?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2120.715,2123.685,"Under the separate sovereign theory, yes he could Your Honor."
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2123.685,2125.884,"So, that really is the basis of this thing?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2126.391,2127.112,That's one of them.
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2133.435,2137.063,"Of course, the city is subordinate to the state --"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2137.063,2139.394,Just as the states are to the federal in my opinion --
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2139.394,2141.046,Well not just that --
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2141.046,2144.602,"Similarly, I would assume that--"
1969.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2144.602,2159.889,In order that the rational of following -- it's a rational of body binds the relationship of this conduct to a state?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2159.889,2161.781,"Well, I'm not sure I quite understand your question."
1969.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2161.781,2169.351,"Oh, I gather, what we dealt within the body was the questionable relationship between the federal Government and a state Government?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2169.351,2170.264,Yes sir.
1969.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2170.264,2173.894,And prosecution for the same conduct?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2179.782,2182.896,Yes sir and I tell you why.
1969.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2240.938,2247.748,"Well, I still don't understand how old is just rational of a body advice --"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2247.748,2249.177,"Well, I don't see why it doesn't."
1969.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2260.065,2261.849,But what you think of them--
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2261.849,2262.864,"Oh yes, tomorrow."
1969.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2262.864,2267.311,(Inaudible)
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2267.311,2272.868,"No, but I would imagine before the Congress would allow Puerto Rico in, a certain number of things would have to follow."
1969.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2272.868,2285.597,What we are dealing with is whether or not a state and federal government could prosecute a man for the same conduct (Inaudible)
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2285.597,2298.739,"Well sir, I think that's meaningless in this argument today because he's told you that if you brought all three of these in one court, he wouldn't be here complaining about it and that is what he said."
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2323.299,2329.993,How does it makes quite a difference to him is whether he is once in jail or twice in jail for the same thing?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2329.993,2331.993,I'm sure of that.
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2726.896,2728.373,How much you say this one was?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2728.373,2730.867,Six months to five years sir.
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2763.494,2768.933,Was this sentence appealed to the six -- this larceny larceny sentence?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2768.933,2769.959,I didn't hear you sir.
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2769.959,2772.674,Was the larceny sentence appealed?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2772.674,2774.566,"Oh, yes."
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2774.566,2776.941,And did the State Supreme Court affirmed it?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2776.941,2778.284,It did not go to the Supreme Court.
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2784.341,2785.502,And they affirmed?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2785.502,2788.437,Yes sir.
1969.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2817.027,2830.284,Did the -- was this question of the making available to the defendant the pre-sentence investigation report an err that was brought to the -- claimed error that was brought to the attention of the District Court of Appeal?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2830.284,2831.218,"Yes, it was sir."
1969.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2831.218,2834.388,"Because I don't believe there's any mention of it in the -- their opinion, is there?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2834.388,2835.837,"Oh, they are often are not."
1969.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2835.837,2841.653,"Well, I understand that there is a catch all in the last next last paragraph, but we've examined the other --"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2841.653,2850.362,"I shall be glad if that's included in that, but quite often, even when they -- I will assume when they don't want to particularly say anything about it."
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2922.134,2931.703,Did I understand you earlier to say that the state crime occurred when they ripped this mural off the wall?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2931.703,2934.824,"And carried it off, and carried it off."
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2934.824,2941.124,When did the city crime of destroying the city property start?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2941.124,2943.224,"Damaging sir, I think it was."
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2943.224,2944.52,When did that start?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2944.52,2948.378,"When they started to tear it off and the plaster came off, the adhesive, and I think --"
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2948.378,2961.533,"So, they both started, both crimes started at the exact same time involving the exact same instrument?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2961.533,2962.969,"For a point, yes, they did."
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2962.969,2965.186,And did they end at the same time?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2965.186,2966.563,No sir.
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2966.563,2968.821,When did the city crime end?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2968.821,2971.567,After it came off the wall.
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2972.759,2973.248,Then.
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2974.781,2976.179,"Yes, I would assume, oh yes."
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2976.179,2980.492,And then they carried it off -- how far did they take it?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2980.492,2983.579,"I'm hard to put to be accurate about that, not too far."
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2983.579,2984.342,Not too far.
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2984.342,2986.91,They got away with it --
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2986.91,2988.653,Few minutes?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2988.653,2990.042,Perhaps by a tenth Your Honor.
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2990.042,2992.837,Another 10 minutes.
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,2992.837,2993.311,I'm not that --
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2993.311,3001.747,"So, that's the only difference between the facts of the two crimes?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3001.747,3007.883,"I'm afraid if I say yes to that, I'll agree that it's so minute that it isn't worth any discussion."
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3019.387,3033.682,"Well, I understood that your District Court said that the crime isn't the damaging, that's what made it larceny?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3033.682,3036.635,"Well, it was also in the carrying away if Your Honor please."
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3036.635,3041.84,"But, they put emphasis on the damages, am I right?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3041.84,3043.727,That they did.
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3043.727,3046.184,"So, we got two damages?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3046.184,3046.609,That's right.
1969.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3068.346,3072.634,Does the record show where they put it back?
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3072.634,3075.11,Do you mean that the city ever put the mural back?
1969.24,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3122.469,3148.684,"I thought it was your argument Mr. Georgieff is that the District Court of Appeal did seem as I read their opinion beginning on page 52a of the appendix, did seem to rely exclusively upon this so-called two sovereignty's rule because they said one of the things, this information was based on the same acts of the appellant as were involved in the violation of the two city ordinances."
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3175.799,3176.142,No.
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3219.8,3225.368,"Well, the offense against the State of Florida could not begin until that mural was off of the wall?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3225.368,3226.018,That is correct.
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3226.018,3228.989,Because it began with the carrying away?
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3228.989,3230.56,That is correct.
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3231.873,3240.945,"The damage begun as soon as the tearing commenced, so that they did not commence at the same time?"
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3240.945,3251.181,"Well, as I said to Mr. Justice Harlan Mr. Chief Justice, I don't like to see to something when it so minute that I may go into tank without knowing about it."
1969.24,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3266.951,3268.384,That's the real problem is it.
1969.24,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,3270.143,3279.611,"That is correct sir, and I wish as much as Mr. Levinson and the Court that it was here, but it is not and I don't know how to restructure that."
1969.24,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3295.737,3297.463,You have five minutes.
1969.24,2,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,3297.463,3302.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, just a word about this question of larceny by destruction."
1969.24,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3359.623,3362.805,How about carrying it off?
1969.24,2,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,3362.805,3376.925,Carrying it off can only be the ingredients of larceny if it is carried off with felonious intent and the presence of police officers negated the possibility of the requisite felonious intent on the evidence presented by the state.
1969.24,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3376.925,3383.087,You're making a pretty difficult to prove a bank robbery where you have a lot of uniform armed guards around?
1969.24,2,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,3383.087,3391.321,"Well, the circumstances of a bank robbery make it obvious that the robbers intend if they can to get away with the haul."
1969.24,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3398.139,3401.715,I don't see difficulty with that.
1969.24,2,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,3401.715,3402.526,Well --
1969.24,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3402.526,3405.676,"Well, you said, they have some intention to take it away, did you?"
1969.24,2,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,3405.676,3410.692,They have an intention to take it away for the purpose of carrying out a demonstration.
1969.24,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3410.804,3413.116,They have an statement there?
1969.24,2,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,3413.116,3417.099,They walked the few city blocks with it in the presence of a large crowd of people including the police officers.
1969.24,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3417.099,3418.858,Did the police back off?
1969.24,2,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,3418.858,3419.715,The police recovered.
1969.24,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3423.123,3425.073,Did they put it back up on the wall?
1969.24,2,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,3425.073,3425.657,No sir.
1969.24,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3426.753,3429.126,Your (Inaudible) been without that all this time?
1969.24,2,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,3429.126,3429.912,"Yes sir, they have."
1969.24,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3429.912,3431.132,How long since this?
1969.24,2,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,3431.132,3440.79,"Three years, but the mural was in the custody of the city even or not on the wall of the City Hall."
1969.24,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3625.437,3625.788,Your time is up Mr. Levinson.
1969.24,2,34738,leslie_h_levinson,,3625.788,3627.048,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1969.24,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3627.048,3628.921,We'll take your other points on the brief.
