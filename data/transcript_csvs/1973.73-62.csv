1973.73-62,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,79.248,81.114,"Yes, I’d like to have a 5-minute warning."
1973.73-62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,83.312,84.828,I’ll indicate to you when you used --
1973.73-62,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,84.828,85.154,Thirty minutes.
1973.73-62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,85.154,86.748,Forty minutes.
1973.73-62,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,86.748,90.447,Thirty minutes because I’d like to reserve that 10 minutes for rebuttal.
1973.73-62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,90.447,94.059,Alright.
1973.73-62,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,94.059,97.928,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-62,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,294.974,297.459,What part of the District Court’s order?
1973.73-62,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,297.459,306.79,"This is -- the District Court order, a remand, it’s called injunction and judgment issued in compliance with mandate of the Court of Appeals."
1973.73-62,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,353.741,358.257,The trouble is that your petition for certiorari doesn’t have 846 page.
1973.73-62,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,358.257,358.557,A --
1973.73-62,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,358.557,360.517,A46.
1973.73-62,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,360.517,361.051,A?
1973.73-62,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,361.051,369.303,"A [Attempt to Laughter] Your Honor, I wouldn’t burden this Court with an 846 petition for certiorari."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2230.582,2232.393,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2232.393,2236.677,Mr. Sullivan.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2236.677,2242.31,Let me try to outline our position in this case as it has been from the time we filed the complaint.
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.902,2414.639,"Well, dual enrollment would never be sufficient --"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2414.639,2415.457,Sir?
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.457,2422.415,Dual enrollment where the classes on the private -- on the public school property would never be sufficient.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2422.415,2425.501,"Not in Missouri, Mr. Justice, because --"
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.501,2426.393,"No, under the Act."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2427.248,2429.457,"I think it could be, certainly."
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2429.457,2447.387,"Well, by definition, the class is carried on on public school property and I thought the Court of Appeals said that if these services are furnished by teachers on public school property during school hours, it must be furnished on the -- be made available on private school property during school hours."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2447.387,2448.914,"That’s right, Mr. Justice, with reference to Missouri --"
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2448.914,2451.347,"Well, dual enrollment program would never be sufficient?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2451.347,2453.273,It would be in Missouri.
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2453.652,2456.89,"Forget Missouri, they said the Act required it."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2456.89,2457.636,"No, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.685,2463.721,I’ll put it to you this way.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2467.766,2469.035,But they did say they were wrong.
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.035,2469.262,Okay.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2469.262,2470.041,They said the Act--
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.041,2470.909,"Okay, that’s all I need."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2470.909,2491.57,"They said the Act did not provide any particular method, and I think I can quote that, they said the Act could not provide any particular -- the Court of Appeals said “we further observe that no particular program or service is mandatory under the Act.”"
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.766,2516.951,Let’s put state law aside for the moment.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2541.164,2548.99,"It construed the Act that way, but only in the sense and in the background of the evidence and facts presented to it."
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.99,2567.498,"Well that’s alright, but nevertheless, as I understand it, that the local educational agency in Missouri, if it’s going to furnish a program on public school property, must furnish a like program on private school property."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2567.498,2568.123,In Missouri?
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2568.667,2570.97,"Well, it would be true anywhere, wouldn’t it?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2570.97,2572.328,"No, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.328,2578.044,"Well, they -- at least they construed the Act in this case to require that?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2578.044,2584.706,"They did, but as I say, only in the light of the evidence and the background that was presented to them in this case."
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2584.706,2596.18,"But only in the light, I thought you said was the settlement of the Missouri law that has an alternative, dual enrollment, was as a matter of state law prohibited."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2596.18,2596.934,"That’s right, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2596.934,2604.371,And it’s based on that consideration that the statute was applied the way it was?
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2604.371,2605.31,That’s right.
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2606.679,2606.969,Yes.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2606.969,2620.701,-- and the further element inherent in the Court of Appeals opinion and in the injunction that it only applies or the Title I benefits are rendered on -- during regular school hours on public school premises.
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2635.735,2636.868,As to hours?
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2636.868,2643.121,There’s one that has no Title I grant and they won’t request it for reasons of their own.
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2653.969,2655.367,They take care of the problem themselves.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2655.367,2662.676,"That’s right and the eligible or otherwise eligible children in private schools, they have no right under the Act to request --"
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2662.676,2665.921,"Well, are there any school districts that have after hours --?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2665.921,2666.973,"One or two, yes."
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2666.973,2667.531,Yes.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2667.531,2668.496,"Yes, and they have it."
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2700.944,2706.213,"So this injunction, anyway, applies only to the school districts we have involved here, is that it?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2706.213,2708.83,It only applies to State Board of Education.
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2708.83,2710.234,Yes.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2710.234,2712.658,And that was the only -- and the commissioner.
1973.73-62,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2842.677,2856.246,"Mr. Sullivan, why shouldn’t the District Court have abstained here if, as Mr. Pfeffer said that the petitioner’s requested him to do, if there’s a significant undecided question of Missouri law involved?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2856.246,2861.67,"Well, he should not have abstained because we were seeking relief under the Federal Acts."
1973.73-62,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2861.67,2875.301,But the Court of Appeals itself which ended up granting you relief was able to do so only after it had resolved what it conceded to be an important and undecided question of Missouri law?
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2875.301,2878.353,"He did but he -- well, let me withdraw that."
1973.73-62,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2896.127,2897.265,Well but --
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2897.265,2899.726,Chief Judge -- excuse me.
1973.73-62,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2899.726,2901.68,Why was it not a case --
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2901.68,2902.002,Because --
1973.73-62,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2902.002,2903.239,-- for the abstention?
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2903.239,2909.032,Because these youngsters were seeking their federally established rights.
1973.73-62,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2909.032,2912.623,"Well, but that just begs the question, I think."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2933.132,2943.824,"Well, we approve the question of Missouri law, but I still think the basic question was always federal under Title I the Title -- our rights under the Title I Act."
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2960.799,2978.135,"Well, Mr. Sullivan, suppose there had been a decision of the Supreme Court of Missouri reaching a contrary result on this issue of state law. At the time this case got to the Court of Appeals, reaching a different decision on state law than the Court of Appeals came to, do you think --"
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2978.135,2979.316,"Namely, that --"
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2979.316,2980.177,That dual --
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2980.177,2981.301,Enrollment was permissible?
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2981.301,2982.283,-- was permissible.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2994.149,2996.418,"No, they would’ve said any one is alright, but --"
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2996.418,2998.076,We wouldn’t have this case?
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,2998.076,3002.322,I still think we would’ve had the same position on the part of the State Board of Education.
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3009.861,3022.506,"You mean you think if the Missouri Supreme Court had said that dual enrollment was a proper -- was proper under the educational law of Missouri, that the State Board of Education would have ignored that?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3022.506,3035.017,"The State Board says in their own brief, and particularly in their reply brief, that it is the State Department of Education that determines what the relevant state law is and they’re the ones that --"
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3035.017,3036.712,Even if Missouri Supreme Court --
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3036.712,3037.504,I think so.
1973.73-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3043.162,3059.563,"Let’s assume what Mr. Justice Brennan just suggested to you, then your position is that merely it would’ve widen the options of available to get this remedial training to the students?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3059.563,3065.279,I would’ve hope that dual enrollment would have been-- provisions would’ve been made for dual enrollment.
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3079.003,3089.321,But the injunction that would’ve been entered was cease disapproving any program that provides either for dual enrollment or furnishing on private --
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3089.321,3090.846,"I beg your pardon, Mr. Justice?"
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3090.846,3104.088,"Well, the injunction that was entered here, that was order entered by the Court of Appeals ordered the state agency to quit disapproving programs or that suggested furnishing services on private school property."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3104.088,3105.996,Yes.
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.996,3110.621,"Now, the decision of the Supreme Court of Missouri went the other way."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3116.325,3118.065,He -- with respect to dual enrollment?
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3118.065,3118.849,Yes.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3118.849,3137.154,"Well, I don’t -- if there was a -- if dual enrollment was available, I mean, that would’ve been a maybe a little more cumbersome and awkward but certainly had been a valid way to -- for these children to receive their educational benefits and I would hope that it would’ve been done. It would’ve been carried out in the programs and projects."
1973.73-62,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3137.154,3155.276,"Well, Mr. Sullivan, certainly what I had conceived to be the undecided point of Missouri law was what the Court of Appeals refers to at page a20 of the petition for certiorari where they say it’s conceivable that, under Missouri law, the use of all funds might have been prohibited."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3193.131,3217.967,"Well, Mr. -- Judge Lei in the majority opinion said he hypothesized a situation, if this is I think an answer, that on page -- I’m looking at the slip sheet 23, a23 in the Appendix."
1973.73-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3244.443,3246.053,The state would forfeit all its right under Title I.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3246.053,3247.135,There’d be no Title I.
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3249.708,3253.8,"Well, that’s the state constitutional matter, isn’t it?"
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3253.8,3260.473,It would be an issue under the state constitution as to whether this Missouri law barred all of these programs?
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3260.473,3266.505,"Yes, and we have to assume the existence of such a law or statute, which there is none."
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3295.259,3302.776,That was the one money and property may also be received from the United States and be redistributed together with public money of this state.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3306.461,3307.741,Missouri constitutional amendment --
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3307.741,3310.811,Section 38a.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3310.811,3312.98,Article III Section 38?
1973.73-62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3312.98,3315.163,Yes.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3315.163,3319.141,"And so, I think we’ve obviated that situation."
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3333.268,3338.238,"But the Wheeler decision that barred dual enrollment was a statutory construction matter, wasn’t it?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3338.238,3339.498,"Yes, it was, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3339.498,3347.947,It was a matter of saying that the state’s Compulsory Attendance Laws required --
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3347.947,3349.425,The child should stay in his own school for --
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3349.425,3350.111,Stay in his own school.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3350.111,3351.442,So many hours a day and --
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3351.442,3357.536,And the same would be in another different question as to whether a public school teacher could be sent into a private school.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3357.536,3358.984,That wasn’t included in that case.
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3359.219,3360.523,"I understand, I understand that."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3360.523,3374.641,"The only one that was included in that -- there was a mention in that case that public school teachers employed a virtue of trust on it in the opinion, but for public school teachers employed out of Missouri public school fund to teach in public schools."
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3374.641,3375.18,But the --
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3375.18,3376.169,They can’t be sent to private schools.
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3376.169,3388.036,"But if there were a case in Missouri about sending public school teachers into private schools, the argument would be based on, what, the Missouri constitution?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3388.036,3390.221,The fiscal elements of Missouri constitution.
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3408.376,3412.298,But it still would be a constitutional construction problem?
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3412.298,3422.451,"Yes, there’s certainly no statute that affects it in any degree that I know of, except the one -- maybe some statute on public school funds."
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3492.014,3495.519,"There was no issue of abstention raised in the District Court, was there?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3495.519,3496.49,"The first time, there was."
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3496.793,3498.789,"There was, and who raised that?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3498.789,3501.024,"Nobody, the District Judge raised it."
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3501.024,3504.19,But neither the defendants -- the defendants didn’t --
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3504.19,3506.059,"No, the defendants didn’t raise it."
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3506.059,3518.25,So the argument for abstention is that you should await a State Court construction of its constitution in order to avoid a federal statutory question?
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3518.25,3520.452,"Well, I guess --"
1973.73-62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3520.452,3525.679,"That’s all that the Court of Appeals got to, was the federal statutory question?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3525.679,3528.555,"Well, the District Judge also raised it in that same thing."
1973.73-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3693.555,3703.709,"Mr. Sullivan, what -- you day this is no aid to the program, but isn’t it true that if these people don’t get this aid they’ll be in bad shape?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3703.709,3707.798,"No, this has got nothing to do with aiding the --"
1973.73-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3707.798,3708.332,Aiding --
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3708.332,3709.511,Like Lemon or [Voice Overlap] --
1973.73-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3709.511,3712.367,Aiding children in learning how to read?
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3712.367,3714.515,I thought you meant the schools --
1973.73-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3714.515,3714.886,I meant the children.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3714.886,3716.492,"--the program of the schools, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3716.492,3717.237,I meant the children.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3717.237,3718.996,The children --
1973.73-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3718.996,3731.031,"And if this money didn’t come and the private school wanted to give their children adequate education, they would have but one thing, they’d have to put the money up themselves."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3731.031,3731.906,No --
1973.73-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3731.906,3732.785,"Well, how else can they --"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3732.785,3741.191,"They just can’t give, and haven't been giving, the generally speaking, educationally deprived children in private or public schools."
1973.73-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3741.478,3751.425,"Well, assuming that it’s necessary for them to have the special help and the private school decided they should have the special help."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3758.609,3766.693,"Well, it’s true that if special educational benefits would be rendered to educationally deprived children, if the government doesn’t do it, somebody else will."
1973.73-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3766.693,3772.308,"Well, their parents or their parents might have to send them to a special teacher?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3772.308,3773.234,That’s one of the elements.
1973.73-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3792.05,3807.364,"Well, then I have a one point Mr. Pfeffer made about where is the protection against these teachers teaching religion?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3807.364,3807.637,Well --
1973.73-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3807.637,3813.441,"I want to alert you that you’ve got five minutes of your own time left, four minutes approximately."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3813.441,3814.927,There are several provisions.
1973.73-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3824.9,3828.041,"Well, that’s up to the teacher. How is it supervised?"
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3828.041,3830.89,The same way they are in the public schools.
1973.73-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3841.352,3844.706,"Well, somebody would have to tell them or something, somebody would have to report them or something."
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3844.706,3845.532,I beg your pardon?
1973.73-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3845.532,3847.349,Somebody would have to report them.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3847.349,3849.053,That’s right.
1973.73-62,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3922.494,3926.476,They get as much supervision as the teachers that teach in the public school get?
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,3926.476,3929.849,"Title I teachers should, that’s the idea of it."
1973.73-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4073.131,4074.09,I think your time is up now.
1973.73-62,1,43299,thomas_sullivan,,4074.09,4074.748,Thank you.
1973.73-62,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4074.748,4086.356,Mr. Sullivan.
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4088.207,4091.174,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-62,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4247.236,4254.233,"But in doing that I take it, Mr. Friedman though, within any limitations that may be imposed by state law."
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4254.233,4254.792,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-62,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4254.792,4257.062,"That is, I mean, the local educational authorities."
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4257.062,4258.071,The local educational authorities --
1973.73-62,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4258.071,4259.53,"They have to adhere to state law, do they not?"
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4259.53,4274.271,"They have to adhere to state law and, indeed, the regulations specifically recognizes and contemplate it, and recognizes it because of certain requirements of state law, there may be situations where particular programs have to be worked at."
1973.73-62,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4381.815,4388.242,"Well, and affluent people have just as many children with reading problems as poor in general, do they not?"
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4388.242,4394.028,"Yes, it’s unfortunate of condition which does not -- which draws no lines and it’s a condition that you could have."
1973.73-62,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4394.028,4408.925,I think we’ll resume after lunch.
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4413.37,4416.441,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-62,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4491.038,4499.752,"Excuse me, Mr. Friedman, did you say that -- does the law require that only public school teachers could be used?"
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4507.882,4517.099,"Not -- they could only employ them, for example, during, say, in a summer situation."
1973.73-62,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4566.355,4570.823,You mean that the people on the local educational agencies payroll?
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4570.823,4572.398,Yes.
1973.73-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4572.398,4587.11,"Well, couldn’t the state or its subdivision hire a teacher who did nothing else but this, didn’t have any other teaching duties in the public school but taught only remedial reading, went around may be the various public schools and did so?"
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4587.11,4589.637,"Yes, as I say and I perhaps I misspoken myself --"
1973.73-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4589.637,4590.039,"Well, perhaps I --"
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4590.039,4590.691,I am not --
1973.73-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4590.691,4590.834,Perhaps I did --
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4590.834,4597.368,"I’m not suggesting that they have to be regularly, otherwise, utilized teachers in the public school."
1973.73-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4598.714,4600.487,"And many of them are, in fact, are, aren’t they?"
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4600.487,4601.247,"Yes, but they are --"
1973.73-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4601.247,4602.759,Hired for this purpose alone.
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4602.759,4607.527,"For this purpose alone, but they are employees of the public school authorities."
1973.73-62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4608.567,4609.013,Right.
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4609.013,4609.89,Yes.
1973.73-62,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4666.539,4669.938,I think the case has used the phrase “entanglement” rather than involvement.
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4672.044,4672.269,"I stand corrected, Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.73-62,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4672.269,4674.917,It has other connotations.
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4674.917,4676.735,Excessive government entanglement.
1973.73-62,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4793.967,4797.904,"Well, what about the next sentence, Mr. Friedman?"
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4797.904,4806.407,"Well, what the Court is saying I think, Mr. Justice, is that there is a requirement under the Act that the services provided be comparable."
1973.73-62,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4862.175,4867.316,Well the claim is that the state shouldn’t have to respond to an injunction like that?
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4867.316,4877.302,"Well -- but, Mr. Justice, that is because of the conduct -- the reason the state has to respond to this is because of the requirement in the statute that it’s comparable."
1973.73-62,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4879.344,4895.968,"Yes, but part of the issue is whether comparability as used in the Act requires that the programs be furnished on the premise that private schools if they are furnished on the premises of the public schools, that’s part of the issue here?"
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4895.968,4909.341,"That is part of the issue, Mr. Justice, but we don’t know at this time, one, whether the state is going to undertake and furnish them on that basis, but two, precisely how it’s going to furnish them."
1973.73-62,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4933.944,4942.93,Do you think the injunction that was issued in compliance with the mandate was consistent with the opinion of the Court of Appeals?
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4942.93,4945.18,"Yes, I do, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-62,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4983.494,4985.267,"Let me see if I get this, Mr. Friedman."
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5011.907,5013.637,If that’s permissible under state law.
1973.73-62,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5013.637,5018.28,"Yes, and that if they did so, then they would not be violating this injunction?"
1973.73-62,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5018.28,5023.449,"I believe that’s correct, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-62,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5026.54,5028.631,"Very well, Mr. Friedman."
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5030.919,5031.157,Thank you.
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5066.484,5067.982,That’s the point though.
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5083.719,5087.621,"And therefore, it would have to be rejected."
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5148.212,5150.446,In page?

1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5154.32,5154.723,Thank you.
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5154.723,5158.403,"I’m sorry, page 3 of the petition for certiorari."
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5158.403,5159.4,Page 3 of the --
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5159.4,5161.417,"Petition for certiorari, yes sir."
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5343.599,5346.001,"Well, may I ask?"
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5349.034,5351.902,The District Court initially abstained.
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5351.902,5352.884,I know.
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5352.884,5357.215,Then the Court of Appeals reversed it and said that state law is irrelevant.
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5357.215,5357.768,I see.
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5357.768,5360.247,"Because it’s a federal law and, therefore --"
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5360.247,5362.447,"That is in this opinion, is it?"
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5362.447,5364.0,"No, that’s in the -- that’s referred to."
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5367.62,5377.933,"May I ask, what -- would you it be your view, Mr. Pfeffer, that it’s open to us still to direct the abstention if we thought was appropriate thing to do here?"
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5377.933,5385.519,"No, Mr. Justice Brennan, it is our view initially that state law is irrelevant in the sense --"
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5385.519,5389.072,"I know, but suppose we would disagree with you and we thought the --"
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5389.072,5400.13,"State law -- then the only thing that could be done would be, and I think there’s a procedure where you -- that the state law question could be satisfied to the Supreme Court of Missouri, assuming that that is --"
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5400.13,5408.789,"No, my question is whether it would be appropriate for us to vacate, and send this back and direct abstention."
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5410.617,5410.806,You could do that --
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5410.806,5411.593,Student body?
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5411.593,5423.2,"Mr. Justice Brennan, although -- you could do that, but our contention of course, our second condition is that even if state law is not violated that this does violate --"
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5423.2,5423.32,"Yes, I know."
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5423.32,5425.269,-- the Establishment Clause.
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5425.836,5438.009,"But, I gather, any state under this program, it's legislature could adopt the law forbidding any school district of the state from applying to participate in this program."
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5438.009,5438.75,I assume so.
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5438.75,5439.257,Yes.
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5453.971,5455.434,I would assume so.
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5461.607,5471.684,"Well, then if that were so, I think you’d agree, Mr. Pfeffer, then at least there is an issue here that might be avoided by directing abstention."
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5471.684,5476.892,"The only thing I answer, Mr. Justice Brennan, is that except for the original argument, we could not convince the Court of Appeals."
1973.73-62,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5476.892,5479.199,"Well, maybe you convinced us."
1973.73-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5479.199,5492.251,"Mr. Pfeffer, do you agree with the Court of Appeals that under the Wheeler case in the Missouri Courts that dual enrollment is not consistent with the state statute?"
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5492.251,5499.221,I could only say -- are you asking my opinion or the opinion of the State Board of Education?
1973.73-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5499.221,5499.52,I’m not sure.
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5499.52,5500.191,The State Board of Education --
1973.73-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5500.191,5503.505,"I’m asking you what’s your position, here, in this Court as to what state law is on dual enrollment?"
1973.73-62,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,5503.505,5510.889,And our position is that state law is that dual enrollment and sending teachers into --
1973.73-62,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5510.889,5512.049,That isn’t what I ask you.
