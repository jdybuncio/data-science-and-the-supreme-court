1996.95-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.477,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1598, Leroy Young v. Ernest Eugene Harper."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,9.667,13.701,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,114.567,131.64,"Ms. Howard, did the State have any procedures in effect at the time this case arose for a situation like this where one group permitted the preparole but then the Governor subsequently denied parole?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,135.562,136.443,There--
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.443,137.625,--when this case occurred?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,137.625,139.725,--There were some written procedures at that time.
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.809,149.412,So the answer is there wasn't anything that covered this case.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,149.412,150.193,Nothing specific.
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.193,153.943,And subsequently the State has adopted some procedures?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,153.943,171.094,"Several procedures have been adopted by our Pardon and Parole Board since that time, and in 1991, after the time Mr. Harper was already brought back onto the program, our Pardon and Parole Board adopted a policy where they now leave people out for 90 days before reexamining them and determining whether to bring--"
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.094,180.601,"And then it's discretionary with the board whether to terminate it, the pre-parole, simply because the Governor had denied parole?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,180.601,185.587,"--Actually, it's a determination made by our Department of Corrections, which is somewhat confusing in this case."
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.87,195.992,And on what basis do they now make that decision?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,199.093,200.253,"--Yes, it's--"
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.253,204.057,"--with the Department, or do they consider how the prisoner has behaved on pre-parole?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,204.057,209.88,"--It is totally discretionary with the Department, and they derive their authority from this Court's opinion in Meachum v. Fano."
1996.95-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,209.88,210.831,"Well, can they flip a coin?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,210.831,211.722,"Yes, they can."
1996.95-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,211.722,216.435,Under Oklahoma law you would advise the board that they can flip a coin?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,216.435,219.827,I would advise that that would be permissible in this situation.
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.827,227.821,So there... you then take it that the claim before us today doesn't carry a substantive component to it?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,227.821,228.623,No.
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,228.623,231.645,"That you go through the motions of a hearing, but then they can flip a coin."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,231.645,232.717,I'm not--
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.717,234.486,And that gives them due process.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,234.486,235.137,--Right.
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,235.816,236.457,Is that right?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,236.457,243.894,"--Well, I'm not discounting any type of claim, a First Amendment violation or an Eighth Amendment violation, if there were an independent constitutional violation."
1996.95-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.408,254.059,"Well, flipping a--"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,265.188,267.529,"--Again, there's nothing specific in the statute."
1996.95-1598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,295.015,306.045,"But Mr. Harper was asked at the time he was put in this program, he was asked to sign a form, and I'm lcoking at page 5 of the joint appendix."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,306.045,307.344,Yes.
1996.95-1598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,307.344,319.812,"And that form says, reviewed options available in the event of parole denial, and he signs it, and I guess somebody from the Department of Corrections signs it."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,327.997,333.152,"At the end, we don't have anything specific in our regulations saying what those options were."
1996.95-1598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,339.925,344.4,So this was a misrepresentation on the form that they asked him to sign?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,345.759,352.834,"--Well, we don't know for sure if those options are only limited to... to two options of either being brought back in or being stayed out."
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,359.449,361.7,"Well, was staying out, as you put it, one of the options?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,361.7,363.31,--At that time it was not.
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,365.413,377.95,"In fact, as I understand it, some of these individuals who were denied parole were brought back like this particular prisoner, and some were not, is that correct?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,377.95,379.772,At the time--
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,379.772,380.752,Not all of them have been brought back.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,380.752,386.247,"--At the time that Mr. Harper was brought back, everyone in his similar situation was brought back in."
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,386.247,387.457,But that's not the case now?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,387.457,388.288,That is not the case now.
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.288,388.869,Well--
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,390.158,395.771,"Well, there were no options as far as, if you consider the options stay out or come in."
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.771,397.373,What other options would there be?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,397.373,405.618,"Well, like you, I'm somewhat troubled by that language, that I think perhaps it could refer to other types of options once he's back within the prison."
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,414.915,415.335,Your--
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,428.834,431.865,"Do you mean, what is the rationale behind the change, or--"
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,431.865,433.916,"Well, has there been any change in the State statute?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,433.916,437.219,--There has been no change in the State statute with regard to that.
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,440.611,441.372,But that doesn't cover this.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,441.372,441.772,--Right.
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,442.572,447.296,"What does explain as a matter of law, if anything, the difference in treatment?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,447.296,450.488,--I don't know that there's anything as a matter of law.
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,450.488,452.008,So it's a matter of administrative practice?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,452.008,456.473,"It's a matter of administrative policy, which is really my point here, the point we're trying to make in this case."
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,456.473,465.79,"Well, before you go on to that, how is the decision being made today as to whether he... a given prisoner will be brought back or not?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,467.609,468.641,No.
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,468.641,470.761,But how are they making this decision?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,470.761,473.863,A review board in the Department of Corrections is making the decision.
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,473.863,476.415,And what is it grounding its decision on?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,477.787,483.019,"Again, there are no specific statutory or regulatory guidelines, but they--"
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,483.019,483.61,Well--
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,483.61,483.979,--One--
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,483.979,498.08,"--If it's not flipping a coin, wouldn't a hearing with an opportunity to appear and give reasons why one should be brought back or not brought back function as a normal due process hearing would function?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,498.08,506.966,"--It might would function as that, but I think the question here is whether there's a liberty interest in this program such that he's required to have a hearing, and--"
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,506.966,517.921,"But in any case, leaving the liberty interest issue aside, there would be the same function for this hearing that there would be, I presume, for a parole revocation hearing."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,525.746,544.069,"--There would be an argument... there would be... under Meachum v. Fano I keep coming back to, but that case discussed the fact that when you're dealing with classification systems like this one is, that there's no... that there's no right to participate in the decision of whether or not to reclassify."
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,544.9,577.352,"Well, but this is a question which involves not only a reclassification, but a revocation of liberty, and Morrissey and Brewer says expressly, whatever you call it, by whatever name, the liberty in fact is an interest which deserves a hearing before it is revoked, so I don't see why you don't fall within the terms of Morrissey, because you have a) liberty in fact, and b) a discretionary decision about whether to revoke it or not."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,577.352,583.576,"--I think we have to look at the Morrissey v. Brewer opinion closely to determine whether we do really fall under Morrissey, and there are several--"
1996.95-1598,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,583.576,585.377,"Well, you fall within the language that I just referred to."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,586.829,592.501,"--I would agree with that, but I think we also... and the Court talks about this in Morrissey, is you have to look at the function of the program."
1996.95-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,592.501,593.43,"Well, yes."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,615.716,626.613,"That's exactly the point I wanted to make, Your Honor, that when Morrissey talked about parole, Morrissey talked about the fact that parole had been around for 60 years, it was a well-established part of the penal system, and that--"
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,626.613,652.649,"Well, suppose we decided here, at least a majority were to conclude that it is most closely analogous to parole, and therefore Morrissey is some... it's applicable in some respect, do you think the system the State now has in place would suffice if the ultimate decision is arbitrarily decided?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,652.649,661.195,"--The system they now... the State now has in place still does not entitle the inmate to a hearing; so, you know, if this Court were to find that a Morrissey--"
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,661.195,662.427,The new system does not--
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,662.427,663.068,--No.
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,663.068,664.317,--give the inmate a hearing?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,664.317,666.069,"No, it does not."
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,672.511,678.177,"And if this Court thought that Morrissey were applicable, do you defend that system?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,678.177,681.139,If this Court thought--
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,681.139,683.25,If we thought that it was analogous to parole.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,683.25,689.844,"--If you thought that it was like parole such that Morrissey applied, then I think we would have a hard time defending that system."
1996.95-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.844,699.949,"Well, you can't under our due proces cases say that we have a particular scheme here, and it doesn't call for a hearing, and therefore that's the end of it."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,710.996,714.339,"I would agree with that, that first you have to find a liberty interest."
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,714.339,718.823,"May I ask you, you said this is different from parole, and you never quite explained why."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,723.505,727.789,I will answer that question and then I'd like to also make a couple of other comments.
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.162,731.492,Right.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,731.492,732.484,--there are several differences.
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,753.307,757.629,"And you don't think that Morrissey, if he was disrespectful to his parole officer, could have been disciplined?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,757.629,758.831,There's no provision for that.
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.831,759.271,I see.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,759.271,763.692,"Under parole, you're either revoked or you're... there are no provisions--"
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,763.692,764.023,I see.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,766.664,767.245,--Exactly.
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,767.245,767.656,Okay.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,767.656,776.142,Another important... I think a real important point to make is that prisoners on this pre-parole conditional supervision program are earning earned credits within our Department of Corrections.
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,791.241,794.143,These are good time credits shortening the release date?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,794.143,794.473,--Right.
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,794.473,795.984,"Well, can't a person on parole earn those, too?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,795.984,796.454,No.
1996.95-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,798.795,811.184,I would take it... correct me if I'm wrong... that a parolee is subject to a certain amount of increased restrictions if he seems to be not quite adjusting to the instructions of the parole.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,824.204,826.645,"--There may be additional options, depending upon--"
1996.95-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,826.645,838.552,So then that distinction between your pre-parolee respondent here and the parolee in the standard parole case doesn't seem to hold up in your answer to Justice Stevens.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,838.552,850.22,"--Well, the distinction, I believe, is the fact that these... the things that I were mentioning to Justice Stevens show that this inmate, people on pre-parole are continuing to serve their sentence under the Department of Corrections."
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.485,876.106,"Ms. Howard, who administers the pre-parole program."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,878.467,880.691,It's administered by our Department of Corrections.
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,880.691,883.943,Or... and who administers parole?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,886.834,891.868,"It's... the Pardon and Parole Board recommends people for parole, and they ultimately do administer that--"
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.868,899.302,"No, but once they go out on parole, I mean, who takes care of seeing that everybody's abiding by his parole restrictions and so forth?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,899.302,901.835,--Parole officers would report that to the Pardon and Parole Board.
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,901.835,905.335,"Okay, so the Pardon and Parole Board, which is independent of the Bureau of Corrections?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,905.335,906.216,Yes.
1996.95-1598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,918.345,923.938,So the supervisor while he's at liberty would be the same whether he's on parole or pre-parole?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,923.938,928.57,The specific employee might be the same.
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.879,955.908,"But the judgment whether to bring him back, for example, or whether to impose some kind of a sanction, whether it's more frequent consultation with a parole officer or denial of good time credits or whatever else, that judgment is made by the warden or by the Department of Corrections?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,955.908,957.421,"--The Department of Corrections, yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,957.421,958.219,Not by the parole board?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,958.219,958.8,No.
1996.95-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,961.892,970.027,I still am not quite clear on the reasons that this respondent could have been brought back at the... under the regulations then in force.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1005.43,1015.638,"That gets us to the point that this Court recently made in Sandin, which is that you don't look at language like that and pick it apart in a mechanical manner."
1996.95-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1024.134,1028.017,"It says two things, you may be removed, which indicates there's some discretion, for a reason."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1028.017,1037.132,"--But that doesn't leave an implication that you may not be removed for any other reason, and that's exactly what this Court was talking about most recently in--"
1996.95-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1037.132,1039.173,"Well then, I don't know why you described the program in that way."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1039.173,1042.025,--In... I'm sorry.
1996.95-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1042.025,1048.128,It seems to me your description is completely unnecessary if no reason at all is necessary to be given.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1048.128,1052.674,We're describing the program as a reclassification system.
1996.95-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1067.993,1085.453,"I don't have the joint appendix before me, Ms. Howard, but what exactly... you say the inmate was aware he can be reclassified to be in fact brought back for several... including the Governor has denied the inmate parole."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1093.059,1097.353,"Again, I would admit to you there's no specific language I can point to that says--"
1996.95-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1097.353,1100.105,"Well, is there general language you can point to?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1100.105,1101.857,--General language that he's on a community level.
1996.95-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1106.119,1111.963,"Yes, but now, that's drawing a legal conclusion, but I'm curious to know just what's there."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1111.963,1121.349,"--We also have a statute, title 57, section 512, which says that the prison officials may transfer between institutions."
1996.95-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1121.349,1125.932,So the prison officials in effect regarded this as just another form of confinement.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1125.932,1126.422,Exactly.
1996.95-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1126.422,1129.163,Except it wasn't in the prison.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1129.163,1135.628,"Well, it... the restrictions that were placed on the inmate were such that it is a type of confinement."
1996.95-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1158.653,1163.177,"Well, what restrictions were placed on him that were different from restrictions placed on parolees?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1163.177,1170.57,"As I was mentioning earlier, if he escapes, then he's subject to escape charges, criminal charges for escape."
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1216.011,1219.463,May I ask a pretty... maybe it's the same question the Chief Justice asked in another way.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1237.914,1248.172,"--If you're talking about day-to-day functions like, you know, visiting with his family and, you know, going on about--"
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1248.172,1250.182,"And going to work, and going to the movies, or whatever it is."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1250.182,1253.505,--Then I can't think of anything specific in a day-to-day--
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.505,1254.817,I thought he couldn't leave the State.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1255.187,1259.759,--He... the medical... I wanted to make a point about if he needs medical treatment he has to go back in for it.
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1261.331,1264.432,--What about... what if the parolee... couldn't parolee go back in for medical treatment?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1264.432,1266.174,--Not unless his parole were revoked.
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1266.875,1268.134,"He could not... oh, not unless his parole is revoked."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1268.134,1268.485,--Yes.
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.478,1273.578,"Can he leave the State, the parolee?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1273.578,1274.269,--He cannot leave the State.
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.269,1275.871,So he's better off than the parolee.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1276.242,1278.734,A parolee can leave the State with permission.
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1287.849,1295.663,"--But on the medical point you made, I think you're saying that the person on pre-parole is better off than the parolee, right, because he has an option the parolee doesn't have."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1295.663,1303.868,"--There are certain things about the program, if you just look at one isolated portion like that, that make it appear to be better, but overall, when you look at the true nature of the program--"
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1303.868,1307.731,"Because he wouldn't... if he could pay for the doctor himself, he could go to his own doctor, just like the parolee could."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1307.731,1308.452,--Right.
1996.95-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.452,1312.596,"Well, of course, in that sense all of the people still in prison are better off than the parolee."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1313.465,1313.785,Exactly.
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.646,1318.918,"Well, he is confined to the county, and the parolee is confined to the State."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1318.918,1324.274,A parolee is technically released from his sentence of imprisonment.
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1330.457,1330.797,Yes.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1331.939,1332.64,I'm sorry.
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1332.64,1336.259,"The parolee is confined to the State, is that right?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1336.259,1338.632,I don't know that he's--
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.632,1339.372,Unless he gets permission.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1339.372,1341.775,"--that he's... oh, physically confined to the State."
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.775,1342.474,Yes.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1342.474,1343.886,"I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question."
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.886,1344.196,Yes.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1344.196,1345.137,"Yes, he is."
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1345.137,1348.497,And the pre-parolee is confined to the county.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1348.497,1349.989,Right.
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1349.989,1351.47,"That's a pretty big difference, I suppose."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1360.747,1372.735,"Well, because of the nature of the program, I'd say about a year generally, if they continue on the program, because pre-parole is considered a year earlier than parole is considered."
1996.95-1598,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1372.735,1382.571,"Are there people who were released for a year before their consideration of parole, and then parole was denied, who have remained out?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1382.571,1384.982,There may be people like that now.
1996.95-1598,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1389.905,1392.887,And how many people would you say approximately are on this program?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1392.887,1398.601,"About... at this time I would say about 1,200 or so are probably on the program."
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1401.553,1420.265,"Does the parole board consider different factors in determining whether a particular prisoner should get pre-parole, such as whether he will be a threat if put on pre-parole to society, and his chances of meeting the requirements and so forth?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1421.637,1428.2,"Again, I hate to keep saying this, but there's nothing in our statute which sets forth what considerations the parole board should make."
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1428.2,1431.733,Is there anything in the statute about what they consider for parole?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1431.733,1432.614,Certain people are--
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1432.614,1435.205,Anything in the statute?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1435.205,1436.817,"--Not specifically, no."
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1436.817,1442.849,And do we have any reason to know whether they consider the same or different factors?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1442.849,1451.405,"I think one reason that we would know that is that with pre-parole we look at the purpose of the program, which is to alleviate overcrowding."
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1451.405,1455.899,"So even if it's a triple ax murderer, you'd automatically give them pre-parole?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1455.899,1459.17,"Not automatically, but they may be given pre-parole--"
1996.95-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1459.17,1464.063,"They wouldn't consider, you think, whether they're going to be a threat on release?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1464.063,1469.666,"--They certainly may consider that, and... but I... but they are not required to consider that."
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.666,1472.158,May I ask another question along Justice O'Connor's line?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1483.956,1487.759,"It might be permissible, but there are no specific guidelines for when--"
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.759,1491.423,So overcrowding could play a role in either decision.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1491.423,1493.015,"--It possibly could, but--"
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.015,1493.246,Yes.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1493.246,1494.367,--with this program--
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1494.367,1496.318,It specifically is a response to overcrowding.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1496.538,1497.587,--it was the focus of the program.
1996.95-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1497.587,1497.887,Yes.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1497.887,1500.49,"And in doing that, they might have to consider who best to let out."
1996.95-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1508.075,1512.847,"If everybody else is a quadruple ax muroerer, they would presumably let out the triple ax murderer, right?"
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1512.847,1513.598,--Right.
1996.95-1598,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1513.598,1515.108,But would they do the same--
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1515.108,1516.56,Or the double murderer such as Mr. Harper.
1996.95-1598,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1516.56,1518.44,--But would they do the same thing in bringing people back?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1531.991,1542.848,"I'm not aware of any situations where they've done that, because to this point we've never had any extra cells, but I think pursuant to our program we could, if the Department of Corrections chose to do that."
1996.95-1598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1545.429,1558.377,But I thought that under the program currently someone is kept in the program even if they're denied parole until there's a 90-day period when they decide what will be done with the person.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1558.377,1564.572,"--They may be left out for 90 days and then still a determination is made whether to bring them back or not, but they're still not entitled to a hearing at that--"
1996.95-1598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1564.572,1579.332,"In terms of what is told to a person who is entering such a program, we've already established that we don't know what options there were, but he was also asked, Harper was asked to sign another thing, and this is on page 9 of the joint appendix."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1593.761,1597.253,"--Refusing to be considered, or deciding not to be considered for parole."
1996.95-1598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1597.253,1604.727,He would... why a... would someone decide that they don't want to be considered for parole?
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1604.727,1619.318,"It gets back to the point that Justice Stevens was making earlier, that there are some situations where pre-parole is more advantageous, and because a defendant is earning credits while he's out on pre-parole, in addition to flat time served, he may get out earlier on pre-parole--"
1996.95-1598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1619.318,1626.243,"But this says that if he does that... if he waives parole, this says, while he's on pre-parole status, back he goes."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1628.194,1642.582,"--That's to prevent the situation, as an inmate, trying to manipulate the system that way, staying out on pre-parole rather than being placed on parole, where society would have their interests filled by having him in a program where he's being rehabilitated into society."
1996.95-1598,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1642.582,1651.037,"So this is telling him, you must be considered for parole when your time comes up, otherwise you go right back."
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1651.037,1652.129,Exactly.
1996.95-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1730.609,1731.4,Which you don't have.
1996.95-1598,0,41460,sandra_d_howard,,1732.202,1732.562,Thank you.
1996.95-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.562,1733.571,--Ms. Howard.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,1735.334,1741.178,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1774.78,1785.867,"Do you think the Morrissey opinion was entitled... was intended to apply to every single program that a State might set up under the name of parole, no matter what the conditions of it were?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,1785.867,1786.637,No.
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1786.637,1792.653,"Then you really have to examine the Oklahoma program, don't you--"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,1792.653,1792.82,Yes.
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.82,1798.276,--to see what would be Morrissey's impact on it in terms of a duty process hearing?
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,1798.276,1813.844,"Yes, I agree, and what we are really saying is, is that in the State of Oklahoma they have created two programs, two parole programs, both of which fall well within the parameters discussed in Morrissey."
1996.95-1598,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1832.668,1848.927,"Do you agree with counsel for the State that pre-parole can be revoked for any reason or no reason at all... that pre-parole can be revoked, that the respondent can be told to report to Correction for any reason or no reason at all?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,1850.479,1851.2,--No.
1996.95-1598,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1854.011,1867.94,"I tried to find out from opposing counsel, the counsel for the State of Oklahoma, the grounds upon which pre-parole could be revoked, and I thought the answer was any reason at all."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,1885.592,1891.155,--That statute doesn't say.
1996.95-1598,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1893.956,1895.338,Do you agree with that interpretation?
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,1895.338,1901.242,--I don't know exactly what Your Honor is asking.
1996.95-1598,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1912.309,1925.787,"Well... well, apart from due process, under State law, are there any principles that guide the Board of Corrections in determining to revoke pre-parole status?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,1925.787,1930.932,In... this case was heard in State court.
1996.95-1598,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1940.897,1946.741,"Well, would you agree... would you agree that the Board of Corrections can give no reason at all, say, well, we're... I'm bored today."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,1952.344,1954.886,"--Well, we're here to see that he can't do that."
1996.95-1598,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1955.237,1958.088,I'm talking about under State law.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,1958.088,1961.002,--There is... the statute doesn't speak to this.
1996.95-1598,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1975.729,2000.005,"I think they would suggest the opposite, and I think the form that is set forth at pages 4, 5, and 6 of the joint appendix indicates that he has a certain expectation... that's the word the form used... that he is expected to be in compliance with all of these rules, which would indicate to me that under the State's procedure, discretion has certain boundaries."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2000.005,2036.781,"Under the form that Mr. Harper signed, the time... the form that was used at the time he was let out, the last thing he's expected to sign off on after having been given all the rules and procedures is a statement, I understand that my being released into the community is dependent upon my compliance with all of these expectations, and so it seems to me clear that at the time that he was released, at least the Department of Corrections and the parole board understood that they couldn't do it for any reason or no reason."
1996.95-1598,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.781,2037.53,"Oh, I... it doesn't mean that."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2045.566,2046.508,"Well, you see--"
1996.95-1598,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.508,2053.181,"But you're sort of compelled to argue, aren't you... don't you really have to answer yes to the question Justice Kennedy was asking?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2071.743,2074.235,--It seems to me that what the--
1996.95-1598,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.235,2077.527,"I mean, your client comes in and says, you know, you pulled me back, and... yes, we did."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2082.59,2084.83,--It certainly would be useless.
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2091.735,2117.873,"All right, so why on that very point... I... there's a State court finding here that the reason that your client was removed from the program was because he was not granted parole by the Governor of Oklahoma, and they found that, I guess, in Judge Lumpkin's opinion, dispositive of the issue is the fact he was not granted parole by the Governor of Oklahoma, right?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2117.873,2118.925,No--
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2118.925,2119.726,That's what it says.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2124.808,2125.8,--I believe--
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2125.8,2127.581,40a of your... of their petition.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2127.581,2130.863,"--The Court may be looking at the district, the U.S. district court opinion."
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2130.863,2136.666,"I'm looking at page 40a of the appendix, where it says, Gary Lumpkin, the presiding... maybe it's a different case, or--"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2186.868,2199.808,"I... looking at everything that the court of appeals says, they say that we believe that the procedure, that is, the procedure that says--"
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.808,2201.408,I'm not asking about procedure.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2206.672,2207.052,"--No, the--"
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2207.052,2208.534,--Court of Criminal Appeals that Justice Breyer is talking about?
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2208.534,2209.155,--Court of Criminal Appeals.
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2209.155,2209.714,Yes.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2223.603,2227.016,"Yes, but it seems to--"
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2227.016,2227.324,All right.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2233.458,2236.102,--That's correct.
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2236.102,2236.341,Am I right about that?
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2236.341,2236.801,That's correct.
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2236.801,2237.222,All right.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2247.459,2248.109,That's--
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2248.109,2259.468,"--and if, in fact, he was removed because he wasn't given parole, and if that isn't in dispute, what would there possibly be in this case to have a hearing about?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2259.468,2262.897,--I don't think that that is what the Court of Criminal--
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2262.897,2264.44,I know it isn't what they said.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2280.359,2280.81,--Yes.
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2280.81,2281.3,Yes.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2281.3,2281.621,Correct.
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2281.621,2282.032,All right.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2297.652,2303.406,There's a... the purpose of having a hearing here is exactly the same as it is in Morrissey.
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2311.801,2314.893,"Well, it's not just they say, it's the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma that says."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2314.893,2316.143,--That's fine.
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2324.53,2327.142,"Well, but you say it becomes a triggering event."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2336.717,2338.379,--That would be a different case.
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2338.379,2346.653,"Well, how... but there isn't any intimation in the opinion of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals that more factors somehow are involved."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2346.653,2348.424,But I think there is.
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2361.703,2370.67,Nobody says that parole revocation is a necess... there might be other reasons why you might revoke a person's pre-parole.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2384.368,2384.678,But--
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2384.678,2385.66,--under Oklahoma law.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2396.406,2406.824,"--Why don't we assume that it is a sufficient reason, just as a parole violation is a sufficient reason, but the court doesn't stop... the court says you can't stop with a sufficient reason."
1996.95-1598,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2407.603,2408.103,"Well, wait a minute."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2429.808,2432.439,--I think that that would be a different case.
1996.95-1598,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2432.439,2440.985,"Well, the suggestion being made to you is it is the same case as when an Oklahoma court says that is what State law is."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2453.694,2455.575,Would you mind posing the question to me again?
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.575,2469.983,"Well, it's the same... I mean, to add to that is, of course you might be entitled to a hearing if it were in dispute as to whether the Governor had in fact or not revoked the parole, but there is no dispute--"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2499.853,2504.118,The assertion that it wasn't true then is nothing but an assertion.
1996.95-1598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2511.46,2513.952,"Well, they document when the new rules came in."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2537.818,2538.549,I would agree.
1996.95-1598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2538.549,2542.292,"So the question is, is that what we have in this case?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2551.007,2552.898,I do have one caveat.
1996.95-1598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2565.457,2568.719,"The reason is, the Governor denies parole."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2577.385,2584.559,"--In a situation like this, where it happens quickly, I think that makes it like a furlough problem and that there's no problem with that."
1996.95-1598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2586.03,2594.225,"Well, the question is, is that what this statute says, because a 90-day period didn't come in until later."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2594.225,2602.56,"The record has so much evidence, including a dozen statements by the Attorney General in its briefs."
1996.95-1598,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2646.739,2648.792,"That is an essential part of your case, though."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2664.481,2667.081,"Yes, that that was not the policy."
1996.95-1598,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2667.081,2678.211,"Does the record tell us whether there were... I think your opponent said there were something like 1,200 people in the program, and does the record tell us whether or not when other people had their parole denied they were automatically taken off the program?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2678.211,2679.92,"No, the record doesn't tell us that."
1996.95-1598,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.674,2690.279,"I suppose then the question is, who has the burden of establishing what the rule of law was?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2690.279,2693.141,"Well, it seems to me that--"
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2693.141,2696.564,Your client was the plaintiff in the Federal court.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2697.672,2699.834,--Our client was pro se.
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2701.597,2704.518,"Well, does that change the burden because he was pro se?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2704.518,2711.332,--I think it changes the burden that he asked for an evidentiary hearing in the Court of Criminal Appeals and in the Federal courts.
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2712.722,2714.513,"Well now, wait a minute."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2733.396,2742.313,--I'm not sure that it's... I think that the pro se habeas plaintiff is entitled at some stage to a full and fair hearing.
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2742.313,2745.695,"Well, he's got a right to a full and fair hearing on disputed facts."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2745.695,2749.478,This is a fact that at the time was not disputed.
1996.95-1598,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.215,2798.949,"Well, isn't that argument the same as the argument that he had to go back?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2811.388,2813.029,"No, I don't think it's at all incredible."
1996.95-1598,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.798,2833.521,"Indeed, if that were the law, they couldn't have adopted the 90-day procedure."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2833.521,2834.482,--No.
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2840.517,2841.546,You're talking about now the Tenth Circuit?
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2841.546,2842.267,"No, the--"
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2842.267,2843.228,The Court of Criminal Appeals.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2843.228,2851.163,"--Criminal Appeals, and the Court of Criminal Appeals said in an interim order, which is in the record, please show me the... I want to see the law."
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2885.136,2885.817,What... what--
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2885.817,2886.145,It simply didn't arise.
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2886.145,2887.217,--I've another question.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2927.432,2928.093,A half--
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2928.093,2928.874,So what is your response?
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2938.992,2945.985,"--I think it's not too... I'm sure there could be grey areas, but at this point I've seen nothing that's a seriously grey area."
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2953.39,2955.632,Home under house arrest would be different?
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2955.632,2957.432,--That could be different.
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2957.432,2967.019,"The line they want to draw is a line which says, look to whether authorities have retained virtually total discretion to revoke it."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,2985.192,3017.222,"That it's not just about expectations, it's being out of prison, and that once you've crossed the threshold of the prison door and you are told get a life, get a job, go to work, pay your bills, have relations with other human beings, have friends and family and come and go and go to the movies and to the grocery store, you know that you're not in prison, and when you know that you're not in prison, something very precious has happened, and it shouldn't be taken away without a hearing."
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3055.898,3058.008,But I thought you said the record simply didn't show on that point.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3058.008,3064.964,I think that the reason it doesn't show is because it's a newly developed theory of the case.
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3064.964,3078.411,"Well, but then you really don't have the factual basis to say the Governor... that... or the board retained discretion, if the record simply doesn't show what happened to other people whose parole was denied by the Governor."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3078.411,3094.403,"Well, Chief Justice, it seems to me that even if, in 1990, when Ernest Harper was let out of prison, there was an unvarying practice of bringing people back to jail when parole was denied by the Governor, that wouldn't necessarily show that there was a policy."
1996.95-1598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3116.766,3117.297,They didn't say it is.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3118.568,3119.678,It could be.
1996.95-1598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3119.678,3128.105,"--as far as the Constitution is concerned, because there's nothing to which due process right could attach, a due proces procedural right."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3147.147,3155.031,"That was... that regulation came into being 5 months after he was returned to prison in August, I believe."
1996.95-1598,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3155.031,3158.403,May I ask if there was a statutory change during that 5-month period?
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3158.403,3162.627,There was a statutory change as follows.
1996.95-1598,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3171.453,3173.735,"Before you do, will you tell me what the statutory change was?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3173.735,3191.836,"--It's one that says... there's an identical provision for both parolees and pre-parolees, and I believe they were enacted at the same time, and that provision says, if you don't keep up with the educational and job requirements that we put on you as a condition, you will become ineligible for parole, and that's the only thing--"
1996.95-1598,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.836,3200.191,And does either the statute before or after that amendment make any reference to the Governor's denial of parole as a reason for terminating pre-parole?
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3200.191,3201.833,"--No, neither before nor after."
1996.95-1598,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3204.165,3211.338,"But we do have this opinion of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, is it?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3211.338,3211.899,--Yes.
1996.95-1598,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3211.899,3228.601,"Which denied the respondent's writ of habeas at the State level saying, dispositive of the issue in petitioner's case is the fact that he was not granted parole by the Governor."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3258.02,3264.592,I believe that what they're saying is that it is... they are--
1996.95-1598,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3264.592,3266.765,What if we read it that way anyway?
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3266.765,3269.718,--May I... I just want to make sure that I'm understanding the question.
1996.95-1598,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3275.451,3276.351,That's not the question.
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3276.351,3279.983,They... they understood it--
1996.95-1598,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3279.983,3303.218,"The court understood that dispositive of the habeas petition in this very case is the fact that he was not granted, eventually, parole by the Governor, and it was for that reason that his status was revoked, not for some disciplinary reason or some other reason."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3303.218,3305.659,--I believe that I misspoke before--
1996.95-1598,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3305.659,3309.583,"Now, what if we interpret that... not you."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3320.94,3332.668,"--Then it seems to me that you should find... you should say that the State law denies due process, and that people must have a hearing, because--"
1996.95-1598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3332.668,3339.132,"A hearing to do what, because I think as... first, there's no dispute on the fact that it wasn't any disciplinary reason, right?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3339.622,3340.163,--Yes.
1996.95-1598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3340.163,3341.372,--that the only reason given--
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3341.372,3342.033,Yes.
1996.95-1598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3342.033,3347.467,"--was that the Governor denied parole, so there'd be no hearing to decide what was the reason."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3352.89,3353.501,Yes.
1996.95-1598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3353.501,3357.625,"--pre-parolee, and he was called back for one reason only, that parole was denied."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3357.625,3368.451,In parole... a person can admit that they have violated a condition of their release and they're still entitled to a hearing because there's a second decision.
1996.95-1598,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3390.677,3412.89,"Are you saying that as a result of this pre-release, pre-parole scheme that the discretion the Governor previously had, which I assume was unreviewable, is now in some sense subject to a due process requirement simply because he was on release before the Governor made his discretionary decision?"
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3413.701,3422.797,"--No, not at all, Justice Souter, because there's a huge difference between parole... refusal to grant someone parole and bringing them back into prison."
1996.95-1598,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3422.797,3424.447,But all the examples--
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3435.494,3435.904,Yes.
1996.95-1598,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3435.904,3439.497,"--for revoking pre-parole, not that it is an automatic and mandatory reason."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3440.478,3441.249,Yes.
1996.95-1598,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3441.249,3447.414,"And your point is that if it is only a permissible reason, he should have the opportunity to argue that in this case it shouldn't be permitted."
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3447.414,3449.304,Exactly.
1996.95-1598,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3449.304,3451.255,Which is the purpose of the 90-day----
1996.95-1598,1,36844,margaret_winter,,3468.478,3470.648,"Yes, exactly."
1996.95-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3475.922,3477.338,"Thank you, Ms. Winter."
