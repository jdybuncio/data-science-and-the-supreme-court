2000.00-276,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.108,"We'll hear argument first this morning on No. 00-276, the United States and the Department of Agriculture v. United Foods, Inc.--"
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,11.3,13.754,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,46.753,47.934,Not in their view?
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,47.934,61.994,"Not entirely, Your Honor, no, but Congress is entitled in this sort of economic program to make the determination that the interests of the industry as a whole would benefit from such a program."
2000.00-276,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,61.994,63.807,"Well, you speak of the economic program."
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,70.8,75.414,"Well, the program is not limited to advertising, Justice Souter."
2000.00-276,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,88.522,96.608,"But I take it it's your position that if it were solely confined to advertising, it would be constitutional nonetheless."
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,96.608,112.147,"That's correct, Justice Kennedy, as long as Congress has a legitimate interest in strengthening the market for a particular agricultural commodity, Congress is entitled under Wileman to enact this sort of program and impose it upon an industry."
2000.00-276,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,112.147,116.111,Is this commercial speech that is within the First Amendment for some purposes?
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,116.111,117.793,"Yes, it is, commercial speech."
2000.00-276,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,127.931,137.515,So your position is that in some instances industries or persons can be compelled to contribute to commercial speech when there is no other program that's connected with it?
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,137.515,138.286,That's correct.
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,147.263,150.725,And you say it can't cover ideological speech.
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,170.229,175.621,"--Well, then presumably you wouldn't be a mushroom producer and you wouldn't be covered by this statute."
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.621,177.863,"Oh, no, I produce them to make them happy."
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,181.185,188.822,"Well, I still think in those circumstances you would be outside the statute because you wouldn't be selling them for consumption."
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,189.273,191.013,Would it be ideological?
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,206.864,228.206,"--It's a line that the Court drew in Wileman Brothers itself contrasting those sorts of objections of fruit producers with the kinds of objections that were asserted in cases like Abood and Keller, objections to, for example, a nuclear freeze initiative that the California bar had supported or contributions to political candidates in the Abood context."
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,228.206,233.592,So nuclear freezes and political candidates are ideological.
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,233.592,236.264,"Those would clearly fall on that side of the line, whereas--"
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,236.264,236.674,Free economy is not?
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,236.674,237.553,--Pardon me?
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.553,238.935,Free economy is not?
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,238.935,249.653,"Well, certainly respondent and others are free, notwithstanding the Mushroom Act to express their own views about the benefits of a free economy."
2000.00-276,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,249.653,261.728,"Ms. McDowell, I take it you're making a point that in that respect it's no different from Wileman, but you've gotten away from a point that you started on when Justice Kennedy put a question to you."
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,283.154,286.587,"Yes, in fact, Justice Ginsburg, other programs are going on."
2000.00-276,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,312.445,327.553,"Is it correct, as your opponent in the red brief says, that there are actually two different rather dramatically different kinds of programs in the Department of Agriculture and that this is not in the same group that the one in Wileman was involved in?"
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,327.553,354.0,"Well, it's true, Justice Stevens, that the program in Wileman Brothers was authorized under the Agricultural Marketing Agreements Act and programs authorized under that Act sometimes, in most cases, in fact, do include other regulations, but there are some 11 promotion, research, and consumer information programs that are quite similar to this one, including the ones in the beef, pork, and cotton industries."
2000.00-276,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,369.382,369.912,But did those--
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.912,377.047,--I presume you can be forced to contribute to a program that is clearly against your economic interests.
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,392.999,399.824,"Well, that was certainly one of the complaints that was raised in Wileman Brothers, and it wasn't given constitutional significance."
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,399.824,400.773,So your answer is yes?
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,400.773,410.42,Presumably Congress could determine that there were benefits to be obtained to the entire industry by promotion that focused at least in one year on particular products.
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.42,414.273,And make you contribute to the saying that my competitor's product is better than mine?
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,414.273,420.108,"Presumably Congress could do that, Justice Scalia, but that's not what this program does."
2000.00-276,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,420.108,446.343,"But in Wileman, the argument, I didn't think it was a persuasive one, but the argument that carried the day in Wileman was that the restrictions on speech, which I agree fall within Justice Scalia's hypo were justified because they were incidental to and they were germane to what was a true act of market regulation."
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,460.983,466.269,"That's correct, but I would disagree with your premise that there were quantity controls in Wileman Brothers."
2000.00-276,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,469.361,471.331,"I'm sorry, you're right."
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,478.948,479.108,Yes.
2000.00-276,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,486.532,492.158,"Well, what do you make of the germaneness argument in Wileman and its relation to this case?"
2000.00-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,532.453,540.367,"Ms. McDowell, is that perhaps why you raise an alternative argument, that this, in fact, is Government speech?"
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,540.367,543.87,"We had raised that alternative argument, Justice O'Connor."
2000.00-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,543.87,551.366,And is it because of this problem that you've been listening to this morning that it doesn't appear to be part of a broader regulatory program?
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,551.366,556.83,We raised the Government speech argument because we think it's also a viable argument.
2000.00-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,556.83,559.451,Was that argument made below?
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,559.451,561.17,"No, it wasn't made below."
2000.00-276,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,568.907,570.129,And are you going to address it in your argument?
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,570.129,586.261,"Yes, I will, if I could just return briefly to Justice Souter's question because I think our argument in Wileman Brothers and how we read the Court's opinion is not that the generic advertising program has to be germane to some separate regulatory program."
2000.00-276,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,586.261,590.371,Then why did the court spend all the time that it did discussing germaneness?
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,590.371,603.782,"Well, as we understand the Court's opinion, the Court was saying that the generic advertising program was germane to Congress's interest in strengthening and stabilizing the market for an agricultural product, and that's precisely the same interest--"
2000.00-276,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,603.782,622.493,"So in that case then you're simply saying that the advertising scheme was in effect germane to a general scheme of addressing the desirability of marketing this material, and that seems to me to read the germaneness requirement right out of, you know, right out of any significance."
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,622.493,624.015,--We would disagree.
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.296,641.739,"Well, if you're... I'm sorry."
2000.00-276,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,641.739,667.087,"Couldn't at least one read... there may be ambiguity in it, but Wileman to have alternative arguments that is one is the germaneness thing, but then I think the Court used expressions like in any event, which sounds like that's a self standing ground, that it wasn't necessary to have both, if it had either, it would do."
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,667.087,675.852,"The opinion certainly can be read in that manner, and here, as in Wileman Brothers, there is no political or ideological content to the speech."
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.852,689.721,"Ms. McDowell, if germaneness to a Government regulatory program is irrelevant, how do you explain the limitations we've placed upon compulsory union dues?"
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,706.991,726.076,"Yes, the Court has so held in cases such as Lehnert where the Court allowed nonmembers' dues to be used to fund certain union programs which were not ideological and were not particularly germane to the purpose of collective bargaining but were nonetheless considered to be permissible."
2000.00-276,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,726.076,735.333,"So the line gets back to ideology again, and I do want you to address the Government speech argument Justice O'Connor... let me, just one hypothetical."
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,756.376,769.486,"We would still view that I think as a commercial message, but it would be somewhat more problematic because the clothing producers would be required to fund a program that's directly contrary to their interests."
2000.00-276,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,769.486,774.659,"But you're controlling consumer tastes, demands, attitudes."
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,794.991,799.104,"It's a somewhat more difficult question than this one, Justice Kennedy, I will agree with you."
2000.00-276,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,818.847,821.21,"Oh, so now you have to have some special Government interest?"
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,821.21,825.033,Pardon me?
2000.00-276,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,825.033,830.338,"Now you have to have some special Government interest, some compelling interest that the Government is accomplishing?"
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,830.338,836.533,Perhaps an important interest under the Abood standard if one is to view this as ideological speech.
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.533,845.068,Do you know the last case in which a tax scheme was stricken down because the objects of it were irrational?
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,845.068,849.71,"It happens rarely, Your Honor, but perhaps Congress could be--"
2000.00-276,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,849.71,853.563,"Very, very rarely rational basis of taxation is almost anything goes."
2000.00-276,0,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,862.141,876.49,"--Well, the Court certainly has done that in instances where the group singled out the taxation was, for example, the media, but obviously the hypothetical posited by Justice Kennedy wouldn't involve that."
2000.00-276,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1567.87,1572.854,Thank you.
2000.00-276,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1674.522,1679.654,"Mr. Tribe, how does that differ from some tree fruits that were covered and others weren't in Wileman?"
2000.00-276,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1679.654,1702.81,"Not at all, but in Wileman you had an economic regulation essentially, and as the Chief Justice pointed out in his concurring opinion in the Greater New Orleans case, the various haphazard features of the commercial regulation there, of commercial speech might have been constitutionally tolerable if Congress had undertaken substantively to regulate the gambling industry."
2000.00-276,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1759.878,1761.681,Why is it astonishing?
2000.00-276,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1781.603,1781.783,Sure.
2000.00-276,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1781.783,1784.204,--lots of things that are not the slightest bit absurd.
2000.00-276,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1784.204,1784.895,Right.
2000.00-276,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1784.895,1787.887,And you're saying that all those things are unconstitutional?
2000.00-276,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1787.887,1788.147,I'm not.
2000.00-276,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1799.986,1800.156,"Oh, no, there isn't."
2000.00-276,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1801.648,1802.968,"Well, who is the we in your question?"
2000.00-276,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1802.968,1821.229,"The we is that they have the museum council, and the museum council is told by statute to collect ten cents on each ticket to advertise museums in the inner city or we have the tobacco council, and the tobacco council is told to collect 50 cents a pack to advertise that tobacco smoking is bad for you."
2000.00-276,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1824.003,1841.054,"Well, it seems to me that I really should turn to whether this is speech for which the Government bears responsibility because it seems to me that in all of your cases, whether the ultimate vehicle for the speech is the tobacco council or the Government, it's the Government's message."
2000.00-276,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.214,1914.041,"Well, to what extent do you have to, you know, if you lose a case in the court of appeals, your common sense tells you have a little bit different emphasis in the Supreme Court, maybe you'll win."
2000.00-276,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1914.041,1916.394,"--Oh, I understand their reasons for doing it."
2000.00-276,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.525,1935.334,But we're talking about the First Amendment.
2000.00-276,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1941.409,1970.767,"I'm not saying the Court lacks jurisdiction, but I'm saying in order to establish that the Government is really responsible for these messages, despite the fact that under the regulations and the statute, the secretary cannot, in fact, reject a message for any reason other than that the program established by the Mushroom Council, it violates the statute, or that the message derogates another individual's product."
2000.00-276,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3309.931,3323.261,"I did want to correct the suggestion that, as Mr. Tribe put it, the Secretary of Agriculture does not have general censorial power over the speech of the Mushroom Council."
2000.00-276,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3392.417,3395.99,"Thank you, Ms. McDowell, the case is submitted."
