2005.04-881,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.254,We will hear argument next in Lockhart versus United States.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,4.995,8.348,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-881,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,109.468,122.017,"Did... are... just as an initial matter, are you sure that one Congress can bind a future Congress that way, that Congress can pass a law that says, you know,"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,129.294,130.125,--Well--
2005.04-881,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,130.125,145.115,"And then you have a future Congress that makes its intent entirely clear in a statute that does not use the magic words. I thought our cases held that, in such a situation, the will of the future Congress prevails--"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,145.115,146.316,--That--
2005.04-881,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,146.316,147.618,--so long as it's clearly expressed.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,147.618,150.221,--I will say that that is something that we've considered.
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,186.616,191.441,"It didn't contain the bar at the time that they said, ""You can collect it""."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,199.778,200.808,"--Yes, it did."
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,200.808,205.112,"I thought the Higher Education Act said... as of what year did the Higher Education Act say,"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,209.646,211.136,That was 1991.
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,211.136,211.557,Fine.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,212.067,212.418,Yes.
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,212.418,213.219,"--1991, it said,"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,228.741,231.353,That occurred in 1996.
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,231.873,232.094,All right.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,233.422,233.943,--The reason that's--
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,233.943,241.88,"--so there was no... there was no statute of limitations applying to the Social Security Act; and then, in 1996, they say, ""And now go get 'em""."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,241.88,243.38,--Because--
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,243.38,243.92,What can we do about that?
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,243.92,248.865,"--Because, with respect, that's not what Congress said in 1996."
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,248.865,249.566,What did they say?
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,249.566,250.427,"They didn't say, ""Go get 'em""."
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,265.077,266.85,It has a 10 year bar.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,266.85,280.361,"--Yes, but... but, again, getting back... and I think this takes us back to Justice Scalia's question... that... the... there is a broad anti attachment provision."
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,338.922,343.036,"So, in other words, you're saying that that provision of the later statute that says,"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,351.401,351.731,"Well, I--"
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,351.731,352.752,"So, it's as if it said,"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,358.176,358.817,--Well--
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,358.817,360.76,Is that what your... I'm trying to understand this.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,360.76,361.097,--That is our argument.
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,361.097,361.318,Yes.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,361.318,361.999,That is our argument.
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,361.999,362.209,Okay.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,362.209,363.561,But I would only qualify it--
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,363.561,364.58,"The only problem is, it doesn't say that."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,364.58,366.842,"--No, I would disagree, Your Honor."
2005.04-881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,395.913,396.133,Are--
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,396.133,396.774,--the statute--
2005.04-881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,396.774,400.957,--Are you saying that this has a purpose other than barring stable... stale claims?
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,417.467,420.389,"--Well, what it says--"
2005.04-881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,420.389,421.501,I think... because I think that would help you.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,421.501,424.172,"--Yes, and I think... that's exactly my point."
2005.04-881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,446.488,447.039,"Well, if--"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,447.039,447.498,--for offset.
2005.04-881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,447.498,454.353,--if we call it 1991 Act.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,454.353,472.986,"Well, I... with respect, I don't think that the actual nomenclature matters that much, but I will distinguish it from what the law normally calls a limitations period, because a limitations period is one that is raised as an affirmative defense and may be waived."
2005.04-881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,479.16,479.51,Well--
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,479.51,480.161,--does not apply.
2005.04-881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,480.161,489.678,"--can you give me a reason for the Government's adopting (e), the 10 year... the 10 year bar, other than for stale claims or--"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,489.678,498.965,"Oh, I don't know that there is one, but my point, again, is simply that the Government has no authority to proceed."
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,515.4,515.9,Well--
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,515.9,516.241,But that's--
2005.04-881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,516.241,528.009,"--I understand that, but I'm just... I'm just saying, if you could give me an explanation, a characterization, a description, a statement of purpose that's other than the bar on stale claims, I think you'd have a stronger case."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,533.702,564.743,"--You know, again, if... it is not... the purposes of the bar are not stated in any of the legislative materials, and we can assume that at least one of the principal purposes was to not allow the litigation, the contesting of stale claims, or to give the individuals repose, which is a purpose of time bars."
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,564.743,570.988,"--You can call it any purpose you want, but there is an earlier word in 9... 1091(a), just what Justice Kennedy said."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,605.113,608.555,"Well, I think there are... there are... I... there are several answers."
2005.04-881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,678.033,688.151,"Of course, part of the problem is that 1091(a)(2), the ""notwithstanding"" clause, talks also specifically about offsets, which is what this is, I take it."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,688.151,689.673,"--No, I understand that, Your Honor."
2005.04-881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,690.003,691.035,"I mean, if it had said ""no""--"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,691.035,691.245,--I understand that.
2005.04-881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,691.245,695.499,"--""# no limitations period"", then I might... this specifically talks about an offset."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,695.499,713.381,"Well, that's right. The... and I... I don't think that undercuts our argument at all, because, after all, there's no question that, prior to 1996, there was offset authority in the Government to offset... to collect debt against other types of income, other than Social Security."
2005.04-881,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,744.923,747.464,May I pursue that point for a second--
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,747.464,747.785,--Uh huh.
2005.04-881,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,747.785,748.125,--more?
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,816.322,816.593,"The HETA law, yeah."
2005.04-881,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,816.593,826.25,"--which says, with respect to educational loan collections, including by setoff, there's no limitation at all."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,834.745,848.866,"Well, but I... but I... with all respect, I think our interpretation certainly does not render HETA nugatory, because HETA would still override limitations periods for other forms of collection with respect to other types--"
2005.04-881,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,848.866,848.936,But with--
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,848.936,849.667,--of debts.
2005.04-881,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,849.667,852.218,"--with respect to Social Security setoffs, of course, it would."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,852.218,856.482,"Well, it... I'm not sure I understand that question."
2005.04-881,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,856.482,867.369,"Social Security... Social Security said it would be... it would be a... it would... a flat head to head contradiction, no matter how you read it, on Social Security setoffs for educational loans."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,867.369,867.679,Well--
2005.04-881,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,867.679,871.922,"And if that's the only thing that the 1996 Act covered, we would say,"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,906.166,933.324,"--Well, that may be, but let me, again, if I... if I might, respond to that... to this... to this point, because I think it is true that the proportion of times under our argument that the 10 year bar would apply would... is greater under our position, but it is, nevertheless, true that HETA still applies to many situations, under our reading, and the 10-year bar applies to somewhat more."
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.801,968.242,"Yes, but--"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,968.242,968.242,--initial question.
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,969.02,968.242,--may I ask this question?
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1033.217,1034.99,I--
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.99,1042.804,"--It isn't as though they enacted, for the first time, an authority to offset Social Security and, in that statute, said,"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1046.047,1047.078,"--Well, that--"
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1047.078,1048.79,"Rather, they amended the 1991 Act."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1048.79,1061.53,"--that is correct. And I think that... but with a caveat, which I'll get to... but... I think that is correct, but it is a... it is a consequence of the situation that Congress found itself in, in 1996."
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1066.972,1068.895,But it also had the exception for student loans.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1069.864,1070.415,--Well--
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1070.415,1072.868,--side by side with the rest of the 10 year bar.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1072.868,1077.502,--I'm not sure what you mean in that... I'm not sure what you mean by the exception for student loans.
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1077.873,1078.854,"Well, it's 1091(a)."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1078.854,1082.337,"--Well, 1091 was in a different statutory provision, in a different part of the code."
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1083.518,1083.518,But it was in the 1991 statute.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1085.909,1083.518,--Right.
2005.04-881,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1100.331,1103.823,"But the '91 Act mentions offsets, specifically, as well."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1103.823,1104.164,--That's right.
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.872,1164.016,"If you say that... let me just throw this thought out, so you can comment on it."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1164.016,1164.016,--Uh huh.
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1164.016,1184.402,"It seems to me that there is a reasonable basis for assuming Congress might have thought that student loans should not have a 10 year bar if you're going to collect from Social Security, because most Social Security payments won't accrue until many, many years... much more than 10 years after the student loan default."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1184.402,1192.889,"Well, that... the Government certainly makes that submission in its brief, but, as we note in our reply brief, the statistics the Government cites don't really back that up."
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.431,1210.282,"No, but there is a--"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1210.282,1210.673,--and there are disability--
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1210.673,1212.633,--Retirement benefits are a pretty big part--
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1212.633,1212.923,--Are a--
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1212.923,1213.574,--of the whole package.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1213.574,1214.505,"--larger number, that is true."
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.505,1214.875,Yes.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1214.875,1235.091,"But, again, I don't think that... there's no... there's no suggestion in... the problem... the ultimate problem with that point for the Government, Justice Stevens, is that it requires us to believe that Congress formed that intent in 1991, which is an impossibility, because--"
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.091,1235.3,"No, I understand that."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1235.3,1241.424,"--in 1991, Social Security benefits were just, sort of, off the table."
2005.04-881,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1245.728,1246.519,Mr.--
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1246.519,1246.519,--theory there.
2005.04-881,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1246.519,1260.28,"--Wolfman, are there provisions by regulation in the Department of Education for discharge of debts like this on a showing of total and permanent disability?"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1260.28,1261.8,"There are, Your Honor."
2005.04-881,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1261.8,1265.133,"And your client doesn't qualify, or--"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1265.133,1269.317,"Well, the record is completely silent on that question."
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1397.108,1400.541,"No, it... I mean, you... it's... it probably comes up a lot."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1434.493,1434.773,Yes.
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1434.773,1436.386,--unless there's some special reason--
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1436.386,1436.684,Right.
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1436.684,1438.066,--for thinking that it doesn't.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1440.209,1440.43,Well--
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1440.43,1446.794,"--here? You have an earlier act that says, when you see those words, 10 year limitations> [""], forget 'em where student loans in effect."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1452.24,1452.491,--Right.
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1452.491,1452.981,--it is special and--
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1452.981,1453.121,Right.
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1453.121,1453.302,--so forth.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1453.512,1453.932,And I--
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1453.932,1454.443,--I don't know--
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1454.443,1454.623,--but I--
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1454.623,1454.784,--if they're--
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1454.784,1454.954,--but I think that that's--
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1454.954,1455.114,--strong enough--
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1455.114,1456.086,--that's the nub of the case--
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1456.086,1456.466,--Uh huh.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1456.546,1456.926,--the special reasons.
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1459.799,1461.973,"But, I mean, they don't have that big burden to show."
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1462.514,1463.015,--I--
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1463.015,1463.385,--show it's normal.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1463.385,1464.327,--That's where I--
2005.04-881,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.327,1464.668,And you have to show it's special.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1464.668,1467.081,"--I think, on these legislative materials, they have quite a burden."
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1503.915,1504.966,"But, Mr.--"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1504.966,1505.217,--to collect--
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.217,1508.222,"--Wolfman, couldn't you say the question could be phrased in this way?"
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1532.495,1533.367,--Right.
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1537.39,1537.66,Yes.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1537.66,1551.591,"--which... one of our arguments here is, given the various indicia of intent, both in '91 and '96, that the '96 Act, with respect to a small sliver of collections, is effectively an amendment of the '91 Act."
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.047,1559.277,Right.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1559.277,1559.708,--provision.
2005.04-881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.708,1559.918,I understand.
2005.04-881,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,1559.918,1560.148,Okay?
2005.04-881,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1594.011,1595.924,"Thank you, Mr. Wolfman. Ms. Blatt."
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1595.924,1602.049,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.249,1633.572,But it didn't include Social Security payments when it was enacted.
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1633.572,1635.743,That's right.
2005.04-881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1638.365,1638.906,Or 1991.
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1639.346,1639.547,--Right.
2005.04-881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1668.577,1671.96,"Well, but then... but then, in... you know, you know what's coming."
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1688.954,1706.574,"Well, (e) is a limitations period, and it is a provision of law, and the Higher Education Act says, notwithstanding any other provision of law, there's no time limit for offsetting... for collection by offset when it's to collect student loan debt."
2005.04-881,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1723.577,1742.711,"But Mr. Wolfman tells us, Ms. Blatt, that this clause is not quite as sweeping as you suggest, the clause in the 1991 Act, and points specifically to provisions that say,"
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1770.75,1774.27,"--Yes, well, it is unqualified, on its face, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-881,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1837.408,1839.429,The point that Justice Stevens made--
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1839.429,1840.28,Yes.
2005.04-881,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1840.28,1840.28,--before.
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1840.28,1846.925,Ninety percent of all student loan debtors who default do so before age 55.
2005.04-881,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1928.49,1930.453,"Those are... those are regulatory provisions, right?"
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1930.453,1937.767,"--The caps, Mr. Chief Justice, are in the statute, and further limited by the regulations."
2005.04-881,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1956.28,1974.893,"So, is the statute... I saw something here, that a person who's going to get this offset, and he has Social Security, you exempt $9,000 of the Social Security, and then you limit it to 15 percent of the remainder or whatever is reasonable, whichever is less."
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1974.893,1982.77,It's the lesser of... it's the lesser of the 15 percent or the amount by which the benefit payment exceeds 750.
2005.04-881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.415,2088.817,"But it is... it is true that the 1996 statute, which is the first time the express reference appears, does contain the 10 year statute by the indirect reference, and does not expressly refer to the... cite the 1091(a)."
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2088.817,2089.775,--That's right.
2005.04-881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2099.121,2101.504,"And it says... and it says ""offsets under this section""."
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2101.504,2105.758,"--That's right. And that takes you down to the subsection (e), which imposes a 10 year limit."
2005.04-881,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2147.565,2155.793,"But... yeah, I think he's... one argument that they're emphasizing, anyway, is that... you look at the Debt Collection Act, and suppose it had said the following,"
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2184.29,2192.235,"--It would still... the express reference would be completely overtaken, because it says the 207> [""]."
2005.04-881,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2195.247,2195.717,And you'd say it's the same.
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2195.717,2196.949,--For up to 10 years.
2005.04-881,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2196.949,2198.892,"All right. If that's the same, let's imagine this statute."
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2223.019,2224.09,Right.
2005.04-881,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2225.222,2232.558,"And then, indeed, the whole point of it... it's entitled ""Limited Offset Ability"", parenthesis..."
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2244.336,2252.143,"--Yes. Well, our position is that the Social Security Act only requires an express reference to create authorization to offset."
2005.04-881,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2252.143,2252.744,But you're not going to treat that--
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2252.744,2253.282,And--
2005.04-881,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2253.282,2253.452,--one the same.
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2260.197,2260.497,--Right.
2005.04-881,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2260.497,2264.67,--I'm making it harder and harder for you to accept that saying--
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2264.67,2264.911,Yes.
2005.04-881,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2265.652,2265.853,--automatically.
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2265.853,2266.664,--fundamental position--
2005.04-881,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2266.664,2266.664,Right.
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2266.664,2271.659,--I'll be clear on this... is that the Higher Education Act applies unless it's been repealed.
2005.04-881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.551,2297.876,"Ms. Blatt, can I ask... there's no discussion... legislative history in the briefs that I... because I... that I recall."
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2312.498,2315.039,"No, I know of no statement to that effect."
2005.04-881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.414,2328.97,"Because it seems to me that, conceivably, a legislator looking at the bill all by itself, not getting out the earlier provisions of the code, might well think,"
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2330.9,2333.013,"Maybe they did, maybe they didn't."
2005.04-881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2336.876,2337.197,Yes.
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2337.197,2343.221,"--and just because it... the limitation period was in one section... but, now, here's where I think the policy does come into play."
2005.04-881,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2388.635,2392.488,Why can he get a discharge if he's disabled?
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2392.488,2399.832,You can get a discharge of your loan if you have a disability of indefinite duration that prevents you from working.
2005.04-881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2453.889,2462.257,"Ms. Blatt, it... was this statute... I'm just really kind of curious that something this important, we're first putting this burden on Social Security... it's a fairly important change."
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2467.67,2468.151,Yes.
2005.04-881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.711,2468.942,That--
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2468.942,2470.284,--I remember trying to find it on Westlaw.
2005.04-881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2472.215,2472.535,--Yes.
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2472.535,2474.738,"--huge. And it covers many, many different subjects."
2005.04-881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2474.738,2479.653,And they did not have a separate committee proceeding on each separate part of that monster bill--
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2479.653,2479.974,That--
2005.04-881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2479.974,2479.984,--as I remember.
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2479.984,2480.715,"--That, I don't recall."
2005.04-881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2486.431,2486.81,Yes.
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2486.81,2486.83,--efforts.
2005.04-881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.719,2499.719,Right.
2005.04-881,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2499.719,2503.893,"--another agency, such that one Department had no idea what another Department was doing."
2005.04-881,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2546.631,2549.253,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."
2005.04-881,2,18166,brian_wolfman,,2553.026,2549.253,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-881,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2699.362,2703.362,"Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted."
