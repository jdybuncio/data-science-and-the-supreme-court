1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,38.332,43.848,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors."
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,136.062,146.572,And there was no issue of the effect on primary lined up or is it just -- someone with headers?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,146.572,148.817,On primary line competition?
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,150.105,157.035,In the journeys you have -- the effect on any -- on the supplier?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,157.035,161.046,"Oh, on supplier's product to grocery stores, no."
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.676,1066.715,What would be the extent that you --
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1066.715,1082.419,"Well, it's a little difficult to compute precisely because the Census Bureau had split the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area into Los Angeles County and Orange County."
1965.303,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1119.089,1121.57,That's 20?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1121.57,1123.363,"20, yes."
1965.303,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1123.363,1126.836,Does your market in Los Angeles [Inaudible]
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1126.836,1127.675,Excuse me?
1965.303,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1127.675,1132.548,The relevant markets complain with what Los Angeles may [Inaudible]
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1132.548,1136.794,The relevant market includes the two counties.
1965.303,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1228.416,1236.456,It's hard to be efficient on small firms have to join some sort of cooperative buying arrangements.
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1236.456,1251.303,"Yes, that's true and when they do so, they're able to buy some of their products at any event at the same price of the chain, but we don't attach anticompetitive significance to belong into a cooperative."
1965.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1335.17,1339.322,Is this combination put the combination first?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1339.322,1339.871,Yes.
1965.303,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1349.165,1351.777,How about 1963?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1351.777,1360.407,We don't know in 1963 because the census doesn't breakdown sales by individual firms.
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.829,1387.696,"Do you know what the trend in is since 1958, at least the latest percentage figures in that essentially."
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1387.696,1393.566,We know the trend in terms of the group of four firms at the top.
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.424,1420.777,Is that -- is that a finding or it's finding that --
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1420.777,1443.451,It is a finding and again we point out that its reliability is impossible to verify because the universe on which this percentage was computed was based on guess work projection rather than on actual data gathered --
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.451,1449.684,What's the -- what Safeway's history since 1958?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1449.684,1454.519,I don't know Safeway's history since 1958.
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.519,1457.397,Does it shares go up or down? You don't know?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1457.397,1466.4,"I don't know, It's share over a longer period of time, going back to 1948 has been down."
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1526.237,1528.905,It varies with Ralphs though -- if there is [Inaudible]
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1528.905,1536.019,"We don't know, Ralphs would have been third on the basis of 1958 figures."
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1547.886,1550.502,Do you think the [Inaudible]
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1550.502,1555.117,"That's right, the 1960 -- the census doesn't break down."
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1565.529,1565.91,When was that --
1965.303,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1565.91,1568.724,You get those sales from government's agents?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1568.724,1569.049,Yes.
1965.303,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1612.85,1620.403,"And that [Inaudible] about 83%, an increase of [Inaudible] which you --"
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1620.403,1629.804,You could tell -- you would have to know something about whether the overall market was expanding or decreasing.
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.804,1635.909,"Well, could you -- did you say to synthesize the total market figures for 1963?"
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1635.909,1641.965,"Yes, but the record doesn't have figures for the individual firms in 1963."
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1641.965,1645.8,When did the record close in this [Inaudible]
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1645.8,1652.431,"There is some evidence, I believe as late as 1963."
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.431,1656.836,"1964, 1963 or 1964?"
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1656.836,1659.554,Evidence?
1965.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1727.035,1750.081,"Well, did I understand you say anyway Mr. Posner that the trend toward concentration in terms of increased percentage of the market, without regard to where these changes individually fit, you did have statistics of this report."
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1757.608,1759.81,"Yes, there's no (Voice Overlap) -- there's no question -- pardon?"
1965.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1759.81,1764.491,But my question is where -- how up-to-date is that?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1764.491,1778.523,"That goes through 1963, because the Census made a copy to a special tabulation of the top 4, 8 -- I suppose down to 20 firms in 1963."
1965.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1778.523,1787.283,And your point is that's not so significant where the respective firm stand in the first eight or ten.
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1791.311,1791.733,"Yes, well --"
1965.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1791.733,1795.655,"In the sense of proportion of the market with those first eight or ten shares, is that it?"
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1795.655,1800.825,"Yes, absolutely, there maybe some shifting around in the rank of these firms probably --"
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.825,1816.897,"Well Mr. Posner, wouldn't you agree though that it's the -- if between 1958 and 1963, the top 20 firms changed 100% that there might be some question about the -- whether there was any damage to the competition."
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1816.897,1817.421,As I think --
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.421,1827.003,"If none of the top 20 in 1963 were among the top 20 in 1958, it would be somewhat difficult to say that the competition was negative in that --"
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1827.003,1828.462,"Yes, I think that's true."
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.462,1828.96,[Inaudible]
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1828.96,1835.042,"I think if you had that kind of mobility, it would suggest a very competitive situation but no --"
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.042,1841.136,"So what is the situation as among these firms, are they all in the same firms, they're like that?"
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1841.136,1850.316,The leading -- I don't think the record contains complete information on this.
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1884.242,1892.813,So you think roughly that the record would sustain the top 20 firms in 1963 or roughly the top 20 firms in 1958 or --
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1892.813,1893.415,I would not --
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1893.415,1895.212,-- holds to it?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1895.212,1901.358,There's no -- there's certainly no contrary indication but -- and I'm sure that it would be in this record.
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.82,1932.692,Among the leading firms and if they're -- and if the share of the top 20 that's increasing is the share of the same firms roughly --
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,1932.692,1936.598,"Roughly the same firms, yes."
1965.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2661.709,2665.433,Now what was the standard you suggest Mr. Posner?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,2665.433,2677.581,"We suggest focusing upon markets where -- while they're still competitive, they've began to turn the corner to oligopoly."
1965.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2679.644,2684.367,But then you mentioned 40% earlier as something on the economist field.
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,2684.367,2685.242,Yes.
1965.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2685.242,2689.416,What -- it's potentially or is in fact oligopolistic with it?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,2689.416,2699.304,"Well I think economist would feel that in a market's that concentrated -- there's a chance that they'll have less than competition, but it's by no means certain --"
1965.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2699.304,2704.007,Well are you suggesting that we'd take some mathematical determination of that kind?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,2704.007,2706.757,"No, we don't suggest that."
1965.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2760.024,2768.541,"Well, I confess I am still not quite clear as to what standard is you think ought to be applied."
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,2768.541,2772.959,"Well, we think the Court has to make two determinations in a case of this sort."
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.004,2791.996,When is that?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,2791.996,2794.156,"Well, it can't be fixed precisely."
1965.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2883.771,2884.492,May I interrupt this one?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,2884.492,2885.033,Sure.
1965.303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2885.033,2886.327,"Danger, what do you mean?"
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,2888.889,2909.745,"A danger that if mergers are allowed to continue, this market within the foreseeable future will reach a state so clearly concentrated that there's no substantial hope for -- the digger of competition."
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.507,2955.822,"Mr. Posner, you say this market had turned the corner of the -- on the appellee, could you give me just say a brief run down on what the government's theory is in terms of what consequences flow from being able to label some market as oligopolistic?"
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,2964.429,2985.542,"Well, this Court has assumed and has said many times that in a situation in a market where a very few firms have very large market shares, the prospects are for that well as the Rome Cable case said, hollow policies have mutual advantage rather than competition will emerge."
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3005.173,3007.477,As a -- and what?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,3010.144,3020.925,High concentration is very likely though admittedly not certain to result in a diminished vigor of competition.
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.925,3026.684,Well see -- price competition is diminishing in the price competition?
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,3026.684,3030.933,I think the basic theory would be the price competition is much less likely.
1965.303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3086.458,3092.56,"Of course, you don't suggest that sale in Los Angeles do you, about new entry?"
1965.303,0,40232,richard_a_posner,,3092.56,3100.694,Let me take up that point then.
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,3376.922,3381.006,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.303,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3420.969,3426.555,Always argue better after the argument? [Attempt to Laughter]
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,3426.555,3431.179,We have considerable evidence concerning new entries.
1965.303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3511.754,3514.007,That's part of the [Inaudible]
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,3514.007,3523.769,It's volume five Your Honors.
1965.303,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3524.849,3529.961,Thanks to Justice Brennan.
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,3529.961,3543.438,This is a letter from the State Board of Equalization and all of these are not all closings because the number -- they count as a closing or transfer from one to another.
1965.303,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3693.123,3695.996,What significance do you put on the exits?
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,3695.996,3698.56,On the exits?
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3838.195,3847.647,But if the -- what do you say about the identity of the top eight and the top 20 firms in the last 15 years?
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,3847.647,3855.317,There's a considerable change Mr. Justice White.
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3932.188,3943.889,"Well, how about the -- what about the public served in 1958, have served the top eight [Inaudible]"
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,3943.889,3958.282,"Excuse me, I -- I can't honestly say with the exception of Fox, that there's been any change in the identity of the top eight firms in 1958 as compared to 1963."
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3958.282,3961.836,And does the top 20 through 1958 and 1963?
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,3961.836,3968.478,"Top 20 from 1958 had considerable change primarily due to the bankruptcies of Fox, McDaniel's and [Inaudible]"
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3968.478,3970.474,It's not at the top eight?
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,3970.474,3971.914,Not at the top eight Your Honor.
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3974.832,3976.509,"Yes, among themselves or --"
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,3976.509,3997.455,"Among themselves on the basis of the 1958 statistics that counsel relied upon, if this merger had taken place in 1958 instead of 1960 then Von's would have ranked first ahead of Safeway in terms of market share with 8.9."
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4019.223,4031.46,But you do say that the -- I gather that 1958 to 1963 the top eight remain the same -- then they say there the total market shares.
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,4031.46,4033.413,There total market share declined Your Honor.
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4033.413,4036.257,Declined over these five years?
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,4036.257,4041.859,Yes Your Honor.
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4041.859,4045.186,Now where is that?
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,4045.186,4050.594,"Exhibit A Your Honor, page 2788."
1965.303,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4050.594,4051.551,Page what?
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,4051.551,4055.648,"2788, Mr. Justice Black."
1965.303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4055.648,4063.951,"Now that's in Volume what, 6?"
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,4063.951,4083.422,"I'm sorry, that carries only to 1960."
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4118.618,4121.969,These are the only figures from 1963?
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,4121.969,4124.889,We did not have them Mr. Justice White.
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4162.607,4165.462,Where is that?
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,4169.365,4179.795,It does not relate to the question of relative shares Mr. Justice White because we did not have that.
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4233.344,4235.26,Suppose they have it both?
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,4235.26,4238.169,"The do not, they say in their brief Your Honor."

1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,5289.153,5289.484,Yes.

1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5336.206,5351.718,Well you think there's -- there's come a point in the market where there's sufficient concentration that the -- there's a danger of injury to competition from an acquisition by one of the (Voice Overlap) --
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,5351.718,5361.601,"I'm sure at some point -- point in time Mr. Justice White that undoubtedly would result. Now, whether it would result in the grocery business, I don't know."
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5362.85,5373.727,You think it's less -- that you think it's less likely that there will be vigorous competition among a few large competitors than among many smaller ones?
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,5373.727,5374.532,"Well, generally --"
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5374.532,5376.307,Do you agree with the government on that?
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,5376.307,5386.368,In general I would agree of what you have just a few large competitors where they might be concerned about their own act in retaliation by the competitors.
1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5460.665,5465.01,So you do say that this concept of the government this has no place in the grocery business?

1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,5512.694,5515.435,The great bulk according to officers.
1965.303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5515.743,5519.939,"So the 3700 total, if you don't know what that means, 2500 was --"
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,5519.939,5525.089,"No, it would -- I'm sure but at least 2500 but that would be a speculation."

1965.303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5724.181,5731.912,Well what percentage does this market did Certified's members sell?
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,5731.912,5738.691,"We do not have that figure Mr. Justice White, but it must be very, very substantial."
1965.303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5756.589,5767.161,"Well, we do know don't we -- the percentage of the two and a half billion n the small retailers among them have."
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,5767.161,5772.917,Yes but that -- we could make a rough approximation Mr. Justice Brennan but --
1965.303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5772.917,5775.264,That is why I was asking earlier.
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,5784.275,5801.892,I'd say the great bulk of the smaller operators with the possible exception of small Mom and Pop stores that -- the figure is complicated somewhat Mr. Justice Brennan because some of the leading chains are still members of Certified.
1965.303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5815.321,5817.753,I supposed membership is not open to anybody.
1965.303,1,43768,william_w_alsup,,5817.753,5819.41,Membership is open to anyone.
1965.303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5819.41,5820.057,It is open?

1965.303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5887.643,5890.971,That we did not even do so.

1965.303,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6797.004,6797.792,Why?
1965.303,2,26477,henry_j_bison_jr,,6797.792,6820.742,"Well, because in that situation, I think we could go down the list of the indica that you might want to consider in connection with it, what the competitive advantage might be over other operators in the markets where they operate, what it would do to new entries, what it would do to small firms and that -- I wouldn't deal in terms of just market shares, I don't say they're not relevant but I say they're not all important."

1965.303,2,26477,henry_j_bison_jr,,6854.004,6857.585,I think the result of that is that the number of retailers declining.
1965.303,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6862.436,6869.269,So that you -- do you think the trend is that fewer and fewer competitors sharing the $2.5 billion gross sale?

1965.303,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7331.191,7349.516,"I don't think we would because we regard, for purposes of this case, as very significant, the fact not only that this market had reached a level under threshold of oligopoly but that the direction was towards greater and greater levels of concentration."
1965.303,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7349.516,7360.607,So we have to give them the record and disagree with the District Judge before we -- we can agree with you.
1965.303,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7360.607,7367.043,I think the -- we must disagree with the conclusion stated in Finding 80.
1965.303,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7371.091,7374.067,You mean it's not supported by the evidence?
1965.303,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7374.067,7383.394,"That finding, we think is clearly erroneous in it so far as it states a conclusion that concentration has been decreasing."
1965.303,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7383.394,7395.751,But the reason then it affirms the finding that there has been increasing concentration except as we take the statistics you have supplied and we read them themselves as requiring a conclusion.
1965.303,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7395.751,7406.468,"That's true, and we suggest that reading -- that even accepting all of defendant statistics, it's still clear except the -- all the statistics on the record."
1965.303,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7439.58,7439.93,"Well, may I say that --"
1965.303,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7439.93,7441.15,-- may not be increasing.
1965.303,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7441.15,7454.914,But do I correctly understand the government's position Mr. Posner depends for its basic premise on this tendency to -- towards concentration on this market?
1965.303,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7454.914,7455.848,"That's correct, because you don't --"
1965.303,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7455.848,7458.243,"I mean that's the basic premises, isn't it?"
1965.303,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7466.64,7488.326,"If you find that this is not a market which is jeopardized in which there's a danger of increasing concentration, we do not suggest that the merger itself in some other market setting, by reason of the size of the firms would be illegal."
