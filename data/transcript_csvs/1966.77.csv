1966.77,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,24.849,"No. 77, Lawrence Long, petitioner v. The District Court of Iowa in for Lee County, Fort Madison Island."
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,27.086,40.894,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.The petitioner, Your Honor, in this case is an indigent inmate at Fort Madison Penitentiary in Iowa and I have been appointed by this Court to present his course to the Court."
1966.77,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,109.006,111.799,Did he ever counsel during the trial?
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,111.799,116.765,"Yes, Mr. Justice Douglas, he had appointed counsel at his trial, and this was only trial."
1966.77,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,289.97,297.795,"Mr. Carlson, at any time, did they, in any of these proceedings, did the petitioner receive the transcript?"
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,297.795,299.354,"Yes, he did Your Honor."
1966.77,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,311.531,313.398,"Well then, that's what he wants here?"
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,313.398,314.255,"No, Your Honor."
1966.77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,322.498,326.576,And what were the issues on the merits of the habeas corpus trial?
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,326.576,337.282,"Oh, there were basically four issues at that time, Mr. Justice Stewart, including that he did not have counsel at his preliminary hearing."
1966.77,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,348.838,349.567,Excuse me.
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,349.567,350.806,"Yes, sir."
1966.77,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,350.806,358.293,Was the transcript after this trial before the court on habeas corpus?
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,358.293,361.716,"No, it was not, Your Honor."
1966.77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,361.716,363.564,It could have been brought to the court --
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,363.564,370.394,"It could have been, Mr. Justice Stewart but counsel is not provided on habeas corpus in Iowa and this was not presented to the court."
1966.77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,384.215,385.893,He had counsel on this preliminary hearing?
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,385.893,388.849,"He was represented in the preliminary hearing, right, Your Honor."
1966.77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,402.693,404.659,That is that he had had counsel or --
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,404.659,405.427,"Yes, yes."
1966.77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,405.427,407.325,-- that something damaging had happened at the preliminary hearing.
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,407.325,408.69,"No, no, Your Honor."
1966.77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,413.902,418.754,On the basis of what kind of evidence?
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,418.754,425.917,"Well, as I recall, there was evidence presented by the county attorney from the county which had convicted Long."
1966.77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,434.391,436.869,But -- so that was a factual issue?
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,436.869,437.247,Yes.
1966.77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,437.247,439.672,-- resolved by the habeas corpus court.
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,439.672,452.364,"Now on review, the Supreme Court of Iowa must adjudicate whether this finding is supported by substantial evidence in the record and our point is, that the reviewing court cannot (Voice overlap)"
1966.77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,452.364,454.489,-- on the record before?
1966.77,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,454.489,463.054,It's not that jurisdiction -- you are not depriving an appeal the proof of the essence of the transcript?
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,463.054,466.771,"There are two propositions that apply here, Your Honors."
1966.77,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.068,516.03,Was a testimony of where the proceedings taken down?
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,516.03,516.822,"Yes, it was."
1966.77,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.013,520.826,Is that customary in Iowa in habeas corpus?
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,520.826,525.281,"In a District Court matter, court reporters are always provided, Your Honor, and there's no exception to that."
1966.77,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.281,527.716,And has the transcript been made?
1966.77,0,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,527.716,529.753,"Yes, it has."
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1682.466,1688.203,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1804.61,1811.899,"I don't quite understand that, this language that follows what you read to as on the bottom of page 30 of the record."
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1829.158,1845.603,"I think, Mr. Justice Stewart that what the trial court is saying is that he was at all times represented in the sense that the Iowa Supreme Court had made the same statement in its opinion affirming the conviction on direct appeal."
1966.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1845.603,1846.927,That that he had a lawyer?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1846.927,1848.609,"Yes, physically in --"
1966.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1848.609,1852.502,He had a lawyer but the lawyer decided not to show up there?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1852.502,1852.888,Right.
1966.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1852.888,1854.611,But he was represented by a lawyer.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1854.611,1864.466,"Well, as the Court's opinion indicates, at the very moment, the man was taken there for a preliminary hearing, that was when the lawyer was contacted."
1966.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1895.035,1915.657,"I suppose, this is really a holding that the defendant was represented by counsel at all crucial times or relevant times and that then at the preliminary hearing, this doesn't have to deal a kind of a time in Iowa where you need to be represented by counsel."
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1915.657,1927.444,"The attorney general for whatever that is were, has ruled subsequent to White vs. Maryland, that counsel must be appointed at a preliminary hearing at least to this extent."
1966.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1937.116,1940.027,If that would be true --
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1940.027,1942.111,By virtue of this court proceeding.
1966.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1942.111,1950.682,As long as he doesn't lose anything at the preliminary hearing as long as he pleads not guilty.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1956.783,1963.177,"Well, he has ruled that counsel ought to be appointed at preliminary hearing because of White vs. Maryland."
1966.77,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1976.53,1981.407,"Well, what is your understanding at the trial record?"
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,1988.67,1995.301,"Well, I cannot -- the States unequivocally as Mr. Carlson had stated that the record shows that."
1966.77,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2006.275,2006.923,Do we have that?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2007.373,2009.843,"No, you do not have, Mr. Chief Justice."
1966.77,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2025.132,2027.045,I suppose that no objection from you two.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2027.045,2029.034,"I'd be very happy for you, Your Honor."
1966.77,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2029.034,2031.591,Would you leave it to the Court then?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2031.591,2032.493,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2127.243,2136.528,"But what is the rule in Iowa, this matter -- if there is one formulated so to tell us those?"
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2143.487,2144.246,That is right.
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2144.246,2169.437,"There is a request here and I take it as one of the separate ancillary or collateral proceeding done by application in the District Court in Iowa and then petitioner's certiorari was filed from the denial of that application and this is to say the application for the habeas corpus transcript, is that right?"
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2169.437,2170.858,"Yes, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2252.622,2257.653,The only part of the case that we have before us is a denial of the certiorari.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2257.653,2258.431,That's right.
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2258.682,2261.325,Because the Iowa Supreme Court still is considering.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2264.536,2276.864,"Now in footnote 5 of our Brief, I pointed this out because I think conceptually it's very important that the Court knows/understands that on appeal that the appeal still is pending."
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2311.148,2329.817,"Now is the rule or is there a rule on the Iowa Supreme Court, decisions of this Iowa Supreme Court in no event will that Court order that a transcript of habeas corpus proceeding be made available --"
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2329.817,2329.885,"No, Mr. Justice --"
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2329.885,2332.067,Or they formulated some other rule.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2332.067,2334.172,"No, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2345.719,2349.372,"Well, how about -- any holding in the Iowa Supreme Court?"
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2349.372,2351.407,Not to my knowledge.
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2351.407,2353.016,Nothing one way or the other.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2353.016,2356.113,"Well, yes."
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2392.973,2408.701,"But the Iowa Supreme Court has never for example said that “We will make a case by case determination and it doesn't say that in this particular case, there's no showing that the transcript is needed?"
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2408.701,2409.811,"No, it does not say that."
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2409.811,2429.504,It's a broad -- we are confronted with the broad rule of law here to the effect that in no event will the Iowa Supreme Court reverse a trial court's holding that --
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2429.504,2431.478,I do not know -- excuse me.
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2431.478,2434.654,-- transcript will not be furnished on habeas corpus.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2434.654,2450.693,"I do not know that that is entirely accurate because the petition for certiorari, petition as it was filed with the Iowa Supreme Court as well as the application to the trial court simply as a conclusary allegation that he needs the transcript."
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2468.369,2479.736,Can you refer a standing case in which Iowa Supreme Court has ordered a transcript to be furnished in these circumstances?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2479.736,2481.267,"Not directly in point, Your Honor."
1966.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2515.504,2526.919,"And you would agree that the trial court was wrong, gave the wrong reason for denying the request for a transcript?"
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2526.919,2532.788,"Well, I think to say that it is civil is irrelevant to the real issue here, now we can take --"
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2532.788,2549.087,"And would you go on and say that this petitioner could demonstrate satisfactorily to you that for a meaningful appeal, you needed the habeas corpus transcript that he is entitled to it?"
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2549.087,2550.493,I believe I would have to --
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2550.493,2553.26,You would but you can't speak for your Supreme Court?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2553.26,2560.9,I cannot speak for the Supreme Court and unfortunately I have and on pretty tenuous ground even speak for the Attorney General because of last night.
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2560.9,2566.294,"Well, was it open to the Supreme Court? [Laughter]"
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2566.294,2567.155,I'm sorry.
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2567.155,2576.601,Is it open in your view to the Supreme Court to decide if this man is entitled to the transcript?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2576.601,2577.472,"I'm sorry, --"
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2577.472,2586.624,Is it open to your Supreme Court when the appeal is heard to say that this man should have a transcript or they foreclosed by any of their prior decisions?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2586.624,2588.107,"Well, no, they're not."
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2605.251,2606.89,You mean short of the transcript?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2606.89,2610.28,Short of having the hearing transcript.
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2610.28,2612.977,And I suppose that he wasn't?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2612.977,2614.572,You mean that he not able?
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2614.572,2621.061,"Of course then the Supreme Court says, “Well, this record is not good enough for us, we can't tell you or we cant' decide this thing."
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2636.218,2637.936,Are they foreclosed from doing it?
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2637.936,2638.387,Yes?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2638.387,2640.54,"No, I don't think so."
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2646.45,2648.126,This trial court has refused to do it.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2648.126,2652.167,"Right, there is no rule of law in the State of Iowa requiring furnishing an indigent --"
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2652.167,2660.372,This case went back to the Iowa Supreme Court and this appeal is heard.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2669.069,2686.085,"Well, I would have to answer I think, yes that he could file a further application, trying to set forth why he cannot comply or work with the rules of the Civil Procedure which would allow him to get up a record despite the transcript."
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2686.085,2696.783,And you don't know of any decision in your books that would prevent the Supreme Court from saying that these circumstances will require a transcript?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2696.783,2698.72,"No, I do not."
1966.77,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2698.72,2701.779,(Inaudible)
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2701.779,2705.821,"No, let's go to the rules, Mr. Justice Clark."
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2819.811,2823.439,"He was personally there at the habeas corpus hearing, was he?"
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2823.439,2827.74,"Yes, he would have to have been because a hearing was held at which he was to give his side."
1966.77,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2827.74,2830.947,And he was a witness there?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2830.947,2843.26,"So assuming that the transcript may not be filed, at least, we have a situation where if he is capable, he could file a narrative statement of what he thinks the evidence shows."
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2871.594,2885.331,"Would you mind, may I disturb you and tell me, just from the beginning, what is the precise issue between you and your adversary?"
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2885.331,2886.099,Whether it is in the record?
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2886.099,2892.831,(Inaudible) that was presented between you and him that you are at issue.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2892.831,2915.955,"Well, we have in effect conceived that perhaps the whole court, if not the whole then a substantial majority of this court is committed to the proposition that if an indigent in a post-conviction proceeding needs a transcript to get adequate and effective appellate review, he is constitutionally entitled."
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2915.955,2917.628,"Alright, do you agree on that."
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2919.967,2927.52,"Well, no. 1 we are taking a position that he has not shown that he needs the transcript and no. 2, that there --"
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2927.52,2930.408,Not shown it where?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2930.408,2932.825,Any place.
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2932.825,2937.82,Where can you show it?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2937.82,2946.268,"In his petitioner for certiorari, he could have attempted to have made a showing beyond just simply a conclusary allegation that he needs the transcript."
1966.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2946.268,2948.13,You mean the petition for the cert in the Iowa Supreme Court?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2948.13,2950.889,"To the Iowa Supreme Court, right."
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2950.889,2953.28,But it looks to me like you're near together.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2955.117,2955.797,"Well, we're not --"
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2955.797,2957.557,I don't know why you have been issued.
1966.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.557,2963.111,All you have to do is return over that document to him and the case is over isn't it?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2963.111,2965.878,I have no intention of turning that document over to him.
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2965.878,2969.528,Is that your issue?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,2969.528,2972.827,"Yes, in effect that's the issue but I want to take a step further."
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3024.626,3028.731,What are you asking as not to do that he is asking as to do?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3028.731,3036.477,I am asking you to hold that there has not been a sufficient showing that this man has been deprived of the constitutional right.
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3036.477,3042.046,"That's a pretty broad abstract clearly, (Inaudible) something concrete."
1966.77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3048.797,3052.935,He wants that blue covered book and you don't want to give it to him. [laughter]
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3057.055,3064.379,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I would rather say, it's not I who doesn't want to give it to him. [Voice overlap]"
1966.77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3064.379,3073.313,"Well, yes, but he says that he not only wants that book, that he is entitled to it because he needs it to have a meaningful appeal."
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3080.535,3081.665,That's right.
1966.77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3081.665,3094.868,"Because there's nothing went on anyway that they need the transcript or even if there is, there's another way for him to make up the kind of the record he needs for a meaningful appeal, no. 1."
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3094.868,3097.526,Now no. 2 I think -- I'm sorry.
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3097.526,3118.558,They seem to have everything but that is -- that's the reason I want it but we (Inaudible) last time you are filling -- (Inaudible)
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3118.558,3136.649,"I don't think the Draper versus Washington was decided couple of years ago and of course, you have dissented in that opinion but you say that in Davis versus California (Inaudible) Griffin versus Illinois."
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3215.574,3229.237,"As Long came in to the trial court and I remember that in this piece of evidence I don't remember anything about objection, I don't remember anything whether sustained or not?"
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3229.237,3230.652,You mean at the habeas?
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3230.652,3233.995,Definitely.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3238.468,3241.364,You mean in trying to get up a record from the habeas hearing itself?
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3241.364,3242.577,Yes.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3242.577,3256.895,"I think whether the objections were made or not, whether it was sustained or not, is not terribly important because what his interest should be is getting the evidence set out to show how and he has been unlawfully confined."
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3272.907,3290.983,(Inaudible) record on the merits shows that the Long pleading used -- they might have raised that and --
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3290.983,3292.612,Yes.
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3292.612,3297.762,You never know when (Inaudible)
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3297.762,3302.205,"Alright, I think this brings to the third point."
1966.77,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3354.102,3359.033,They could see whether --
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3359.033,3365.927,What's raised -- you can see that from the trial court's judgment denying the petitioner for habeas corpus.
1966.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3401.114,3412.459,"Well, I'd expect that although it's not issue of waiver here; that you pointed out at 26 and so forth, 30 rather."
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3445.487,3455.967,"Well, yes, but then if he was not physically present and the plea of guilty was entered at this trial then, I think the petitioner is entitled to relief under White vs. Maryland."
1966.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3455.967,3458.963,Unless there is something lesser than the plea of guilty and may be something else.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3462.419,3462.844,Well I don't [Voice overlap]
1966.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3462.844,3466.009,That shows cross examination?
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3469.618,3470.872,Right.
1966.77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3473.51,3473.963,I know.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3473.963,3477.341,"The point is, I think this is the place to find out."
1966.77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3504.99,3511.491,"You know, Mr. Bennett, I fully appreciate the use of (Inaudible) but I must say it presses me to think."
1966.77,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3527.008,3532.366,You may answer that after lunch.
1966.77,1,20552,don_r_bennett,,3532.366,3540.429,To answer your question and I am a little bit (Inaudible) with it because it seemed not to be phrased quite so much as a question but as an observation.
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,3929.634,3934.877,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1966.77,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3974.989,3976.74,That case is in the citation.
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,3976.74,3980.441,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, Hoskins vs. Bennett."
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3986.168,3988.415,And what -- when was that?
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,3988.415,3991.199,1964.
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3991.199,3994.533,And that was before Long.
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,3994.533,3995.451,Yes.
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4052.886,4063.948,What if this Court took this case and reversed it and -- to what Court would it go?
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4063.948,4071.41,It would go to the Supreme Court of Iowa to order the District Court to enter to prepare a transcript –
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4071.41,4088.88,"Yes, but what if this Court just took the -- this one as far as saying the -- what I understand with the law of Iowa to be at least the decision, the rule of law in the decision which we are reviewing said that: this is a civil proceedings, no transcript."
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4098.566,4099.533,Yes.
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4099.533,4101.881,Now we go back to the Supreme Court of Iowa.
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4115.493,4118.231,"Yes, Your Honor, although the decision of this Court --"
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4118.231,4128.959,"-- it might not decide but in this case, there was to be a transcript or it might remand the trial court for further proceedings."
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4133.66,4135.631,"Yes, I think we've done that, Your Honor."
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4135.631,4140.322,"I know, but the Iowa Supreme Court never had a crack."
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4146.428,4149.654,"Yes, I think that's legitimate Your Honor."
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4165.438,4170.468,"Well, I would think the Iowa Supreme Court might decide the same thing."
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4176.134,4182.117,"Yes, I think you have the problem arising quite analogously in Griffin vs. Illinois."
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4182.117,4186.388,"It would be quite an argument between the two of you, why do you really need the transcript of that?"
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4190.099,4190.404,Yes.
1966.77,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4190.404,4194.216,(Inaudible)
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4194.216,4196.205,Yes.
1966.77,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4212.16,4212.574,That's right.
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4215.59,4217.502,"That's right, Your Honor."
1966.77,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4217.502,4219.901,"If you go back to Iowa, he may still be what otherwise --"
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4219.901,4223.057,That's right and he will still be.
1966.77,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4223.057,4235.623,"I gather you would agree with Mr. Bennett that if we correct -- that's what our judgment should be, the misunderstanding based on this being a civil procedure for the Iowa Supreme Court."
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4247.467,4248.64,"Yes, I think they are."
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4254.218,4257.194,Why do you say that he wouldn't have a lawyer?
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4257.194,4260.927,"Well, that is also denied him under the civil proceeding rationale."
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4260.927,4261.683,"Well, I know."
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4263.933,4265.834,"Yes, excuse me, Your Honor."
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4265.834,4268.07,He is bound to have a lawyer.
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4268.07,4270.988,"Yes, that's right."
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4270.988,4274.235,"Because we have already held that, haven't we?"
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4274.235,4282.782,"Well, it seems to me that if the civil proceeding rationale is -- well, perhaps I should pause on that, Mr. Justice White."
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4282.782,4283.801,What?
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4283.801,4285.848,Perhaps I should pause on that.
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4294.767,4295.451,What's the case?
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4295.451,4296.426,It seems to me that --
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4296.426,4299.046,We held that on the (Inaudible).
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4300.981,4301.741,On counsel?
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4301.741,4304.239,"Yes, in post conviction hearing?"
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4304.239,4307.147,"No, no, that's my response."
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4311.159,4314.313,So we he might go back to that lawyer in the Iowa Supreme Court.
1966.77,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4314.313,4318.947,Unless you volunteer.
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4318.947,4323.513,"Well, I've enjoyed my service so far, Your Honor, and it's not too griever prospect."
1966.77,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4323.513,4325.029,"Well, you did a good job."
1966.77,2,38966,ronald_l_carlson,,4325.029,4328.045,That's for sure.
