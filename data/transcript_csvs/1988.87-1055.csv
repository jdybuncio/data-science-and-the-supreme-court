1988.87-1055,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.512,"We will hear argument first this morning in Number 87-1055, Elisa Chan versus Korean Air Lines, Limited."
1988.87-1055,0,36716,milton_g_sincoff,,12.683,19.696,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1055,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.307,223.193,"Mr. Sincoff, may I inquire of you whether you agree that Article 3 of the Warsaw Convention is operative here."
1988.87-1055,0,36716,milton_g_sincoff,,223.193,224.505,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1055,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.505,241.155,And under that article it seems to indicate that the sanction of removing the liability limit applies only if the ticket hasn't been delivered at all.
1988.87-1055,0,36716,milton_g_sincoff,,250.384,251.978,Justice--
1988.87-1055,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.978,254.836,"Now, why should we take a different view?"
1988.87-1055,0,36716,milton_g_sincoff,,254.836,268.378,"--I believe that Article 3, the first paragraph, must be read together with Article 3, the second paragraph, to which you have just referred."
1988.87-1055,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.758,306.94,"Well, I mean, you would take the position that if there are some typographical error on date or place of destination or origin on the ticket that the liability limit is forfeited?"
1988.87-1055,0,36716,milton_g_sincoff,,306.94,339.974,"--Well, my position would be and is that that is precisely what the drafters intended, mainly, if the date was omitted or one of the itinerary stopping places, destination... I should say ultimate destination or originating place... if any of those required particulars specified by the first paragraph of Article 3 were omitted, that is what the drafters intended."
1988.87-1055,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,349.064,358.889,I think there's confusion in the drafting history as to whether any of those things were sufficient to cause removal of the liability limit.
1988.87-1055,0,36716,milton_g_sincoff,,360.356,390.125,"--The drafting history, we submit, makes it clear that these particulars, each one of them, and especially the one that's involved in the case at bar, the statement warning of the damage limitation, they were characterized by the drafters as mandatory and invoking the sanction as they put it of losing the damage limitation."
1988.87-1055,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1285.591,1309.378,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1055,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1348.222,1357.812,"Mr. Lazarus, Japan offered an amendment at the time of the Warsaw Convention to make this position clear, and it was not adopted."
1988.87-1055,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1357.812,1359.921,"No, the Japanese amendment was adopted."
1988.87-1055,2,26195,george_n_tompkins_jr,,1841.305,1848.771,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1879.976,1884.864,No other party recognizes the necessity of giving notice?
1988.87-1055,2,26195,george_n_tompkins_jr,,1884.864,1888.567,--That is correct under the original 1929 Warsaw Convention.
1988.87-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.704,1899.624,That's what we're operating on.
1988.87-1055,2,26195,george_n_tompkins_jr,,1903.639,1906.545,"--No, this case is not subject to the Hague Protocol."
1988.87-1055,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.81,1909.027,Is this the original?
1988.87-1055,2,26195,george_n_tompkins_jr,,1909.027,1914.136,--The original 1929 treaty unamended by any provision.
1988.87-1055,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2020.61,2023.701,How did you accomplish it?
1988.87-1055,2,26195,george_n_tompkins_jr,,2024.545,2031.121,"Perhaps... if Your Honor please, perhaps I was more persuasive there than I was here 20 years ago."
1988.87-1055,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.189,2059.735,"Mr. Tompkins, can I interrupt you?"
1988.87-1055,2,26195,george_n_tompkins_jr,,2064.406,2065.481,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1988.87-1055,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2065.481,2068.231,What is the purpose of applying that sanction for that?
1988.87-1055,2,26195,george_n_tompkins_jr,,2076.087,2091.503,"The history reveals, if Your Honor please, that in 1925 when the draft convention was first put together, it included forms of transportation documents which the parties were going to consider making mandatory in the treaty."
1988.87-1055,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2141.701,2146.95,Wouldn't he have been have had all those rights even if he didn't have the ticket as long as he was a passenger on the plane?
1988.87-1055,2,26195,george_n_tompkins_jr,,2146.95,2156.429,"--He would not be in a position unless he was able to obtain the carriers' copy of the contract to establish his rights, and in order to ensure--"
1988.87-1055,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2156.429,2157.351,I don't understand that.
1988.87-1055,2,26195,george_n_tompkins_jr,,2157.351,2158.741,"--Well, the parties--"
1988.87-1055,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2158.741,2158.991,Why not?
1988.87-1055,2,26195,george_n_tompkins_jr,,2158.991,2160.257,--the history seems to indicate--
1988.87-1055,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2160.257,2162.662,"Didn't they all use uniform tickets, standard forms?"
1988.87-1055,2,26195,george_n_tompkins_jr,,2162.662,2173.204,"--No, they abandoned the idea of using a standard form, and the idea that the drafters adopted was that we would like the air line industry to develop its own form of ticketing."
1988.87-1055,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2183.216,2197.038,"You mean, you're telling me... I just want to be sure I understand what you're saying... you're saying that the reason it was important to give the passenger the ticket was so the passenger could prove that the air line had agreed to be subject to the Warsaw... all the convention's requirements?"
1988.87-1055,2,26195,george_n_tompkins_jr,,2197.038,2197.85,"--No, it's more than that, Your Honor."
