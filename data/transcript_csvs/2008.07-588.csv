2008.07-588,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.433,"We will hear argument first today in Case 07-588, Entergy Corporation v. Riverkeeper Incorporated, and the consolidated cases."
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,10.9,22.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For more than 30 years, EPA has construed the Clean Water Act to permit it to consider the relationship between costs and benefits in setting limits on water intake."
2008.07-588,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,96.268,103.61,"Of course, in the other provision, it specifically required consideration of costs and benefits and it didn't do so in this provision."
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,103.61,104.437,Right.
2008.07-588,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,127.163,138.235,"May I ask you to follow up on that, because your statement about compatibility raises what for me is a fundamental difficulty in understanding this case."
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,238.865,240.381,Two points on that.
2008.07-588,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,250.922,253.188,Do we know so far as intake pipes are concerned?
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,294.016,294.406,Sure.
2008.07-588,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,295.767,296.157,Yes.
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,296.859,306.386,"The first is that -- the first is that the history here is, that I was referring to, is with respect to cooling water intake structures, where for more than 30 years."
2008.07-588,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,322.065,338.026,"And have these been applications of something more than the outside standard, which I guess everybody agrees would apply in a case like this, that when it just becomes wholly or outrageously disproportionate, there wouldn't be -- that there would in that sense be a cost-benefit cutoff?"
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,340.183,340.838,--Yes.
2008.07-588,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,348.009,348.337,Right.
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,348.649,354.381,"And we cite in our brief one particular -- in our reply brief, one specific example where benefits were clearly not de minimis."
2008.07-588,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,354.381,367.72,"The Second Circuit recognized that latter kind of taking account of costs disproportionate, more than the industry would bear, and they also recognized a cost comparison."
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,393.49,399.222,"Well, first off -- I'm sorry."
2008.07-588,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,446.42,449.685,Isn't it easier to quantity that than the value of a plankton?
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,449.685,456.307,"--Not -- well -- but with costbenefit analyses, again, this is -- this is routinely done by agencies."
2008.07-588,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,458.057,465.587,It is -- let me -- I will -- I will grant you that agencies purport to do this kind of thing.
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,501.447,511.099,"--No, the -- I think the most irrational thing would be to just throw up one's hands and say that we are going to impose standards whether or not they do more harm than good, whether or not they make any sense."
2008.07-588,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,521.689,537.323,"Just to get back to your television hypothetical, if you told somebody that you were going to buy the best TV available, nobody would think you meant that, you know, you were going to buy a very cheap TV because, considering the costs and benefits, that was the best one."
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,541.273,544.821,"--Well, these words have different meanings in different contexts, which just underscores their ambiguity."
2008.07-588,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,573.448,573.775,Does it make any difference--
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,573.775,575.85,--that costs would be traded against benefits.
2008.07-588,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,575.85,582.768,"--You have the two labels: BPT, ""best practical"", and then ""best available""."
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,601.496,604.043,"These -- well, all of these words can have different meanings."
2008.07-588,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,624.048,631.375,"Well, my -- I think maybe what Justice Ginsburg was beginning to get at is my question here."
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,666.466,677.148,"Well, to be clear, the agency does not think -- and therefore did not in its regulation presume -- that the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact was more strict than the other standards."
2008.07-588,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,725.489,728.815,Are you disagreeing with the premise of Justice Kennedy's question?
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,728.815,729.502,--Yes.
2008.07-588,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,730.27,730.832,You don't think--
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,730.832,732.439,--this provision here for water intake--
2008.07-588,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,732.439,733.44,--Congress intended a tougher standard?
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,733.44,734.204,--Pardon?
2008.07-588,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.204,738.124,You do not think Congress intended a tougher standard; is that your--
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,738.124,742.889,We think Congress did not intend this to be a tougher standard than the ones for discharge of pollutants.
2008.07-588,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,742.889,746.87,Why didn't it use BPT or -- or one -- one of the other standards?
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,746.87,749.104,"Well, because these are all different standards."
2008.07-588,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,752.633,755.008,"If they are different, then one -- then it's either less rigorous or more rigorous."
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,755.008,755.523,Right.
2008.07-588,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,818.933,820.138,So it would have said--
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,820.138,820.637,--I was being prudent.
2008.07-588,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,820.637,823.075,"--So it would have said ""available to reduce""?"
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,835.428,843.784,"Well, elsewhere in the Clean -- in the Clean Water Act, Congress clearly did use ""minimize"" to mean reduction, because Congress called for a, quote, ""drastic minimization of paperwork""."
2008.07-588,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.668,863.369,"""Reduce"" in any event is -- is not -- is not the same as what you are arguing."
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,887.14,887.483,--No.
2008.07-588,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,894.181,895.491,Just to reduce.
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,895.491,897.57,--a reasonable -- it refers to a reasonable reduction.
2008.07-588,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.912,905.1,You -- I didn't understand that to be your position.
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,911.94,912.907,"Well, I guess--"
2008.07-588,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,912.907,915.578,You think any reduction constitutes minimizing?
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,915.578,921.03,"--No, because it does have to be a reasonable reduction, which would not be -- in this context would not be a trivial one."
2008.07-588,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.543,928.229,Yes.
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,928.229,935.493,"And so when we're talking about a reasonable reduction, we are going to talk about a reduction that is reasonable in light of, among other things, the relationship between costs and benefits."
2008.07-588,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,938.679,941.037,"Let me say it again, and you tell me whether you agree."
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,959.733,965.309,"I think that's right with -- with ""reasonably"" entailing a consideration of -- of the relationship between costs and benefits."
2008.07-588,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.309,967.403,"Of course, ""reasonable"" includes everything."
2008.07-588,0,21060,daryl_joseffer,,967.403,968.042,Yes.
2008.07-588,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,970.293,971.276,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,983.441,988.612,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start with just setting the stage here."
2008.07-588,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1019.27,1021.301,Do you agree this is a Chevron case?
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1021.301,1022.88,"--Well, it is a Chevron case, Your Honor."
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1037.625,1048.775,"Well, the -- the -- one question I have on this is if I look at the two standards, and the first one, ""best practical"" -- it talks about cost-benefit."
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1067.971,1068.751,"Your Honor, but that's--"
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1068.751,1070.376,"So they both use the word ""cost""."
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1070.376,1070.938,--They do.
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1070.938,1073.484,Then you look at what Senator Muskie said at the time.
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1073.484,1074.171,Yes.
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1074.171,1086.743,"And what Senator Muskie said at that time is the object here is when we move to better -- to better technology, we -- you know, when you get past the practical and you get into the other, it says to stop considering costs?"
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1154.856,1162.745,"Well, Your Honor, we are not arguing that you have to do monetized cost-benefit analysis, nor did the agency say that it was basing its rule on--"
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1162.745,1163.228,"Okay, fine."
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1176.678,1177.145,--Well--
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1177.145,1178.831,--the way that Senator Muskie suggested.
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1178.831,1188.049,"--But, Your Honor, the -- the Second Circuit held, and Respondents argue, that the benefits have to be essentially the same before you can look at the cost of the technology."
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1188.049,1192.561,"Well, now, what they are going to argue, I guess, is going to be up to them, and I'd be very interested in hearing it."
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1192.561,1193.827,But that's what the Second Circuit held--
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1193.827,1201.76,And then you would be satisfied with the following ruling: The Second Circuit went too far in saying that you can never take costs into account.
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1201.76,1202.809,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1202.809,1211.727,"Of course, you can sometimes take account of them, and the standard that we think is there -- I'm just imagining this -- is the one they have used for 30 years."
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1223.627,1226.985,"--Well, something like that, as long as it is clear that costs can be--"
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1226.985,1227.281,All right.
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1227.702,1236.325,"--Well, as long as costs can be compared to benefits, and the Second Circuit said they could not be; that the benefits have to be essentially the same."
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1241.557,1242.01,All right.
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1249.426,1250.927,Of comparison.
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1250.927,1257.128,"--of what the costs are relevant to, but a -- but a vague, grossly disproportionate test is okay with you?"
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1257.128,1257.861,"Well, if--"
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1257.861,1258.625,Is it or not?
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1258.625,1260.875,"--Vague, grossly disproportionate--"
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1260.875,1262.61,The one they used for 30 years at EPA.
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1262.61,1263.593,"--Your Honor, I think the point is--"
2008.07-588,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1263.593,1264.186,Is that all right or not all right?
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1264.186,1274.122,"--Yes, if for 30 years they have not been mandating closed-cycle cooling under that standing -- standard, so from the industry's perspective, that probably is an acceptable standard."
2008.07-588,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1328.395,1330.349,"Ms. Mahoney, I -- before you go any further."
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1341.045,1343.123,"--Wholly disproportionate, Your Honor, has been the test."
2008.07-588,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.09,1345.42,Wholly disproportionate?
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1345.42,1347.639,"Wholly disproportionate, not grossly disproportionate."
2008.07-588,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.639,1348.856,And you're -- you're happy with that?
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1348.856,1357.649,"Well, the point is that I -- I think what I am happy with is saying that the agency should have discretion to formulate what test it's going to use."
2008.07-588,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1360.289,1360.726,Okay.
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1362.852,1363.772,"--Yes, I do, Your Honor."
2008.07-588,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.772,1370.439,"--And you'd be happy if they continued to do that, but you wouldn't be particularly happy if we prescribed that as the only available test?"
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1371.535,1374.0,"Well, I just think that it's hard to get that out of the language."
2008.07-588,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1380.874,1381.514,--I see.
2008.07-588,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1381.514,1386.591,"Could the -- could the agency mandate a closed-cycle system, recirculating system--"
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1386.591,1387.496,"--Well, they haven't."
2008.07-588,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1387.496,1388.682,--for old plants?
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1396.976,1399.32,"Under a wholly disproportionate standard, Your Honor?"
2008.07-588,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1399.32,1401.055,Just under the statute.
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1401.055,1402.881,"Under the statute, I doubt it."
2008.07-588,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1443.989,1458.168,"But it -- it seems to me -- of course, there are limits on what the agency can do, but if it couldn't mandate the closed circulation system -- I think I've got the term right -- if it could not do that, then this is not -- you're backing away from Chevron, it seems to me."
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1458.168,1459.654,"Well, here's -- here's how I would say it, Your Honor."
2008.07-588,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1556.895,1559.317,"Then why didn't they use the word ""cost""?"
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1559.317,1561.33,"--Because, Your Honor, I don't think--"
2008.07-588,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1561.33,1566.937,"I mean, your argument is they used ""cost"" here, they used ""cost"" there, they didn't use ""cost"" here, but they must have meant ""cost""."
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1566.937,1575.34,"--Here's why, Your Honor: Because the most significant comparison between this statutory section and the others is they didn't list any of the factors."
2008.07-588,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1585.696,1591.679,And maybe the inference to be drawn is the agency is not supposed to be taking any of these considerations into account.
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1591.679,1605.0,"--I -- I don't think that's the most reasonable inference because it would lead to very irrational results, 200-foot cooling towers in -- in -- in town -- in historic old towns--"
2008.07-588,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1605.0,1610.389,You've got the -- I mean everybody agrees that there is kind of an ultimate irrationality standard here.
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1614.854,1616.013,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2008.07-588,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1634.8,1636.036,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-588,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1636.036,1636.488,Thank you.
2008.07-588,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1636.488,1641.249,Mr. Lazarus.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1641.249,1655.152,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In section 316(b), Congress did not authorize EPA to decide that the benefits of minimizing adverse environmental impact did not justify the cost of available technology."
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.152,1659.511,"Except -- except, you say, when it's grossly disproportionate?"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1659.511,1660.369,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1660.369,1662.728,"Where -- where -- where do you find that or the Second Circuit said, anyway?"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1662.728,1664.554,"Let me explain our position, Your Honor."
2008.07-588,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1734.831,1741.5,"I don't want to interrupt you in your enumeration of three reasons, but I just don't see how you get cost into the concept of availability."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1745.918,1749.654,"--No, I think it -- I think it fits quite well in the word ""available""."
2008.07-588,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1755.648,1756.883,It's not the plain meaning of the word.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1778.218,1792.163,"--I think because it's clear that in the context of the Clean Water Act what Congress meant in ""available"" -- and this is throughout the statute -- all the technology-based performance standards, the availability was both technologically available and economically available."
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.258,1797.708,"You are using the word in a strange -- ""economically available""?"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1797.708,1798.956,--Yes.
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.956,1800.768,Economically feasible maybe.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1816.184,1821.944,"It may -- it may be weird, Your Honor, but it is not anything that has ever been disputed in the interpretation of the Water Act."
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.132,1832.723,I disagree with that.
2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1832.723,1838.875,"If ""availability"" -- if ""availability"" includes economic availability, why doesn't ""best"" include ""economically best""?"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1838.875,1845.906,Because what the statute says is not that EPA should -- should promulgate the best technology.
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.929,1863.68,"But that -- but that -- that doesn't answer, it seems to me, the question."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1877.251,1880.468,"--No, it certainly -- it certainly includes costs."
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1884.624,1885.014,Why?
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1902.726,1914.784,"--Well, there is no -- there is no question, Your Honor, that the word ""available"", and perhaps the word ""best"" -- we think the word ""available"" includes an inquiry into whether or not it could be borne by industry."
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.549,1920.625,"I -- I agree with you on that, whether it's borne by the industry."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1921.919,1922.419,"--No, no--"
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1922.419,1925.698,Why isn't where that line is drawn up to the agency?
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1925.698,1929.184,"--We're not, Your Honor, and let me try to explain because I think we are confusing different inquiries here."
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.184,1929.683,Okay.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1929.683,1936.991,We also would agree that EPA can take into account site-specific factors in deciding whether technology is available.
2008.07-588,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1957.484,1964.607,Isn't that -- isn't that exactly what they did here in listing what they called a suite of technologies or approaches that is available?
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1970.557,1970.978,--Right.
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.488,2024.02,I don't see how you can do that.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2052.191,2052.616,No--
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.616,2066.748,"But to be honest about it, I'd have to say the reason it isn't available is quite -- it isn't available for minimizing the -- the harm, that particular adverse impact which is killing a -- a water animal."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2073.009,2073.325,--But--
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.325,2077.4,"--Or it kills three, and don't tell me de minimis, because as soon as you say ""de minimis"", I'm going to add one, okay?"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2152.225,2155.695,--But for best available there is no cost-benefit analysis.
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.865,2161.974,"No, no, no, but best available says take costs into account."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2161.974,2162.317,--Right.
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2162.692,2174.654,"Now, there's a way of doing that which is what I'd call a commonsense way that they have some discretion over, that doesn't involve some enormously elaborate thing; and that's what I am searching for."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2179.03,2180.761,"But -- well, let me try to give you an answer."
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2189.851,2191.43,Those two things seem contrary to me.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2193.993,2198.099,"--Well, I don't, because it's two fundamentally different policy decisions."
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2213.45,2216.387,But how is it -- how is it feasible if it has no benefits at all?
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2216.387,2221.011,"It -- it -- it's still feasible for, in terms of the -- whether they can afford it."
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2221.011,2223.012,Then we are going to reach our insane results.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2223.012,2225.289,You -- you're never going to -- you're never going reach the insane result.
2008.07-588,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2265.853,2271.787,"Counsel, your argument is focused on proving that your interpretation won't lead to insane results, as you put it."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2277.426,2295.106,"Well, I think it's not ambiguous language because if you look at the statutory language, it says, right, in section 316(b), EPA is required, right -- instructed, required -- that location, design, construction, capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact."
2008.07-588,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2321.221,2328.093,"You have a -- you have a good argument based on the language of the statute, I think, that costs cannot be taken into account at all."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2328.093,2328.467,But--
2008.07-588,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2328.467,2329.091,At all.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2337.775,2339.431,"--Well, Your Honor, this is a--"
2008.07-588,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2339.431,2342.461,Once the foot is in the door I don't see how you can--
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2342.461,2344.634,"--No, it's a -- it's a complete line."
2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2365.888,2372.948,"Our problem is that we -- you've got a clear distinction in mind, and I don't think we are getting the distinction."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2399.028,2399.403,--No.
2008.07-588,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2402.604,2403.139,--Right.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2403.575,2405.073,--And for reasons that you suggested--
2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2405.073,2416.912,"But is the only question -- when you say they can consider costs, are you saying they are simply asking whether it is economically possible for the industry to afford this, regardless of whether it's any good or not?"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2416.912,2417.442,--Absolutely.
2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2417.442,2418.365,Is that your point?
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2418.365,2418.943,Absolutely.
2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2418.943,2419.317,Okay.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2419.317,2421.645,"What -- in 1972, this is what Congress was faced with."
2008.07-588,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2421.645,2427.144,"--When you say whether the industry can afford it, does that take into account at all the effect on the price that consumers have to pay?"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2441.81,2448.041,"If it can be reasonably borne by the industry or some site-specific, they can't make any other judgment."
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2449.024,2450.054,Can't make any other judgment.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2484.307,2484.775,--Right.
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2503.878,2505.531,That's exactly where I agree with you.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2537.598,2553.921,"--And going back to Justice Souter's statement a moment ago, which I agree with, what Senator Muskie -- the distinction he wanted to draw was to allow EPA to engage in cost analysis as to feasibility, money in the bank, but not to make that value judgment of what's worth what."
2008.07-588,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2554.342,2559.497,"Well, if you get to that, money in the bank, does this mean that best technology available changes over time?"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2567.32,2578.721,"--It certainly does depend, and this is how EPA does it, not just in this area but throughout all the technology-based performance standards, looking at availability."
2008.07-588,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2585.811,2592.483,"So you think they could have said, two years ago, this is what you have to do, but today they would say you don't have to do that anymore--"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2592.483,2593.419,It's quite possible--
2008.07-588,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2593.419,2596.043,--even though the technology is still available.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2596.043,2598.247,--But notice -- notice -- not economically.
2008.07-588,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2657.208,2657.816,"Mr. Lazarus, can I ask--"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2657.816,2658.58,--once-through to closed-cycle.
2008.07-588,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2658.58,2659.581,--May I ask you this question?
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2663.438,2664.265,That's right.
2008.07-588,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2664.265,2667.326,What about if it bankrupts three firms?
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2667.326,2687.163,"If it bankrupts three firms -- if one looks how EPA has interpreted that historically, Your Honor, throughout all the pollution control statutes, the Air Act, the Water Act, Resource Conservation Act, EPA has said that itself isn't enough to say it's not available for the industry, but it is possible -- we don't doubt this -- it is possible--"
2008.07-588,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2687.163,2689.46,But it's not economically available to those three firms.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2689.46,2698.004,"--No, but here's what happens: What the EPA said -- and you can see this in this Court's decision in the Crushed Stone case, where the Court drew this distinction."
2008.07-588,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.04,2721.946,"No, but this -- it's -- they are just not quite as strong a company."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2721.946,2722.446,--No.
2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2726.989,2734.737,But is the variance a matter of statutory right or -- or is it available under a regulation?
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2734.737,2748.514,"It's -- the way this Court interpreted sort of the use of categorical standards in the Dupont case, early on in the 1970s, the Court said in that case that EPA can promulgate these kind of technology-based performance standards on a categorical basis--"
2008.07-588,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2748.514,2748.966,Yes.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2748.966,2754.044,"--but if they do so, they have to take -- they have to give a variance possibility because if a particular--"
2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2754.044,2757.307,Why -- why isn't that simply another name for cost-benefit analysis?
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2757.307,2760.946,--Because you can't do it on a cost-benefit -- it's not a cost-benefit variance.
2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2760.946,2762.381,"Well, you are doing it on cost-benefit."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2762.927,2763.274,No--
2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2763.274,2773.112,"--if we require this and the company goes bankrupt, the value of demanding it is not satisfied by the result."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2773.112,2775.503,"--No, that's not the justification for the cost variance."
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2803.302,2819.018,"I assume you can't get a variance -- and you also would say the EPA cannot take it into account -- if this particular plant -- although the company as a whole is quite prosperous, this is a small plant, and it's not generating that much electricity."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2823.497,2824.152,"No, that--"
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2824.152,2827.841,That would not be something that EPA could take into account.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2827.841,2836.756,"--The EPA can take into account, as they do for all technology-based performance standards -- they can take into account the size of the facility to the extent it bears on the availability question."
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2844.676,2846.583,"So, what about the particular case?"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2890.847,2892.89,We're not saying they can't take that into account.
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2906.416,2922.522,"So if they did exactly the same thing they've done, which I've just read you, and they put a label on it, instead of saying ""thinking of benefits"", we were calling it now ""taking into account environmental impacts"", then they could do it?"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2922.522,2929.736,"--Well -- but they -- here's what they can do, Your Honor, and I don't think there is anything anomalous about this: The EPA can say,"
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2959.38,2963.818,"I see that thought, and this is what's concerning me, but there may be a very good answer."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2999.927,3000.364,Right.
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3000.364,3002.598,"Now, I'm worried about what you are saying."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3006.267,3008.097,"Well, we are doing the exact opposite, Your Honor."
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3054.029,3054.997,I agree.
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3054.997,3058.451,"And that's why they said, we want to take out this particular."
2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3084.706,3094.123,"Well, is the reason they don't do cost-benefit analysis well because they are forced to do it in a political atmosphere in which it is difficult to make rational decisions?"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3097.154,3099.669,"--I think that may be part, but I don't think that's--"
2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3099.669,3100.106,Is that--
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3100.106,3101.572,--the real reason in 1972.
2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3122.906,3155.065,"--But I think -- I see your point, but I think if I accept your point, all I am doing is saying, they may in a kind of smoke and mirrors way take cost-benefit analysis into consideration sub rosa, when they decide what availability is going to mean; and they make take it into consideration when they decide what a -- a -- an undesirable environmental impact is; and that sort of gets the -- the weighing process out of the public focus."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3167.578,3179.824,"Well, I think our argument boils down to that they can focus on environmental impacts, define what is and isn't an environmental impact, they can focus on availability, decides what costs are relevant to that, and when a technology is available--"
2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3179.824,3181.103,What costs are relevant to that?

2008.07-588,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3182.042,3196.875,"And when they made that decision, are they not in effect anticipating the kind of decision that they would make on a more specific basis in a more highly charged political atmosphere, if they engaged in the cost-benefit analysis that you say they can't do?"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3196.875,3203.313,"--It may well be one reason why Congress didn't want to compare one to the other, about that charged atmosphere."
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3212.825,3223.256,"And the page -- the page of the legislative history or the page of the text of the statute that says what I think is a -- I mean, try it with your son."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3225.131,3226.067,"Sorry, I couldn't quite hear you."
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3226.067,3228.084,"Your son says, 100> [""]."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3249.043,3249.48,Right.
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3249.48,3250.56,What page?
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3251.824,3254.277,I'm -- I'm not going to give you a specific page.
2008.07-588,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3256.823,3258.555,I know 316(b).
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3258.555,3273.252,What Congress is doing systemically in 316(b) and throughout the Clean Water Act was that Congress was saying we want to give EPA the authority for cost feasibility; we don't believe in this -- that it works with cost-benefit analysis because of the weighing against one against the other.
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3273.252,3280.938,"Well, it has -- it has required -- not just permitted but required cost-benefit analysis in other areas."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3281.421,3281.874,Well--
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3281.874,3300.427,"--What -- what is your response to the fact that it seems ridiculous to allow it, and indeed require it in effluent situations where human health is at stake, and yet to forbid it in this intake situation when you're just talking about the snail darter."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3303.005,3305.458,"--Two responses, Your Honor."
2008.07-588,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3332.321,3335.242,And did that section 307 not allow cost-benefit?
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3335.242,3336.194,--It did not allow cost-benefit.
2008.07-588,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3416.726,3417.163,Counsel--
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3417.163,3418.489,But that's the only provision.
2008.07-588,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3418.489,3428.175,"--You would have to agree, wouldn't you, that the panel's decision in this case overruled the prior panel's decision, in Judge Katzmann's opinion in Riverkeeper I?"
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3428.175,3430.827,"No, they certainly didn't overrule it for two different reasons."
2008.07-588,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3447.087,3457.648,"Well, in Riverkeeper I, what Judge Katzmann said is that we think the EPA was permitted to consider costs and energy efficiency in determining the best technology available."
2008.07-588,2,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3461.13,3463.692,"He gave -- he gave several reasons, Your Honor."
2008.07-588,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3477.637,3482.37,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-588,3,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3485.852,3486.585,Thank you.
2008.07-588,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3498.301,3502.66,It's an ambiguity the government said it could live with.
2008.07-588,3,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3509.204,3522.636,"Our -- our -- what we said is we thought the court of appeals was dead wrong, that it was a very important issue, but that in the interlocutory posture of this case, which was a remand, we did not think that it was so -- so important as to warrant your cert standards."
2008.07-588,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3572.753,3575.206,"Well, that was the House side, which the House side was against that."
2008.07-588,3,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3617.926,3620.284,"Well, look -- first off."
2008.07-588,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3740.323,3741.107,"Thank you, counsel."
