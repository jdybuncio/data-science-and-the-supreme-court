2013.12-1168,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.404,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-1168, McCullen v. Coakley."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,7.32,13.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,114.589,138.138,"Mr. Rienzi, the problem that the State faced is it doesn't know -- and it has a history, there was a considerable history of disturbances and blocking the entrance, and it doesn't know in advance who are the well-behaved people and who are the people who won't behave well."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,162.236,166.89,So I think the State is simply wrong about that fact for several reasons.
2013.12-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.757,235.718,"You know, I should probably ask this of the other side, and I will, but do you happen to know when was the last time that Massachusetts prosecuted somebody for obstructing entrance to an abortion clinic?"
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,235.718,248.109,"So I believe the last cite in the record that I'm aware of is, as of 1997, there was a decision in a previous injunction case against people who had been adjudicated to have broken rules."
2013.12-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,255.698,260.234,"So there have been laws against obstruction during this entire period, right?"
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,260.234,262.269,There have been laws against obstruction the entire time.
2013.12-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,262.269,269.09,"And you say that only once, in 1997, that was the last time a prosecution was brought."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,269.09,271.125,And that was an injunction against prior bad actors.
2013.12-1168,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,273.909,285.051,You are not taking the position that 1997 was the last time an entrance was obstructed or that the police were called to open access to a clinic?
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,290.471,293.507,I frankly don't -- I couldn't say that I know the last time it happened.
2013.12-1168,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,293.507,295.807,But you do know that in the record there were more examples?
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,295.807,298.625,I know that in the record there was testimony claiming that that happened.
2013.12-1168,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,304.613,318.522,"Mr. Rienzi, the State says, of that particular tool, that it's a hard thing to prosecute because you have to show intent, and there is a lot of obstruction and interference that goes on naturally just because there are a lot of people around."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,322.426,322.509,--Yes.
2013.12-1168,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,346.291,364.353,"And sometimes there are those bad actors, but probably more often it's just a function of there are just lots of people, and they, your clients and all of -- all of them want to be as close as possible to the site, and that that naturally leads to an interference with normal access."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,364.353,366.603,And so I agree that's the second part of the State's argument.
2013.12-1168,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,391.486,395.788,Does the record show how many clinics in the State are covered by the law?
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,395.788,398.824,I believe there are 11 or 12 clinics in the State.
2013.12-1168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,402.878,405.58,How far do you want to go in your concession?
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,457.763,459.981,"So, no, I do not mean to concede that."
2013.12-1168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,465.284,467.32,But now you are into the details.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,496.923,498.006,--Generally--
2013.12-1168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,498.006,498.89,With the details.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,498.89,499.792,"--Generally speaking, no."
2013.12-1168,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,501.892,525.073,"So protestors like the one we had in the Schneider case at a funeral of a veteran can go right up to the public sidewalk outside the church and put up the signs that they did and give out the leaflets that they did, talking about that veteran in the ways that they did?"
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,526.609,529.061,"--So -- so, a couple points about that."
2013.12-1168,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,529.477,534.513,There was no evidence there that they were -- that they were disruptive.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,537.548,538.917,--So I think that that--
2013.12-1168,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,538.917,543.285,But there is the potential for disruption because of the strong sentiments around that.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,543.285,544.321,--Agreed.
2013.12-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.163,568.102,"In Schneider, they were held not so far back that their shouts and protests couldn't be heard."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,571.054,573.654,I think it made--
2013.12-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.654,574.423,--out of--
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,574.423,578.708,--perhaps were part of the funeral procession that passed by.
2013.12-1168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,579.558,580.659,Do you see now why I am trying to narrow it?
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,615.833,632.109,"--So the matter of very broad principle is that a law that makes it illegal to even engage in consensual conversation, quiet conversation, on a public sidewalk, an act that makes that a criminal act for which Mrs. McCullen can go to prison, I think, is not permissible under the First Amendment."
2013.12-1168,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,644.769,666.615,"But are you saying that you could not do an act that instead just says, look, it's a little bit too hard to figure out what and what does not disrupt peace and order, so we're just going to say 25 feet around a funeral, or 25 feet around any facility, that that's never permissible?"
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,666.615,675.221,"So, generally speaking, I think any law like that runs into a big First Amendment problem of even eliminating peaceful, consensual conversation that doesn't disrupt anything."
2013.12-1168,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,693.333,700.17,"Well, for example, I was intrigued by one of the examples that you gave in your own brief, which you said slaughterhouses."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,749.986,752.204,--So what's wrong with that is a couple of things.
2013.12-1168,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,779.272,793.865,"In one of the examples that is given in one of the amicus briefs in this case, and they -- they provide a lot of background, is a State law that creates a buffer zone around every fraternal lodge."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,796.567,805.256,"I think it is difficult to imagine the government interest to -- well, first, I guess, I don't know the particulars of that law and what it -- what it restricts."
2013.12-1168,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,843.131,845.5,But let's go back to the slaughterhouse case.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,884.875,888.593,"--To be clear, Your Honor, I'm not saying the government has to let it go on."
2013.12-1168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,894.231,903.687,"But suppose -- and this is still Justice Kagan's question -- suppose it were a given, assume that those laws just did not work."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,915.66,920.981,Suppose it were a given that there is no way to keep the abortion clinic open--
2013.12-1168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,920.981,928.904,"The laws simply do not -- reference to obstruction and blocking entrance, simply do not work."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,928.904,939.01,"--If the laws simply do not work, I think perhaps the government could come in and make a case that it has a compelling interest and that this is the least restrictive means of doing it."
2013.12-1168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,939.01,939.393,Okay.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1005.737,1017.628,"So -- so, on this detail, what -- what I think the Court should look for is, for example, had they had a -- the State said they did not even convict a single person of one unconsensual--"
2013.12-1168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1017.628,1018.928,But you understand that.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1052.385,1054.868,"--So, a few things."
2013.12-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1067.711,1074.464,"--Counsel, do you accept that the record here shows that it did not work well in the sense that Justice Breyer--"
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1074.464,1075.364,"--No, not at all."
2013.12-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.364,1076.166,--seems to use it?
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1076.166,1078.0,I understood I was being asked to assume that.
2013.12-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.0,1086.706,"As I recall the record, all -- all it says is that the police found it difficult to apply a bubble; that, you know, they have to measure 8 feet or whatever it is."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1096.062,1096.664,No.
2013.12-1168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1098.414,1100.282,That's why I just asked you that question.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1132.003,1132.787,"--I -- I agree, but if--"
2013.12-1168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1132.787,1133.787,I'm not trying to put words--
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1133.787,1138.074,--if you sent me 35 feet further back and asked me to make my argument from there--
2013.12-1168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1138.074,1138.457,--I'd hear you.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1138.457,1143.209,"--You might hear me, but I would suggest you'd -- you'd receive it quite differently."
2013.12-1168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1153.516,1154.95,I'm not denying the difference.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1154.95,1155.535,--Yeah.
2013.12-1168,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1155.535,1159.82,"I am asking you, we've now heard different characterizations of the record."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1172.062,1181.501,"So the constitutional narrow tailoring test under the time, place, and manner test requires that the law not restrict substantially more speech than necessary to serve the government's interest."
2013.12-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1182.186,1184.103,How much is -- how much is restricted?
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1194.16,1198.545,"--If -- if you're walking nonstop, I assume 7 to 10 seconds or something like that."
2013.12-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1198.545,1204.016,So the conversation can go on before those 7 to 10 seconds.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1204.016,1205.416,Yeah.
2013.12-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1205.416,1210.853,There's not much you're going to be able to do to have a conversation that will persuade people in 7 to 10 seconds.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1210.853,1212.955,"I respectfully disagree on that last point, Your Honor."
2013.12-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1232.285,1233.718,And if you know they're going to the clinic.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1233.718,1236.087,And if you can identify the audience early enough.
2013.12-1168,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1252.264,1255.382,But isn't that more a function that they just have a private parking lot?
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1263.972,1264.522,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1168,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1289.389,1292.741,Is there a buffer zone that you would concede is permissible?
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1295.959,1302.78,"So, as the size of the zone decreases, I think the -- the imposition on the speech rights is -- you know, gets less and less and better and better."
2013.12-1168,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1315.606,1318.224,"Well, but that goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1326.145,1327.247,That's -- that's precisely the point.
2013.12-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.28,1363.937,"It is the case, isn't it, that not only abortion counselors are -- are excluded from this area, everybody is, right?"
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1367.205,1367.991,So--
2013.12-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.991,1373.709,"--can't -- I mean, this is a -- a dead speech zone, right?"
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1373.709,1375.061,--In many respects it is.
2013.12-1168,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1384.201,1385.051,It's more than a speech-free zone.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1392.523,1400.36,"--I agree the government has eliminated more than speech on that sidewalk, but they've eliminated speech on that sidewalk as surely as in the Jews for Jesus case."
2013.12-1168,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1400.36,1401.545,It's still a thoroughfare--
2013.12-1168,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1401.545,1403.997,"Well, they haven't entirely eliminated speech because employees are permitted--"
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1403.997,1404.364,Yes.
2013.12-1168,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1404.364,1406.782,--to speak within the scope of their employment; isn't that right?
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1406.782,1407.482,"Thank you, Justice Alito."
2013.12-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1411.334,1425.994,"Well, that's a -- a contested point because the Attorney General reads ‶ scope of employment ″ to mean getting to my job and leaving my job, and does not include speech activity."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1425.994,1432.832,"--So on the face of the statute, I don't that -- that that interpretation doesn't do very much."
2013.12-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1433.35,1439.087,This is the -- the chief legal officer of the State says this is a term that needs to be interpreted.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1451.395,1454.597,--So the Attorney General says it's more than just getting to work and leaving work.
2013.12-1168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1499.892,1513.469,"Well, am I correct that the Attorney General's regulation with respect to employees of the clinic in a way made this even more content-based because there was a prohibition on discussing the -- the abortion procedure?"
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1513.469,1514.219,I -- I agree.
2013.12-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1547.29,1548.142,"But it's ‶ such as ″, it's ‶ such as ″."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1549.125,1551.277,"Well, I -- I agree."
2013.12-1168,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1551.777,1555.379,"Well, it's not content -- it's not based on speech about abortion."
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1557.08,1563.234,"--Well, the -- the interpretation as to the employees that the Attorney General has proffered for 6 years is about speech about abortion."
2013.12-1168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.268,1564.584,Excuse me.
2013.12-1168,0,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,1577.142,1579.594,--The Attorney General has taken multiple positions on that.
2013.12-1168,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1600.274,1600.941,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1605.995,1610.03,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.819,1620.838,This is not a protest case.
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1650.274,1653.107,"It -- Your Honor, I would say it's a congestion case."
2013.12-1168,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1665.117,1665.884,"Well, it's more than a few feet."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1683.495,1690.232,"--Just as a factual matter, I did want to point out that in Boston, for example, the door is recessed."
2013.12-1168,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1698.302,1699.921,I thought it was two car lengths.
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1699.921,1700.654,I'm sorry?
2013.12-1168,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1700.654,1701.454,Two car lengths.
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1701.454,1702.706,I'm sorry.
2013.12-1168,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1703.19,1703.756,Two car lengths.
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1703.756,1705.325,Two car lengths.
2013.12-1168,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1706.192,1709.044,"That's, I think, a little less than this courtroom."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1709.044,1710.627,We measured this courtroom.
2013.12-1168,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1710.627,1712.145,I'd just like you to go back to Justice Scalia's question for one second.
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1722.267,1724.636,"Well, certainly, there's a picture of a calm conversation--"
2013.12-1168,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1724.636,1731.892,"No, the evidence upon which Massachusetts based its decision to go to 35 feet instead of 8 feet."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1741.748,1743.967,"--Certainly, the evidence showed something else."
2013.12-1168,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1743.967,1744.5,What?
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1744.5,1747.402,Experience showed that there had to be a certain amount of space around the facilities.
2013.12-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.511,1770.35,"Well, surely you could have a law against screaming and shouting within 35 feet or protesting within 35 feet."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1786.627,1796.299,"But, again, experience showed that even individuals who wanted to engage in close, quiet, peaceful conversation were creating congestion around--"
2013.12-1168,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1796.299,1806.207,"Rather -- I note there's some people who are peaceful, in which case I would accept Justice Scalia's suggestion this is a counseling case."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1832.456,1837.992,"--They didn't make a fine distinction, Your Honor, because it didn't matter whether people were being peaceful or whether they were--"
2013.12-1168,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.992,1840.677,Could you have written such a statute that would have worked?
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1840.677,1842.963,"--It would have been very difficult to write such a statute, Your Honor."
2013.12-1168,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1842.963,1844.498,How did you pick 35 feet?
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1845.565,1852.002,"Well, again, experience showed that some amount of space around the buffer zones -- around the facilities needed to be open."
2013.12-1168,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1899.3,1900.502,To go to -- go back for a second.
2013.12-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.727,1942.412,You should say yes.
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1943.445,1943.812,--And I will.
2013.12-1168,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1944.947,1948.833,"She can't say yes if it isn't there, because I'm going to ask her where because I want to read it."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1948.833,1950.166,"I will of course, Your Honor."
2013.12-1168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1958.338,1980.287,"Well, let -- let me ask this question: Assume it to be true that an elderly lady who was quite successful and had meaningful communication with over 100 women going into the clinic, before this law, was unable to talk to even one after this law."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,1998.248,2005.402,"I -- I think, Your Honor, that no one is guaranteed any specific form of communication."
2013.12-1168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2021.697,2025.483,You say there's no -- no guarantee of talking quietly?
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2025.483,2029.018,--There is--
2013.12-1168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2029.018,2035.255,Do you want me to write an opinion and say there's no free speech right to quietly converse on an issue of public importance?
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2035.255,2037.056,--Generally on the public sidewalk.
2013.12-1168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2051.65,2054.835,I still don't know where you're going to -- this -- this goes to Justice Breyer's question.
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2074.916,2080.819,"--Your Honor, we -- we couldn't here, obviously, because that wasn't the problem."
2013.12-1168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2087.139,2093.893,"But in speech cases, when you address one problem, you have a duty to protect speech that's -- that's -- that's lawful."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2093.893,2095.995,--You do.
2013.12-1168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2101.649,2111.339,"But I -- I think what you have to say to this Court is that it's impossible to write a statute of the kind that we are discussing now, and this is Justice Breyer's question."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2111.339,2123.746,--It would be enormously difficult to write a statute that addressed the problem and the significant interest here where you are making that kind of a find--
2013.12-1168,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2123.746,2127.698,May I ask you a question about a distinction that is in this statute?
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2169.627,2175.031,"--Your Honor, I think what the statute distinguishes is based on what those two different people are doing."
2013.12-1168,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2200.479,2202.764,"Well, that's what she -- what she's doing is what she's saying."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2211.887,2212.27,Right.
2013.12-1168,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2212.27,2215.756,"If it's as big as this courtroom, they're the only three people in that zone."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2215.756,2216.122,Right.
2013.12-1168,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2216.122,2217.941,The difference is a viewpoint difference.
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2217.941,2232.451,The -- what the legislature has done is that it has created a circle around these entrances and has only permitted particular conduct within that buffer zone to allow the traffic to keep moving on the sidewalk and to allow people to get in and out.
2013.12-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.556,2243.175,I don't understand it.
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2249.995,2250.245,--The--
2013.12-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2250.245,2251.628,Is that--
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2251.628,2254.463,--The statute is not focused on that person's speech.
2013.12-1168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2258.934,2264.755,"But the consequence is just what is described by Justice Scalia; that is, the consequence of the statute."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2268.707,2270.658,"Certainly, I wouldn't say that, Your Honor."
2013.12-1168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2271.874,2274.526,"It seems to me that you should answer Justice Scalia's question, then."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2274.526,2281.197,"--With respect to viewpoint discrimination, Your Honors, the statute has a perfectly legitimate sweep."
2013.12-1168,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2292.488,2295.54,"Well, you could have created a completely silent zone."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2327.411,2327.945,Right.
2013.12-1168,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2327.945,2330.197,So how do you justify that?
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2338.384,2352.443,"What I would argue, Your Honor, is that speech in that particular circumstance of the employee actually doing her job and not unnecessarily cluttering the buffer zone, what -- then that speech is simply incidental to the permissible conduct."
2013.12-1168,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2360.766,2362.168,You think it's incidental?
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2366.536,2370.155,--It's incidental to her performing her job.
2013.12-1168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2394.353,2401.726,"It's very hard for me to credit the statement or the implication that for an employee to say,"
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2412.165,2418.255,It's incidental to the permissible purpose for which they are allowed in the buffer zone.
2013.12-1168,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2441.953,2455.511,"Well, that raises another question, Ms. Miller, because I assume that that's true because the crowds and the obstruction really are with respect to one facility at certain periods of time."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2469.271,2469.721,Right.
2013.12-1168,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2469.721,2470.238,So why not?
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2470.238,2476.841,"Because the experience has shown that you do have problems at Worcester and Springfield, and those problems do center around the driveways."
2013.12-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2539.534,2546.188,"--I -- I object to you calling these people protestors, which you've been doing here during the whole presentation."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2558.745,2567.351,"--Your Honor, the problem, of course, that the statute was looking to address was not with protestors, per se."
2013.12-1168,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2585.563,2595.703,"And I would think, Ms. Miller, that if you tried to do a statute that distinguished between protestors and counselors, that would be content-based much more than this statute is."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2595.703,2596.953,--I would agree.
2013.12-1168,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2596.953,2601.774,"I mean, but -- you know, which is not to say that this statute doesn't have its problems, in my view."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2606.326,2609.028,"Again, the experience."
2013.12-1168,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2640.249,2644.934,"Well, before you sit down, can I ask you this question that's suggested by the AFL-CIO briefs."
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2669.252,2669.869,Right.
2013.12-1168,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2676.405,2676.739,All right.
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2678.357,2687.13,"--Well, this Court has repeatedly upheld restrictions on labor activity, if given the right record."
2013.12-1168,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2692.265,2693.2,"In every case, in every case--"
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2693.2,2694.234,"--No, no, no."
2013.12-1168,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2694.234,2695.819,--there could just be a flat rule.
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2707.627,2708.027,Right.
2013.12-1168,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2716.482,2720.867,You don't think there's a history -- you don't think there's a history of violence at places where there are strikes and replacement workers?
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2720.867,2730.123,"--Well, I don't think there has been the kind of history and sustained violence that we've had -- this almost unique record in Massachusetts with respect to facilities."
2013.12-1168,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2731.659,2734.111,That's not my understanding of the labor history.
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2734.111,2734.644,--does not have is--
2013.12-1168,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2734.644,2738.729,Is there any abortion clinic that has not had -- is there any abortion clinic that has not had a problem in Massachusetts?
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2738.729,2753.006,"--In -- there was, when the legislature was considering the statute, there was a survey submitted by NARAL that reviewed the experience of the ten facilities that were then in existence in Massachusetts."
2013.12-1168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2765.896,2768.915,"This is testimony by the -- by the clinics themselves, right?"
2013.12-1168,1,31750,jennifer_grace_miller,,2768.915,2769.534,Correct.
2013.12-1168,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2773.569,2774.569,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2788.579,2790.698,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1168,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2802.255,2806.807,Which of our -- which of our precedents do you think governs this case?
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2806.807,2810.242,"--So, Your Honor, I think that there are a number of precedents that are helpful."
2013.12-1168,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2816.079,2817.181,That was an injunction.
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2817.181,2823.002,"It was an injunction, Your Honor, but it was upheld under an even stricter standard that -- that is applies here."
2013.12-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2872.666,2874.102,What's the alternative here?
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2874.102,2875.118,--The alternative--
2013.12-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2875.118,2876.987,Standing 35 feet away and yelling?
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2876.987,2877.687,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2877.687,2878.504,Is that the alternative?
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2878.504,2879.088,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2879.088,2880.305,To comfort these women?
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2880.305,2881.272,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2895.098,2896.8,They don't know who's going into the clinic.
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2896.8,2898.017,"--Your Honor, the testimony--"
2013.12-1168,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2898.017,2903.787,"Until you get to the area close to the clinic, you don't know whether passersby are going there or not."
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2903.787,2913.16,"--Your Honor, the testimony is actually to the contrary, that they get -- that Ms. McCullen and others get quite good at identifying who is going and is not going into the clinic."
2013.12-1168,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2919.181,2925.784,"Is your concern that, absent this statute, there will be physical obstruction to the entrance?"
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2927.019,2928.386,"--So, Your Honor, let me address that."
2013.12-1168,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2934.456,2941.996,"Let me ask, if that's -- if that's your concern, how many Federal prosecutions were brought in Massachusetts for physical obstruction under the Federal statute?"
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2941.996,2943.864,"--Your Honor, I'm not aware of the number."
2013.12-1168,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2958.958,2967.044,But the Federal interest that you're the defending is you don't want this physical obstruction statute to be misinterpreted.
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2967.044,2969.146,That's right.
2013.12-1168,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2969.146,2977.519,But what's wrong with the physical obstruction statute as an answer to many of the problems that Massachusetts is facing?
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2977.519,2987.208,"Your Honor, I don't think it's at all an answer to the problems Massachusetts is facing because, as Justice Scalia has repeatedly pointed out, these are not the type of defendants who are at issue in the FACE Act."
2013.12-1168,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2997.916,2999.399,That's obstruction under the Federal statute.
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2999.399,3005.336,"--It is not, Your Honor, because those are specific intent crimes in both Massachusetts and in the Federal statute."
2013.12-1168,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3006.771,3011.156,Justice Holmes said even a dog knows the difference in being stumbled over and being kicked.
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3011.156,3011.675,"--So, Your Honor--"
2013.12-1168,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3011.675,3017.377,Can't -- can't -- you're saying Federal prosecutions can't tell when people are deliberately obstructing--
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3017.377,3018.179,--I'm saying--
2013.12-1168,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3018.179,3020.448,--this is beyond -- this is beyond the realm of the law?
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3020.448,3024.733,"--I'm saying what's at issue here, Your Honor, is not that kind of -- of deliberative obstruction."
2013.12-1168,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3114.224,3134.204,"Well, how far do you think -- what do you think a State legislature or Congress needs to find in order to establish a zone around some category of facility at which there -- they have some evidence that there have been some disruptions and some obstruction?"
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3134.204,3135.221,"--So, Your Honor--"
2013.12-1168,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3135.221,3142.66,"Take the example of -- I think it's -- it's a real -- real ordinance someplace you can't have, there's a buffer zone around fraternal lodges."
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3142.66,3147.881,"--So, Your Honor, I'm not aware of the history of fraternal lodges, but what's at issue here is really--"
2013.12-1168,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3147.881,3148.831,What would they have to find?
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3153.618,3166.842,"--So I think -- I think, for example, in the slaughterhouse or what they found in -- around circuses and conventions is the idea that there is massing of people that prevents the orderly ingress and egress to and from the facilities."
2013.12-1168,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3190.874,3193.676,What kind of a record do they need?
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3208.319,3208.869,--Right.
2013.12-1168,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3210.871,3211.471,Right.
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3211.471,3213.239,But it was very different from this statute.
2013.12-1168,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3224.464,3225.081,"Well, I mean, I understand."
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3226.981,3227.516,--Yes.
2013.12-1168,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3227.516,3234.837,I think it's -- I understand the -- the desire to create a buffer zone around certain sensitive facilities.
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3256.816,3261.136,"So, Your Honor, I think in the evidentiary realm, it's hard to have hard-and-fast rules."
2013.12-1168,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3292.355,3292.972,One more thing.
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3302.145,3306.249,--So I think that would be a very broad statute and hard -- hard to defend.
2013.12-1168,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3319.907,3320.809,What kind of--
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3320.809,3328.596,"Justice Kagan, the testimony is 22 feet from the entrance in Boston, 22 feet from the edge of the doorway to the edge of the -- of the buffer zone."
2013.12-1168,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3335.018,3336.318,--But I understand you're saying the reasonableness of it.
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3371.707,3375.476,"--Your Honor, I am not aware of the standard they use, but it is a--"
2013.12-1168,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3375.476,3384.849,Are you aware of any case -- I'm putting it -- loading it because -- only because to show my ignorance of it -- where the standard has differed from the ordinary APA standard?
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3384.849,3385.567,"--I'm not, Your Honor."
2013.12-1168,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3387.986,3392.455,Should we create a new standard for reviewing this kind of regulation?
2013.12-1168,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3394.14,3395.157,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2013.12-1168,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3396.107,3396.759,"Thank you, counsel."

2013.12-1168,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3415.97,3417.422,"Is that true, Mr. Rienzi?"
2013.12-1168,3,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,3419.938,3421.707,It is the only State statute of its kind.
2013.12-1168,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3495.672,3498.54,Are you questioning the government's representation?
2013.12-1168,3,36549,mark_l_rienzi,,3499.74,3500.826,--I don't believe the government--
2013.12-1168,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3500.826,3506.646,"Is it limited to the three situations, to -- to murder, arson and chaining?"
