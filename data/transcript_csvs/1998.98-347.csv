1998.98-347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.368,"We'll hear argument now in No. 98-347, William J. Clinton v. James Goldsmith."
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,11.52,14.172,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-347,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,132.319,142.503,"Mr. Dreeben, exactly how could the Respondent have proceeded to raise his issue of double jeopardy, and... and before what agency or agencies?"
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,142.503,149.218,"--Justice O'Connor, Major Goldsmith had three avenues essen... essentially, in which he could raise his claim."
1998.98-347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,247.276,263.396,"Well, what if, in the case of an ordinary criminal conviction within the armed services that's been upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, does a defendant in a situation like that have resort to Federal courts under habeas corpus or something else, or not at all?"
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,263.396,264.748,"Yes, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1998.98-347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,317.563,330.661,"Mr. Dreeben, what about the argument that this relief was necessary to protect or effectuate the result of the court-martial, which was specifically that he not be dismissed from service?"
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,341.928,351.395,"Justice Ginsburg, we don't dispute that the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has, in appropriate circumstances, the power to rely on the All Writs Act."
1998.98-347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,394.966,403.351,"And you... you say the remedy is ask the Secretary, then ask the Board of Corrections of Military Records, and--"
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,403.351,409.756,"The BCMR, the Board of Correction for Military Records, is an optional administrative procedure."
1998.98-347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,421.065,426.418,--Is that the one that's been spending its time deciding whether Samuel Mudd was properly convicted?
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,426.418,429.9,"I'm not entirely sure, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1998.98-347,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,439.735,449.412,"In this case, but... but not the Samuel Mudd case... in this case, does-the APA review come from the Board of Corrections?"
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,449.412,451.944,APA--
1998.98-347,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,451.944,454.227,You indicated in your answer to Justice O'Connor there is APA review.
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,454.227,454.926,--That's right.
1998.98-347,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,454.926,465.024,Do you exhaust your remedies before the Board of Correction of Military Records and then go to a court under the APA?
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,465.024,466.657,"You do not have to, Justice Kennedy."
1998.98-347,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,483.586,488.619,"My question is, if you did that with the Board, do you then have any judicial review of what the Board did?"
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,488.619,488.959,Yes.
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,489.901,490.431,Under the APA?
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,490.431,490.73,Yes.
1998.98-347,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,496.864,501.478,And... and are these rev... are... are its actions often reviewed in the courts?
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,501.478,502.358,--Yes.
1998.98-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.471,542.916,"I'm surprised to hear you say that... that in order to pursue these judicial remedies, you don't have to go before the Board of Corrections."
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,547.077,551.421,"--It is fairly well-established, Justice Scalia, for two different reasons."
1998.98-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,571.894,574.565,But that... but that's not an APA action; that's a Tucker Act action.
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,574.565,575.056,--That's correct.
1998.98-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.056,578.129,You... you said that there was an... an action under the Administrative Procedure Act.
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,578.129,578.489,That's correct.
1998.98-347,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,623.877,628.331,Is... is it the case that the merits in the jurisdictional question are tied together?
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,672.881,674.581,"I don't think you do, Justice Breyer."
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,706.491,706.802,Well--
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,706.802,710.204,"It does not have power to consider DFR, dropping from the rolls, actions."
1998.98-347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,710.204,725.614,"--Well, even... even if... even if... even if this were something other than you're saying it is, certainly the way a double jeopardy is ordinarily administered is not for the court where the first sentence was imposed to start proceedings to enjoin another court."
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,727.645,728.827,That... that's absolutely correct.
1998.98-347,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,728.827,729.487,That's true.
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,732.437,732.778,So--
1998.98-347,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,732.778,739.322,"So, imagine, though, that the... the... the different part of the Army had said this... they... they write out the following."
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,764.289,764.928,--No.
1998.98-347,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,764.928,765.489,Because?
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,765.489,773.336,Because this Court's jurisdiction is defined to review certain kinds of actions that are taken under the UCMJ by the court-martial proceedings itself.
1998.98-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.798,830.374,Do you agree that the... that the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is being impaired when additional punishment is added?
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,830.374,830.815,--No.
1998.98-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.853,843.113,I see.
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,852.399,852.98,--Yes.
1998.98-347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,907.134,913.238,"Mr. Dreeben, is there any practical difference in these three ways of removing an officer?"
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,932.462,936.965,"There... there are a number of legal and practical differences, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.98-347,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1058.224,1074.673,"Does the court of military... or does the military court, the sentencing court, take dropping from the rolls into consideration in the sentencing, and say, this is a serious felony, we know you're going to be dropped from the rolls, therefore we will reduce our punishment somewhat to the following?"
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1074.673,1085.99,"That would be impossible, because the sentencing body at the court-martial level would not know whether any administrative action would be taken later, because--"
1998.98-347,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1085.99,1087.412,"Well... well, it might know it judicially."
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1094.277,1101.37,"--As a... as a practical matter, I can't say that the court-martial body might not think that."
1998.98-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1134.773,1164.953,"Mr. Dreeben, you... you said, I think, a minute ago that if... if the executive... if the military, in purporting to enforce the sentence, went beyond its term... say, there was to be loss of half pay and the military said, well, we're going to... we're going to see that he loses three-quarters pay... that in those circumstances the All Writs Act could be used, in effect, to bring the matter back to the Court of Appeals, in effect, for enforcement of sentence; is that right?"
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1164.953,1166.333,"No, Justice Souter."
1998.98-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1195.692,1206.931,How would... how would a claim for... for a... a failure to follow the judgment after the review be brought and enforced?
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1206.931,1208.203,--It depends what the claim is.
1998.98-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1228.445,1230.967,"In my example, he would bring a Tucker Act?"
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1230.967,1233.501,"He would probably have to bring a Tucker Act action, that's right."
1998.98-347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1324.41,1344.042,"Mr. Dreeben, there was... the reason given for going the CAAF route rather than the more lengthy military district court or claims court was the illness of Goldsmith."
1998.98-347,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1345.274,1347.074,"Yes, he is."
1998.98-347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1463.781,1464.7,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1468.043,1471.485,"Economidy, just like America's economy, except it's ""omidy""."
1998.98-347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.485,1473.546,"Say it again, will you."
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1473.546,1474.908,Economidy.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1474.908,1475.666,Economidy.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1475.666,1476.257,"I'm used to ""Ec"", though, however."
1998.98-347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1476.257,1476.888,"Very well, we'll hear from you."
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1476.888,1478.708,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.719,1536.988,Was it... was it automatic?
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1540.421,1547.397,"--You have to meet certain criteria, Justice Scalia, to have that automatic reduction in rank, unless you're referring to the DFR."
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1547.397,1551.169,"Well, yes, I was referring to the DFR."
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1551.169,1551.5,Okay.
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1551.5,1552.139,What are you referring to?
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1552.139,1554.272,I was referring to Article 58(a).
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.824,1561.965,Is that what Justice Kennedy was asking about?
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1562.405,1563.597,He had asked about instructions.
1998.98-347,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1577.216,1578.285,"--Well, does... does that--"
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1583.871,1587.642,"It hasn't yet, because the statute occurred."
1998.98-347,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1614.159,1614.84,Yes.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1623.155,1626.288,The place to go in this particular case would be the Court of Appeals.
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.948,1638.937,What Court of Appeals are you talking about?
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1638.937,1640.499,--The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1640.499,1641.02,Okay.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1641.02,1641.498,CAAF.
1998.98-347,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1641.498,1643.301,"Well, but what... what about my question?"
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1655.129,1658.711,Those statements are correct.
1998.98-347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1673.73,1682.866,"Well, are... are you saying that someone imprisoned out of this country, in the custody of an American custodian, cannot bring habeas corpus?"
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1682.866,1686.829,--I would have habeas corpus in the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.
1998.98-347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.829,1703.02,"Well, are you saying... or perhaps you're not expressing any opinion on... whether someone held in custody in the military, outside of this country but by an American custodian, could... could sue for habeas corpus in the... in a Federal district court?"
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1703.02,1718.579,"I think this Court has given opinions like the Gusic case versus Shoder, Schlesinger v. Councilman, that says if you go into Federal courts, you should have comity, and they should go to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces or to the other military appellate courts."
1998.98-347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1722.693,1726.146,I... I don't have the same recollection you do of those cases.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1726.146,1735.122,"--What they're saying there is that if you have a court-martial-type case, you should go to the military court, is how I read the cases."
1998.98-347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1735.122,1747.099,"Well, but one... your argument, as I understand it, for this being a court-martial-type case, is that he can only get his remedy in the Court... in the... in the Court of Appeals because habeas isn't available."
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1747.099,1751.022,I'm not saying habeas is not available in the Federal courts.
1998.98-347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.225,1760.469,"Well, but a specialty court that is, by statute, given the authority to review sentences that are brought before it."
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1761.91,1772.768,"I would suggest to you, Mr. Chief Justice, that what we have here is an increased sentence; and therefore, under Article 67, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces can act to protect and effectuate that sentence."
1998.98-347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.768,1784.757,There... there is no precedent at all in... in civil law for saying that a court which imposes the first sentence that's the basis of the... should then go about scurrying about and enjoin the second court.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1794.923,1805.62,"Mr. Chief Justice, if we had the situation where the individual was kept in confinement past his confinement date, we can still go into the military appellate courts."
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1810.484,1812.234,We know... I know that they'll take it.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1816.318,1822.123,"--I think that they did, Justice Scalia, because they can act on the sentence, under Article 67."
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.053,1825.144,The sentence hasn't been changed.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1836.07,1836.33,--I believe--
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.33,1839.172,Where... where do you find that within their jurisdictional statute?
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1839.172,1839.743,--I find it--
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.743,1840.794,Just give me the text of it.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1840.794,1844.255,--And the text of it is where they can act upon the sentence.
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.158,1847.126,Their sentence hasn't been touched.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1856.493,1861.767,--I believe they have the right to protect the sentence from being increased by an unconstitutional act--
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.767,1863.189,That sentence isn't being increased.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1866.351,1871.183,--The forum here was a dropped from the roll action.
1998.98-347,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1889.766,1901.754,"Well, assuming that to be true, do you... you don't dispute that... that your client could have... could have raised every issue that he is now trying to raise by going to that Board for Correction of... whatever it is--"
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1901.754,1903.885,The Board for Correction of Military Records--
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1903.885,1904.205,--Yeah.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1904.205,1907.128,--would not help my client in this particular case for the following two reasons.
1998.98-347,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1929.132,1930.953,I'm not sure that I'm following your answer.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1930.953,1931.333,--All right.
1998.98-347,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1931.333,1936.045,"But I take it your bottom-line answer is no, he could not have gone to the Board for Correction in this case?"
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1936.045,1939.188,"You can always go, but he would not be able to get relief."
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.359,1944.852,"What, because of the constitutional claim that you're raising; is that it?"
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1944.852,1945.382,No.
1998.98-347,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1947.061,1951.655,"Well, the... I... I don't think we're... we're following each other."
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,1969.497,1973.111,"I don't believe it is, because they would view it as a military justice matter."
1998.98-347,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1997.184,1998.045,"Well, let... let me ask you this."
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,2014.658,2020.28,--They could hear the case then because it would not involve the statutory restrictions in Section 1522.
1998.98-347,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2020.28,2028.295,"Now, if we should decide that in fact the Board for Correction would have jurisdiction here, would that be the end of your case?"
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,2028.295,2035.431,It means we would take an alternative course of action.
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.324,2046.378,What if Corrections said that it doesn't have jurisdiction in these matters?
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,2052.955,2056.455,"We really don't have cases in the Board of Corrections, sir."
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.878,2061.56,"--Well, you... you say they have no jurisdiction to make these corrections."
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,2062.958,2063.84,"No, sir."
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2063.84,2065.552,"--where someone has tried to get a correction, and they say,"
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,2069.335,2073.657,"I have been in cases, particularly Woodrick v. Divich, which is somewhat like this."
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2084.456,2085.235,I'm not talking about the Federal court.
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,2091.139,2092.71,--I do not think that they do.
1998.98-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2093.572,2094.031,"Well, maybe you don't think so."
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,2094.992,2099.434,"--I think their statutory charter would preclude it, because--"
1998.98-347,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2099.434,2100.526,Has the Board ever said so?
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,2109.251,2112.283,"--I have had cases before the Board of Corrections where they have stated that, yes, sir."
1998.98-347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2112.283,2113.695,"Well, the Board has a fairly--"
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,2113.695,2114.674,But not in this case.
1998.98-347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2114.674,2123.75,"--The Board has a fairly generous idea of its jurisdiction, if it can renew the court-martial of Samuel Mudd, which took place in 1865."
1998.98-347,1,30120,john_m_economidy,,2123.75,2129.584,"I would suggest to you, Mr. Chief Justice, what they're doing is going on the old Board of Corrections statute."
1998.98-347,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3000.105,3003.418,"If the Court has no further questions, I would waive rebuttal."
1998.98-347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3003.418,3004.099,"Well, actually, I do."
1998.98-347,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3044.044,3053.541,"Justice Breyer, the question of... of the meaning and interpretation of All Writs Act jurisdiction is not a question of expertise in military law."
1998.98-347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3071.743,3089.325,"Well, I suppose he'd say that the... in the military, perhaps though not in the civil system, what... there... there is some kind of a remedy, where a commander takes a person and subjects him to punishment growing out of a conviction, and that conviction specified you shouldn't have that punishment."
1998.98-347,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3097.72,3107.908,"I think the answer comes from Justice Stevens' hypothetical, which is that, if that kind of unauthorized punishment is being meted out, whether it be with a prior court-martial--"
1998.98-347,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3107.908,3108.639,Meted out.
1998.98-347,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3108.639,3111.26,"--or without it, your remedy is Federal habeas corpus."
1998.98-347,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3111.26,3123.338,"Let me change the hypothetical to say that, in doing this the extra 90 days, the... the body that does this says, to the extent necessary, this shall constitute a modification of the criminal judgment entered on such and such a date."
1998.98-347,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3123.338,3134.946,"Well, I... I think I conceded earlier that if there were a formal modification of the actual judgment that had been before a reviewing court, traditional All Writ... Writs Act authority would permit it to rectify the--"
1998.98-347,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3134.946,3142.961,"What if it purported to be a modification but there was no actual power to modify; the wrong tribunal did it, but they thought they had the power to modify the earlier judgment, but they didn't?"
1998.98-347,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3148.803,3154.667,"--To correct the sentence, yes, but not to adjudge the lawfulness of the administration of a sentence."
1998.98-347,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3155.358,3158.55,Would they have jurisdiction to correct the attempted modification of the judgment?
1998.98-347,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3158.55,3171.009,"--If I understand your hypothetical correctly, they would have authority to say that you cannot modify the judgment in the fashion that you thought you had authority to do."
1998.98-347,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3249.52,3250.862,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
