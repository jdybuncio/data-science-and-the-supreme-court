1967.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,29.698,"Number 48, Minnie E. Nash, Petitioner, versus Florida Industrial Commission et al."
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,29.698,30.999,"Mr. Chief Justice, --"
1967.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,30.999,32.273,Mr. Gottesman.
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,32.273,34.529,-- may it please the Court.
1967.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,271.214,278.921,"Oh, I suppose the theory would be that she could not be heard to say that the layoff was not caused by a labor dispute."
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,278.921,278.935,Well --
1967.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,278.935,283.418,And she's the one who said it was that -- she was laid off because of her union activity.
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,284.43,285.026,"Well, if that were the theory --"
1967.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,285.026,288.857,-- it's smarter to say its law means whatever it wants to say it means.
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,288.857,289.312,That's right.
1967.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,326.553,329.298,"You mean -- say they, that's only the examiners."
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,331.755,334.037,We have -- he is called the appeals referee I believe.
1967.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,334.037,335.09,Is that what's he's called?
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,335.09,336.447,The examiner first issued a ruling--
1967.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,336.447,338.43,He is the administrative officer.
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,338.43,339.299,That's correct.
1967.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,339.299,342.27,That's the only opinion there is in this whole matter?
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,342.27,359.18,That's true because the Florida Industrial Commission itself affirmed without opinion and the Florida District Court and Appeals denied certiorari which I assume does not constitute a ruling on the merits though it necessarily means under their law that it found no important question.
1967.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,363.262,363.449,They stopped --
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,363.449,364.602,-- this Court's denial.
1967.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,364.602,368.153,"They stopped at the level of the Court of Appeals, did they?"
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,368.153,377.462,"Yes that there was at the time, sir it was -- originally petitioned for here, the dispute is to whether there was a right of appeal to the Florida Supreme Court."
1967.48,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,808.891,820.049,"You refer the right to unemployment benefits as discretionary with the state, will you state that more accurately."
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,835.859,836.029,Well --
1967.48,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,836.029,838.119,-- in this (Inaudible)
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,838.119,844.288,Arguably it's not because it's so interwoven with the federal unemployment scheme and some of the money comes from the federal system.
1967.48,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,844.288,846.552,I think that -- arguably its not what?
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,846.552,861.775,Arguably it's not about the innocence that other rights might be -- other state benefits would be bound and that it is interconnected with the federal law and it survives because it in effect behaves pursuant to federal standards and unemployment compensation.
1967.48,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,920.341,923.026,"Wait a minute, say that over again, will you."
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,923.026,934.28,"What Florida says as to -- I think there are 48 states I, misspoke earlier, that an employee who strikes is not entitled to unemployment benefits while he's on strike because for two reasons, really."
1967.48,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,951.295,957.583,Suppose if the strike though that -- defend the jurisdiction of the NLRB.
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,957.583,959.032,"Well, most strikes are."
1967.48,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,959.032,970.448,"Well, suppose it is and then you'd -- you're still want to concede that Florida may deny unemployment compensation payments."
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,970.448,970.795,"Well, I say I'm willing --"
1967.48,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,970.795,971.082,(Inaudible)
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,971.082,971.983,-- I'm willing to concede it for this case.
1967.48,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,971.983,973.44,-- is that right?
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,973.521,975.576,I want to concede it because I don't think it is necessary for this case.
1967.48,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,996.517,1004.342,"Well, what you're really doing is giving away your preemption argument aren't you, to make that concession in your (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1004.342,1006.076,"No, we don't think so at all Your Honor --"
1967.48,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1006.076,1008.644,-- Supremacy Clause or preemption argument.
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1008.644,1011.294,We don't think so for this reason.
1967.48,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1046.5,1055.604,"But do you believe that preemption or Supremacy Clause argument -- claim has a role to play in your case, in the case before us now?"
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1055.604,1069.011,"Yes, well -- I believe that it has a role to play in the strike case too but what I'm prepared to say in this case is that whether or not it does there whether or not Florida can justify that distinction on the basis which it would come forward and justify."
1967.48,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1083.925,1093.466,"Excuse me, I probably don't understand you but I don't see how you can argue your case under the -- as a Supremacy Clause case."
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1110.713,1115.79,"Well, that -- you see, the difference is that they don't withhold them merely because the person goes on strike."
1967.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1268.751,1279.755,"Oh, I suppose it were shown that Florida wouldn't try to recoup that the -- that any back pay award would have deducted from it the amount of an unemployment compensation (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1279.755,1280.895,"Well, but this Court has held --"
1967.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1280.895,1283.46,-- just as -- just like the amount of earnings elsewhere.
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1283.46,1283.905,That's right.
1967.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1294.565,1295.911,And if the answer is for the state to recoup (Voice Overlap) --
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1295.911,1297.898,That's -- (Voice Overlap) which it could've done really on either way.
1967.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1344.079,1352.116,"Please tell me Mr. Gottesman, the -- I gather from this record, the company opposed this claim, did it in the first instance?"
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1352.116,1355.918,"Yes indeed it's opposed to -- well no, not in the first instance."
1967.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1362.73,1365.939,"Well, when they oppose that many went after she had file a --"
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1365.939,1366.199,Yes.
1967.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1366.199,1366.656,"-- charge, is that it?"
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1366.656,1367.93,"Yes, after the charge was filed."
1967.48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.93,1370.641,And who raised it once the file was charged.
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1377.679,1385.854,"No, what happened here was in fact and this is what makes a funny procedure because you know, the case in which the law is made always gets somehow done retroactively."
1967.48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1389.308,1390.09,Yes.
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1390.09,1402.705,"And then, the next thing she knew was that a month after she was back at work she got letters from the claim's examiner saying, “Your benefits have been redetermined and we've discovered we made a mistake and you should not have been paid”."
1967.48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1423.279,1424.797,And was there a hearing after (Voice Overlap)?
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1424.797,1426.468,There was a hearing after that.
1967.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1430.934,1434.802,"And is that the one of -- I noticed, it says, company counsel appears, is that right?"
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1434.802,1440.169,"Yes, at that hearing, the company counsel very vigorously opposed the award of benefits to the petitioner."
1967.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1440.169,1442.743,How far back?
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1443.512,1446.276,Company argued she should be disqualified for the entire period.
1967.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1446.276,1447.299,He -- that was the company?
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1447.299,1459.695,"Yes, adopting essentially the suggestion that was made earlier right at the outset of my argument the theory being that she having claimed she was laid off, preempt the union reasons, that's a labor dispute and a union reason."
1967.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1464.797,1468.709,"That's what the examiner decided its purpose, I gather."
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1468.709,1470.595,"Well, not in his decision after the hearing."
1967.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1473.256,1473.643,That's right.
1967.48,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1473.643,1474.509,-- for a labor dispute.
1967.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1558.471,1559.308,Mr. Greene.
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,1559.308,1564.544,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1628.46,1632.832,And you get one of these cases to dissipate (Inaudible)
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,1632.832,1644.111,We were anticipating that this case might go there but as Mr. Gottesman has pointed out the procedure within the State of Florida in this particular area is --
1967.48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.111,1645.455,This isn't the only area --
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,1645.455,1645.571,Yes.
1967.48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.571,1646.926,-- for your procedure (Voice Overlap) --
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,1646.926,1666.299,It is rather complicated and we in our petition for certiorari oppose the jurisdiction of this Court because that first -- the first impression that we have was that the state court procedure had not been exhausted but then after taking another look at it while we came to the conclusion that probably that it was.
1967.48,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1858.989,1877.533,"Do you mean that if the particular privilege immunity -- privilege or immunity is available to non-citizens as well as citizens then it doesn't come, it says, ending of the clause, is that what you're saying?"
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,1877.533,1890.975,What I'm attempting to say is that you do not have to be a citizen in this particular instance to file or process a charge for the National Labor Relations Board.
1967.48,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1890.975,1892.712,You mean it's available to non-citizens --
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,1892.712,1892.872,That is correct.
1967.48,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1892.872,1898.426,-- and (Inaudible) citizens and therefore it's not within the privileges and immunities clause.
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,1898.426,1899.238,That is correct.
1967.48,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1899.238,1899.824,I see.
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,1902.569,1925.329,"Now secondly, the petitioner advances as a reason for striking down this ruling of the Florida Industrial Commission that it violates the Supremacy Clause and in support of this position, primarily relies upon two cases one is Davis against Elmira State Bank and the other one is Hill against Florida."
1967.48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.099,2262.309,"Well, what about the other side of that coin, the -- let's assume we don't agree with you in this case, are we also ruling on the strike case?"
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2262.309,2265.025,Also that is not an issue.
1967.48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.936,2270.413,"Well, what the -- let's assume --"
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2270.413,2271.598,-- that is issue is not here.
1967.48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.598,2281.417,"Let's assume we disagreed with you in this case, why wouldn't the argument cover the strike case?"
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2281.417,2282.049,Well I don't think that --
1967.48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.049,2287.232,"Well, how can you really simply distinguish the strike case in this case."
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2287.232,2287.351,All that's --
1967.48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2287.351,2290.05,You say -- you're arguing that you can.
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2297.058,2297.235,No.
1967.48,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2314.597,2314.905,"Well, what's the --"
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2314.905,2314.941,-- apply to reverse but I --
1967.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2314.941,2316.421,"Well, how do you mean that?"
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2324.599,2325.934,But I am --
1967.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2325.934,2326.598,"Well, but then --"
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2326.598,2329.141,Which has been held to be freedom of speech.
1967.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2329.141,2332.532,"If that's alright, we can impose that."
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2337.536,2337.91,When an employee (Voice Overlap) --
1967.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2337.91,2338.26,(Inaudible) or it may also --
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2338.26,2348.218,"-- is engaging in freedom of speech activity then a fortiori, you can do it in this particular situation."
1967.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2348.218,2352.541,Even treating this as a petition for redress?
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2352.541,2352.981,Right.
1967.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2352.981,2356.881,Of a fed -- of grievance for violation of a federal right.
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2356.881,2357.82,Right.
1967.48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.278,2379.449,But if we disagree with you on this case -- we disagree with you on this case and say that this is an unreasonable burden that then wouldn't be a fortiori on the strike.
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2379.449,2379.689,I don't think so.
1967.48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2379.689,2385.55,That's this -- you were just saying that the right to strike is a more egregious wording.
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2385.55,2386.815,No I don't think so.
1967.48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2386.815,2388.13,Think what?
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2388.13,2397.687,"I think the policy and as I say -- first of all, I don't -- I think the strike situation would encompass this situation but to reverse is not true."
1967.48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2412.534,2428.811,"Well, there may be a lot of differences but in terms of the federal issue that's involved, is there really any difference, just in terms of the Supremacy Clause for example, purging on some federal clause or even on the -- do you -- or take the privilege of and immunity to control here."
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2437.545,2453.302,"Well, I take the position that if you reverse the ruling as a part of Florida Board of Review in this case that the strike situation is not necessarily encompassed in that ruling."
1967.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2456.025,2458.362,"Well, you've said it but why?"
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2458.362,2463.697,"Well, let me go ahead with these reasons in support -- in connection with the strike situation."
1967.48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2463.697,2480.915,"But certainly to the extent its constitutional for Florida to deny workmen's compensation to do a strike, there is, is there not a burden on the right to strike?"
1967.48,1,25357,glenn_l_greene_jr,,2485.455,2490.385,I don't necessarily think that there is a particular burden on the right to strike.
1967.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2689.8,2691.51,Mr. Gottesman.
1967.48,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,2691.51,2693.223,Thank you.
