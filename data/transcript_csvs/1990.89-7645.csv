1990.89-7645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,18.045,"We'll hear argument next in case No. 89-7645, Dionisio Hernandez v. New York."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,20.462,23.865,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,115.458,132.468,"Well, now, if that reason is true that that was the basis for the prosecutor's strike, are you arguing that there can be no peremptory strike on that basis?"
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,132.468,133.42,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,139.972,147.994,"Well, that's rather a remarkable position to take, isn't it?"
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,179.899,180.482,--We don't--
1990.89-7645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.482,181.382,--on that basis.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,181.382,190.69,"--Your Honor, we don't... we don't dispute the opportunity challenge for cause, but we do argue, as you said, that a prosecutor could not exercise a peremptory challenge."
1990.89-7645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.472,215.055,"Well, isn't--"
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,225.678,238.254,--The prosecutor here said that he believed that these jurors were hesitant in their responses in that they said that I will try to follow that instruction.
1990.89-7645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.889,243.289,Well--
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,243.289,244.657,--follow the instruction.
1990.89-7645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.657,252.763,--But didn't the trial judge find that the prosecutor stated reason was his real reason?
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,255.549,259.517,"He made no specific finding, Your Honor, but he did deny the motion."
1990.89-7645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.738,271.225,We assume in deciding this cased that the stated reason was his real reason.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,271.225,277.629,"That's correct, Your Honor, but we believe that the real reason is the Spanish language ability of these jurors."
1990.89-7645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,277.629,278.396,"Well, do you--"
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,291.388,292.905,"No, we don't, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,319.306,328.061,Well isn't that... isn't your statement itself a form of stereotype to suggest that all bilingual jurors react exactly the same way?
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,328.061,329.028,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,380.446,385.517,"But this... this is true in any case, when you've got a juror who is bilingual."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,397.408,398.442,That's our argument.
1990.89-7645,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,409.882,410.315,"Yeah, but--"
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,410.315,416.219,--who honestly... excuse me... who honestly reflects on the questions that he's being asked to answer.
1990.89-7645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,416.952,419.337,"--Well, what if... so what."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,439.632,441.734,"That's absolutely correct, that that relying--"
1990.89-7645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,441.734,449.273,To say that intentionally excluding a juror by peremptory challenge because the juror is bilingual--
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,449.273,449.706,--That's correct.
1990.89-7645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,449.706,455.26,--is a discrimination based on race or ethnic origin.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,455.26,460.229,"The connection between national origin and language is a clear one, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,464.866,492.533,"Well, let's assume that... let's assume that the witness or that a juror is from a certain... from a certain section of a foreign country, now a nationalized citizen, but that foreign country has all sorts of areas in it and people speak a different kind of language in each area."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,509.645,512.013,"--We don't dispute that in the least, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,531.158,542.7,"Well, you've... you've argued the case as if the juror was being asked to completely disregard what he or she heard."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,568.367,569.283,"We do not, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,581.777,592.899,"Well, the prosecutor here said, I was uncertain as to whether they could accept the interpreter as the final arbiter, and it seems to me that's different than saying completely disregard what you've heard."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,592.899,609.01,"--Well, I don't know if it makes a distinction in the minds of the juror, Your Honor, because what's at issue is whether or not they can essentially screen out what it is that they hear in Spanish."
1990.89-7645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,663.311,671.6,"That's what I have some difference with you, because that's all that the prosecutor was asking that you would accept the interpretation."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,677.57,682.808,"They said that they would try, and then they affirmed that they would."
1990.89-7645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.274,689.795,He's entitled to interpret their demeanor evidence to perhaps cast doubt on their assurances.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,689.795,700.234,"--Your Honor, if... if that's the distinction, then I don't think it's a very meaningful one in most settings."
1990.89-7645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,716.445,721.599,"Mr. Kimerling, there you're... you have to rely on the trial judge."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,747.751,752.619,"Your Honor, we think that it is a per se violation, that credibility has nothing to do with it."
1990.89-7645,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,776.918,794.779,"Well, except that the correlation is never going to be what you say it is, because in the first place, as I understand, somewhere in the briefs, the statement is made that about 25 percent of those who are ethnically Latino do not speak Spanish."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,828.119,830.405,"Your Honor, I... you're absolutely correct."
1990.89-7645,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,858.305,871.463,"But you're now telling us that even on the assumption that that is the prosecutor's real reason and not merely a covert reason to eliminate an ethnic group, that that cannot be done."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,887.991,898.299,"Your Honor, the... there is no difference between somebody who does it unconsciously and somebody who does it consciously."
1990.89-7645,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,941.959,946.946,"Well, then the question is, what is the permissible criterion and what is a impermissible one?"
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,970.061,970.811,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,970.811,974.863,"Now, suppose a juror says, well, judge, I can't do that."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,974.863,978.001,"Okay, and then what happens?"
1990.89-7645,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,978.001,980.151,Is that grounds for excusing the juror?
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,980.151,983.119,For cause.
1990.89-7645,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,983.119,984.738,For cause or peremptory either way.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,984.738,987.19,"For cause, because he says I can't do that."
1990.89-7645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,989.29,992.761,"Well, I... suppose he says, I have... I'm just not sure I can do that."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,994.844,1008.286,"--And if in the context of that voir dire, he concedes that he will and can, our position is that it makes no difference between that juror and one shows less hesitancy."
1990.89-7645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1052.565,1062.403,"Well, it's a very odd proposition that you concede that an instruction from the court, a direction from the court, is correct, that it's binding."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1071.126,1093.642,"We don't argue that he can't for cause, but we argue that by allowing a prosecutor to do it with peremptory challenges, allows him in essence to exclude any time he wants... in which there... anytime... in a trial, as Judge Souter pointed out... Justice Souter pointed out... where there's going to be testimony in Spanish, a bilingual Latino."
1990.89-7645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1093.642,1104.997,"--Well, that just sounds to me like a rule applying a disparate impact analysis as opposed to a finding of intentional discrimination."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1112.853,1115.288,"I am not, Your Honor, and if I might--"
1990.89-7645,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1115.288,1116.555,It sounds like it.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1116.555,1118.407,"--Fine, and I'll... fine."
1990.89-7645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.563,1234.382,"Mr. Kimerling, you're coming up to your time limit, and I--"
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1234.382,1235.984,"That was my 10-minute buzzer, but--"
1990.89-7645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.984,1239.686,"--Yeah, I'm worried that you haven't said anything about the second question--"
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1239.686,1240.152,--I really--
1990.89-7645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.152,1247.808,--that you've taken this case for and which to my mind is a... is a more significant one as far as its impact on other cases.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1247.808,1250.66,"--Your Honor, if I might just finish... finish my answer to Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-7645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.66,1251.144,"Well, it's your time."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1251.144,1252.06,Thank you.
1990.89-7645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.433,1364.483,--May I just question that?
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1370.773,1377.343,"No, it rests on the fact that that is a part of his national origin... that is the name."
1990.89-7645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1377.343,1378.577,"Well, but it isn't always."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1378.577,1379.31,That's correct.
1990.89-7645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1379.31,1387.132,And it may well be true that the prosecutor is 100 percent sincere in believing that people... if he's had bad experience with the people with Latino names.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1387.132,1395.638,"Well, I think the difference is that we're looking at traits in the Fourteenth Amendment context that have led to discrimination."
1990.89-7645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.889,1430.977,"Mr. Kimerling, I think that hypothetical would come out the way you do... the way you suggest, that is, that it would be in violation of Batson."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1436.881,1438.667,"Well, Your Honor, that--"
1990.89-7645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.667,1439.633,That's why that comes out.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1439.633,1449.023,"--That... that might be, but I... but I think that had a trial judge found so, it would still be a per se question before this court, and not one clearly erroneous."
1990.89-7645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1479.994,1485.898,"You probably should address the second question, Mr. Kimerling, the standard of review."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1485.898,1493.302,"If I just might put one more point on this, because we believe that the second question doesn't affect us because we have a per se violation here."
1990.89-7645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.131,1525.606,"Well, you would have a better case I suppose if... if one of these... if the prosecutor asks, can you follow the interpreter, and he says, of course, I can and I will."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1529.058,1532.027,"Well, that... that's right, but we wouldn't be talking per se."
1990.89-7645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.068,1549.738,"So, if there... if there were six jurors, Latino jurors, that he was examining and three of them said, of course, I can."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1558.827,1562.112,"One, there may be a question of a prima facie case, but I would still be here."
1990.89-7645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1562.112,1562.731,You would still be here.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1562.731,1576.372,"I would still be here, Your Honor, because in the context of explaining those reasons, for striking those jurors, he would say just what we've said."
1990.89-7645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1579.924,1586.596,So it's hard to say... it's hard to say on those facts that he has an intentional discrimination against all Latinos.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1586.596,1589.631,"--Your Honor, it's not a question of motive being good or bad."
1990.89-7645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1628.356,1640.231,You don't think any deference should be accorded to the finding of the trial court who was there as he obviously was at the time the prosecutor took these actions as to the truthfulness of the prosecutor's statement?
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1640.231,1641.664,"--That... absolutely should, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1661.395,1665.264,"Well, it's really... we're looking for, was it a race-neutral reason?"
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1666.049,1666.916,That's... that's--
1990.89-7645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1666.916,1669.667,And that presumably is I suppose a question of law.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1678.321,1679.306,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.873,1682.308,"Apparently, it would have to be clearly erroneous."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1682.308,1682.758,--That's correct.
1990.89-7645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1726.419,1727.502,--clearly erroneous.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1727.502,1741.429,"--Clearly erroneous or it find as... without determining clearly erroneous under independent review, that it would find discrimination regardless of whether or not the trial court did not."
1990.89-7645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1742.362,1753.903,"Well, is... does that mean that the appellate court is substituting its view, as it may on some cases... for the trial judges as to the truthfulness of the prosecutor's statement?"
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1753.903,1762.307,"--The truthfulness as to his statement is that he said this, that, and the other."
1990.89-7645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1762.307,1764.259,This is the reason I'm doing it.
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1764.259,1774.649,"But the constitutional question is is whether his true reason is race or national origin, and that I guess is where I--"
1990.89-7645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1774.649,1781.636,"To find out what is true, isn't it, you first have to decide whether the reason he gives is or is not his true reason."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1781.636,1787.04,"--It is... it is what he says is his reason, and therefore, the court will treat it as such."
1990.89-7645,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.717,1804.419,"I think you've answered the question, Mr. Kimerling."
1990.89-7645,0,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1805.936,1806.869,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,1812.756,1815.791,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1880.214,1895.743,"Mr. Cohen, would it offend a raceneutral reason for the prosecutor to strike every bilingual juror without regard to any questions and responses?"
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,1895.743,1897.243,Not necessarily.
1990.89-7645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1907.699,1915.305,"Well, the reason the prosecutor gives when called under Batson is they're bilingual."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,1915.305,1924.143,"--That reason could serve, depending on how it's applied to the case, as a pretext for discrimination on the basis of their national origin."
1990.89-7645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1924.143,1929.445,How about if he says the reason is because they had an Hispanic surname?
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,1929.445,1935.166,"Well, by the same token, that reason could serve as a pretext, particularly with regard to the second one."
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.022,1944.355,"Mr. Cohen, any reason can serve as a pretext."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,1944.355,1944.94,--Right.
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1944.94,1945.606,I mean any reason.
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,1945.606,1945.956,That's correct.
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.956,1949.075,"You can give me the best reason in the world and if I don't believe it, it's a pretext."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,1950.142,1951.26,"Well, but what I mean though is that--"
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.26,1952.31,--it proves to say it could serve as a pretext.
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,1973.273,1973.673,--That--
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.673,1974.892,Can the prosecutor do that?
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,1974.892,1978.844,"--That... challenging bilingual jurors is on its face, race-neutral."
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.004,1995.489,"Let me interpret if I may, Mr. Cohen."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2012.465,2013.084,--Correct.
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.084,2029.277,"And therefore, the prosecutor's office adopts as a matter of office policy in writing, always challenge bilingual jurors for that reason, would we say that was a sufficient reason under... no question of pretext... should we accept that as a sufficient reason?"
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2029.277,2045.639,"This Court in Batson said that challenges to cognizable groups would raise an inference, a prima facie case of discrimination and challenges on that basis alone would reflect discrimination on the part of the prosecutor."
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2048.005,2049.857,"Mr. Cohen, I know what we said in Batson."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2051.625,2060.315,--The answer is challenging someone simply on the basis of their language ability would not be a discriminatory reason under Batson.
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.315,2064.533,What you're saying it that would be a permissible reason on the facts I've given you?
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2064.533,2066.802,If... yes.
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.0,2102.642,"Of course, you could do that, but you're suggesting that even if that's not the fact, they regard the importance of not following the translator as more important than the interest in having a diverse jury, that's still permissible."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2105.51,2106.677,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2107.296,2113.098,--Is there any limit on the sufficiency of the reason that must be given as long as it's in good faith?
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2126.091,2126.791,--Yes.
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.791,2127.391,Yes.
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2127.391,2145.402,"But in that situation if the court could not determine why the fact that a juror wore a bow tie was at all relevant to the case, and if it actual happened in that particular case that the only jurors who wore bow ties were black jurors, he could--"
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2145.402,2151.741,Infer prejudice... but I'm assuming that the... I'm assuming that he knows the prosecutor and he knows he wouldn't misrepresent something.
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2165.883,2183.094,--This Court in its Sixth Amendment cases and in its Fourteenth Amendment cases has indicated that Batson prohibits challenges exercised on the basis of some discrimination and does not challenge... prohibit challenges exercised on the basis of other kinds of assumptions based on other criteria.
1990.89-7645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2183.094,2187.164,"I thought it was racial discrimination, not just discrimination."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2195.302,2207.662,But there's nothing in Batson that prohibits a prosecutor's reliance on that criteria so long as his reliance on that criteria is not a pretext for discrimination on the basis of some prohibited characteristic.
1990.89-7645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2247.37,2261.629,"Mr. Cohen, what... what is the standard of review that this Court should apply to the determinations made in State court in this case concerning the prosecutors' motives?"
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2261.629,2264.914,This Court should apply the clear error standard.
1990.89-7645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2264.914,2283.46,"Is that consistent, do you think, with Norris against Alabama and some other cases from this Court saying at least that we will conduct an independent review of State court fact finding in jury discrimination cases?"
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2283.46,2294.933,"Yes, there is nothing inconsistent with independent review of the record, including the record on the facts, and deference to the trial court's fact finding."
1990.89-7645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2294.933,2303.556,Do you think that a... application of the clearly erroneous rule is consistently with Norris against Alabama?
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2303.556,2313.931,"Yes, in Norris this Court indicated that it came to the conclusion that the facts compelled a result from the result that the State court had found."
1990.89-7645,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2350.604,2355.924,"Well, we're not concerned with the standard of review applied by the State appellate court."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2358.626,2373.052,"But the standard that the New York Court of Appeals has applied... applied, Your Honor, is the same standard that this Court has itself applied to state court determinations of discrimination."
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2373.052,2374.552,"Mr. Cohen, may I just clarify one thing?"
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2387.46,2392.681,"Well, in this case, the courts found that a... that a prima facie case was made out."
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2392.681,2393.214,Right.
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2393.214,2400.703,"In response to that prima facie case, this Court in Batson indicated that a prosecutor must offer a race-neutral reason."
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.809,2416.296,"No, but you're not conceding that the universe of race-neutral reasons is limited to case-related reasons?"
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2416.296,2417.079,No.
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2417.079,2417.781,No.
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2423.235,2424.485,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.857,2488.345,"Oh, or even you've said not in the facts and... oh, I see."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2504.27,2504.737,It would seem to--
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.737,2518.864,"You know, there are some swarthy Caucasians who are eliminated, but overwhelmingly that criterion leads to the categorical exclusion of blacks."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2518.864,2519.797,--I believe that--
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2519.797,2521.149,"I mean, is that all right?"
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2521.149,2528.653,--I believe that any judge would find that a reliance on that criterion was a pretext for a discrimination against blacks.
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2528.653,2531.255,"But if it wasn't a pretext, it would be all right?"
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2531.255,2545.447,"Well, but in order it not to be a pretext, the prosecutor would have to demonstrate in some way that skin color was relevant to the particular case on trial, and I don't think a prosecutor could ever establish that it would not--"
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.447,2549.733,"No, you said... you said the prosecutor could adopt general rules before I think in response to Justice Stevens."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2559.907,2565.511,--I believe that that general rule reflect a pretext on the part of the prosecutor to discriminate.
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2572.515,2573.951,Which rule are you talking about?
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2576.067,2576.735,"Yours, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2576.735,2578.185,"Oh, okay."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2578.185,2592.328,"But even if the prosecutor adopts a general rule, if a prima facie case of discrimination is made out, the court is still required to determine that the application of the general rule in the particular case on trial does not reflect an intent to discriminate."
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.57,2608.438,I'd like to push Justice Scalia's example one step further.
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2631.453,2638.523,"--I believe that a judge... if the judge could not find... first of all, that that in fact would not be the case."
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2651.081,2652.264,Was pretext.
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2663.054,2670.625,"--But that kind of a factor, because it has such an impact and because it is in general... it would seem to me it--"
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2670.625,2672.46,Like speaking a language.
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2672.46,2673.21,"--Well, no, Your--"
1990.89-7645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.21,2674.279,"I mean, you ought to be careful where you're going."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2674.279,2681.783,"--No, Your... it would seem to me appropriate in that particular case for the Court to conclude that the prosecutor had intended to discriminate."
1990.89-7645,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2694.693,2707.833,"In other words you're saying the impact is never enough, but the impact may be evidence which on the total evidence of the case is sufficient to tip it in favor of a conclusion that there was intentional discrimination."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2707.833,2708.733,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2811.418,2821.542,"Your hypothetical about non-Latinos having the same hesitation assumes that the prosecutor asked the same question to the non-Latino, which I guess he didn't even do in this case."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2821.542,2834.533,"Well, in fact, Your Honor, the evidence in the record indicates the prosecutor told the court that he believed that at least one of the jurors in this case might not have been Latino."
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.67,2843.122,Did he ask everybody on the panel if they spoke Spanish?
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2843.122,2845.158,--There's no evidence in the record one way or the other.
1990.89-7645,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2863.952,2872.641,"Mr. Cohen, let me ask your... ask you a question about the way the rule that you would have us apply might be applied to other ethnic groups."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,2938.751,2939.218,No.
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.401,3126.091,"Mr. Cohen, can you tell me based on your experience with these case, because I guess it's... it is a problem that this sort of thing happens in New York a great deal."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,3137.213,3139.315,"Well, I don't know, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3146.338,3154.158,"It must come up repeatedly I would think, because there must a number of bilingual jurors and I would think the prosecutor would always be concerned... have the same concern you described."
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,3154.158,3159.395,"--Well, the prosecutors wouldn't in each individual case necessarily have the same concern."
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3167.501,3167.884,I know.
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,3167.884,3171.286,And the evidence in this case would be the interpretation of the forum--
1990.89-7645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3171.286,3178.124,He doesn't explain it on... as far as you know there's not a standard... it seems to me it might be something... be worth considering.
1990.89-7645,1,29418,jay_m_cohen,,3178.124,3179.059,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-7645,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3259.075,3260.259,"Thank you, Mr. Cohen."
