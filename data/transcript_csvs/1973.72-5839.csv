1973.72-5839,0,25444,george_r_higinbotham,,23.557,26.439,May it please the Court.
1973.72-5839,1,37927,philip_d_gaujot,,1978.002,1982.245,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-5839,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2033.594,2036.817,"Well you haven’t filed a suggestion of mootness, have you?"
1973.72-5839,1,37927,philip_d_gaujot,,2036.817,2039.004,"No, Your Honor, I haven’t."
1973.72-5839,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2040.374,2045.482,But this is the usual procedure before you argue?
1973.72-5839,1,37927,philip_d_gaujot,,2045.482,2063.63,"Yes, Your Honor, my original -- I was requested to respond to suggestion of mootness on behalf of a counsel for the appellant, so I would assume now that the motion is before the Court that I could change my position and argue that yes, it is moot."
1973.72-5839,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2063.63,2067.178,"Well, a normal procedure is that you file a suggestion of mootness."
1973.72-5839,1,37927,philip_d_gaujot,,2067.178,2071.911,"Yes, Your Honor, I think normal procedure is that the appellee --"
1973.72-5839,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2071.911,2074.167,"When did you change your mind, just now?"
1973.72-5839,1,37927,philip_d_gaujot,,2074.167,2080.904,"No, Your Honor, within the last quite frankly though, within the last several weeks."
1973.72-5839,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2176.535,2185.314,"Well, if you’re right, can we decide the question of mootness here, or would we have to vacate? In remand of this three-judge district was a three-judge court wasn’t it?"
1973.72-5839,1,37927,philip_d_gaujot,,2185.314,2186.247,Yes.
1973.72-5839,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2186.247,2196.758,"District Court will let them decide whether there’s question of mootness, because under this being a federal case -- by where it’s moot, but we do is wipe the slate clean all the way down."
1973.72-5839,1,37927,philip_d_gaujot,,2197.67,2208.308,"Yes, Your Honor, I’m not -- quite frankly, I’m not sure what this Court can do -- as to decide whether it is moot or rather remand it to the District Court."
1973.72-5839,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2208.308,2214.393,"Well, I must say, I have difficulty in light of your retroactivity question that both of you raised."
1973.72-5839,1,37927,philip_d_gaujot,,2217.511,2239.555,"Well, if you let me continue Justice Brennan, Justice Cardozo in answer to whether state decisions are retroactive or not, said and that a state may make a choice for itself between the principle of forward operation and the relation backwards."
1973.72-5839,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2270.278,2276.004,"Well in the first instance, isn’t it primarily the business of West Virginia courts to decide the retroactivity matter anyway?"
1973.72-5839,1,37927,philip_d_gaujot,,2276.004,2276.389,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-5839,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2276.389,2279.193,And you said they have decided it back in 1902 -- the general preposition.
1973.72-5839,1,37927,philip_d_gaujot,,2279.193,2284.317,"Yes, Your Honor, so therefore -- so what I’m saying is that Reece versus Geis does apply to Patterson."
1973.72-5839,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2302.647,2310.846,Do you mean that everybody that’s had a judgment against them with the JP court from 1900 to date is entitled to get his money back?
1973.72-5839,1,37927,philip_d_gaujot,,2310.846,2313.799,"As well as I can interpret that case, Your Honor, yes."
1973.72-5839,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2353.52,2357.18,"There’s nothing to choose, except so far relates to mootness."
1973.72-5839,1,37927,philip_d_gaujot,,2367.184,2368.507,"I don’t understand Justice Douglas, what --"
1973.72-5839,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2368.507,2378.567,"Very well, if you don’t understand, it’s too late.[Laughter]"
1973.72-5839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.567,2385.241,"Well, what if it is retroactive so that you can’t let the execution on this judgment."
1973.72-5839,1,37927,philip_d_gaujot,,2387.92,2392.8,"Well, now that’s my next argument in support of mootness."
