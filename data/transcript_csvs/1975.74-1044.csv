1975.74-1044,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.897,We will hear arguments next in Massachusetts Board of Retirement against Murgia.
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,33.958,36.602,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1044,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,105.189,106.524,Was this a class action?
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,106.524,108.59,"No it was not, Your Honor."
1975.74-1044,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,108.59,130.28,"The -- I asked because the Joint Supplemental Memorandum was filed here by recently on December 8 in the case that Mr. Murgia has materially changed his employment, I am reading, he is presently employed as the Security Manager in the Westminster, Massachusetts Plant of Digital Equipment Incorporated."
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,148.638,157.715,"I have not been informed to that effect Your Honor; I am informally informed that he would, if granted reinstatement, retake his position of the State Police."
1975.74-1044,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,161.213,165.339,"You or at least your side of case, this is a joint submission, as I understand."
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,165.339,165.935,Yes your Honor it was not a --
1975.74-1044,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,165.935,168.176,Thus I think I feel free to ask you about it.
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,168.176,168.611,Yes Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,177.343,181.805,It does not -- it is not -- it does not imply that there is a -- this case moot in any way or it is not.
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,181.805,187.511,"Certainly, yeah there is nothing in that Joint Supplemental Memorandum that the Commonwealth believed material affects the case."
1975.74-1044,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.999,287.904,Isn’t one of the purposes sometimes advanced for these kind of statutes to the desirability of avoiding having to make individualized determinations and tell Officer Smith that you have to retire at 62 because you are not quite in as good shape as you used to be but Officer John you can stay on for three or four more years?
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,287.904,288.725,Exactly Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,303.064,310.86,"That may -- I am talking about -- probably tell us, that may, on reaching 50, an office be continued?"
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,310.86,311.727,He may not Your Honor unless—
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,311.727,313.01,And not under circumstances.
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,313.01,315.617,Unless he has not served 20 years yet.
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,315.617,316.038,"Well, I see."
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,316.038,318.722,He must serve 20 years before he is granted a pension.
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,321.298,329.892,"Now, but if he has served 20 years and reaches age 50, he may not be continued, there is no process for continuing him, and he must retire."
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,329.892,330.57,Exactly Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,330.57,331.242,I see.
1975.74-1044,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,331.242,344.887,"Mr. O’Malley how can the problem, the 20 year problem, ever come up if you have, as I understand from your brief, you do have another statute that says one may not enter into the service beyond age 30?"
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,344.887,350.815,"Historically Your Honor, about 35 people have been over the age of 50 upon retirement."
1975.74-1044,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,379.142,385.045,"Well if someone came in at age 48 then he could serve until 68 on the face of the statute, could he not?"
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,385.045,385.679,Yes.
1975.74-1044,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,391.454,393.883,One more question now that I have interrupted you.
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,409.923,411.003,Not that I know of Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,427.484,431.953,"In Massachusetts there are other Mandatory Retirement Statute, does it not?"
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,431.953,432.152,It does Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,432.152,434.205,"And now there is one affecting judges, do you?"
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,434.205,435.009,Yes Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,435.421,436.915,And some other --
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,436.915,446.534,There is a -- well we have a very comprehensive retirement scheme of which are about four basic groups.
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,450.953,451.938,That is mandatory.
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,451.938,453.449,"No, they are all mandatory."
1975.74-1044,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,472.905,477.052,"And you are not uncomfortable because everyone’s pension is over 50, are you?"
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,477.052,480.388,I am uncomfortable Your Honor but not essentially because of that.
1975.74-1044,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,480.388,482.243,[Laughter]We are not here for the explanations.
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,482.243,483.564,Exactly Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,483.564,487.4,We are not uncomfortable with that either?[Laughter]
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,487.4,497.483,The fact the age for the retirement at 50 is lower than the general retirement age does not justify carving out an exception for the general rule that retirement statutes are constitutional.
1975.74-1044,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,636.827,643.314,Mr. O’Malley would you be making the same argument if your system or did not have the built in physical examination.
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,647.726,652.764,"The District Court ruled that because we have the examinations available, the statute was irrational."
1975.74-1044,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,675.434,699.741,"(Inaudible) to the existence of the medical examination requirement after age 40 means that a decisions had been made that after age 40 the policemen in uniform is in a suspect class in a sense, and they cut it off at 50 with a per se rule."
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,699.741,701.259,Yes Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,731.247,758.26,"Mr. O’Malley, you are obviously -- and I thought (Inaudible), your summary, there is Footnote 90 suggest 70 and in the fact you are talking about 55 as every other State has this kind of law, mandates retirement at 55 rather than 50."
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,762.305,765.63,I think that explains the opinion that he just thought 50 was too young.
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,765.63,776.36,Well thus what I am trying to get at that really is the thrust of his invalidation that Massachusetts has to this individual medical examination requirement.
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,776.36,780.284,He never really defined what the critical area or how it was defined.
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,793.086,797.622,I believe it certainly sounds that 50 was just irrational under any circumstances.
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,797.622,798.353,I think so Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,798.353,802.337,That 55 might be all right; 70 certainly might be all right.
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,802.337,808.222,"If you apply the analysis of the District Court to a 55-year-old Retirement Statute, I do not see how it could be any different."
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,808.222,810.619,"I guess it is true, is it not?"
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,826.605,838.36,"Your Honor with respect to the other States and their Retirement Statutes, I did note that State of Delaware has a 20 year service requirement and an officer must retire upon reaching serving 20 years."
1975.74-1044,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,838.36,839.682,Even if he is only in his 40’s?
1975.74-1044,0,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,839.682,839.97,Yes.
1975.74-1044,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,883.091,887.261,Mr. City.
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,887.261,890.403,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,930.697,936.883,"You say each officer Mr. City, I have thought earlier someone said this was not a class action."
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,936.883,938.812,It is not a class action Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,955.546,955.985,I see.
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,955.985,975.284,"And it is our contention that having screened this group through this fine mesh, the only group that reaches 50, the only group that can continue to serve at age 50 because everyone who does not meet this standards is set aside, he just cannot continue to serve."
1975.74-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,993.58,1014.18,Does this not show that the Massachusetts has a view that beginning at age 40 they must check their members of their police force annually to determine their fitness for duty and then they cut it off permanently at age 50.
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1016.964,1026.075,"Your Honor there is no doubt about the fact that the burden upon the individual member increases at age 40, he has to be found to be fit every single year."
1975.74-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1042.396,1045.992,Would you be here if they had drawn it at 55?
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1045.992,1061.069,"Well I think that the District Court opinion addresses itself to that problem and I think the later that we get in age, the inevitable aging does set in and the problems that are incumbent upon us become greater."
1975.74-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1062.14,1068.875,"Well have you answered my question, would you be here if the age had been 55?"
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1068.875,1076.926,I would not be here provided that at age 55 the medical testing which is already the order of the day showed one of two things.
1975.74-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1122.972,1123.928,That is for airline pilots?
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1123.928,1125.386,That is for airline pilots.
1975.74-1044,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1150.632,1155.368,It is also true that you have (Inaudible) much more extensive.
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1155.368,1155.64,Your Honor --
1975.74-1044,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1155.64,1156.839,Much more.
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1156.839,1165.606,I would submit that the examination used in this case which covers 60 pages of the Appendix here is extremely extensive physical examination.
1975.74-1044,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1165.606,1169.506,Is it as extensive as the airlines pilots?
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1169.506,1192.109,Your Honor we had a medical expert who testified in this case who was familiar with the medical -- he was a doctor for the airlines and was familiar with the medical tests and he felt that they were comparable.
1975.74-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1236.861,1243.315,"But they mean superannuated in relation to the duties that are called underperformed, do they not?"
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1243.315,1245.994,That is -- I think that is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1246.399,1267.384,"Now an airline pilot is presumed superannuated possibly so beginning at 60 and not later I think it is than 64, but lawyers and judges are not necessarily or librarians are superannuated at 60 or 64 or 65, are they?"
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1267.384,1274.414,There is no doubt Your Honor that they are different retirement ages for different activities.
1975.74-1044,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1306.202,1321.637,"What language -- what statutory language were you referring to Mr. City when you said that language makes -- the statute makes specific reference or it has -- and gave us a specific reason, the hypothesis that these people were superannuated?"
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1322.715,1331.929,The language Your Honor in the first part of Chapter 32 in the Definition Section provides that a man will be retired for superannuation.
1975.74-1044,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1345.554,1364.35,Now in assessing the constitutional validity of this State Statute are you suggesting that we are confined in assessing to the reason that the State gave for it?
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1364.35,1364.944,I would submit --
1975.74-1044,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1364.944,1382.149,"In other words, if we found that perhaps the presumption of superannuation might not support this constitutionally but other factors or considerations might, we are not bound by the reason the State gave, are we?"
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1382.149,1388.301,"I would suggest Your Honor that this Court should be bound by the purposes stated in the statute, the --"
1975.74-1044,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1388.301,1393.508,It is not necessary for you own suggestiveness of the traditional and conventional constitutional law?
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1393.508,1393.859,No sir.
1975.74-1044,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1408.944,1412.556,"There is a presumption of course you would agree whether that the statute is valid, you rule that."
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1412.556,1413.77,There is no doubt about it.
1975.74-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.351,1433.344,"And the Equal Protection Clause is that if any rational set of facts can be conceived which would support this legislation, it will be upheld."
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1438.129,1442.03,"Well Your Honor, I think there are really a number of issues in here."
1975.74-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1473.602,1483.407,"Well that is just a on words, it seems to me, and it does not fit in at all with our equal protection decisions which Justice Stewart just reminded you of."
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1489.239,1502.567,"My position is even under that test Your Honor, there is no rational set of facts on the -- there is no rational basis on the facts that we have had before us here."
1975.74-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1502.567,1511.595,But it is not the question of the facts we have before us here or the facts on or the basis at which the State says it relied.
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1519.293,1521.132,Your Honor I will have to maintain my position.
1975.74-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1568.916,1574.202,But it is not a question of fact; it is a question of Constitutional Law.
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1596.338,1598.309,I agree with you Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1617.36,1647.703,"What if a State just want it all of its placement not to have gray hairs as a matter of image or identification just as a person making a movie might want to have the lead roles played by people who do not have gray hair regardless of their health, would that be -- and what if a State said any placement of whose hair turns gray can no longer be a policeman working for us because we want only people whose hair is not gray."
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1647.703,1647.939,I would submit to you --
1975.74-1044,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1647.939,1649.526,As a matter of image of our police force.
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1649.526,1650.908,I would submit your Honor that that is just the --
1975.74-1044,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1650.908,1652.078,No matter how healthy.
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1652.078,1653.466,That is just not a rational basis --
1975.74-1044,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1653.466,1653.714,Why would not it be?
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1653.714,1655.251,-- on which to make a determination.
1975.74-1044,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1655.251,1656.965,What could we make on that --
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1656.965,1657.485,I think that the—
1975.74-1044,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1657.485,1659.848,-- as a matter of the United States Constitution.
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1659.848,1676.718,I think as a matter of the United States Constitution the classification which a state makes in which it selects to treat its people has got to have some functional relationship to the job that it seeks to accomplish.
1975.74-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1676.718,1692.031,What you are saying is that a legislature of a state cannot act on the generalization that men over 50 are not as competent to perform rigorous police duties as men 50 and under.
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1693.583,1694.198,No sir.
1975.74-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1715.889,1721.745,"Then if they abolished all of the medical examinations you would not be here, is that what you are saying?"
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1721.745,1735.122,"I think that the holding of the District Court, which is really the only issue that we have here before us, says that when the legislature is involved in an admittedly arbitrary line drawing, which is the classification here."
1975.74-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.378,1753.917,"Do you think that the data in the record shows that men over 50 do not get tired quicker, more quickly?"
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1753.917,1755.714,I think the record shows that every single --
1975.74-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1755.714,1759.544,Or that the men over 50 do not have the endurance than men under 50?
1975.74-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1759.544,1762.208,Or the reflexes are not as swift?
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1762.208,1767.353,I think that the standard that is required by the State Police is set forth in its examination.
1975.74-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1767.353,1770.743,"Well, that is not what I asked you."
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1779.42,1783.155,Mr. Justice White I think without any question age is a factor here.
1975.74-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.919,1787.204,Yes.
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1791.484,1792.877,Exactly Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.902,1840.997,"Well, again you are just saying that we are -- he should not be entitled to add to the possible qualifications that the State is asking of its policemen."
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1854.928,1860.032,I am suggesting that they could recognize that except in this instance Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1864.37,1871.93,Actually those requirements that after 40 each officer have a medical examination.
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1902.141,1908.171,I think Senior Judge Aldrich said to the legislature that is something that you cannot do.
1975.74-1044,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1914.817,1921.771,"Well I gather if that is what he said, that is what we -- what we have got before is whether he was right for saying it."
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1921.771,1924.109,I think that is what the Court was saying.
1975.74-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1990.284,1998.131,But is that not just a matter of drawing different lines for different functions in the government?
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,1998.131,1998.489,No Your honor.
1975.74-1044,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2057.574,2068.746,"Mr. City, as I understand the original complaint it also alleged sex discrimination in that women officers or at least some of them are not required to retire at age 50."
1975.74-1044,1,39020,robert_d_city,,2070.297,2071.556,No sir.
1975.74-1044,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2072.735,2075.697,Thank you.
1975.74-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2075.697,2077.44,Do you have anything further Mr. O’Malley.
1975.74-1044,2,43160,terence_p_o’malley,,2077.44,2078.38,No Your Honor.
1975.74-1044,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2078.38,2079.076,Thank you gentlemen.
