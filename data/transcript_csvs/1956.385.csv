1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,1820.889,1823.232,May it please the Court.
1956.385,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1908.283,1909.815,May I -- may I ask you?
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,1916.598,1917.341,California --
1956.385,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1917.341,1919.595,Under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,1919.595,1927.036,"California, sir, has a -- an Act which permits suits against the State to a limited extent."
1956.385,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1927.036,1929.496,But it could be reviewed as wrong.
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,1929.496,1931.04,"There's no doubt of it, sir."
1956.385,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1934.728,1936.391,That has been held to cover --
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,1936.391,1939.628,That has been held to cover the operation of this very railroad.
1956.385,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1939.628,1943.459,I understand that it covers suits under the F -- F.E.L.A.
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,1943.459,1945.463,Under -- under the F.E.L.A.
1956.385,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1953.691,1954.427,State court?
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,1954.427,1955.588,The state court.
1956.385,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1956.862,1957.858,I won't trouble you with it.
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,1962.344,1967.058,Counsel has described this railroad as a switching railroad.
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2036.027,2061.643,"Well, does that mean this, Mr. Williamson, that the employees in respect of higher tenure of employment, wages, seniority will be -- will no longer be embraced by any California statutes, civil service statutes that deal with those subjects?"
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2061.643,2070.487,"Sir, I think the answer is that so far as the collective-bargaining agreement covers the particular points that is supreme."
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2079.759,2079.822,Well --
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2079.822,2081.866,-- that California law would still be there.
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2081.866,2084.659,Let's take a -- let's take the matter of wages.
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2084.659,2086.357,"Yes, sir."
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2086.357,2089.179,"Well, perhaps if there is a question because I don't know the fact."
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2089.179,2090.226,"Yes, sir."
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2090.226,2100.598,"Are the wages prescribed by some state legislation which affixes ranges, for example, salary rates by ranges?"
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2100.598,2101.704,"That -- that is correct, sir."
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2101.704,2109.336,"And are they on a salary basis by which I mean an annual basis, rather than weekly or monthly and so forth?"
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2109.336,2113.843,"It -- it is by the hour in majority of instances, I believe."
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2113.843,2114.88,Under the statute?
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2116.082,2118.714,"Under the -- I beg your pardon, under the collective-bargaining agreement --"
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2118.714,2118.886,No.
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2118.986,2121.768,-- under California Act.
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2125.701,2125.943,Yes.
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2132.604,2134.268,"As Mr. -- that's correct, sir."
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2142.569,2143.105,Prevailing?
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2143.105,2144.812,"-- yes, in private employment."
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2147.41,2152.125,But I take it in this instance if your position is correct.
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2165.94,2167.976,"That -- that is correct, sir."
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2167.976,2170.867,"And similarly, I suppose as to other --"
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2170.867,2173.085,In any place where there might be conflict.
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2181.997,2185.3,"Well, getting back to wages for a moment though."
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2202.273,2204.971,"I think that is correct, sometime by administrative -- some regulations."
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2204.971,2205.889,Sometime?
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2205.889,2211.228,"I think, sometimes the legislation permits administrative regulation of wages."
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2211.228,2227.783,"Well now, if your position is correct, now would there be required either legislative or administrative action to confirm any collective-bargaining agreement provision which fixed wages?"
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2227.783,2229.073,"I believe not, sir."
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2267.847,2267.944,"Now, how do you --"
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2267.944,2269.44,I believe it's very simple in fact.
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2269.44,2285.269,"How do you meet Mr. Wineg's point that there are other employees in related activities that is related to the railroad activity, well of course, would not be covered by -- if you prevail?"
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2294.488,2302.332,"Well, I think there would be no trouble because the other employees would not be in the railroad labor world."
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2309.375,2309.679,"Well, I gather --"
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2309.679,2314.458,"And the other employees, I believe, sir, are -- are not in that class or craft."
1956.385,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2314.458,2328.66,"Well, I have the impressions from this argument, I may be wrong about it, but there was a direct relation between the compensation paid to the railroad employees and these other employees in activities somehow related to the railroad work."
1956.385,1,18171,burke_williamson,,2328.66,2330.511,"Well, how closely related they are."
