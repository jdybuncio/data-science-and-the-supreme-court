1983.81-2159,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.556,We'll hear arguments next in Silkwood against Kerr-McGee Corporation.
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,110.085,113.557,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.81-2159,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.266,215.023,"Now, the only compensatory damage award that remains in the case, as I understand it, is the $5,000 property damage award."
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,215.023,218.345,That is the only award that remains in the case.
1983.81-2159,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.958,229.582,"And the entire $10 million punitive damages has to hang then on the $5,000 property damage, is that correct?"
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,229.582,232.152,"--Well, at the present... in the present posture of the case--"
1983.81-2159,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.152,232.853,At present?
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,232.853,233.694,--Yes.
1983.81-2159,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,258.951,267.366,"Does Oklahoma law, so far as you know, as to punitive damages draw any distinction between a property damage award and a personal injury award?"
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,267.366,268.848,"None, Your Honor."
1983.81-2159,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,317.518,318.028,Yeah.
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,333.8,336.441,"Well, that issue would be before the Tenth Circuit."
1983.81-2159,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,729.718,746.138,"--Yet, Mr. Gottesman, the position you take that punitive damages are primarily to punish suggests, at least in your view, that the punitive damages serve a much different purpose than compensatory damages, which I suppose are just to make whole."
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,746.138,747.119,That's correct.
1983.81-2159,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,775.577,780.341,Are you suggesting it would be more likely if they had to choose that they would have preempted compensatory damages?
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,780.341,789.188,"Well, I think it's not likely they would choose to select between them, and indeed, there's never been a ruling by this Court that found one and not the other."
1983.81-2159,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,804.575,824.01,"Of course, logically, though, punitive damages are in a sense regulatory, and it was Congress' intent to leave in place... to leave the regulatory aspects to the NRC for safety purposes."
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,824.01,834.716,"Well, I think logically, Justice O'Connor, both compensatory and punitive damages are regulatory, and this Court has repeatedly so said."
1983.81-2159,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,903.962,918.374,"Mr. Gottesman, are you conceding, in effect, that the radioisotopes involved here are subject to the same preemption doctrine as perhaps the operation of a nuclear reactor would have been?"
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,918.374,922.105,"--Well, there are some differences in this case."
1983.81-2159,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,950.925,963.414,"Do you think then that, for instance, damages to the public arising out of a terrorist attack on a nuclear facility would be preempted?"
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,963.414,965.244,"--Oh, absolutely not."
1983.81-2159,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1391.466,1399.832,"Would a state tort action lie in the nature of a nuisance suit against a power plant, a nuclear power plant?"
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1399.832,1419.476,"I would think that it would like for damages... if we're talking about radiation emissions, then I would think that the message of this... it isn't a necessary message, because that's not what Congress was thinking about when they made these statements; what they were thinking about were people being injured."
1983.81-2159,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1442.731,1449.993,And you don't... you're not troubled by the language of this Court in the PG&E case about the preemption?
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1449.993,1472.638,"--Well, I think if... I think the question of whether a state court could enjoin a nuisance would be much more troubling, because there you would be doing not that which Congress so clearly had in mind, which is conferring damages, but there you would be, in effect, revoking the license of the plant to operate."
1983.81-2159,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.053,1500.177,"What you're saying is that PG&E dealt with safety regulation by the states as such, by a commission or perhaps by a nuisance action, but it didn't go so far as to say that perhaps things that are tangentially concerned with safety but primarily devoted to compensation or punishment were also to be swept under the rug with safety concerns."
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1500.177,1501.639,"That is our submission, Your Honor."
1983.81-2159,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1567.912,1607.077,"Well, Mr.... Mr.... Mr. Gottesman, if the... if the plant is complying in all respects safety wise with federal standards and federal regulations but the state nevertheless and by virtue of its tort standards says that you must conduct your plant differently, you must run your plant differently or you're going to be subject to a damage suit, and it doesn't make any difference to us whether you're complying with the federal law or not; you have to comply with this safety standard or you're going to be held to be negligent."
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1612.65,1615.672,Everyone on the other side concedes the state may do that.
1983.81-2159,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1615.672,1620.247,I don't think that concessions can find the Court very easily.
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1620.247,1620.667,Okay.
1983.81-2159,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1621.817,1625.6,I mean people frequently try to concede that--
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1625.6,1645.261,"--Then I take it is our submission... it is our submission and their submission that the state can say notwithstanding your compliance with the federal standards, which the federal government says are no guarantee of safety... this is cost-benefit; this is what we say we want... notwithstanding full compliance with that, you can still do incredible damage to people."
1983.81-2159,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.224,1651.646,"--So the states can say you just didn't run your plant safely, so you're subject to damages."
1983.81-2159,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1651.646,1652.487,--Absolutely.
1983.81-2159,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1660.083,1670.349,Mr. Cook.
1983.81-2159,1,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,1670.349,1673.401,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.81-2159,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.68,1847.103,"Which one did the court of appeals use, both or just one?"
1983.81-2159,1,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,1847.103,1860.113,"--Your Honor, I think they used the... the preemption on the basis of entire occupation of field, but I cannot tell you whether they also had in mind that in this particular case there is an obstacle to the accomplishment of a purpose."
1983.81-2159,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1882.416,1905.992,"Mr. Cook, if you're right in that, I suppose... and although the California case involved state regulation licensing requirements... if you're going to carry that over en bloc to state tort law, which I don't think that statement from PG&E at all requires, I take it compensatory damages would also be preempted."
1983.81-2159,1,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,1905.992,1908.115,"--No, Your Honor, I do not think so."
1983.81-2159,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1993.13,2007.168,"Well, but surely you don't suggest that when the state court said charges on negligence sufficient to support a recovery of compensatory damages it isn't laying down a standard of care directed to safety?"
1983.81-2159,1,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,2007.168,2008.498,I don't suggest that at all.
1983.81-2159,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2019.487,2029.062,"Well, but isn't there also a nonsafety rationale to punitive damages in the sense of punishing someone who is regarded as having deliberately done wrong?"
1983.81-2159,1,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,2029.062,2031.085,"No, Your Honor, I do not believe so."
1983.81-2159,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2145.969,2149.552,"Well, has the Oklahoma court said that compensatory damages are not for that purpose?"
1983.81-2159,1,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,2149.552,2164.001,"What the Oklahoma court I think has said is that compensatory damages have... and the... as their basis the intention to benefit the plaintiff, to make him whole for the wrong he has suffered."
1983.81-2159,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.001,2165.902,"What wrong, though."
1983.81-2159,1,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,2173.858,2178.39,"Actually, in Oklahoma you do not because there's... it's strict liability in Oklahoma."
1983.81-2159,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.074,2188.518,"--Is that... and the jury was instructed both on negligence and strict liability, wasn't it?"
1983.81-2159,1,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,2188.518,2190.188,Not with respect to the property damage.
1983.81-2159,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2191.029,2195.261,"Well, that may be so, but now let's talk about personal injury."
1983.81-2159,1,18727,c_lee_cook_jr,,2203.326,2206.198,"--Your Honor, I don't think that--"
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,2976.014,2983.046,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.81-2159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3076.037,3079.16,"Is this a radioisotope, Mr. Garvey?"
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3079.16,3081.1,I wish I knew.
1983.81-2159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3093.068,3104.556,"Certainly it's fairly important to determine in deciding whether this has been preempted or not, under the government's theory, isn't it, when the Joint Committee Report in '59 says we're leading... leaving radioisotopes--"
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3104.556,3116.013,"--Oh, there is... there is absolutely no doubt but that Congress attempted to preempt the operation of plutonium fuel fabrication facilities in all their respects."
1983.81-2159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3124.07,3128.502,"--Well, one thing Congress said was that we're leaving radioisotopes to the states."
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3128.502,3129.273,--Yes.
1983.81-2159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3133.945,3135.528,And what's your authority for that?
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3135.528,3162.883,"Well, I think if you look at the AEC analysis of the bill, which appears in 105 Congressional Record '83-'84, and if you read the House and Senate reports that accompany the 1959 amendments, it's clear that Congress made a distinction between facilities that possess special nuclear material in quantities sufficient to form a critical mass, and this was such a facility, on the one hand."
1983.81-2159,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3271.326,3282.663,"So your... your point is... is... is that if... that if had been shown that Kerr-McGee was responsible for the presence of that plutonium, there would have been a violation of federal law."
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3282.663,3283.454,--Yes.
1983.81-2159,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.266,3327.954,"Well, that wouldn't... there wouldn't be any intention to... there wouldn't be any bar, though, to a... to a state court action for compensatory damages--"
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3327.954,3328.862,"No, it would not."
1983.81-2159,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3328.862,3329.783,--For the violation of the federal law.
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3329.783,3330.484,"No, it would not."
1983.81-2159,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3338.369,3339.05,"Right, right."
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3343.792,3344.743,Indeed not.
1983.81-2159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3390.654,3398.889,"But, Mr. Garvey, the civil fines imposed by the NRC, do they go to a person who's claiming injury or do they go to the government?"
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3398.889,3400.89,"--Well, they go to the government."
1983.81-2159,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3400.89,3403.852,So that isn't exactly analogous then to punitive damages.
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3403.852,3410.196,"No, it's not exactly analogous, although Oklahoma law recognizes that... that the collection of punitive damages isn't a right of the private party."
1983.81-2159,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3423.376,3424.695,Excuse me there.
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3434.973,3436.273,--That's correct.
1983.81-2159,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3436.273,3440.446,It has a deterrent effect.
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3440.446,3442.019,That's correct.
1983.81-2159,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3531.095,3546.346,"Well, I suppose that in the process of awarding compensatory damages if in a particular case the state was attempting to impose a standard of performance inconsistent with federal law, that would pose a different problem."
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3546.346,3547.567,I don't believe so.
1983.81-2159,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3559.956,3560.955,"Well, you aren't answering my question."
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3560.955,3570.08,"Well, I think I... I think I am, because in awarding damages under standards of strict liability, the state makes no decision about standards of care."
1983.81-2159,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3570.08,3578.085,"Well, I asked you if the state was awarding damages in accordance with some standard of care that was inconsistent with the federal law."
1983.81-2159,2,30459,john_h_garvey,,3595.319,3601.571,I find it curious that appellants have turned that argument to their own advantage.
1983.81-2159,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3621.095,3625.176,We'll resume there at 1:00.
1983.81-2159,3,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3646.041,3648.214,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.81-2159,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3648.214,3652.303,"Mr. Gottesman, may I ask you a question before you commence?"
1983.81-2159,3,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3672.669,3673.88,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.81-2159,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3673.88,3679.623,And would they then be entitled to bring punitive action suits?
1983.81-2159,3,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3679.623,3709.092,"Well, punitive damages would be part of the very cause of action, but the statute has in it, Price-Anderson has in it a provision that where the total recoveries of all elements of damage exceed the $560 million limit of liability the court will make apportionments based on which elements of recovery are the most deserving."
1983.81-2159,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3712.785,3715.977,"Does the statute make that clear, drawing a distinction between the two?"
1983.81-2159,3,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3715.977,3717.277,--No.
1983.81-2159,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3728.086,3730.948,And there's nothing in the legislative history that sheds any light on that?
1983.81-2159,3,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3730.948,3738.981,There is some discussion in the legislative history that personal should come before property.
