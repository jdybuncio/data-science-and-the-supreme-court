2000.99-8576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.234,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-8576, Paul Glover v. United States."
2000.99-8576,0,36852,michael_l_waldman,,37.312,38.628,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2000.99-8576,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,147.212,173.289,Would it also be open to the lower court on remand to reassess its initial position on Glover's leadership role if it knew what it knows now about the... that the Seventh Circuit's test is incorrect?
2000.99-8576,0,36852,michael_l_waldman,,185.34,207.532,"Your Honor, I think the issues as to what arguments have been waived, what arguments... by the Government or by Mr. Glover, whether to do a recalculation is something that would have to be sorted out by the Seventh Circuit, and I think that is one of the very reasons why remand to the lower court is appropriate in this case."
2000.99-8576,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,367.299,370.712,"Mr. Waldman, is your client still incarcerated?"
2000.99-8576,0,36852,michael_l_waldman,,375.906,376.788,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-8576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,492.383,498.916,"Well, the Government... you, of course, were appealing against the decision of the district court, were you not?"
2000.99-8576,0,36852,michael_l_waldman,,498.916,500.129,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-8576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,500.129,507.079,"And so how much is the Government expected... as an appellee, how many of these things do you expect it to raise, when you're appealing?"
2000.99-8576,0,36852,michael_l_waldman,,507.079,516.413,"Well, Your Honor, they obviously had the right to raise whatever arguments they wanted to affirm the district court below, alternative grounds for affirmance at that court."
2000.99-8576,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,532.62,533.998,That's all you're saying.
2000.99-8576,0,36852,michael_l_waldman,,538.858,547.341,"That's correct, Your Honor. Second, neither the district court nor the court of appeals ever addressed any of these various new Government arguments."
2000.99-8576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,813.855,819.567,"Was Glover's counsel on the first appeal, was it retained counsel or furnished by the Government?"
2000.99-8576,0,36852,michael_l_waldman,,819.567,828.976,"Retained counsel, Your Honor. In summary, the Government's various new arguments are inappropriate for this Court to address in the first instance."
2000.99-8576,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,861.964,863.341,"Very well, Mr. Waldman."
2000.99-8576,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,865.623,869.363,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-8576,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,894.733,901.451,"Mr. Dreeben, why didn't the Government tell us this in the response to the petition for certiorari?"
2000.99-8576,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,901.451,909.787,"Justice O'Connor, at the stage when we responded to the petition, we told the Court that we thought the judgment was correct."
2000.99-8576,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,970.496,979.277,"But those grounds would be hard for us, really, to address here for the first time, at least on the grouping question."
2000.99-8576,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,989.406,1010.368,"I agree, Justice O'Connor, that the sentencing guidelines question and the intricacies related to whether money laundering should be grouped with the underlying offense are both complicated and the kind of issue that this Court would ordinarily properly leave to the Sentencing Commission to resolve, particularly since the Sentencing Commission is aware of it."
2000.99-8576,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1055.91,1066.629,"That would come up, Mr. Dreeben, only if we dealt on the merits with your effort to affirm on an alternate ground."
2000.99-8576,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1066.629,1068.736,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.99-8576,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1104.163,1108.688,"That may be, but it's hard to say that's what the Seventh Circuit was talking about."
2000.99-8576,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1139.843,1152.009,"--I quite agree, Justice Breyer, and my point is that the considerations that drove the Seventh Circuit to adopt its rule on prejudice are actually far more pertinent to analyzing the performance prong."
2000.99-8576,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1159.475,1168.256,"But Mr. Dreeben, may I just stop you there to confirm that you recognize the Second Circuit did not pass on the adequacy of the performance."
2000.99-8576,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1193.523,1230.575,"--I think, Justice Ginsburg, the reason why it is relevant for the Court to say something about the performance issue, which was not addressed squarely by the Seventh Circuit... we did argue it in the district court and the district court didn't address it either, so it has not been resolved by the courts below, but it is highly interrelated with the prejudice inquiry in a sentencing guidelines ineffective assistance collateral attack, and the point that the Seventh Circuit was trying to make was to give courts a way to weed out these collateral attacks in an efficient way."
2000.99-8576,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1230.575,1241.358,"Well, why not let the Seventh Circuit make it, because looking at its current decision, all it said is, we're going to assume for purposes of this decision that counsel's performance was inadequate."
2000.99-8576,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1241.358,1267.828,"I agree that the Seventh Circuit hasn't resolved it, but this Court is going to announce a decision that will be influential in the way that the lower courts address comparable sentencing guidelines ineffective assistance of counsel cases, and I think that it would be useful for the lower courts to have some guidance from this Court as to some of the relevant considerations and factors that ought to be brought to bear on the performance inquiry."
2000.99-8576,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.828,1275.877,There's really nothing novel about the points you make concerning adequacy of counsel's performance.
2000.99-8576,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1314.697,1328.982,"Well, I hope they're not bizarre, but I do think that the arguments that we've made have gone a little bit beyond what you, Justice Scalia, have just accurately described as where this Court has thus far gone in analyzing the performance inquiry."
2000.99-8576,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1425.512,1432.719,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, I take it we have three choices here. We could say something on this issue that helps the Government."
2000.99-8576,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1440.698,1442.328,"Correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.99-8576,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.257,1486.033,"If I understand you correctly, you're asking us either to affirm on grounds not relied on below or, alternatively, to write an advisory opinion on the general subject matter."
2000.99-8576,2,36852,michael_l_waldman,,2183.671,2041.176,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2000.99-8576,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2186.435,2188.22,"Thank you, Mr. Waldman."
