2013.12-414,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.17,"We will hear argument next in Case 12-414, Burt vs. Titlow."
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,7.87,11.022,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-414,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,95.378,98.514,May I just ask a question about what you just said?
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,118.577,121.779,"Well, I don't think he's -- he's saying that, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-414,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,154.166,163.272,"Was the sentence that was ultimately imposed after the trial for the second-degree murder conviction within the guidelines, within the Michigan guidelines?"
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,163.272,163.989,"Yes, it was."
2013.12-414,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,163.989,165.891,What -- do you know what those guidelines were?
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,165.891,171.462,"I don't recall, but it's something on the range of 15 to 20 years."
2013.12-414,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,241.789,258.151,"When we're asking whether the advice was reasonable, what force do we give to the proposition that a well-counselled defendant was now insisting that he wanted to change his plea?"
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,265.555,266.256,Right.
2013.12-414,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,267.623,269.708,--it may lead us to one answer.
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,279.164,287.337,"I think that's a significant factor because, as you point out, before the ink was even dry on the plea agreement, Titlow was already in prison saying, I'm innocent."
2013.12-414,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,331.199,336.52,Could you explain the procedural situation before the Michigan Court of Appeals?
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,345.708,346.392,That's correct.
2013.12-414,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,346.392,348.91,--on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel?
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,358.266,358.999,That's correct.
2013.12-414,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,358.999,377.228,"And the court of appeals, I gather, said they're not sufficient and cited, among other things or principally, the fact that the Respondent had claimed innocence, and that was the reason for the change of attorney."
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,393.772,402.645,"Just to be clear about Michigan procedure, the defendant has an opportunity to a right to ask for what's called a Ginther hearing in Michigan, and that's an evidentiary hearing to develop a record for an ineffective assistance claim."
2013.12-414,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,476.593,481.497,"In just thinking about that Michigan Court of Appeals decision, there is one sort of troubling line in it to me."
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,507.463,508.064,Correct.
2013.12-414,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,508.064,514.818,So could you tell me a little bit about what you think of that question and why you read the sentence the way you read the sentence?
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,514.818,515.151,Yes.
2013.12-414,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,592.482,596.57,Can you clarify something for me about habeas corpus law?
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,596.57,597.186,Yes.
2013.12-414,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,597.186,602.474,"I have to imagine facts, so let's take it as a hypothetical."
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,685.444,687.48,That's a delightful question.
2013.12-414,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,687.48,688.48,--I'm glad.
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,690.598,695.467,And I want to start with a record response to distinguish our case from your hypothetical and then address the habeas question.
2013.12-414,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,765.48,778.138,"What do you make of the fact that -- what do you make of the fact that at the change of plea hearing, the first attorney didn't mention the claim of innocence, only mentioned the fact that the sentence was above the guidelines?"
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,778.138,782.275,I don't think that's significant because those two things are not mutually exclusive.
2013.12-414,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,813.291,825.248,"When you say the record is silent, I am looking at the Joint Appendix, Page 295, and this is Titlow's statement:"
2013.12-414,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,867.527,874.781,"Well, first I have to disagree with the premise of your question, Justice Ginsburg, because there is no doubt that Toca made an appraisal."
2013.12-414,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,939.723,940.539,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,952.597,955.063,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-414,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1019.139,1032.882,"Counsel, years ago, one of my colleagues, not on this bench, but a different one, said to me, you know, there's much to-do about judges basing credibility on demeanor."
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1095.622,1105.061,"--I don't -- we're not asking for any kind of a special rule that there has to be, you know, a certain amount of corroborating evidence in addition to the defendant's statement."
2013.12-414,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1124.206,1125.642,"It said it, but it didn't do it."
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1125.642,1134.098,"Well, to the extent that the court was saying that the defendant's statement should be credited or not credited alone without necessarily looking at everything, that's wrong."
2013.12-414,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1146.721,1149.423,"Well, counselor, that's what juries do all the time, selectivity."
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1169.004,1182.661,"--All we're asking the Court to announce or to clarify on this question is that the subjective statement or the self-serving statement of the defendant in these circumstances should be viewed with skepticism, and that the Court should look--"
2013.12-414,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1182.661,1183.211,Every court says that.
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1183.211,1188.715,"--Well, to the -- there could be confusion on what the Sixth Circuit's rule is."
2013.12-414,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1193.469,1193.936,"Well, are there rules in this area?"
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1234.796,1237.148,--We are not asking for any kind of a special rule.
2013.12-414,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1252.091,1257.828,"Well, you need to give us some examples of things that don't count."
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1274.188,1275.104,Not in this case.
2013.12-414,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1284.126,1284.811,Right.
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1284.811,1285.861,"In fact, it has to be for prejudice."
2013.12-414,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1315.415,1325.62,"On the question of this -- of this sentence, what do you think were the range of reasonable sentences that could have been imposed in compliance with our recent decisions?"
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1347.902,1364.097,"Well, I think the trial court has a lot of discretion under the Court's opinion, but I think what -- what should have happened in this circumstance is to go back to the sentencing court, not require the government to reoffer this plea deal, which just simply can't be -- can't be offered and accepted anymore."
2013.12-414,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1383.659,1398.752,"Why -- why -- you made the point that this plea bargain could not be carried out once the number one condition, the prosecutor said, you testify against your aunt and then we'll give you this deal."
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1420.082,1423.136,"--Well, I mean, we think that's right."
2013.12-414,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1443.363,1453.821,"But we're in a position now, aren't we, where the State court can do exactly that, can say the circumstances have changed, and -- and so leave everything undisturbed."
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1453.821,1454.588,Yes.
2013.12-414,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1495.232,1505.956,"But isn't that -- I mean, the court didn't say that the court -- that the court below -- the Sixth Circuit didn't say that the court below had to accept the reoffered plea agreement."
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1527.469,1528.569,That's right.
2013.12-414,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1535.725,1539.677,"So that's your only point, which is that that should be an issue for the court below."
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1539.677,1540.177,Yes.
2013.12-414,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1545.098,1547.7,But some remedy has to be offered--
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1547.7,1548.317,Well--
2013.12-414,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1548.317,1549.683,--if there is a violation.
2013.12-414,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1549.683,1553.187,"--The -- the court's opinion in Lafler, I think, leaves that question open."
2013.12-414,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1567.946,1569.213,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1574.184,1576.802,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-414,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1594.514,1608.071,"I agree with you and so does your adversary, but he says there is nothing in this record to show what research was done or not done."
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1628.002,1631.454,"--That is partially true, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-414,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1689.892,1690.442,"Well, that's--"
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1690.442,1708.271,Are you arguing that he -- he needed to be -- he needed to have enough material and to have familiarized himself enough with everything that's relevant to the case to be able to go to trial before he could move to have the -- the previous plea withdrawn?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1708.271,1710.073,"--No, my argument does not go that far."
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1711.123,1711.439,All right.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1713.191,1726.416,"--The argument is that defense counsel has a duty to investigate, that the defense attorney has a duty to be able to inform the client of the risks of either accepting a plea, withdrawing a plea, whatever the case."
2013.12-414,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1733.438,1734.271,"Well, that's true."
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1753.3,1757.204,"I agree with that, Justice Scalia, and we are not putting the burden on the other side."
2013.12-414,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1814.706,1827.716,"But just -- just to be clear, isn't that after Titlow had asked for an attorney because Titlow had talked with the jailer, who encouraged Titlow to plead innocent?"
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1835.054,1836.187,Justice Kennedy--
2013.12-414,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1836.187,1836.906,Or correct me if that's wrong.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1836.906,1850.813,"--I would say that's wrong, and that's where the court of appeals is wrong again and why the State court's findings are entitled to no deference, because the state court took that affidavit from William Pierson and turned the words on its head."
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1943.341,1949.995,Isn't it -- is it unreasonable to read the Pierson affidavit -- and -- and you submitted that; isn't that correct?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1949.995,1950.762,Correct.
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1950.762,1951.229,All right.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,1977.562,1988.62,"Justice Alito, that's one -- part of what you said I would agree with, that the -- it does state in the affidavit, certainly, that he had an attorney that was really good and could ask somebody to come talk to me."
2013.12-414,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1994.274,1996.56,So the point is that there has to be some evidence.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2032.566,2035.701,"It also -- it also says, with all due respect, that--"
2013.12-414,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2035.701,2036.401,Where?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2036.401,2037.22,--the deputy approached her.
2013.12-414,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2037.22,2038.753,Where -- approached her--
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2038.753,2039.287,Right.
2013.12-414,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2039.287,2041.505,--and discussions with her.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2072.56,2073.293,And Justice Breyer--
2013.12-414,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.293,2074.076,So whose burden is it?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2074.076,2079.297,"--Justice Breyer, I would argue that it's -- it's an inference that doesn't matter."
2013.12-414,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.864,2080.297,Okay.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2080.297,2080.797,--in this case.
2013.12-414,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2080.797,2081.932,It doesn't matter.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2124.409,2138.502,"Well, in paragraph 8 of William Pierson's affidavit on page 298 it indicates that it was Frederick Toca who encouraged her to reject a plea agreement to testify against the aunt."
2013.12-414,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2149.976,2168.772,"--Ms. Newman, you know, I -- I'm -- this may be the first case that I have been involved in as a judge -- and there might be others, but myself personally -- where, in a situation like this, the defendant has not put in an affidavit to explain what happened."
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2193.672,2195.772,I was not the attorney.
2013.12-414,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2218.104,2220.822,But they didn't ask for the hearing in the court below.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2222.906,2231.612,"--They -- Michigan -- Michigan -- the way Michigan works is within 56 days of getting the transcripts, you can file in the trial court."
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2248.89,2249.676,Who was the attorney at that stage?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2258.179,2258.864,Right.
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2259.431,2259.914,Who was it?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2259.914,2263.999,"--It was an appellate attorney, Liz Jacobs, was the attorney at that stage."
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2263.999,2266.868,And she's -- is she with your office or she's--
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2266.868,2268.72,"She's not with my office, no."
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2268.72,2269.72,--But she was appointed.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2269.72,2273.874,"She was -- I don't know if she was appointed or retained, but she's not with my office."
2013.12-414,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2273.874,2294.12,"May I ask you, Ms. Newman, if you would agree that the Sixth Circuit was wrong, at least to this extent: Is there -- what is the argument for directing a prosecutor to make a plea offer that was never previously made?"
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2323.89,2338.649,"Well, Justice Ginsburg -- Ginsburg, as the Court decided last term in Lafler v. Cooper, the point of the remedy is to put the defendant as closely as possible back in the position he or she would have been in but for the ineffective assistance."
2013.12-414,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2358.461,2364.449,Then how could -- how could this Court order the prosecutor to renew an offer that can't be made?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2364.449,2368.753,"--Well, it is an offer that can be made if you remove the condition precedent."
2013.12-414,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2374.157,2379.458,But the whole -- what drove the prosecutor to make this bargain was he wanted the testimony.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2391.618,2402.557,"--Well, again, referring to Lafler v. Cooper, the remedy goes -- the Sixth Amendment right attaches to the defendant, not to the prosecution."
2013.12-414,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2463.047,2473.253,I don't know that it's so strange to make the prosecutor -- to make the prosecution submit an offer that can no longer be accepted.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2529.823,2532.792,"Justice Scalia, though, I think you hit the point on the head."
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2599.836,2601.038,If that's the case--
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2601.038,2602.605,The facts are in all force.
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2602.605,2606.09,--Your arguments seemed to be -- have had a head-on collision.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2620.25,2623.218,Because it's for the same reason in Cooper.
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2630.474,2631.174,"Well, that's not a manslaughter case."
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2632.657,2642.715,I'm saying that his representations on the record are similar to the representations made by Mr. Cooper's attorney on the record.
2013.12-414,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2645.4,2647.934,"But the charge was -- that she was convicted of second-degree murder, right?"
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2647.934,2649.686,--She was convicted of second-degree murder.
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2669.615,2670.499,You have my head--
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2670.499,2671.015,So there's no question--
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2671.015,2671.967,--You have my head spinning.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2685.209,2686.325,--I'm not making that--
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2686.325,2686.977,Did I misunderstand that?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2686.977,2688.127,--I'm not making that argument.
2013.12-414,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2688.127,2695.417,"I thought you were -- there is a reason that they spoke about, which was, well, she said she was innocent."
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2810.34,2816.629,"Well, 2254 gives -- has separate provisions for the legal aspect of that."
2013.12-414,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2816.629,2821.081,"First of all, did anybody make the argument as clearly as you have made it?"
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2834.739,2836.257,Not that I'm aware of.
2013.12-414,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2836.257,2836.791,"No, okay."
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2854.385,2865.526,It's just a factual argument trying to respond to the Court's questions about what happened in this case and about what is contained in the record and what Mr. Toca did say on the record.
2013.12-414,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2865.526,2871.68,If I could move beyond the particular facts to some of the broader points that the Solicitor General has raised.
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2904.318,2912.591,"Mr. Chief Justice, there is no question the Sixth Circuit in dicta said that we don't require it, but it exists in this case."
2013.12-414,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2934.337,2938.039,So you think the Sixth Circuit was wrong in what you are characterizing as dicta?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2945.728,2951.216,"I don't think -- No, I don't think that any particular rule should be adopted."
2013.12-414,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2960.838,2967.991,"Well, I thought -- maybe I'm misremembering, but the Sixth Circuit distanced it itself from the other circuits, didn't it?"
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2967.991,2972.045,"Yes, it did distance itself by stating--"
2013.12-414,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2972.045,2974.162,"Now, you are telling me that all the circuits have always done this."
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,2976.764,2990.674,"--It may think it is doing something different, but in this particular case there was objective evidence that they pointed to and, as the Solicitor General mentioned, there's always going to be sentencing disparity because you're going to have to have a sentencing disparity in order to show prejudice."
2013.12-414,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2999.28,3003.915,"Well, if there is always going to be objective evidence, that's like saying you don't have to have corroboration."
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3003.915,3024.145,"--Well, for this Court -- my point is obviously the Court can -- can set forth a rule, but in doing so I think we are going to run into what Justice Sotomayor said earlier in terms of judges do this all the time, they -- they figure out who's credible."
2013.12-414,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3040.874,3045.51,"So the Sixth Circuit was wrong when it said, we are doing something different than the other circuits?"
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3045.51,3050.479,They certainly did not do anything different in this case.
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3070.793,3075.78,Can I ask you about Mr. -- Mr. Toca's ethical lapses?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3079.899,3084.803,They certainly speak to his credibility.
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3185.684,3192.488,In what sense is his credibility -- did his credibility figure in the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3192.488,3194.107,"--Well, it didn't."
2013.12-414,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3201.963,3212.919,"Do you know if the Michigan Court of Appeals was ever presented with this argument that, in fact, he gave the advice that he did because of the peculiar fee arrangement that he had?"
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3212.919,3225.661,"They were specifically presented with the conflict argument and off the top of my head, I apologize, I don't recall if that is specifically contained in there, but I think it was."
2013.12-414,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3230.88,3233.832,"And Mr. Toca is now, remind me, disbarred for?"
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3233.832,3234.265,Disbarred.
2013.12-414,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3234.265,3235.367,Forever?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3235.367,3236.184,Yes.
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3250.694,3253.079,What was submitted to the Michigan Court of Appeals?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3258.933,3262.085,"Yes, in Michigan it's called a motion to remand."
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3269.088,3273.225,"It's not in the habeas record, it's not in the record of the Federal Court."
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3277.694,3278.061,--Yes.
2013.12-414,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3278.061,3278.577,This motion?
2013.12-414,2,43652,valerie_r_newman,,3278.577,3280.51,"Absolutely, yes."
2013.12-414,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3335.93,3338.116,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-414,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3340.449,3347.471,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-414,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3535.043,3536.895,I -- I--
2013.12-414,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3536.895,3539.947,That's the objective evidence.
2013.12-414,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3539.947,3542.215,--I -- I don't understand what you're saying.
2013.12-414,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3546.933,3547.452,Correct.
2013.12-414,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3547.452,3550.102,And what you're saying is they didn't do that here.
2013.12-414,3,29018,john_j_bursch,,3556.391,3558.091,Here's -- yeah.
2013.12-414,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3627.254,3627.72,"Thank you, counsel."
