1994.93-7659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.047,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-7659, Louise Harris v. Alabama."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,16.012,20.105,"Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-7659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,85.859,88.042,"Well, that certainly isn't technically correct, is it?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,95.776,97.888,"That's correct, the jury does not have final authority--"
1994.93-7659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,97.888,98.689,So it's not like Florida.
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,98.689,99.75,--It is like Florida.
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,181.592,186.925,"On the facts of this case, can you tell me, for the four defendants were there four different juries?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,186.925,187.856,That's correct.
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,193.419,194.04,All right.
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,198.324,199.674,Sockwell.
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,199.674,200.235,--was the trigger man?
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,202.876,203.667,That's correct.
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,203.667,207.08,"What was the division there, was it 7 to 5 as well?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,207.08,207.548,"Yes, it was."
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,207.548,209.761,But a different jury than Harris' jury?
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,209.761,210.26,That's correct.
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,210.26,210.941,Thank you.
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,210.941,219.877,"That's correct, and it's impossible to tell, based on what this judge did, why this jury was rejected, the jury's verdict was rejected in Mrs. Harris' case."
1994.93-7659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,225.791,228.221,I take it that's consistent with Alabama law.
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,235.308,245.994,"--And that's... that's exactly right, and that's why Mrs. Harris is here today, because what Alabama law has done is, in essence, created a dual sentencing system, but done nothing to regulate the relationship between the sentencers."
1994.93-7659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.994,254.9,"Well, you call it a dual sentencing system, but the statute says, while the jury's recommendation concerning sentence shall be given consideration, it is not binding upon the court."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,261.194,263.976,"The statute does not require any more, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1994.93-7659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,263.976,266.697,What's your authority for thinking the Constitution requires any more?
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,266.697,273.662,Because this Court's jurisprudence under the Eighth Amendment has always said that procedures by which a death penalty is imposed must be reliable.
1994.93-7659,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,282.639,292.266,"If a jury were out of this picture entirely and you just had a judge with the standards that the judge has given, there would be no constitutional infirmity."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,292.266,293.495,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.93-7659,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,309.206,309.967,"Well, isn't--"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,325.715,327.588,That's right.
1994.93-7659,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,335.773,337.144,What's the least?
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,337.144,363.181,"The least standard might be that the jury's verdict is rejected if there's some reasonable basis for rejecting that, or if no reasonable person could differ that life was not the appropriate punishment, or another minimal basis could be that the jury's verdict was itself considered a mitigating factor, as some of the courts have done in Alabama, because they literally do not know how to factor this jury verdict into the sentencing consideration."
1994.93-7659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,363.181,366.734,Why... what about just disagreeing with the jury?
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,381.492,386.858,"The jury is not required under Alabama law to specify aggravation in mitigation, though there is no reason in this case--"
1994.93-7659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.858,388.947,"So it just comes in and says, we recommend life?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,401.456,408.369,"--Justice Scalia, I disagree would be, I weigh the aggravation differently against the mitigation to come up with a different... a different response."
1994.93-7659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.432,414.063,"Doesn't he say that implicitly simply by saying, in my view the death penalty is the right one?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,414.063,417.396,But Alabama law requires the judge to do something else.
1994.93-7659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,427.534,430.085,"No, it doesn't require... it requires that he consider it."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,430.085,432.335,And our contention is--
1994.93-7659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,432.335,432.856,And he did.
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,433.928,436.549,--He... this trial judge did say that he considered the verdict.
1994.93-7659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.549,439.13,"And he disagreed with it, evidently."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,439.13,440.192,He clearly must have disagreed with it.
1994.93-7659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,440.192,442.282,What more could be possibly have said--
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,442.282,442.663,Because--
1994.93-7659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.663,447.315,"--to show why he disagreed with it, since he didn't know the basis on which it was... itself was made?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,447.315,455.53,"--He said nothing about what may have been improper about this verdict, and when there are two sentencers, which Alabama has created, I consider it simply not constitutionally sufficient."
1994.93-7659,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,479.116,479.777,Ms. Friedman--
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,508.966,523.145,"Because the Eighth Amendment requires some guided discretion of the sentencer, and here we have... a second sentencer has to evaluate the judgment of the first sentencer and has absolutely no idea how to take that into consideration, which allows for arbitrariness, and that's evidenced by--"
1994.93-7659,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,523.145,528.229,No more arbitrary than if the judge were alone during the sentence.
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,528.229,532.721,"--And if the judge were alone during the sentence, Justice Ginsburg, we wouldn't have an issue here."
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,572.629,577.571,Is your client somehow worse off because a jury made a recommendation of life?
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,577.571,581.345,"She's worse off under the scheme that... yes, that Alabama has created."
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,581.345,582.584,"I.e., worse off than if there had been no jury at all?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,582.584,587.319,"But we cannot look, Justice Kennedy, at the scheme as if there is no jury."
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,587.319,598.465,"Well, if we look at just that, because Justice Ginsburg was asking you what if there were just a judge sitting, and so my question is, is your client really worse off than if there were no jury at all?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,607.171,613.706,I think she would not be worse off if we just had a jury involved in sentencing in Alabama or if we just had--
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,613.706,614.457,"No, that's not my question."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,614.457,614.915,--I'm sorry.
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,614.915,617.438,"My question is, why is she worse off under the present system?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,617.438,620.829,Because she was sentenced to death under a process that was unreliable.
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,626.065,631.047,Why is it less reliable if a judge has an opinion to take into account?
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,631.047,637.181,Because... precisely because the advisory verdict of an Alabama jury is not simply an opinion.
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,640.904,642.236,I assume that that's what you're complaining about.
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,646.587,648.2,"--If it was just an opinion, no."
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,650.972,653.974,"Well then, how is she any worse off under this procedure, where it's even more than an opinion?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,657.456,662.038,"--Because it's more of an opinion, Justice Kennedy... because it's more than an opinion."
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,742.271,744.362,"Well, is that a different argument?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,774.692,776.022,"Certainly, Justice Souter."
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,776.022,778.626,"Well, I went back, and here's where I want you to help me out."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,846.768,848.531,I think there are differing legal standards.
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,850.691,855.126,"Well, can you infer that from the examples that I gave, or am I missing something?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,856.485,859.467,--I think there are other cases which are also useful to look at.
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,886.144,893.281,"Yes, but it doesn't follow from the latter instance that they're not giving it the same weight they would give it if they called it a mitigating circumstance."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,917.724,918.565,That's exactly right.
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,918.565,922.689,"Can you give me... and you don't necessarily have to do it this moment, but you could do it after argument."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,927.641,928.062,Yes.
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,947.784,954.839,"So you're really making kind of an equal protection argument based on disparate legal standards, rather than simply a variety of treatment."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,954.839,956.49,I think we're making both of those arguments.
1994.93-7659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,956.49,970.201,"Or you're making a sort of Furman argument that sentencing shouldn't be flukish, and that it's flukish unless all of the judges are treating the jury's recommendation the same way."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,970.201,975.184,"It is flukish, Justice Scalia, because Alabama has announced no standard to guide the discretion, that's exactly right."
1994.93-7659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.184,983.408,But the same flukishness occurs whenever you allow a jury or a judge sentencer to take account of mitigating circumstances.
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1004.733,1006.105,Alabama--
1994.93-7659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1006.105,1010.566,"And I would say in Lockett that that's not only okay, but it's required, at least... well."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1010.566,1016.781,"--I think we have a very different system here, Justice Scalia, than just the consideration of aggravation and mitigating factors."
1994.93-7659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1019.382,1029.709,May I ask you if you think the provision of the two sentencers as you describe them actually increases or decreases the likelihood of a death sentence across the uniform... the universe of cases in Alabama?
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1029.709,1032.601,--I'm not sure it's possible to say whether it increases or decreases.
1994.93-7659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1032.601,1037.263,"Well, one might ask, which way does the override more frequently go?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1037.263,1045.178,"There's no question, 95 percent of the overrides in the State are life-without-parole verdicts of a jury overridden to death."
1994.93-7659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1045.178,1049.732,"Whereas if a jury does return a recommendation of death, normally the judge accepts that?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1049.732,1052.214,"That's absolutely right, Justice Stevens."
1994.93-7659,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1052.214,1073.928,"Do we have any indication... we don't have any indication of how many times the jury recommends life and the judge leaves it alone, although he might come in, if he were left without the jury, might have imposed a death sentence on his own."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1086.084,1093.57,"We don't know the answer to that question, but I don't think we can talk about whether the system favors defendants when the system has a built-in arbitrary aspect to it."
1994.93-7659,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1093.57,1117.736,"What did... the Alabama supreme court, at least it said this statute makes the jury recommendation advisory only, and courts have had experiences with advisory-only juries, but you're saying in the death context an advisory-only jury is inherently arbitrary?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1117.736,1119.937,It's... not necessarily.
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1150.017,1152.038,What's the rule in an equity court?
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1152.038,1154.87,"I'm afraid I don't know the rule in equity court, Justice--"
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1154.87,1155.811,Do you know whether there is a rule?
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1155.811,1156.882,--I don't know the answer to that.
1994.93-7659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1156.882,1162.015,"Ms. Friedman, did you raise your equal protection claim before the supreme court of Alabama?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1162.015,1165.939,"We raised a Fourteenth Amendment and an Eighth Amendment claim, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1994.93-7659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1165.939,1175.443,"But with the Fourteenth Amendment, was that just because the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the Eighth Amendment, or was it in so many words a reliance on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1175.443,1177.726,We did not rely specifically on the Equal Protection Clause.
1994.93-7659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1177.726,1180.158,"Well then you can't raise an Equal Protection Clause here, claim here."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1180.158,1181.878,I don't know that we have to separate--
1994.93-7659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1181.878,1187.42,"Well, but you answered Justice Souter's question, I thought, that you were raising an equal protection claim here."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1187.42,1189.531,--Perhaps I understood exactly what question I was being asked.
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1281.762,1292.809,"If we assume that that's true, then reweighing by the Alabama appellate court is insufficient?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1292.809,1294.762,"It is insufficient, and for two reasons."
1994.93-7659,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1323.901,1325.761,I was referring to the intermediate appellate court.
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1325.761,1329.684,"And that's true for the intermediate appellate court as well, Justice Kennedy."
1994.93-7659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1412.528,1440.147,"What is your response to the State's argument that the history in Alabama shows that juries were predisposed to acquit white defendants of murdering black victims, or committing crimes against them, the jury's prejudice would tilt the scales in favor of the white defendant, and that they needed the judge override to override life... arbitrary recommendations of life in that category of cases?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1441.787,1459.709,"--Certainly the judge can form that... can provide that role if the Alabama supreme court were to announce such a standard as racial prejudice, if there was some evidence or suggestion of racial prejudice, or some other kind of improper action on the part of the jury, but that has not happened."
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1490.839,1491.229,Excuse me.
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1499.424,1501.297,--It could be a legitimate object.
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1501.297,1502.556,--it simply came down in the wrong way?
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1502.556,1504.429,It absolutely could be a legitimate object.
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1504.429,1520.377,"So on your... going back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg, in which you thought one standard might be that the judge could not override unless no reasonable jury could have come to the conclusion that the trial jury did, you would make it more difficult for the judge to perform that function."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1520.377,1523.61,I'm not sure I understand exactly where Your Honor's going.
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1523.61,1541.441,"Well, you... you accept the legitimacy, I guess, of the State's argument that one of the justifications for this scheme is that there tends to be a racial prejudice in favor of white defendants, and I go back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg's first question in which she said, well, what might the standard be?"
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1569.35,1570.141,I don't think so.
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1573.512,1581.269,It's pretty tough to meet a standard that requires a finding that no reasonable jury could have concluded as they did.
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1582.878,1585.36,"--Well, I use that language because it was language in Tedder."
1994.93-7659,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1587.473,1590.384,Tedder required just clear and convincing demonstration.
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1590.384,1591.273,That could be a standard as well.
1994.93-7659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1628.639,1629.708,"Very well, Ms. Friedman."
1994.93-7659,0,39261,ruth_friedman,,1629.708,1630.199,Thank you.
1994.93-7659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1630.199,1631.621,"Mr. Bjurberg, we'll hear from you."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,1631.621,1635.863,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-7659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.901,1712.104,Is it correct--
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,1712.104,1713.013,--to sentence others differently from--
1994.93-7659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1713.013,1721.509,"--Is it correct, as Justice Scalia put it in one of his questions, that your basic position is that if the judge disagrees with the jury that's a sufficient basis for a different result?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,1721.509,1743.234,"--Yes, because the judge is the sentencer, and as the sentencer, under the Eighth Amendment... we have to keep in mind we're on the sentencing side of the Eighth Amendment business, which as I understand this Court's precedents allows for discretion, and this Court's been very careful to... any procedure that cuts back that discretion has been found to violate Eddings and Lockett."
1994.93-7659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1743.234,1761.045,"Is... do you agree with your opponent's view of what the statistics would show that if a jury recommends death, in 95 percent of the cases the judge will accept the recommendation, whereas if the jury recommends life, there are a substantial number of cases in which the judge will disagree and act independently, impose death?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,1761.045,1776.597,"To date I believe we have approximately 26 cases in which the judge has chosen to sentence to death over a life-without-parole recommendation, so I don't... we have... approximate--"
1994.93-7659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1776.597,1782.931,Two or three where the judge has set aside the... has imposed a life sentence on the jury?
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,1782.931,1784.351,--I cited two or three in the brief.
1994.93-7659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1797.62,1808.276,"Well, but could you tell us in that period where you had 26 overrides, how many cases, capital cases were there... potential capital cases were there in which there was no override?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,1808.276,1808.777,No override?
1994.93-7659,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1820.945,1824.626,A sentence where the jury recommended life and the jury left it alone.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,1824.626,1825.117,Yes.
1994.93-7659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1827.978,1833.133,Even that number would not be significant unless you knew how often the judge independently might have reached a different conclusion.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,1840.087,1855.086,"--Well, not to my knowledge, no, and I'm not sure we could ever know that, frankly, so I take great exception with the argument that Alabama does not have a standard, it does."
1994.93-7659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1877.301,1882.384,"Under your system, can the defendant waive the right to have a jury advisory verdict?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,1882.384,1883.854,"--Yes, sir, it can."
1994.93-7659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.127,1896.564,"And if a defendant does that, is the judge's standard in imposing the death sentence any different than if there had been an advisory verdict of life, namely that in either event the aggravating must outweigh the litigating?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,1896.564,1897.185,--No.
1994.93-7659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1912.665,1926.203,"Suppose it were shown in this case that in County Number 1 a judge says, I accept the advisory verdict unless there's a reasonable grounds for upsetting it."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,1941.894,1957.024,"--No, it would not, because the sentencer is vested with discretion, and that's the essence of the discretionary process and whatever weight the sentencer wishes to give to these various factors that come in in mitigation."
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1957.024,1975.835,"Isn't there a distinction between the discretion to give weight according to what the evidence warrants in a given case on the one hand, and discretion to consider an aspect of the process as either of no value or of great value?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2015.011,2020.004,"Well I... first of all, I don't think the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection issue is before the Court."
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2021.516,2022.385,I grant you it doesn't--
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2022.385,2022.685,--Okay.
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2022.685,2023.867,--but I'd like to know what you would say.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2023.867,2039.597,"The arbitrariness versus discretion is what we're really at, and if Sentencer A says, I accept the jury's verdict and I'm going to give it some weight, is that a different legal standard than saying, well, I... there's a sliding scale here."
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2040.649,2042.109,"Well, let me make it clearer, then."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2042.109,2042.629,--Okay.
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2042.629,2051.375,"In County 1, the judge says, I always accept a jury's recommendation unless no reasonable jury could have come to that conclusion."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2072.467,2079.074,"a) I don't think you have an Eighth Amendment arbitrariness, because what you have is the sentencer giving this particular fact--"
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2079.074,2081.204,"No, no, you're changing my hypo."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2111.276,2125.023,--Perhaps it would be an equal protection problem in that similarly situated defendants are being treated differently.
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2125.023,2133.769,Why shouldn't we consider the same disparity under our nonarbitrariness jurisprudence under the Eighth Amendment?
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2133.769,2140.595,Because I think what you have to look at is how the process in Alabama works.
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2144.077,2144.357,"Well, I am."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2146.979,2149.02,"--Well, that's the crux--"
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2149.02,2153.243,"Doesn't that infect the validity of the standard, of the process under the Eighth Amendment?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2153.243,2155.634,"--Well, I don't think there are different legal standards."
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2156.075,2157.545,"No, but my... stick to my hypo."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2162.697,2168.691,"--Yes, it would be."
1994.93-7659,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2168.691,2171.773,There's one aspect of this case I wish you would address.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2234.135,2245.461,"Well, I think on the basic guilt or innocence, I think a reasonable interpretation of that is, I find that the evidence is sufficient not to grant a motion for a new trial."
1994.93-7659,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2245.461,2258.411,"Isn't that Alabama law, that a judge could not set aside a jury verdict on a question of guilt or innocence unless the motion... or unless there were sufficient to grant a motion for a new trial or a judgment of acquittal under a traditional standard?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2258.411,2259.262,Correct.
1994.93-7659,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2263.864,2267.938,"I have no question about that, that he has to leave the jury verdict of guilty alone."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2278.013,2281.225,--On guilt--
1994.93-7659,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2281.225,2286.33,So I'm speaking about his authority when it comes to sentencing.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2307.792,2330.279,"--Yes, I think it is consistent, because when you go to the sentencing hearing, additional information concerning the defendant, his character and... or her character in this case... and involvement in the crime, in otherwise those mitigating and aggravating circumstances come before the sentencer, the judge, and that judge can then weigh those factors back and forth, and that's what this judge did in this case."
1994.93-7659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2333.23,2340.724,"Well, even without those, I don't suppose it's irrational to say, you know, I'm not sure who did this, but whoever did it deserves the death penalty."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2358.526,2374.548,"--No, there isn't, and in fact I think that's what... the judge said in this particular case, quoting from page 6 of the Joint Appendix, while there is evidence that others were involved, and this defendant did not pull the trigger, her participation was such that but for her there probably would have never been a killing."
1994.93-7659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2382.922,2388.525,I thought that the question here... I'm going back to your statement that there is a standard--
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2388.525,2389.106,Yes.
1994.93-7659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2389.106,2406.227,"--because of the mitigating... and I thought that their point is that the Alabama courts have not told their judges a simple thing: judge, consider this a mitigating factor like the other ones and weigh it, as you would any other mitigating factor."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2450.607,2456.29,"And the question then boils down to, does the Eighth Amendment require that guidance--"
1994.93-7659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2456.29,2457.241,They're not saying a lot of guidance.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2483.428,2490.093,--My response would be that the Alabama supreme court in effect has given that guidance.
1994.93-7659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2490.093,2490.384,Where?
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2509.024,2510.126,"Now, you won't find that case--"
1994.93-7659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2510.126,2510.306,That's what I thought.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2510.306,2518.351,--because the Alabama supreme court has not determined that the advisory verdict is a mitigating circumstance--
1994.93-7659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2518.351,2518.651,Exactly.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2518.651,2519.062,--necessarily.
1994.93-7659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2519.693,2521.536,"Well, is it or isn't it?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2521.536,2530.252,"--It leaves that to the discretion of the sentencer, and we're saying that that dis... that that is the appropriate place to leave that discretion."
1994.93-7659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2530.252,2547.402,"But I thought in answer to a series of questions that Justice Souter and I were posing that you said that if there were different prevailing practices in different counties, on just this sort of legal issue, there would be an Eighth Amendment violation."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2547.402,2551.616,We were hypothesizing different legal standards.
1994.93-7659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2551.616,2559.661,"But haven't we come now from the hypothesis to reality, based on your answers to Judge Breyer's questions, Justice Breyer's questions?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2559.661,2576.791,"No, I don't believe we have, in that we're still saying that the sentencer is free to consider this jury's advisory verdict and consider it in a manner which the Eighth Amendment allows that discretion to do so."
1994.93-7659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2576.791,2613.795,"That happens all the time, even with a finding of guilt, but I suppose one jury might consider that certain facts justify a particular inference, whereas another jury would conclude that those same facts don't justify another inference, and I suppose you'd have an unjust system if the law required in different counties those divergent findings, but not if a jury vested with discretion happens to reach them, and that's what you say is the situation here, that you may indeed have divergences with different judges, but they are not divergences required by law."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2613.795,2615.016,Exactly.
1994.93-7659,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2615.016,2618.097,"Oh, it's exactly, that's interesting, that you find it happens all the time."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2685.093,2713.471,"I don't... I don't think they're different, in that... now, because the sentencer is allowed this broad, Eighth Amendment discretion to consider that advisory verdict as a mitigating circumstance, and another sentencer might consider that advisory verdict as not arising to that particular level, in other words, but that's inherent in discretion."
1994.93-7659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2719.465,2725.268,This judge can presumably give greater degrees of discretion to some juries than to others.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2727.61,2731.153,He can... yes.
1994.93-7659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2734.055,2739.126,"Having sat with this jury for a certain amount of time, he may have some views as to how good the jury is."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2739.126,2744.59,--And he might have some view as to whether or not the life-without-parole recommendation is a compromise verdict.
1994.93-7659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2745.481,2748.303,"Any rule would eliminate that degree of discretion, wouldn't it?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2750.954,2751.775,"--Yes, I think it would."
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2753.176,2755.259,"--Well, there are two... again, there are two discretions involved."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2809.834,2812.385,"--Yes, I would think so."
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2812.385,2822.722,"And the discretion about how much weight to give the jury's verdict is inherent in the function of weighing evidence, but the discretion of... I'm sorry, I'm putting it badly."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2851.461,2854.032,But in Alabama we don't have two different legal standards.
1994.93-7659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.032,2855.083,You don't have any legal standard.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2859.184,2860.967,Except to consider it.
1994.93-7659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2860.967,2862.236,Except to consider it.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2862.236,2863.758,"The statute says, consider this."
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2866.831,2881.891,"Then do... is there not at least an obligation for the State to say, you should not, judges, give this a kind of prima facie weight simply by virtue of the fact that it's a jury recommendation?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2894.279,2900.533,"--The question is, does the Eighth Amendment require that?"
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2900.533,2901.463,"That's right, and--"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2901.463,2902.564,And... but imposing--
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2902.564,2918.643,"--if the Eighth Amendment doesn't require that, then the door is open for the imposition not merely of different weights to give a verdict, but different standards for judging what the verdict of a given weight is worth, isn't that so?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2918.643,2920.776,"--Well, perhaps the best way I know how to answer--"
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2920.776,2921.317,Isn't that so?
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2927.021,2932.695,"--Yes, it would be open to that."
1994.93-7659,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2932.695,2941.968,Is there any indication in this case that the sentencing judge gave any prima facie weight beyond just considering it to this jury's verdict?
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2941.968,2942.98,"No, there isn't."
1994.93-7659,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2942.98,2944.84,"In fact, would you--"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2949.835,2953.338,"In a different case, Coral, or Coral, he did."
1994.93-7659,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2953.338,2955.819,Said that was his normal practice?
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,2958.921,2990.671,"I think it's fair to say he did not give great weight, because in other sentencing recommendations that this particular judge has written, he has said, I give the jury's recommendation great weight, but that was based on the facts of that particular case, and in Coral at least the defendant proffered the jury's life-without-parole recommendation as a mitigating circumstance, and the residual doubt, as in... because of the length of the deliberations of the jury concerning the sentence, as mitigation."
1994.93-7659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2990.671,3014.988,"I suppose if a case is tried to a judge instead of to a jury on the guilt phase, a judge... one judge could say, you know, I consider this factor crucial, and another judge could say, I consider this factor of no significance, and that wouldn't render the State's system arbitrary or unconstitutional, would it?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3014.988,3015.707,"No, it wouldn't."
1994.93-7659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3017.73,3019.059,"Well, then I'm not sure if--"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3021.672,3022.061,"Yes, sir."
1994.93-7659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3022.061,3028.085,"Well, then I'm not sure why you concede that there would be an Eighth Amendment violation, under our earlier hypothesis."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3028.085,3037.352,Because as I understood it we were hypothesizing different legal standards to be applied by the sentencer when considering it.
1994.93-7659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3037.352,3049.259,"Well, if the law in effect says a judge can do what you say the law... what the judges in reality do, what difference does it make?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3055.925,3063.408,"Well, because if you have... well, the discretion is in the sentencer."
1994.93-7659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3075.746,3084.773,"And you do not concede that merely the perception of different legal standards is enough to render it unconstitutional, or do you concede that?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3084.773,3086.535,"No, I don't, absolutely not."
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3086.535,3089.796,"Could you tell me... I just don't... I should know this, and I don't."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3103.215,3107.487,Not to my remembrance.
1994.93-7659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3107.487,3121.898,"If thee were an Eighth Amendment violation of the sort that we've been discussing, would it be cured by the independent reweighing that the appellate court did at page 101 of the transcript?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3121.898,3125.589,"I believe so, and let me clarify that."
1994.93-7659,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3132.464,3133.814,Yes.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3138.97,3141.51,"And in Alabama, the appellate courts, both the--"
1994.93-7659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3141.51,3144.752,Does the appellate court give any weight at all to the judge's determination of the sentence?
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3144.752,3148.483,"--What the appellate court reviews, Justice Stevens, is the death sentence."
1994.93-7659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3148.483,3154.928,"I understand, but when it does that review, does it adopt any sort of presumption that the judge was right?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3154.928,3157.6,"No presumption, no, sir."
1994.93-7659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3157.6,3159.793,"It just starts from scratch, as though it were the original sentencer?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3159.793,3160.391,"It does, yes."
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3160.391,3162.153,As if it were the jury?
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3165.326,3168.168,It doesn't.
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3171.029,3177.575,"Well, but it place... I take it, it places itself in effect in the position of the jury but not the position of the judge?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3177.575,3179.375,"No, I think it--"
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3179.375,3181.615,"That can't be right, because it considers the presentence report, doesn't it?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3181.615,3181.986,--Yes.
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3189.181,3194.064,But does the appellate... the appellate court then considers the jury verdict in some sense.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3194.064,3201.55,"--In the sense... yes, in the sense that it's reviewing the death sentence, the imposition of the death sentence, and if they find--"
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3201.55,3212.868,"But it does not articulate the standard it uses to determine whether any particular prima facie weight is to be given to the jury recommendation, or whether no prima facie weight should be given."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3212.868,3213.519,"--Right, it did not."
1994.93-7659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.519,3219.721,"Does it just merely say in our opinion the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating, ergo the death sentence is proper?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3219.721,3221.554,No.
1994.93-7659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3229.587,3240.764,"No, assuming no procedural error, but just on the ultimate determination, is it just a totally de novo determination that in the judgment of the appellate tribunal the aggravating outweigh mitigating and that's the end of it?"
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3240.764,3241.876,Yes.
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3241.876,3245.038,What does it do with the presentence report?
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3247.699,3252.432,"It... yes, it would consider that in this process of the appellate weighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances."
1994.93-7659,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3252.432,3253.814,"Okay, but that's more than just reweighing."
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3259.538,3261.829,"Yes, and that's why I wanted to get away from the term, reweighing."
1994.93-7659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3283.603,3284.922,Let me just ask one last question.
1994.93-7659,1,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3292.018,3298.223,"--Compromise in the sense that, Justice Stevens, it took them approximately 25 minutes to reach a sentencing decision in this."
1994.93-7659,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3323.138,3324.43,"Thank you, Mr. Bjurberg."
1994.93-7659,2,39261,ruth_friedman,,3327.131,3348.034,"To respond to the earlier questions about appellate review, the Alabama supreme court does not see itself as having the authority to impose a sentence de novo, or to do that kind of reweighing analysis whenever independent of some kind on error below."
1994.93-7659,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3357.621,3365.476,"The opinion does say, after an independent weighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances."
1994.93-7659,2,39261,ruth_friedman,,3369.469,3372.591,It's not a de novo review of the evidence below.
