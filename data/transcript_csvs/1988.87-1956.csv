1988.87-1956,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.856,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1956, Anthony M. Frank, Postmaster General v. The Minnesota Newspaper Association."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,12.308,16.426,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,140.491,147.561,"Well, if you exclude news stories and editorials, what kind of a... what have you got left?"
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,147.561,160.154,"What you have left, Your Honor, is the type of prize list that this Court addressed in the Horner case, and that shows up in some of the examples we've reprinted in the appendix to our brief."
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,212.17,218.091,This was... these were just separate lists mailed... sent through the mails to addressees.
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,218.091,218.757,Correct.
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,231.315,234.95,"Well, but... but I thought the ads were already out of the case."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,234.95,240.17,The... the... the constitutionality of the advertisement clause is out of the case.
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,242.003,245.205,"But if you buy space in the newspaper to publish your prize list, isn't that an ad?"
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,245.205,256.013,"--Not necessarily, no, because Congress adopted two different clauses in the statute because I think it saw that there were two different types of promotional materials being used."
1988.87-1956,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,309.981,311.933,"But, Mr. Larkin, I'm still a little puzzled."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,314.135,316.504,"They could be, yes."
1988.87-1956,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,316.504,318.737,"Well, yes, but... but now they have to pay to do it."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,318.737,320.789,Yes.
1988.87-1956,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,321.706,322.824,Then it's an ad.
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,322.824,325.026,"--No, it would not necessarily be an add."
1988.87-1956,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,325.026,331.013,"Well, have you got an example anywhere in the world of such a list being published by a newspaper without... when it was paid for and it was not an ad?"
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,331.013,342.036,"Well, the one we've reprinted at pages 11a to 12a, the one from the Louisiana Lottery, was called an ad by the Postal Service at the time, but it contained a list of prizes."
1988.87-1956,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,343.254,344.338,But it wasn't in a newspaper.
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,344.338,344.954,"--Yes, it was."
1988.87-1956,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,344.954,346.106,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,347.206,363.216,"See, both of these types of promotional materials... the one we have, for example, at page 13a, which is just basically a little flyer about the Louisiana Lottery would be seen as an advertisement in the period, like letting people know the lottery existed."
1988.87-1956,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,372.238,380.409,But just how were the prize lists... they were... were they a flyer in the newspaper or reprinted on some page of the newspaper?
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,380.409,382.928,They... they could occur in both ways.
1988.87-1956,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,450.452,470.782,"And yet, the... your illustration of the Louisiana State Lottery under the personal supervision and management of General G. I. Beauregard and General Jubal A. Early of Virginia, rather prominent figures in the 19th century."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,470.782,471.482,Absolutely.
1988.87-1956,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,483.792,484.825,And they lent their names.
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,484.825,485.809,Correct.
1988.87-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.978,590.511,How do we know that?
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,621.764,622.7,I have several--
1988.87-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.7,626.984,"I mean, it seems to me that you are... you are dealing in an anachronism here."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,641.327,650.433,"--I don't suggest that the Congress that passed this statute was thinking in terms of the... you know, the four-part Central Hudson test or any of the other cases that this Court has decided."
1988.87-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.478,669.763,Concerned about their being promoted commercially or otherwise.
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,681.737,688.308,"--Well, it's possible that if you had a different set of facts before Congress, they would have been concerned about that."
1988.87-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,800.962,801.73,"Mr. Larkin, suppose I disagree with you."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,815.588,820.608,"--Well, if the statute is limited so that it applies only to commercial speech--"
1988.87-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,820.608,827.262,"No, I'm saying it's written to apply to everything, but it's... it's unconstitutional insofar as it extends beyond commercial speech."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,828.048,837.737,"--Well, the statute still cannot be held facially unconstitutional, which is the ruling below, the one we are challenging, unless it is substantially overbroad, and we don't think it meets that test."
1988.87-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,837.737,854.163,"Or why couldn't we adopt a new rule that in addition to being substantially overbroad... if it's overbroad in a fashion that can be limited very clearly, as most... most overbroad statutes can, where the only overbreadth consists of extending beyond commercial speech."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,865.304,873.66,"We think you can, and we ask in this case for the district court's judgment which dealt only with the facial constitutionality of the statute to be reversed."
1988.87-1956,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,894.823,901.66,Tell... tell us again what the prize list clause covers that the advertising clause doesn't cover.
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,901.66,914.404,"The prize list clause covers circumstances in which you offer a prize in... for entry in the lottery, and the advertising clause covers other types of commercial promotion."
1988.87-1956,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,914.404,916.537,"Well, now... now, wait a minute."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,927.211,931.263,It... there is some overlap between the two.
1988.87-1956,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,931.263,931.865,"Well, exactly."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,938.769,948.591,"The prize list clause would reach the case where you just basically have the list of prizes that the lottery is being... that the lottery is offering, perhaps with the title of the lottery, like the--"
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,948.591,949.058,Where?
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,952.677,960.015,"--Well, prize lists were... were used in circulars and other types of promotional materials."
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.015,971.573,"So, it would be mailings of prize lists that don't appear in the newspapers, for example, but there could be prize lists, I take it, that would be in the newspaper that you think the prize list clause would cover."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,971.573,973.34,"Yes, I agree with Your Honor."
1988.87-1956,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,978.56,984.964,But why wouldn't the advertising clause cover a prize list that appears in a newspaper and is paid for by some sponsor?
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,984.964,992.987,Because we don't think Congress intended the prize... excuse me... the advertisement clause just to be limited... to reach in that manner.
1988.87-1956,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.987,993.704,Why not?
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,993.704,1004.544,"In adopting a... well, by adopting a separate prize list clause, it seems that Congress thought it was dealing with two somewhat overlapping but, nonetheless, somewhat distinct types of promotional materials."
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.544,1009.865,"Well, I would think... that's pretty fine."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1031.112,1031.879,That's right.
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1042.086,1050.156,"Now, if the... if there's a news story on the front page of the paper saying here is... here are the prizes that this new lottery will offer."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1066.702,1068.654,"No, a bona fide news story is not."
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.654,1069.587,Well--
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1069.587,1076.408,We don't think that the statute should be read to prevent the press from reporting about factual events and--
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.408,1077.308,"--Well, not... not events."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1081.878,1083.413,--That's right.
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.413,1083.979,Here's the list.
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1083.979,1094.685,"It's an event to occur in the future and we don't think that the prize list clause properly construed should apply to simple, straightforward news stories in the manner--"
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1094.685,1104.243,Or a news story that says... a news story that sums up and makes a great list of the prizes that have been won in the last year in the lottery.
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1104.243,1105.21,--Correct.
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1116.368,1116.785,That's covered.
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1116.785,1117.785,--That would be covered.
1988.87-1956,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1130.192,1132.16,But the example you just gave is not an ad.
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1132.16,1134.012,Correct.
1988.87-1956,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1140.833,1144.952,"And if it says this is an advertisement paid for by the XYZ Lottery Company, it's still not an ad."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1148.872,1154.343,"Well, we're trying to be faithful to this fact that there are two separate clauses in the statute, and--"
1988.87-1956,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.343,1158.378,"Well, you've already got some... some coverage for the prize... for the prize clause: circulars."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1158.378,1164.281,"--That's right, but we think if you use the same material that goes in the circular in a newspaper, it would be covered there too."
1988.87-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.281,1166.4,"Mr. Larkin, I'm not sure you have circulars."
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1211.846,1212.346,Well--
1988.87-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.346,1221.468,I don't see the meaning of the first clause if... if you're reading this one the way you do to cover something put into an envelope to a private individual.
1988.87-1956,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1221.468,1225.606,"--Well, let... let me explain then if... the difference here between the two."
1988.87-1956,1,37847,p_cameron_devore,,1543.237,1548.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-1956,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1575.708,1579.577,But you're not willing to have the entire judgment vacated.
1988.87-1956,1,37847,p_cameron_devore,,1579.577,1590.301,"We are willing to have the entire judgment vacated, Justice Kennedy, but I think the Court in doing so should explain the logic used by the Court in reaching that point."
1988.87-1956,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.177,1658.112,"Well, don't you... why don't you defend that?"
1988.87-1956,1,37847,p_cameron_devore,,1658.112,1663.147,"Well, I have... would have no doubt, Justice White, that if--"
1988.87-1956,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1663.147,1664.099,The government concedes that--
1988.87-1956,1,37847,p_cameron_devore,,1664.099,1664.583,--this applied--
1988.87-1956,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.583,1669.568,"--The government concedes that if you construe it to cover that, it's unconstitutional."
1988.87-1956,1,37847,p_cameron_devore,,1669.568,1673.455,--They did construe that... they did concede that here today to the Court in oral argument.
1988.87-1956,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.455,1674.522,Why do you want that vacated?
1988.87-1956,1,37847,p_cameron_devore,,1674.522,1694.785,"Well, I would be pleased to have a... an eloquent holding of the Court that an... another holding of the Court, because there are many that the Court has done in the past, that a statute which would purport to apply to news and editorial copy would meet... would not meet the strict scrutiny test which I think was held by the district court."
1988.87-1956,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.308,1709.628,xxx left of the prize clause that if you eliminate news stories and editorials?
1988.87-1956,1,37847,p_cameron_devore,,1709.628,1710.962,I'm not sure I know the answer to that.
1988.87-1956,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2594.624,2596.441,"Just a few points, Your Honor."
1988.87-1956,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2662.183,2664.702,"Thank you, Mr. Larkin."
