1994.93-1128,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.098,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-1128, Jesse Brown, Secretary of Veterans Affairs v. Fred P. Gardner."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,11.71,17.354,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,58.801,64.473,"During most of that period there was no opportunity for judicial review of that judgment, is that right?"
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,64.473,65.893,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-1128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,79.844,84.799,"Well, that would presumably mean that what was being done pleased the then-current committees of Congress."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,90.455,123.184,"Well, although we think there is quite a remarkable record of consistency in that regard, since there was a good deal of administration in the twenties, shortly after the enactment, there was a good deal of administration in the thirties, after the reenactment, and there has been a great deal of ongoing administration during the subsequent period... so we believe really that the evidence that Congress has over all of those years expressed no dissatisfaction, in fact no one in Congress, no one else, to our knowledge, has expressed any great dissatisfaction with the core interpretation of section 1151 not to provide benefits for the ordinary, foreseeable results of proper medical care--"
1994.93-1128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.184,123.985,Mr. DuMont--
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,132.072,145.99,"--We would expect the veterans and the committee to object if they thought that the Veterans Administration was applying too narrow a construction of the statute, which is the claim that the respondent makes in this case."
1994.93-1128,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,145.99,150.815,"Well, we would expect them to object, maybe, if there was a good reason for them to do so."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,200.166,203.899,"I think it makes quite a significant practical difference, actually."
1994.93-1128,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,222.873,224.824,But in the early years we just don't know.
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,232.78,234.49,--That's correct.
1994.93-1128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,257.457,275.058,"Mr. DuMont, do we know on the question of numbers, of the unrepresented claimants, and most, if not all, of these were, what percentage prevailed in showing fault or accident?"
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,309.163,340.322,"I'm not aware of another system that has this structure, but I think the entire system of veterans' benefits is unique, but part of what's unique about it is that it is meant to be nonadversarial at the initial stages, and I think there is really no evidence... despite the allegations from respondent, there's no evidence that the claims adjudicators at the VA don't do a proper job of trying to develop the facts of these cases when they're presented and try to figure out whether there was fault on the part of the VA, or some fault that comes within the meaning of the statute."
1994.93-1128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,340.322,345.077,"But the burden is supposed to be on the claimant, the unrepresented claimant, to prove the fault."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,345.077,346.406,"Well, that's not... not really true."
1994.93-1128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,372.467,375.937,But the claimant loses unless fault is shown.
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,375.937,385.834,"The plaintiff cannot... the claimant cannot require... recover benefits unless there is some showing of fault or an accident within the meaning of the regulations, that's correct."
1994.93-1128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,385.834,386.635,Who must make that showing?
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,386.635,393.11,"It must be... it must be made on behalf of the claimant, that's correct, but--"
1994.93-1128,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.11,416.735,"Mr. DuMont, may I ask you, if we agree with the court below that the statute just doesn't require the proof of negligence, you point to examples such as, well, what about the removal of a lung, and that results in shortness of breath, should that be covered by the statute."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,428.651,430.664,--I certainly think that that's--
1994.93-1128,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,430.664,434.227,Quite apart from any negligence requirement.
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,434.227,436.568,--I certainly think that that is conceivable.
1994.93-1128,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,489.998,503.097,"Well, that's why I'm asking the question, because it seems to me that quite apart from any requirement of finding negligence on the part of the hospital, there may be other requirements in the statute to be met for coverage."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,503.097,503.886,"Well, we think that's quite right."
1994.93-1128,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,521.748,523.451,But that's a separate issue.
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,531.566,535.388,Yes.
1994.93-1128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.388,564.327,"You're saying, if... the Government's case, if I understand it, is there is no recovery even if it is not a common, foreseeable consequence of the operation, but if there is some flukish consequence of the operation you would say there's no recovery unless it's a result of negligence, right, whereas the question that Justice O'Connor puts is a question where it is the foreseeable and normal consequence of the operation."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,564.327,568.31,"And that, of course, is the normal case and the case we have here, but--"
1994.93-1128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.31,570.853,"Well, but that's not the argument you're making."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,592.771,604.331,"--The argument we're making, Justice Scalia, is this: the statute was intended to cover... let me back up, if I may for a minute, to 1924, and what was the situation in 1924."
1994.93-1128,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.299,753.665,"Isn't it possible to interpret that legislative history that you describe as reflecting an intent to have the period when the service-connected disability of a veteran is being treated in hospital as though it were treatment while he was in service, and therefore whatever happened as a result of that would be sort of the equivalent to a service-connected disability itself?"
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,753.665,773.667,"Well, we don't think so, and we don't think so because the question is, what would Congress have intended when it was extending these benefits, and it's perfectly plausible that they intended to cover a veteran for anything that happened as a result of Government fault."
1994.93-1128,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,773.667,780.122,"But to give a specific example of the doctor does the best he can and without neglect, a General Hines... that's quoted in the court of appeals opinion."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,780.122,781.384,That's correct.
1994.93-1128,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,787.636,801.737,"It is consistent with the view that they wanted to more or less treat the period when the former serviceman is in the hospital as though that was military service, so that any consequences of that would be just as though he had been wounded on the battlefield or something like that."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,801.737,824.802,"--One could take that view, but I suggest that by reading the entire legislative history and thinking about what Congress would have had in mind, that would be an unlikely conclusion to reach, because it is simply not plausible that Congress, when they were extending benefits in 1924, thought that what they were doing was saying, not only are we going to... well, remember that they were thinking about service-connected veterans in the first place."
1994.93-1128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,854.5,857.973,"Mr. DuMont, why do you divide it into two categories?"
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,895.952,897.604,"Well, let me focus on that."
1994.93-1128,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,922.274,938.185,"There's a further textual element that you're leaving out, and that is, there's a provision in there specifically referring to the fault of the claimant, so that there is on the face of the text an expression of consciousness of fault, but it was expressed only with respect to the claimant."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,938.185,947.559,"--That's true, but I think it, with respect... that it is of limited significance, because that exclusion for fault of the claimant is one that runs throughout the entire gamut of veterans' benefits statutes."
1994.93-1128,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,947.559,948.721,What does that screen out?
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,956.377,958.85,It could be a variety of things.
1994.93-1128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,973.522,992.155,"Well, suppose the veteran slips when he's... during, in the recovery convalescent period, because he has a cast on, and he slips and falls through no fault of his own and reinjures himself, is he covered?"
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,992.155,1011.999,"--Well, I think that would depend on, if it's through no fault of his own and there is no suggestion there is any fault on the part of the Veterans Administration in the conditions that gave rise to the accident, then it would really be a question of whether that was an accident, something simply unforeseeable that might have happened, and in that case he would recover."
1994.93-1128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1011.999,1014.939,If wilful misconduct--
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1014.939,1015.129,"Now, if he was at fault, or if VA was at fault--"
1994.93-1128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1015.129,1028.618,"--If wilful misconduct does not allow recovery, it seems to me that all other injuries are covered, and all other aggravating conditions."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1028.618,1032.381,"--Well, I really don't think so, and I think one can interpret the language--"
1994.93-1128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1032.381,1034.643,That's the dichotomy the statute sets up.
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1034.643,1046.671,"--Well, one could interpret the statute very broadly to be any factual cause except for wilful misconduct, or one can interpret those same words, I think quite plausibly, to draw a line that says, look, what is this as a result of?"
1994.93-1128,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1064.856,1067.316,I... but that brings you back to Justice Scalia's question.
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1080.514,1087.069,That's exactly the kind of case that would normally be covered under the accident definition of the regulations.
1994.93-1128,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1113.188,1114.139,I can understand that.
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1144.63,1151.816,"We certainly think that's... that's essentially what we're arguing, and we'd be perfectly happy to express it that way as opposed to, through negligence."
1994.93-1128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1160.624,1166.308,--question that you're on when you were responding to Justice Kennedy.
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1172.463,1172.703,That's correct.
1994.93-1128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1172.703,1177.427,"And you don't cover contemplated, foreseeable events unless they're negligent."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1177.427,1178.088,That's correct.
1994.93-1128,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1178.088,1184.653,"Well, there are a whole lot of complications that may occur 10 percent of the time, 20 percent of the time, but say, normally, less than half the time."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1213.073,1224.52,"I think that might be a possible line that the VA could have drawn in interpreting the statute, because we think that the words, ""as a result of"", give plenty of leeway for deciding what it was that Congress was getting at."
1994.93-1128,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1259.405,1266.851,"Well, I thought the line that they had drawn was one based on requirement of negligence on the part of the VA."
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1270.784,1281.071,"The case most often comes up in a posture of somebody... of the question being, was there fault or not fault, and that's most often thought of in terms of negligence of care versus nonnegligence of care."
1994.93-1128,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1302.448,1311.013,"Can I be clear, though, it has to be sufficiently freakish that it would not have normally been covered in the textbooks and that sort of thing?"
1994.93-1128,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1316.427,1327.323,"That's correct, and I think, you know, one good example of that is the recent reconsideration of the accident definition in the case of blood transfusions in the early 1980's that might have transmitted the HIV virus."
1994.93-1128,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1349.528,1351.2,"Very well, Mr. DuMont."
1994.93-1128,1,30820,joseph_m_hannon_jr,,1352.602,1358.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1128,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1437.242,1442.005,"Mr. Hannon, how does this bear on the question that's presented in the petition for certiorari?"
1994.93-1128,1,30820,joseph_m_hannon_jr,,1442.005,1463.95,"It bears on the question that's presented because of the argument of the Veterans Administration that the Court should defer to a so-called longstanding method of interpreting the statute, and their longstanding method of interpreting the statute wasn't even applied accurately in Mr. Gardner's case."
1994.93-1128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.55,1522.63,"Mr. Hannon, could you tell me whether... what is the difference between you and the Government, if the Government's position is taken to be not a requirement of negligence but simply a requirement that the injury not be one of the normal or possible... known to be possible consequences of the medical procedure?"
1994.93-1128,1,30820,joseph_m_hannon_jr,,1526.672,1527.794,"--I would, Your Honor."
1994.93-1128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1538.839,1542.363,What about shortness of breath after removal of a diseased lung?
1994.93-1128,1,30820,joseph_m_hannon_jr,,1542.363,1543.014,There--
1994.93-1128,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1543.014,1545.576,Is that covered?
1994.93-1128,1,30820,joseph_m_hannon_jr,,1545.576,1548.417,"--It is not, and the Department says it's not covered--"
1994.93-1128,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3104.505,3106.207,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1994.93-1128,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3171.761,3191.734,"Mr. DuMont, before you get off the veterans who didn't complain to Congress that this statute should have been cured, once this problem surfaced at two judicial levels, was there any attempt on the part of the Veterans Administration to get a clarifying amendment to the statute?"
1994.93-1128,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3191.734,3195.937,--I believe there was an attempt to get the statute amended.
1994.93-1128,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3198.76,3202.66,In response to the Federal circuit decision.
1994.93-1128,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3202.66,3207.536,"I believe that the VA made a legislative proposal, but certainly nothing was enacted."
1994.93-1128,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3260.269,3265.752,The veteran in a private hospital wouldn't fit into the hypothetical of being similar to being someone in the service.
1994.93-1128,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3265.752,3267.464,"--But again, the question is--"
1994.93-1128,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3267.464,3268.766,I'm not quite sure I understand the thrust of your argument.
1994.93-1128,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3268.766,3281.935,"--Well, again, the question is, what is it that Congress would reasonably be thought to have taken responsibility for, and I think they would have taken responsibility for a range of circumstances that are much the same as those that would have given rise to recovery in the private hospital setting."
1994.93-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3305.01,3332.84,"Mr. DuMont, I was asking you earlier about just the law in general, and I guess we sort of came to the conclusion that you really don't have to establish a separate negligence rule, that it would be enough if you had a rule that any reasonably anticipable consequence, if that is a word, would not be triggered, this compensation."
1994.93-1128,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3355.926,3364.752,"As Justice O'Connor pointed out, there were really three sort of claimed additional disabilities, two of them the board quite clearly found bore no factual relationship to the surgery."
1994.93-1128,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3375.113,3380.185,So to win the case up here we have to agree with you that there is simply a no-negligence test.
1994.93-1128,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3380.185,3381.127,"--Well, I don't think so."
1994.93-1128,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3402.762,3416.113,"Mr. Hannon, I... Mr. DuMont, I thought the Board of Veterans Appeals said that the foot problems were a common, foreseeable result of the surgery."
1994.93-1128,2,22157,edward_c_dumont,,3416.113,3418.824,That's correct.
1994.93-1128,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3482.408,3483.559,"Thank you, Mr. DuMont."
