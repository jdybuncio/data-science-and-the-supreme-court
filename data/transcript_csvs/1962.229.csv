1962.229,0,27728,harvey_b_nachman,,636.357,645.625,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I think that the law is that the transferring courts statute should be the analogous statute."

1962.229,0,27728,harvey_b_nachman,,723.389,734.328,"Yes there is, Mr. Justice Goldberg, but the delay -- the delay was occasioned because the petitioner had hired an attorney from New Jersey."

1962.229,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,902.247,903.193,Right.
1962.229,0,27728,harvey_b_nachman,,903.193,911.047,I was only just saying New York because it's the only port I can think of that's into two -- in two states.

1962.229,0,27728,harvey_b_nachman,,1089.271,1119.143,"Well, from the evidence, it seems that the bags themselves were poor because many of them disintegrated, some were -- from the record, it seems that there was pilferage because of holes, not in the bags of beans, but there were pilferages from cartons in respondent's Exhibit 10, which is in the record, that there was a lot of pilferages in cartons because the cargo was all broken especially in pier â€“ in holds number four."

1962.229,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2218.523,2223.391,Your point is that somebody on the dock simply couldn't see the condition of the bags as they came out of the hold.
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2223.391,2225.928,Came out of the hold.
1962.229,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2225.928,2227.032,So that's the difference it makes.
1962.229,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2229.931,2237.848,Well you would then make any difference whether that [Inaudible] even though the bags were [Inaudible] beans on the ship?
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2243.599,2246.092,"That's my position, Your Honor."
1962.229,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.557,2291.358,"Or, just because the -- just because the bags are -- assuming, assuming [Inaudible] defective bags, and that -- that bag was [Inaudible] just might be impossible for [Inaudible]"
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2291.358,2309.635,"Mr. Justice White, our position is that this condition, if it's existed onboard the vessel, it could make the vessel or it would make the vessel unseaworthy, if the man had been injured on the vessel because of the possession and control, the method has on the vessel."
1962.229,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.635,2322.394,"[Inaudible] and it causes the spillage of the beans on the dock, the ship is liable?"
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2322.394,2326.838,"Because this is something that can be controlled by the ship, the boom, it can be controlled by the ship."
1962.229,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.838,2334.628,[Inaudible]
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2334.628,2338.417,If they know but there's no evidence whatsoever that the ship knew that the bags were defective.
1962.229,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2349.986,2366.967,"[Inaudible] coopers were working aboard the vessel and on pier, sewing [Inaudible]"
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2366.967,2370.137,And those coopers were the employees of the stevedoring contractor.
1962.229,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2370.137,2375.029,"I know, but doesn't this suggest [Inaudible] defective bags aboard ship?"
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2375.029,2375.647,Yes.
1962.229,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2375.647,2376.408,Before [Inaudible]
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2376.408,2377.976,Yes.
1962.229,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2380.718,2393.108,"Mr. Bird, suppose this man was injured by the beans themselves falling, suppose instead of him slipping on the mat, they had hit the dock."
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2406.538,2407.433,No.
1962.229,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2407.433,2407.876,What is the difference?
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2407.876,2413.654,"Because Your Honor, at that point, that is something that was under control of the ship."
1962.229,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2477.7,2491.326,"And under those circumstances, no matter what the negligence of the ship might be, there would be no liability just because he didn't have the obligation to clean it up."
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2491.326,2501.683,"Oh no, Mr. Chief Justice, if there's negligence of the vessel and there's liability but we're not in -- we're not considering there was any negligence on the part of the vessel in this case."
1962.229,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2512.156,2530.445,"Do you remember the case, I forgot the name of it, it was decided by Mr. Justice McReynolds as I recall it, to the effect that -- let's say one of these swinging things that let open and hit a man on the dock, the ship couldn't be held liable because of that [Inaudible]"
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2530.445,2530.741,Well --
1962.229,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2530.741,2532.958,"And as I recall it -- as I recall it, we --"
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2532.958,2538.542,There are two or three cases (Voice Overlap) there are two or three cases.
1962.229,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2661.393,2669.735,I thought Mr. Bird you told me a moment ago there was no question of negligence in this case. It may sue for both unseaworthy --
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2669.735,2670.346,"No, Your Honor --"
1962.229,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2670.346,2678.222,-- and negligence and didn't the court below -- didn't the trial court find that they were -- that it was both unseaworthy and that there was negligence?
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2678.222,2682.428,"Mr. Chief Justice, I must have misunderstood your question."
1962.229,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2689.577,2691.337,We must -- we just misunderstood each other.
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2691.337,2691.557,Yes.
1962.229,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2691.557,2692.036,It's alright.
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2692.272,2701.077,But my contention is that the court had no basis whatsoever to make a finding of negligence.
1962.229,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2730.931,2751.065,"Well, what do you do with Finding 9, which says that the shipowner was negligent in committing the broken and weakened bags to be discharged when it knew or should have known that injury was likely to result to persons in the service of the ship who had to work on and about the spilled beans."
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2751.065,2759.055,"Our position is here that -- as it was in the Circuit Court, that the court, the trial court, had no basis whatsoever to make that finding."
1962.229,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2762.868,2776.981,How about the evidence that Mr. Justice Brennan just called to your attention about them having knowledge of it to the extent that they had these bags being repaired on the ship during the course of the operation.
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2776.981,2788.832,"By the independent stevedoring contractor who was in charge of the operations, but there's no evidence whatsoever that the vessel in any way, in any way had anything to do with this type of work."
1962.229,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2788.832,2803.052,"I thought the court went on the basis -- maybe I'm wrong -- that they couldn't show that these particular beans have either -- have stepped on and fell were the beans that came out of these particular sacks, that's defective."
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2803.052,2804.245,"Well, there was evidence --"
1962.229,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2804.245,2805.446,Wasn't that one of its grounds?
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2805.446,2806.278,"Yes, there was --"
1962.229,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2806.278,2807.723,[Inaudible] grounds?
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2807.723,2825.789,"There was evidence before the Court that there was spillage but there was also that during the process of discharging, a bag fell from about 35 feet high, fell on the dock and spread its contents."
1962.229,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2840.157,2853.278,"Do you mean -- you mean that the [Inaudible] that the evidence that some beans fell, came out of the sacks above, evidence that some of the beans were came from a broken sack?"
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2853.278,2853.56,Yes.
1962.229,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2853.56,2859.73,And they couldn't tell which beans he had slipped on and therefore there's no evidence of negligence.
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2868.774,2869.524,Well --
1962.229,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2869.524,2871.737,"That's the ground, isn't it, but the Court [Inaudible]"
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2871.737,2872.505,That's one of the grounds --
1962.229,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2872.505,2873.315,-- the Court of Appeals.
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2873.315,2875.088,That's one of the grounds for the reversal of Court of Appeals.
1962.229,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2875.088,2880.573,On the ground that there was no negligence because he couldn't show that the particular bean that he happened to fall over.
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2880.573,2880.91,"Well, that was --"
1962.229,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2880.91,2883.288,-- that that had come from the above.
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2883.288,2885.962,"One of the grounds, Mr. Justice Black --"
1962.229,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2885.962,2887.088,Are you standing on that ground?
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2887.088,2888.483,"Oh yes, I also stand on that ground."
1962.229,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2888.483,2889.118,You are?
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,2889.118,2889.949,"Yes, sir."
1962.229,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3098.024,3109.195,What counsel said that -- that he gave you a list of all of his witnesses and that the company never even took the trouble to interrogate any of them?
1962.229,1,15466,antonio_m_bird,,3109.195,3132.26,"After, this is something I might even have to go off the record, I mean, you have to know the problems we have with investigating of these cases in Puerto Rico where this longshoreman have refused to even discuss the cases."
