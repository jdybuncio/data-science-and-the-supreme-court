2019.18-1269,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.36,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1269, Rodriguez versus the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Mr. Reich."
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,8.36,21.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented in this case is what body of law courts should apply to determine ownership of consolidated tax refunds. In our view, the answer to that question is straightforward. Courts should apply state law."
2019.18-1269,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,135.2,142.44,"Before you proceed with that argument, you now said your question presented was about Bob Richards."
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,197.96,205.8,"I think the Bob Richards rule was critical to the Tenth Circuit's decision, and you can tell that both from what the Tenth Circuit said and what the Tenth Circuit did."
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,253.76,254.6,Excuse me.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,286.88,287.12,No.
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,292.0,292.6,"No, no, no --"
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,292.6,293.12,-- that does not --
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,293.12,293.8,-- answer my question.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,305.48,308.92,State law would not deem that sufficient to create an agency relationship.
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,308.92,315.24,"Ahh, that's what the fight's about, whether state law requires something in addition to that?"
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,315.24,319.48,"Well, the -- the overarching fight is as to whether courts should apply the ordinary --"
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,319.48,322.4,"No, I don't want -- I don't an overarching fight."
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,334.68,336.6,"It doesn't say that it trumps the contract agreement, but I think --"
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,336.6,337.12,All right.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,346.88,352.4,It says you look to the contract to determine whether the parties have consented to enter an agency relationship. But --
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,352.4,352.88,All right.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,370.32,391.44,"The Tenth Circuit erred because it -- under state agency law, under the ordinary rules of state agency law, which the Tenth Circuit didn't cite or even purport to apply, the prerequisites for establishing the agency relationship are to -- are that the agents must be vested with both loyalty and control to the principal -- by the principal. The principal must have interim control over the agent."
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,407.48,408.96,Was this argued below?
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,408.96,415.24,"Yes, this was argued in exactly those terms below at every stage of the proceedings."
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,415.24,424.84,"So am I to assume you -- are you arguing that somehow, because of the Bob Richards rule, the court was not paying attention to what the contract did or didn't do?"
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,424.84,425.44,Yes.
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,432.36,436.4,Tell me where the words -- where that -- where in the opinion you see those words.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,436.4,451.92,"On page 18a of the petition appendix in the -- at -- at the end of the paragraph, it says that -- after it says Bob Richards outlines the general framework you must apply, it says that, therefore, as directed by Barnes and Bob Richards, we must look to the terms of the agreement and -- and see whether they unambiguously --"
2019.18-1269,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,451.92,452.8,"Well, it does say that."
2019.18-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,452.8,453.72,"No, it doesn't."
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,459.04,459.48,Yes.
2019.18-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,460.76,461.96,"Well, that -- that's what it says."
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,461.96,464.84,Only as to the question of how does one read a contract.
2019.18-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,465.12,465.32,No.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,523.04,527.24,And there is Colorado law that says that doesn't create an agency.
2019.18-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,527.24,527.32,Good.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,529.2,530.56,That's in our -- that's in our brief --
2019.18-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,530.56,532.2,Where? What page is it? I want to read it.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,532.2,534.32,"In Part II of our brief, we go --"
2019.18-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,534.32,536.68,And what pages should I read?
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,536.68,541.16,"I -- I believe beginning on page 15 of our reply brief, we discuss the requirements --"
2019.18-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,541.16,541.2,Ah.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,541.2,543.08,-- of Colorado law. Starting on page 16 --
2019.18-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,543.08,557.32,"And do you say and, in fact, even though they said, taking into account Colorado law, we think this creates an agency relation; even though they said that, that was wrong as a matter of Colorado law?"
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,557.32,557.6,Yes.
2019.18-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,559.36,559.6,Okay.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,559.6,560.04,-- that they don't look to --
2019.18-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,560.04,566.4,"Now, if they have made a mistake of Colorado law, I guess there is a group that could answer that question."
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,568.6,569.48,But -- but --
2019.18-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,569.48,571.24,They're sitting in Denver. (Laughter.)
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,571.24,575.12,"Yes, Your Honor, but the issue here is not simply that it made a mistake of Colorado law."
2019.18-1269,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,597.68,606.92,Is it enough then for us to say in your view that the Bob Richards rule is not good law and then to send it back?
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,606.92,608.12,I think that --
2019.18-1269,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,608.12,610.12,That's all we would say: Bob Richards.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,624.72,626.76,"I think that's essentially correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-1269,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,667.84,672.84,I guess the other thing we'd have to say as well is that the IRS regs don't speak to this question.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,672.84,673.32,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1269,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,673.32,674.84,The SG's -- the SG's new argument.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,674.84,696.04,"And I think the SG's new argument, it all hinges on the -- on the notion that when a payment -- there's a payment obligation from parent to sub, entitlements to the refund has been vested in the sub, because what they say repeatedly throughout their brief is that the -- the sole office of the regulations in this context is not to alter the parties' underlying ownership rights under state law."
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,775.08,781.56,"How do we write this? Justice Kavanaugh says we say no common law, Bob Richards rule."
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,800.08,800.64,Yeah.
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,800.64,854.0,"I don't -- I -- I will ask the Solicitor General whether they stand by -- they seem even under their test to create a common law rule under the two prongs. So I'll ask them whether creating any kind of federal common law is right or not and they can answer that question. But I don't know how I get to it when they haven't briefed that question, and I don't know how I get to it if I assume that what the -- the Circuit did was what I said, which was to look to the contract to see if it created an agency or debtor/creditor situation. Do I write an opinion that says when you look to the contract, that's what you do, and you apply just general state agency debtor/creditor law?"
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,854.0,856.24,"I think that's exactly what the opinion should say, Your Honor."
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,857.52,861.0,"So we don't need to reach Bob Richards, is what I keep saying."
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,861.0,862.96,"But the -- a -- a few points, Your Honor."
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,868.0,868.44,Why?
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,868.44,869.68,-- literally the question presented in this case.
2019.18-1269,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,869.68,876.56,"Usually, we need adversarial testing before we reach questions that are not implicated by the issues before us."
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,876.56,878.4,"Well, I do think the issue is implicated."
2019.18-1269,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,886.96,908.88,"Well, but, Mr. Reich, it didn't -- it said, you're exactly right, unambiguously, so it says there's a clear statement rule. But then, in its contract analysis, it obviously doesn't apply a clear statement because, in 10 pages of contract analysis, it says some provisions do this, and then, on the other hand, some provisions do that. And then, in the end, we're relying on a default provision in the contract itself."
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,918.04,920.36,"I -- I -- I do think it was, Justice Kagan, in two ways."
2019.18-1269,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,977.12,977.6,I suppose --
2019.18-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,977.6,1009.76,"Why is it just in case we reach the question of federal common law, a matter which, when, I guess, I tried to study it, seems to have evaporated, what is -- why -- why isn't it common sense to say, look, we're talking here about three bank subs and a parent, and they get a tax refund, and the reason they get the tax refund is because of the bank."
2019.18-1269,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1074.52,1077.6,"But I'd like to know, in case we reach that issue, what is it?"
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,1077.6,1078.12,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1269,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1268.6,1269.36,The problem is --
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,1269.36,1270.12,-- grounds for defending.
2019.18-1269,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1270.12,1295.28,"-- we -- we have had no adversarial confrontation on -- on this issue, and we usually don't decide an abstract -- or a question disembodied from the case, that it has to be an actual controversy between the parties. And so you're -- you're -- you present a question; the other side says that's irrelevant to this case."
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,1299.72,1303.64,I think the government had every opportunity to defend this rule.
2019.18-1269,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1307.56,1321.12,"Just to put it another way, though, Mr. Reich, had the government come to us and said we no longer intend to defend the Bob Richards rule, I think we probably wouldn't have thought twice about just -- we would have said, well, then we need to appoint an amicus."
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,1321.12,1341.64,"I think it's a question as to why the government didn't do that in this case if it had no intention of defending the rule on which the Court granted cert. I also think it's notable that the government's brief attempts to cram its new rule into the Bob Richards decision, perhaps in recognition of the fact that that is the question on which the Court granted cert and it needed some basis for grounding its argument in that decision."
2019.18-1269,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1368.92,1370.04,And there's the circuit split.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,1370.04,1371.76,"And there is a circuit split, a 4-3 --"
2019.18-1269,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1371.76,1374.84,And the government benefits from this rule throughout the country.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,1374.84,1375.48,Absolutely.
2019.18-1269,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1376.0,1377.76,And it's manifestly indefensible.
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,1377.76,1379.96,And this is a rule of no small --
2019.18-1269,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1379.96,1382.88,"So -- so their argument suggests, because they're not defending it."
2019.18-1269,0,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,1385.64,1386.92,"Well, that'll be a surprise to us."
2019.18-1269,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1443.36,1455.8,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Huston."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1455.8,1466.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether the parties who made this contract intended the bank to be the equitable owner of the tax refund."
2019.18-1269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1580.48,1594.72,"Mr. Huston, two words you haven't used yet are Bob Richards. What -- what is your position on the extent to which that is implicated in this case? And what is your position on its viability?"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1594.72,1613.24,"Your Honor, we think that Bob Richards -- as the case describes on its facts and as the courts have understood it, it provides a rule for determining who ends up with a tax refund where parties have not made a contract. I would urge the Court to look at page 17a of the Tenth Circuit's opinion."
2019.18-1269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1634.72,1637.0,"I'm sorry, now let's stop."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1654.64,1661.64,"Well, appreciating -- submitting respectfully that the court -- that would be a pure advisory opinion in the context of this case, Your Honor, I'm happy to answer the question."
2019.18-1269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1673.92,1676.52,So you are rejecting the Bob Richards rule?
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1676.52,1678.48,I -- there is -- we -- we certainly think --
2019.18-1269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1678.48,1679.24,Assuming --
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1679.24,1680.2,Yes.
2019.18-1269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1680.2,1687.68,"-- you're right that it applies only when the parties don't have an agreement, you don't think it's right?"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1687.68,1692.24,I do not think that it is correct as a rule of federal common law.
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1705.48,1706.16,"All right, all right."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1706.48,1707.32,-- have subsequently understood Bob Richards --
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1707.32,1740.04,"-- let's just stop there because I think this is what the Chief Justice was trying to get at, and -- and Justice Sotomayor, too. If Bob Richards, as understood by the lower courts, as creating a federal common law rule, to require a clear statement in a contract before a contract will be enforced, contrary to existing state law, do we all agree, can we all agree on one thing, that's wrong?"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1740.04,1746.6,I agree that that rule of -- you would not put a thumb on the scale where the parties have a contract --
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1746.6,1747.08,Okay.
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1747.08,1748.2,-- as we have always --
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1748.2,1748.72,Is that a yes?
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1748.72,1749.88,All right.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1751.52,1752.6,Is that a yes? It's wrong?
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1752.6,1752.96,It's wrong.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1753.76,1754.28,"Did you say -- you said yes, though?"
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1754.28,1757.68,"He said it's wrong. So -- so, if that's the case, counsel -- (Laughter.)"
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1757.68,1760.28,He said it's wrong. I'm not -- I'm not letting him off the hook so fast.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1760.28,1761.48,"No, I'm trying to keep him on."
2019.18-1269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1761.48,1765.56,I'm -- I'm getting wheezy with this back and forth. (Laughter.)
2019.18-1269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1765.56,1766.24,To be clear --
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1766.24,1766.68,Let me just --
2019.18-1269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1766.68,1769.44,-- is -- is your answer to Justice Gorsuch's question yes or no?
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1769.44,1779.68,"The answer to the question is that, where parties have made a contract, ownership of a tax refund is determined pursuant to the terms of the contract."
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1780.08,1784.48,Pursuant to state law without any thumb on the scale by federal common law?
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1784.48,1785.4,"Yes, with -- with --"
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1785.4,1785.6,Okay.
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1804.64,1812.28,"I'm perfectly comfortable to the Court to write that opinion, Your Honor, but the last line of it has got to be that the judgment is affirmed -- (Laughter.)"
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1812.28,1812.4,"Well, no, what --"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1812.4,1815.72,-- because this Court reviews judgments -- (Laughter.)
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1815.72,1816.44,-- this Court --
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1816.44,1830.04,How about -- how about -- how about vacate and remand to decide under state law what the rule in this particular -- who cares about the refund in this case? All right.
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1858.72,1861.52,"Because the Court reviews judgments and not opinions, Your Honor."
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1863.8,1869.24,"We vacate and remand for reconsideration under different -- new tests all the time, don't we?"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1869.24,1870.6,Not where the judgment --
2019.18-1269,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1870.6,1872.16,We do that all the time.
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1872.16,1875.96,"Yes, but not where the judgment has no error in it."
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1890.76,1891.04,But it'll be easy --
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1891.04,1892.72,-- federal common law or Bob Richards or anything.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1892.72,1910.0,"-- it'll be -- it'll be easy enough for the Tenth Circuit to say that on remand, to follow up on Justice Gorsuch's question, if Bob Richards did not put a thumb on the scale in its analysis. So you will end up getting the result you want from the Tenth Circuit if they truly did what you think they did."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1910.0,1911.08,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that --"
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1911.08,1916.16,"But we don't know because they start out with this whole Bob Richards framework, and I don't think you can be sure."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1923.2,1925.48,"I think you do know, Your Honor, and I think it would be --"
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1925.48,1928.24,"Well, if we do know, it'll be simple then, won't it?"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1928.24,1936.44,"It -- it would be strange for the Court, I think, to vacate a decision and remand so that the Tenth Circuit can simply reinstate pages 18a to 27a --"
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1936.44,1936.68,"Well, that --"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1936.68,1937.08,-- of its opinion.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1937.08,1944.88,"-- they may or may not do that, though, knowing that Bob Richards does not, contrary to what they said in their opinion, provide the framework for the analysis."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1944.88,1949.24,"It -- but you have to understand, Your Honor, what the court meant by the framework of the analysis."
2019.18-1269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1973.56,1989.0,"Mr. Huston, may I ask you a question about another aspect of your answer to Justice Gorsuch? I think you said that the Bob Richards rule is wrong in the sense that it -- it puts a thumb on the scales when interpreting a contract."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1990.0,1994.36,A court should not apply a federal common law rule to -- to put a thumb on -- on the scale in the contract.
2019.18-1269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1994.36,1994.68,Yeah.
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2003.64,2006.0,"Again, I think that question is not presented by this case."
2019.18-1269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2012.92,2028.2,"So, in fact, the Bob Richards rule, whether it's a matter of contract interpretation or whether it's a default rule where no contract exists, as to both aspects of the Bob Richards rule, you're saying there's no place for such a rule in our law?"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2028.2,2031.68,"Well, there's not a -- there's not a place for a rule of federal common law."
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2095.72,2096.24,So does the regulate --
2019.18-1269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2096.24,2096.72,"Well, now I --"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2096.72,2098.0,-- my friends on the other side to dispute that.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2098.0,2098.24,Go ahead.
2019.18-1269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2098.24,2112.72,"I guess I'm a little bit confused by this because that suggests that there is a federal rule that comes from the IRS regs that allocates this money in the absence of an agreement. I think, if you had asked Mr. Reich, Mr. Reich would say, no, that's state law that does that."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2121.2,2136.16,"Your Honor, the regulations rebut the suggestion that corporate parents like UWBI have made all the time, that they ought to be viewed as the owner of a tax refund like this because they're in possession of it. And you can see this argument all over the Blue Brief."
2019.18-1269,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2167.56,2170.92,Can I before -- I just don't want you to stop.
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2277.72,2300.76,"Your Honor, let me address all the questions in one -- in one answer. Petitioner has not identified a single case under Colorado law in which parties said we want the nature of our relationship to be an agency, and then a court came back and then said, oh, no, you have not created an agency because you haven't provided the specific forms of interim control that that agency relationship requires."
2019.18-1269,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2364.6,2370.0,"But what you're talking about, you're talking about general agency law, which is to say you're talking about state law."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2370.0,2371.72,"Absolutely, Your Honor. That's right."
2019.18-1269,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2372.72,2375.28,You want us to take a decision of state law?
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2375.28,2378.36,We want to -- we want you to -- the judgment rests on the contract.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2400.4,2400.6,So --
2019.18-1269,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2400.6,2426.68,"Well, one of the things I -- I took from what you said a few minutes ago, but maybe this isn't what you meant, was that you want federal law to be involved in this to the extent of not having the actions taken by the IRS in mailing the check figure at all in the determination of ownership under state law. You want the federal government's participation to be completely neutral."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2427.96,2429.64,"That's basically correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-1269,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2443.2,2443.68,"Do we know, by the way --"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2443.68,2444.92,It has that possession as an agent.
2019.18-1269,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2444.92,2447.44,-- on this -- it has put the question in my mind.
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2488.84,2491.6,"Your Honor, I think, generally speaking, there aren't very many of them."
2019.18-1269,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2494.16,2494.96,Name me one.
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2494.96,2496.88,I -- I -- I'm not sure that there is one.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2549.2,2549.48,In your --
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2549.48,2549.8,-- make clear --
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2549.8,2558.68,"-- in your answer to Justice Alito where you said it should be affirmed, should it be affirmed on the basis of the IRS reg or affirmed on the basis of state law?"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2558.68,2562.48,"It should be affirmed on the basis of the contract, Your Honor, the judgment of --"
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2562.48,2563.88,Contract as interpreted?
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2563.88,2564.68,Under state law.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2565.28,2568.2,Does the IRS reg play any role therefore?
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2568.2,2571.04,It -- it plays a role in this limited sense.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2571.4,2571.6,Let me -- let me --
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2571.6,2571.88,Yes.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2571.88,2578.44,"-- ask you this way: If the IRS reg leads you to a different answer, as you described it, than state law does, what happens?"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2578.44,2579.52,It -- it would not.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2584.28,2584.44,Okay.
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2584.8,2585.64,-- it precludes --
2019.18-1269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2585.64,2591.48,"Well, when you said -- you said in your brief federal law provides relevant back ground for construing the contract, what did you mean?"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2591.48,2614.36,"We mean that a Petitioner, a party like Petitioner, UWI -- UWBI, cannot come into court and say we -- we have a good claim to being the equitable owner of this refund because we're in possession. After all, the IRS regulations, they paid us. That's how you know we're the owner of it. The IRS regulations do not allow a corporate parent to make that type of argument. And that's what --"
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2614.36,2614.52,So --
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2614.52,2617.6,"So they do play a role. They don't override state law, but --"
2019.18-1269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2617.6,2621.44,"But maybe -- you know, maybe state law would say if you are in possession, then you are the owner."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2621.44,2624.2,"Well, state law certainly does not say that, Your Honor."
2019.18-1269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2638.6,2639.4,"Well, then it just seems --"
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2639.4,2639.52,That's --
2019.18-1269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2639.52,2640.84,-- as though it's a matter of state law.
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2641.48,2642.0,It is --
2019.18-1269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2642.0,2644.84,-- what does federal law have to do with it?
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2644.84,2647.2,"It is ultimately, at the end of the day, a matter of state law."
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2650.76,2661.24,"And on that question of state law, Justice Breyer was pointing out that there's disagreement about -- on page 16 and 17, about what the state law is, and the bankruptcy court had a different view, correct?"
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2661.24,2662.08,That's right.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2663.84,2666.24,So it had a different view on state law.
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2666.24,2666.84,Yes.
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2666.84,2686.12,"So, if it is purely a question of state law and there's been disagreement here and there's disagreement between the bankruptcy court, which is expert in these matters, and the district court and the Tenth Circuit, shouldn't we remand for the state law question to be sorted out? You -- you've implied -- just to follow up on this, you've implied that the state law question is so obvious."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2687.84,2725.96,"Well, it's particular -- it's overwhelmingly obvious here because these parties have a contract that resolves any ambiguity in favor of the bank. So to whatever extent there is a fight about what you would do where there's not a contract or if a contract -- you know, in a different case, if the contract were ambiguous, again, I -- I think you can just read the Restatement and understand that it's supposed to be easy for parties to create an agency relationship, but to whatever extent you have doubts about, you know, how -- what these parties wanted for their contract, you know that they wanted an agency relationship because they went out of their way to write an ambiguity-resolving provision in favor of the bank."
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2748.56,2751.6,Would it be a problem for the FDIC if we just said it's a matter of state law?
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2751.6,2773.28,"Well, Your Honor, I would -- I think the Court should make clear that parties are entitled to rely on the statement that their federal regulator has given them about how they're supposed to handle contracts exactly like this one. And what the federal banking regulators have instructed is write your contract to make clear that you are entering an agency relationship."
2019.18-1269,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2786.2,2788.48,But I thought you just said to Justice Kagan it is a matter of state law.
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2788.48,2804.0,"Well, it's a matter of state -- it is, it is, in the sense that, at the end of the day, you know, these parties have to write a contract. What I am saying is that the federal regulators in this area have told groups that have insured depository institutions that they should enter an agency relationship."
2019.18-1269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2925.08,2925.92,You seem to be saying --
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2925.92,2927.52,"-- and they can do it with words like ""agent."""
2019.18-1269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2927.52,2940.56,"But you seem -- I'm -- I'm not quite sure what you're arguing, because you seem to be saying the opposite. You're saying the IRS payment should be seen as an agency payment only."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2947.6,2951.6,"The IRS regulations do not override state law, Your Honor."
2019.18-1269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2953.88,2957.6,But they don't create a state law agency relationship?
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2957.6,2970.0,"Well, they -- no, they -- I don't -- that's -- I think they don't, that's right, but what they do do is they bar a corporate parent like UWBI from attempting to invoke its possession as a basis for its equitable ownership."
2019.18-1269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2970.0,2970.6,That -- that -- that --
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2970.6,2971.68,They can't make that argument.
2019.18-1269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2971.68,2972.84,"I'm sorry, counsel."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2983.0,2983.6,But -- but this is --
2019.18-1269,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2983.6,2988.2,"Whether you want to bar them or not, you can't do that unless you explicitly state that."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2988.2,2990.12,"Your Honor, they do explicitly state it."
2019.18-1269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3059.88,3060.48,May --
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,3060.48,3061.72,That makes no sense.
2019.18-1269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3061.72,3064.2,"May I ask, Mr. -- or maybe this isn't a question."
2019.18-1269,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3068.48,3070.92,"And this is not on you, Mr. Huston."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,3104.0,3120.72,"Your Honor, I think we told the Court in our brief in opposition that, contrary to Petitioner's representation, the Bob Richards rule actually wasn't doing the work in this case that Petitioner would like it to. There is some disagreement about what the Bob Richards rule does."
2019.18-1269,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3125.8,3126.0,But you did --
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,3126.0,3126.28,-- on page 16 of --
2019.18-1269,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3126.28,3126.64,But you did say --
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,3126.64,3127.64,-- our brief in opposition.
2019.18-1269,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3127.64,3162.72,"You did say in your brief, and this is in pages 31 and 32, ""Bob Richards supports the distinct proposition that the parent's role in interacting with the IRS on behalf of the affiliated group does not give the parent temporary equitable title to the refund."" So you are bringing up Bob Richards as in support of your position that there's -- that the temporary possession doesn't create the equitable title."
2019.18-1269,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,3162.72,3168.4,"That's correct, Your Honor, but that -- that aspect of Bob Richards is an interpretation of the federal tax regulations."
2019.18-1269,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3261.12,3264.72,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Reich."
2019.18-1269,2,63196,mitchell_p_reich,,3264.72,3290.04,"I think I'll start by what my friends conceded at the podium, which is that on the sole question on which this Court granted certiori, is the Bob Richards rule valid, the answer is no, that that rule is not a valid rule of federal common law and that courts should not apply it. Therefore, the Tenth Circuit erred in saying that Bob Richards clearly applies to this case and sets forth the framework that must govern the parties' disputes. And, Justice Kavanaugh, you're exactly right."
2019.18-1269,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3375.16,3390.24,"Well, I don't want to interrupt your rebuttal but I didn't quite understand his point to be that, that -- that -- I thought his point was that the fact that the IRS for convenience purposes chooses to pay it to the parent is not -- cannot be taken as a factor under state law."
