2012.12-142,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.154,"We will hear argument next in Case 12-142, Mutual Pharmaceutical Company v. Bartlett."
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,7.12,10.389,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-142,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,46.562,50.349,"Mr. Lefkowitz, could I understand something just about the scope of your argument?"
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,106.785,111.154,"Justice Kagan, it's -- it's certainly the position that the government takes in its brief."
2012.12-142,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,134.87,140.857,"I want you to put that aside for me for just a second, and I understand that's a very significant thing in your argument to put aside."
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,160.17,166.574,"--If you are hypothecating -- hypothesizing a pure design defect regime, we're not--"
2012.12-142,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,166.574,167.358,Just about how you make the drug?
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,167.358,168.008,--Correct.
2012.12-142,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,182.434,188.404,"Not what the government, I mean, I myself, I just can't figure out what distinction there would be."
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,188.404,189.173,--Your Honor--
2012.12-142,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,189.173,189.706,So I'm asking you.
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,189.706,193.308,"--As a legal matter, I'm not sure reading the FDCA there is a matter."
2012.12-142,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,202.681,220.976,"But, you -- but again, and I know that this is a big part of your argument, but to the extent that a warning was not involved in the claim, and it was just about the design of a drug, I guess I'm asking you, is there any possible way to distinguish between generics and brand-name manufacturers?"
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,220.976,223.078,"I'm not sure, Your Honor, that there is a way to distinguish."
2012.12-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,294.691,311.135,"So tell me, is -- is it now your position, and it seems to be, that any time the FDA approves a product that there can never be a tort liability claim because the FDA's approval is now the ceiling of what you can do?"
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,311.135,313.851,"Absolutely not, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,313.851,316.537,They approve nonprescription drugs.
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,317.722,318.489,Absolutely.
2012.12-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,347.158,350.593,But that's not true with respect to the active ingredients.
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,354.745,357.864,--But -- but we were talking in that case about the warning.
2012.12-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,357.864,389.585,"But -- but we came back to the same point, which is -- and we are sort of dancing around the argument -- which is what happens with a truly dangerous drug, and we can posit one, that has nothing to do with a warning of whether it's adequate or not, but a drug that on its face no reasonable practitioner -- I'm going to the restatement third formulation -- no reasonable practitioner, knowing all the benefits and risks, would ever prescribe this drug."
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,393.12,393.789,Well--
2012.12-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,393.789,401.209,"It doesn't matter -- there were other, safer, one-molecule drugs; no one should have prescribed this, no matter what the label."
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,401.209,405.345,"--Actually, Justice Sotomayor, that is not the position my adversary took at trial."
2012.12-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,424.058,424.391,We can argue.
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,439.751,440.801,Absolutely not--
2012.12-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,440.801,442.87,--because the FDA approved it.
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,442.87,444.57,--Absolutely not.
2012.12-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,448.506,449.923,So what tort claim could they bring?
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,449.923,451.539,"--Well, they could bring--"
2012.12-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,451.539,453.291,"Both, again, the brand could manufacture and the generic."
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,453.291,471.419,"--Right now if the Plaintiff -- the Respondent here had taken the brand-name drug Clinoril instead of the generic sulindac, in the New Hampshire law, as it exists and as it existed at the time of the lawsuit, she would have had both a design defect claim and a failure to warn claim."
2012.12-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,471.419,471.669,How?
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,473.486,475.737,Because the design defect claim--
2012.12-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,475.737,477.922,And they couldn't change it without FDA approval.
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,477.922,484.16,"--But they could change the warning, and that's the essential component, as the First Circuit made clear."
2012.12-142,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,512.996,513.762,One of our cases--
2012.12-142,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,513.762,525.986,"And she didn't take -- she didn't take the -- the brand-name drug because the pharmacist gave her the generic, but she didn't know brand, generic; isn't that correct?"
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,525.986,531.807,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, and that's exactly the same issue that we had in the Mensing case a couple years ago."
2012.12-142,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,557.122,570.699,"Suppose that New Hampshire had a real strict liability regime, so that you -- you sell a drug, and whether it's unreasonably dangerous or not it causes an injury, you pay, to spread the costs."
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,572.465,589.76,"Justice Alito, I think if we had what would really be an absolute liability scheme, I think is really what you are suggesting, something similar to the kind of vaccine compensation program that we heard about this morning, that would not raise impossibility preemption problems at all."
2012.12-142,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,601.734,602.4,Isn't there a First Circuit--
2012.12-142,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,602.4,606.969,Mr. Frederick argues that that -- that's the thrust of the -- of the New Hampshire law.
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,608.238,614.392,"Well, he's wrong because -- Price v. Dick -- the New Hampshire Supreme Court case, says very clearly:"
2012.12-142,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,648.813,649.813,Can I just ask this one more follow-up?
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,649.813,650.196,--Sure.
2012.12-142,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,650.196,661.235,Why -- why would -- why is a generic manufacturer in a worse position under the absolute liability scheme than it would be under the New Hampshire scheme?
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,661.235,661.618,Well--
2012.12-142,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,661.618,666.639,"Because under the absolute scheme they might say, if that's the cost, we are not going to sell this drug at all?"
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,667.389,673.376,"--No, it's -- it's not a question of -- of policy choices, it's a question of operation of law."
2012.12-142,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,714.286,745.591,"Mr. -- Mr. Lefkowitz, then what you are saying is that the FDA's approval is not only what everyone agrees it is, a floor to enable you to market, but it is also a ceiling; that is you meet the FDA objective -- FDA approval and that gives you a right to market, not simply an access to the market, but it -- it operates as a ceiling?"
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,745.591,765.487,"--With respect to the question, Justice Ginsburg, as the Mensing Court made clear, when this very issue came up with respect to warnings which are commanded as a sameness requirement by Federal law in exactly the same way as the molecule, the design, the Federal regime does operate as a floor and as a ceiling."
2012.12-142,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,778.795,793.072,"Is there something in the -- in the Act that says that the States have no role with respect to the safety and efficacy of the drug -- the drug; it's only the FDA approval, that's it?"
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,793.072,796.273,--There is no express preemption clause here.
2012.12-142,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,816.354,828.745,"But, Mr. Lefkowitz, I think in describing the FDCA just now, you used the word “ authorizes ”, and typically, when we think about impossibility, it's not enough that a State law penalizes what Federal law authorizes."
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,861.049,864.334,"--Your Honor, Justice Kagan, I'd like to give you two answers to that."
2012.12-142,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,907.328,917.986,"Well, that is your best case, but, you know, there are quite a number of cases where we've really held when a Federal law permits something, typically, a State can do more if it wants to."
2012.12-142,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,917.986,921.954,"Justice Kagan, the very same issue came out in Mensing as well."
2012.12-142,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1024.821,1026.054,"--Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1033.443,1036.312,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1083.71,1084.71,"Well, but it's a little different."
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1120.483,1123.168,"--There are two, I think, arguments embedded within that."
2012.12-142,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1146.533,1154.139,How would you define the duty that New Hampshire imposed here according to the First Circuit and according to the Respondent?
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1154.139,1162.493,The duty is that one cannot market an unreasonably dangerous drug in light of the warnings -- that's unreasonably dangerous in light of the warnings.
2012.12-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1188.877,1195.114,"But is that meeting a standard under State law that your friend's argument says, that's not what we're talking about here."
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1228.802,1240.326,"--Well, with respect to the question of stop selling, which I think is what your question goes to, that you can always escape liability if you simply stop selling and don't have the market."
2012.12-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1334.021,1337.656,"I mean, that suggests that there is an obligation of the Federal government."
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1348.697,1352.233,--Let me draw a distinction if -- that I think might help.
2012.12-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1379.984,1381.586,"Well, I take that point, Mr. Yang."
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1411.438,1411.938,--Our -- our position is--
2012.12-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1411.938,1412.404,And that's--
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1412.404,1412.904,--a little narrower.
2012.12-142,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1412.904,1414.723,--and that's something I don't think we've really ever said.
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1414.723,1417.675,I don't think the Court has addressed this question expressly.
2012.12-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1460.867,1469.189,"So without the preemption clause, actually, with an express saving clause, you're arguing essentially complete field preemption."
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1483.449,1485.567,"--No, we're -- we're actually not saying that."
2012.12-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1485.567,1486.567,"Well, I don't see how you're not saying that."
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1486.567,1499.491,"Well, no, with respect to the design-defect claims that -- and failure to warn, with respect to generics -- remember, this is exactly what the Court said in Mensing -- we're saying the result in Mensing controls here."
2012.12-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1517.952,1520.604,But that's your -- you're telling me that's exactly what the FDA is saying.
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1522.304,1523.287,"--No, but we -- in that--"
2012.12-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1523.287,1526.339,And there's no strict liability that a State could impose.
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1526.339,1528.622,--If I might just finish.
2012.12-142,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.622,1531.324,I would like to hear your answer.
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1531.324,1532.676,Yes.
2012.12-142,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1629.656,1635.726,"This applies to everything that requires FDA approval, or is this a prescription drug-only rule?"
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1635.726,1638.093,--May I answer?
2012.12-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1638.093,1638.845,Briefly.
2012.12-142,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1638.845,1646.949,"With respect to failure to warn, you can -- prescription drugs can be sued, generics cannot."
2012.12-142,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1650.32,1651.336,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1661.626,1663.978,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-142,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1717.028,1719.144,"The jury decides all of this, right?"
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1719.144,1719.894,That's correct.
2012.12-142,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.894,1720.913,That's wonderful.
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1744.178,1744.795,"Yes, it is."
2012.12-142,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1770.246,1773.881,"I'm not so sure -- I'm not so sure it works that way, because of the jury point."
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1793.109,1800.598,"--Well, of course, Mr. Chief Justice, Mutual put in their defense in this case -- they rested after the plaintiffs put in their case."
2012.12-142,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1807.369,1808.621,"Well, what do you in that case?"
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1815.208,1825.497,"Well, there's no claim preclusion effect of a jury verdict, and that is why there is no offensive collateral estoppel that would be applied, Mutual can adopt a different trial strategy."
2012.12-142,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1880.484,1892.708,"Mr. Frederick, it -- it does seem to me, and I understand that there's a waiver argument floating around here, but it does seem to me that this case was litigated such that the adequacy of the warning is really all over this case."
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1919.792,1926.279,"Let me address that, because I think that's the hardest part of this case to understand, and why this is different from Mensing."
2012.12-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1999.092,1999.411,I see that.
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2057.28,2057.947,It is not.
2012.12-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2057.947,2058.547,Because -- why?
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2058.547,2059.68,"No, absolutely not."
2012.12-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2068.403,2077.775,"In other words, in this case, they have to find that -- that no warning -- there is no such warning that could make a difference, that's what they're asked to find?"
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2077.775,2081.31,--All that they -- in terms of minimizing the risk.
2012.12-142,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2082.828,2090.834,"Well, how can that be, Mr. Frederick, because the plaintiff really spent a large portion of their case trying to show this, that the warning was inadequate."
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2100.79,2122.053,"--The case as it was litigated up until the day before the trial was with a comment k defense, which allows as an affirmative defense the defendant to say if the drug is unavoidably unsafe and it has an adequate warning, i.e., it adequately describes what the risks are, complete immunity from suit."
2012.12-142,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2143.986,2151.99,The failure -- the failure to warn defense was -- the -- the judge struck that out.
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2154.775,2155.625,"That's correct, that's correct."
2012.12-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2171.051,2171.918,Where is that?
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2182.008,2182.691,--Yes.
2012.12-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.691,2183.124,Okay.
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2199.468,2200.903,Where is it in the record?
2012.12-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2200.903,2201.27,Yes.
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2213.993,2215.426,"Well, I would direct you to two--"
2012.12-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2215.426,2215.926,How do I discover that?
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2215.926,2216.509,--two pieces.
2012.12-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2273.781,2274.932,The second point is a different point.
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2314.941,2318.56,"--Justice Breyer, a chemotherapy drug has got a huge benefit."
2012.12-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2330.384,2336.955,We're talking about what juries could find and that's what -- and I don't know about Parkinson's -- I don't know what these drugs are.
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2338.574,2354.35,"But that's why when the jury gets evidence that aspirin and acetaminophen, Tylenol produce the same kind of pain relief, but they do not produce the kind of SJS/10 that Ms. Bartlett -- that caused 60 percent of her body to burn."
2012.12-142,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2358.052,2362.439,"If that's correct, and maybe it is, doesn't that mean the drug should never have been approved?"
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2362.439,2368.593,"No, because the evidence at the time of approval had not yet been ascertained."
2012.12-142,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2398.879,2405.049,"But isn't it true that when the -- the FDA reviewed this whole class of drugs, they decided to pull Bextra but not this drug?"
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2405.049,2423.861,"That is true, but what the FDA did not take into account, and this is what the district judge instructed the jury on September 22nd, 2010, I think it's page 108 in the charging colloquy, is the evidence in this case was that the FDA did not have that evidence."
2012.12-142,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2448.075,2452.96,"The -- the SG says that the FDA did have this right, did have it and did consider it, and that's incorrect?"
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2452.96,2454.162,That is incorrect.
2012.12-142,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2497.073,2509.215,"Do you want me to write down in this case, from my understanding, that under New Hampshire law, strict liability is determined quite without reference to the adequacy of warning?"
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2509.215,2510.732,You can do that.
2012.12-142,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2519.254,2519.454,Now wait.
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2522.123,2524.325,--The warning can be a factor.
2012.12-142,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2525.458,2528.444,"Well, that's -- that's not the thrust of your argument."
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2532.831,2533.964,--And Justice Kennedy--
2012.12-142,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2533.964,2542.036,"I mean, which does -- was the warning relevant or not relevant to the determination of strict liability?"
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2542.036,2544.386,"--Yes, it was relevant as in this case."
2012.12-142,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2563.617,2566.235,I'm talking about the definition of the duty.
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2581.078,2581.561,--No.
2012.12-142,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2611.531,2626.54,"So you are saying there is a huge difference between saying you didn't put the warning in, so you are liable for $9 million, and saying, you are liable for $15 million, but if you put the warning in, you are only liable for 9 million?"
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2626.54,2630.677,"Well, when there is a comment k defense, Mr. Chief Justice, you may be off completely."
2012.12-142,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2636.415,2639.783,But -- but just to get back to my -- to my question.
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2656.41,2664.998,"--There is a difference, and the difference is this: Assume in the Diana Levine case there had been a strict liability claim that went all the way through."
2012.12-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2737.944,2745.284,"Well, but then if you apply this -- what is deeply bothering me in all these cases, and it's why I came up with and said, the FDA has to tell us, you know."
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2795.047,2796.299,"Let's be clear, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-142,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2903.419,2909.156,"Just -- just to -- because my memory is failing me, is this drug still on the market?"
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2909.156,2909.706,Yes.
2012.12-142,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2909.706,2910.523,All right.
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2912.607,2913.374,It is.
2012.12-142,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3000.928,3009.699,"This argument about stopping the sale of the drug completely seems to me to eliminate the impossibility -- impossibility preemption, doesn't it?"
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3009.699,3019.391,"No, because the -- the duty here, if there is any duty to stop selling under New Hampshire law, it can be complied with by not selling the drug."
2012.12-142,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3024.126,3028.08,But that's true -- isn't that true often in -- in these impossibility cases?
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3043.422,3044.156,Yes.
2012.12-142,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3044.156,3048.291,But you could comply with both rules by not driving.
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3048.291,3049.341,It would be very dangerous.
2012.12-142,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3049.341,3051.16,Not to drive at all?
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3051.16,3054.695,"Well, it would be dangerous to try comply with both at the same time."
2012.12-142,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3055.595,3056.73,You decide -- if you decide to drive--
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3056.73,3057.146,--Yeah.
2012.12-142,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3070.52,3072.054,The Feds didn't say to do the opposite.
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3081.392,3081.858,Right.
2012.12-142,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3105.859,3107.509,"Well, just -- I'm sorry to interrupt you."
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3113.963,3131.591,"--Actually we dispute what they say, and we've got an -- an excursus about Mensing in our brief, and what is clear is that as the case came to this Court, the only duty that was being litigated was the duty concerning the warning label."
2012.12-142,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3158.744,3177.389,"But even the compensation, suppose you had strict liability that Florida Avocado Growers could -- what they have to do, all they have to do since they can just be fined and the money would go to pay the consumers of California who have the unfortunate mixup sometimes of eating Florida avocados."
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3184.975,3187.677,"--Justice Breyer, that's not an impossibility hypothetical."
2012.12-142,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3243.847,3248.918,Is your point in this case that obstacle preemption has been waived?
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3248.918,3249.935,Granted--
2012.12-142,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3249.935,3251.62,Or were you granted cert just on impossibility?
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3251.62,3252.803,"--Yes, yes."
2012.12-142,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3317.496,3332.005,"There is no such thing then as a brand name manufacturer can change some design features of the drug, you know, without FDA approval or without going back to square one of the FDA, there's nothing like that?"
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3332.005,3343.227,"No, the FDA requires a -- a new drug or an abbreviated drug application -- I get the terms of them sometimes confused -- but if there was to be a tweak to the design, they'd need to go to the FDA to get approval for that."
2012.12-142,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3392.294,3408.32,"How do you respond to the argument, Mutual's argument that they have -- in 2005, they made -- this drug produced $7 million."
2012.12-142,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3417.093,3430.335,"Justice Ginsburg, I've never been in a case in my time arguing before this Court where somebody in a reply brief at the merits put in evidence that they did not put in at trial and they sought to persuade you that that was somehow relevant."
2012.12-142,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3463.906,3464.856,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-142,3,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,3467.275,3467.958,Thank you.
2012.12-142,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3510.049,3513.167,Did you get to the jury's -- to the instructions to the jury?
2012.12-142,3,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,3513.167,3514.617,--Absolutely not.
2012.12-142,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3518.471,3522.623,"So that's what the jury was supposed to apply, not what counsel said."
2012.12-142,3,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,3522.623,3530.879,"--The jury applied the instruction that the court gave it, which was to decide whether or not the jury was good enough -- the warning was good enough or not."
2012.12-142,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3547.74,3551.792,"But you just said there was nothing wrong with the jury instructions, at least you didn't object."
2012.12-142,3,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,3551.792,3552.776,"Your Honor, let me be clear."
2012.12-142,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3574.474,3575.774,How -- how did the Court reject it?
2012.12-142,3,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,3578.359,3581.578,The trial judge rejected our summary judgment motion on preemption.
2012.12-142,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3582.828,3590.434,"It says on page 5496, adequacy of the warning, I guess, the judge says, is not an issue before this jury."
2012.12-142,3,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,3591.701,3609.246,"Well, he said that, but then he went and he instructed the jury and, again, as the First Circuit made clear, it was in fact -- the dangerousness was because of the arguable inadequacies of the warning, which the plaintiff said we could have changed, we should have changed."
2012.12-142,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3655.693,3656.609,"Thank you, counsel."
