1957.87,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.222,"The next case is Number 87, Joseph George Sherman, versus United States of America."
1957.87,0,27547,henry_a_lowenberg,,12.49,16.34,"Yes, sir, if Your Honor pleases, if the court please."
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2491.834,2495.258,"(Inaudible) Pardon me, Your Honor."
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2495.258,2500.985,Certainly.
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2500.985,2509.447,We come again to the question of whether the entrapment issue was one for the jury.
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2621.553,2631.307,And that under -- wasn't there something on page 100 also following -- following that or the question is do you remember this question --
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2631.307,2631.357,Yes.
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2631.357,2632.488,And so please read it.
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2632.488,2633.499,That's where he did it.
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2633.499,2644.631,"Question “And it was your job while working with these agents to go out and try and induce a person to sell narcotics to you, isn't that correct?”"
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2653.664,2653.885,So that -- yes.
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2653.885,2654.407,"Now, that's a little different from what --"
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2654.407,2655.239,Yes.
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2669.495,2670.077,Yes.
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2670.077,2675.982,"So, now, we have -- we have him saying now, he didn't -- that it wasn't his job to induce him."
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2681.087,2681.888,"I know, but he says --"
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2681.888,2682.359,(Voice Overlap) --
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2682.359,2686.674,-- but after he has confirmed it with that question and that answer.
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2694.526,2695.138,Yes.
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2695.138,2702.077,"-- the question now when you look at this, the court, he said, “Let it stand just that way."
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2704.709,2708.833,"He says, “I mean by job that nobody hired me.”"
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2729.442,2735.344,"Now, to tell you, this -- this page 100 just doesn't bear out what you started again to tell us Mr. Knapp."
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2735.775,2736.316,"Oh, I'm --"
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2736.316,2737.298,-- I've read the whole --
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2737.298,2737.729,I --
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2737.729,2751.734,-- I've read -- I've read the whole thing now and it just doesn't bear that out.
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2751.734,2755.829,"Well, he say at the -- at the start, it wasn't his job to do anything of the kind."
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2777.166,2777.907,Yes.
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2777.907,2784.221,And then he says by -- “So when you testify now it was not your job you're not telling the truth?
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2787.657,2788.969,"Well, that's not (Voice Overlap) --"
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,2788.969,2789.98,That is what I inferred.
1957.87,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3042.397,3061.568,"Mr. Knapp, I don't mean to take words out of an opinion and treat them as sacred, but taking Judge Hand's opinion in the first Sherman case, ""Therefore, in such cases two questions of fact arise."
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,3093.644,3104.997,"Well, the thing in the record is that that he eventually, not eventually, I think after three approaches."
1957.87,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3104.997,3106.98,By -- by the government agent?
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,3106.98,3107.722,By Kalchinian.
1957.87,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3116.373,3122.02,But you -- one can't say without denial that he was contemporaneously a government agent.
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,3122.02,3125.525,"Your Honor, there is evidence in the record."
1957.87,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3200.748,3201.069,What --
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,3201.069,3202.511,That's just about --
1957.87,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3202.511,3217.548,Will you state what your -- what -- can you state your understanding of the relations between -- the relations between Kalchinian and the Narcotics Bureau from the moment that they had a relationship?
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,3217.548,3223.225,"Well, my -- my understanding from it is taken from the record."
1957.87,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3223.225,3224.347,(Inaudible)
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,3224.347,3229.012,"Yes, sir, at record page 67."
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3255.966,3263.083,"Didn't you say, Mr. Knapp, that he made two cases for the Government before the sales to the --"
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,3263.083,3263.664,"Yes, sir."
1957.87,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3269.59,3271.373,Then you and I understood what he was saying.
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,3271.373,3273.656,"Well, yes -- but I -- I --"
1957.87,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3273.656,3274.777,(Inaudible)
1957.87,1,31208,james_w_knapp,,3286.626,3287.709,I would assume that.
1957.87,2,27547,henry_a_lowenberg,,4788.691,4789.473,"Now, I'd just like to have (Voice Overlap) --"
1957.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4789.473,4789.504,"Yes, yes, you may."
1957.87,2,27547,henry_a_lowenberg,,4789.504,4792.137,-- about two or three minutes.
1957.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4857.246,4857.477,Yes.
