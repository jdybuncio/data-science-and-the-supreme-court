1973.72-5704,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.823,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-5704, Christian against New York State."
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,37.345,40.796,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-5704,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,329.382,333.963,What would’ve been the case if a fellow who had been a New York State employee?
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,333.963,343.806,"If the appellant had been a New York State employee, and particularly a probationary state employee, the appellant would’ve been treated as or private employee."
1973.72-5704,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,362.618,368.495,"And, your only point is that as Federal employee she should get the same procedure."
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,368.495,371.2,"Oh! Very definitely Your Honor, I should point out that--"
1973.72-5704,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,371.2,372.822,But that’s the point of this --
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,372.822,375.744,"Yes, it is."
1973.72-5704,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.754,400.319,"But some of those Federal employees get it in a Federal form, not on the state’s form."
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,400.319,402.863,"Through the Federal form, through their termination hearings."
1973.72-5704,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,402.863,403.441,Right.
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,403.441,405.508,Because of their status as permanent employees.
1973.72-5704,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,405.508,416.823,"And that we have described the process for the state employee, it was not a hearing, if I followed you correctly, but merely an inquiry --"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,416.823,418.422,That is the initial determination --
1973.72-5704,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,418.422,419.217,-- initial determination.
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,419.217,423.84,"-- which you described in the Java case, Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.72-5704,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,442.612,447.001,"You weren’t undertaking to describe the whole process, but only the initial?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,447.001,448.591,Well --
1973.72-5704,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,448.591,449.926,Eligibility.
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,449.926,476.25,"At this stage, yes I’m getting to the hearing, because something significant happened at this hearing, with regard to appellant Christian and that is that although the appellee’s interpretation of the statute issue here, requires the fair hearing referee at the second stage, now requires the fair hearing referee to accept that ex parte statement of reasons by the Federal agency as final and conclusive."
1973.72-5704,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,524.776,529.369,"So, I gather as a dismissed Federal employee, she gets neither --"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,529.369,529.671,She gets neither.
1973.72-5704,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,529.671,534.293,-- the initial determination or they should get the ultimate final determination.
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,534.293,537.145,That is correct Mr. Justice Brennan.
1973.72-5704,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,537.145,543.234,"I suppose she gets an initial determination, but it’s preordained, is that it?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,543.234,544.807,It’s certainly as not a fair determination.
1973.72-5704,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,544.807,546.955,"No, it’s not. She gets no fair hearing."
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,546.955,564.599,For example in Java this Court noted that the word “do” in Section 503 of the Social Security Act met after the first time when both parties could be heard in an impartial decision rendered that was the initial determination procedure.
1973.72-5704,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,571.675,576.132,"And, there’s no argument between you and your brothers on the other side as to what happens, as to what the issue."
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,576.132,577.623,There’s no argument.
1973.72-5704,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,578.457,579.415,Right.
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,579.415,592.137,"Before I turn into the due process, and the equal protection, and the statutory construction issues in this case, I’d like to reiterate a couple of points about what this case is about and what it is not about."
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.559,788.321,Are you saying that you should have a hearing to determine whether that cause existed?
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,804.706,809.698,"Well, the issue is whether there was cause, whether it was a matter of fact there was cause."
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,809.698,815.397,"If you agree that the government may discharge a probationary employee, for no cause at all."
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,815.397,816.176,Right.
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.176,820.834,You must agree also that they could discharge him for cause.
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,820.834,821.762,"Certainly, they may."
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.762,824.882,By just saying “You were late yesterday.”
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,824.882,825.377,Correct.
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.377,826.808,"And discharged him, whether it’s true or false."
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,826.808,828.352,Right.
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.258,842.473,"If that’s the reason they discharged him, you say there must be a hearing to go behind that statement at the unemployment state?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,842.473,855.07,"Well, the way the system operates right now pursuant to the apellee’s interpretation of the statute, whatever reason the Federal appellees give or the Federal agency gives is final, conclusive, and can never be reviewed."
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,887.271,896.452,"Well, then I gather you say the hearing you require then really is something that you can’t get satisfied just by a paper record."
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,897.479,898.609,Oh! Certainly not.
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,898.609,905.614,"Have a witness and an impartial confrontation, impartial hearing officer, etcetera?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,905.614,911.27,"In our due process claim of course, we alleged that the requisites, the fundamental requisites of due process."
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.358,921.47,"But, the statutory procedure that were available would be enough for you?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,921.47,924.991,The procedure with regard to the state procedure.
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,924.991,925.361,Yes.
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,925.361,933.9,"I should note here that the state procedure, as well as the Federal procedure with regard to terminating a Federal employees."
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,945.065,950.498,"But, that is at the discharge state, but how about at the employment stage?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,950.498,953.014,This is also present at the unemployment stage.
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.014,958.029,"But, any way, whatever hearing they provide, where it’s available, that hearing is enough for your purpose?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,958.029,959.539,Yes.
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.539,971.396,"Well, let me say if I understand, if this were a state employee, at the initial stage, whatever form that hearing takes, the determination by the hearing examiner would be what?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,975.069,975.662,I --
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.662,980.144,"At the initial stage, is a dismissal in the state service."
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,980.144,985.149,"In the state situation, the hearing examiner would base its determination upon --"
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,985.149,986.39,"I know, but what would he decide?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,989.611,991.349,It depends upon the facts before him.
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,991.349,992.617,"But, that’s what he would decide."
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,992.617,993.414,That’s what would he decide.
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.414,993.623,And if he --
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,993.623,994.652,Decide the facts before him.
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,994.652,1001.768,"Right, and if he decided there was cause, whatever it may have been, and then she be an eligible for unemployment compensation?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1001.768,1002.585,"At that stage, yes."
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.585,1009.098,"Whereas if he said “there was no cause” and then she would be eligible at that stage, is that it?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1009.098,1009.711,Right.
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.711,1011.837,"And then, the next step is the --"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1011.837,1012.414,Fair hearing --
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.414,1014.734,"-- the fair hearing, at which the issue was the same, isn’t it?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1014.734,1015.386,That is correct.
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.386,1016.322,With just the different procedure?
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1016.322,1024.353,"It’s a more elaborative procedure, where there is an opportunity for cross examination and confrontation of witnesses, their seeking the power."
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.353,1032.272,"But the state agencies handling a Federal employee, accept the certification of the Federal official there was cause, period, in that statement."
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1032.272,1033.443,"That’s final and conclusive, nothing more."
1973.72-5704,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1033.443,1034.852,And at both stages?
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1034.852,1036.373,At both stages.
1973.72-5704,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1036.373,1053.617,"What if instead of having a one year probationary period, the petitioner here, appellant here had been hired on a one year contract, renewable if the government wanted them?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1059.62,1069.646,"Section 8501, which provides the basic coverage of the law, specifically accepts from coverage certain Federal employees."
1973.72-5704,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1074.397,1074.688,But --
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1074.688,1076.772,"So, that person would not be covered."
1973.72-5704,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1076.772,1085.652,But how do you distinguish a one year probationer from a one year termination?
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1085.652,1087.905,I’m not sure I understand your question Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-5704,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1088.037,1098.572,"How is a one year probationer who is not continued in the service different from a one year contract employee, who is not renewed?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1098.572,1104.538,"Well, the unemployment compensation is not available to the latter employee."
1973.72-5704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.38,1205.173,"As our affirmance in Tori as I take it approved is the absence of some of those procedures for a termination of unemployment compensation, would you apply a different standard to the initial eligibility determination?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1205.173,1217.302,"No, I think should I point out that Tori of course, as in the Bernie case the prior hearing cases which were at issue here, already provided the precise procedures, which we are seeking here."
1973.72-5704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1271.153,1284.44,"Are you suggesting a bit of a more fire reaching type of hearing is required in making an initial determination that you're entitled to a right, than in making a later determination that takes it away from you?"
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1284.44,1286.405,"No, I am not suggesting that at all."
1973.72-5704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1286.405,1296.433,"Well, then why is there that distinction that you suggest between a hearing and determining initial eligibility and a hearing terminating the right."
1973.72-5704,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1296.433,1304.907,"That’s provided for in the statutes and we do not challenge that statutory scheme of having an initial determination procedure, which is not a full blown hearing."
1973.72-5704,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1841.971,1844.696,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-5704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1996.982,1998.863,What book are referring to Mr. Evans?
1973.72-5704,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1998.863,2004.932,"Pardon me? I’m referring to the government’s brief in this case, the appendix short brief."
1973.72-5704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2004.932,2006.699,That of course is all of paper proceeding.
1973.72-5704,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2006.699,2008.114,This is all a paper proceeding.
1973.72-5704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.114,2013.024,"So, that we suggest is at least as good as the initial statement."
1973.72-5704,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2013.024,2014.332,"Yes, I think that is right."
1973.72-5704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.416,2046.388,"And, what’s this mean, affirm, modify, or reverse any or all of its Federal findings in writing, so it affirms in what’s it do?"
1973.72-5704,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2046.388,2048.944,"Well, it just sends the same slip."
1973.72-5704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.004,2056.914,"Let’s say, we modify it’s more elaborate or let’s say reverse, I suppose, it’s still more like it."
1973.72-5704,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2056.914,2058.101,That's right.
1973.72-5704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2058.101,2064.377,"But, if they affirm to send the same old slip back to the state that’s the end of the matter, isn’t it?"
1973.72-5704,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2064.377,2065.495,That’s the end of the matter.
1973.72-5704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.495,2067.531,The state may not go behind that?
1973.72-5704,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2067.531,2068.509,That’s right.
1973.72-5704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.835,2076.659,"Well, but so at least the so-called full due process hearing is not available to this area."
1973.72-5704,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2076.659,2092.685,"That’s absolutely right, we don’t claim that the full due process hearing’s are, not that we claim there is no due process so, right it is implicated, but I’ll turn to that in a moment, but right now I’m just trying to point the existing procedures, whether valid or invalid under the constitution were never invoked (Voice Overlap)"
1973.72-5704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2092.685,2095.696,"Well, he can't be heard to complain, unless he’s at least exhausted these first."
1973.72-5704,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2095.696,2096.768,"Well, that’s my point."
1973.72-5704,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2097.525,2099.659,Was this argument made to the District Court?
1973.72-5704,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2099.659,2102.901,"The argument was not, so far as I can tell, made to the District Court."
1973.72-5704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.851,2113.229,"Were you involved in the, not you but --"
1973.72-5704,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2113.229,2113.878,Yes.
1973.72-5704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2113.878,2114.366,Oh? You are?
1973.72-5704,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,2114.366,2129.174,"Yes, we are parties, but we -- the Federal defendants in that case were dismissed on subject matter jurisdiction grounds, and I might add in response to Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question, Mr. Larson’s right, we do not contest jurisdiction on the mandamus statute."
1973.72-5704,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,3574.094,3575.811,If I may make one comment about this last one?
1973.72-5704,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3575.811,3576.807,"Yes,"
