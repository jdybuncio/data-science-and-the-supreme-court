1989.88-1076,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.608,"We'll hear argument next this morning in No. 88-1076, J. Paul Preseault v. Interstate Commerce Commission."
1989.88-1076,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,63.582,83.355,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this case involves a congressional intent to preempt state real property law throughout the country and in so doing transform private property into public recreational hiking and biking trails."
1989.88-1076,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,226.843,251.621,"Mr. Nance... excuse me... Mr. Berger, is it possible that the state law that applies to define the property interest of your clients would take into account the federal determinations of public purpose or railway use?"
1989.88-1076,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,251.621,253.013,The major--
1989.88-1076,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.013,260.957,Is it possible that the state law determination would look back at the federal position?
1989.88-1076,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,260.957,264.64,"--I believe it does work into the calculus, Justice O'Connor."
1989.88-1076,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,322.921,334.31,"Well, here, of course, they may take the position that there still has been no abandonment because of the ultimate reserved potential use."
1989.88-1076,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,334.31,376.807,"--The way that that works, Justice O'Connor, is that before the ICC considers whether to approve the negotiations between a railroad and either a state and local agency or a recognized trail organization to transform this right of way into a recreational right of way from a full-blown transportation right of way, the ICC first has to determine that it is appropriate for the railroad to abandon railroad usage of this right of way and that there is neither present nor future public railroad need for the right of way."
1989.88-1076,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,400.564,416.235,"Even if you are correct so far, I suppose it's arguable that you still have a Tucker Act remedy for your clients to get compensation."
1989.88-1076,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,416.235,423.251,"That is certainly the other question in this case, and I'd be happy to address that since Your Honor is interested in it."
1989.88-1076,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,525.15,530.354,Where will we find Section 101 of the statute?
1989.88-1076,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,534.297,535.108,It--
1989.88-1076,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,535.108,539.112,If you don't--
1989.88-1076,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,539.112,542.434,"--It's on page 18 of the Solicitor General's brief, Your Honor."
1989.88-1076,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1615.785,1621.128,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1076,2,30042,john_k_dunleavy,,2501.917,2530.585,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on behalf of my client, the State of Vermont, and its fellows respondents, the City of Burlington and Vermont Railway, I urge this Court in the event it finds petitioner's taking claim right for review to hold that the Petitioners are not deprived of any property interest by Section 1247(d)."
