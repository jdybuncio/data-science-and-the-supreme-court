1999.99-579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.76,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-579, the Harris Trust and Savings Bank v. Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.--"
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,49.164,52.927,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,113.054,127.314,"If the provision allows suit against parties in interest, why wouldn't it also allow suits against persons who are not parties in interest?"
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,127.314,130.566,"Well, again, we make two arguments, Justice--"
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,130.566,133.678,"Because I mean, the provision you're relying on doesn't say, parties in interest."
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,144.577,160.786,"--Well, our first argument is that outside of section 502(a)(3) ERISA does say in section 406 and section 502(i) and section 4975 that parties in interest are not to engage in prohibited transactions."
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.293,174.897,"True, but those are not the sections that create the cause of action."
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,179.822,180.262,"Well, and that--"
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,180.262,183.365,You say that it doesn't matter whether it says whom it's against.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,185.406,185.806,--That is our--
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,185.806,189.069,--whenever it's equitable to get the money out of somebody's hide.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,189.069,216.548,"--And that is our second argument, and under our second argument, looking to the language of 502(a)(3), the plain language, it... you're correct, it does not matter when there is a violation of... any violation of any provision of title I, the plain language of 502(a)(3) is that there shall be a civil cause of action for appropriate, equitable relief to redress the violation, and the--"
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.548,225.416,"Any other instance where, you know, the United States Code, or even a State code, creates a cause of action without saying whom it's against?"
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,225.416,237.251,"--Well, I think, I mean, Congress... the Court has said several times that this is a very carefully crafted provision and the Court will not tamper with its language, and it's... what Congress did here was deliberate."
1999.99-579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,247.689,251.722,"Where is that set forth in the briefs, 502(a)(2)?"
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,251.722,264.412,"--50... the statutory provisions, Mr. Chief Justice, in the joint appendix, and 502(a)(2) is on page 254 of the joint appendix."
1999.99-579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,264.412,265.844,Thank you.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,265.844,287.876,"And that provision provides for an action by the Secretary or by a participant beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section 409, and section 409, in turn, is limited to fiduciary breaches, and two other examples, if you look to section--"
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,287.876,288.247,Excuse me.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,290.198,292.068,--The point--
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,292.068,293.71,--502(a)(2)--
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,293.71,308.581,"--The point very simply, Justice Scalia, is that if Congress had meant to limit 502(a)(3) to any fiduciary who violates any provision of ERISA or any person who violates any provision of ERISA, it would have said so."
1999.99-579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,333.368,335.358,--Where is that cited in your reply brief?
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,335.358,341.973,"It's... Mr. Chief Justice, it's on page 1, and it carries over onto page 2 in the first footnote."
1999.99-579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,341.973,342.594,Thank you.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,342.594,369.051,"And that provision says that a civil action may be brought by the Secretary of Labor or any participant beneficiary or fiduciary against any fiduciary to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision, or to obtain any other appropriate equitable relief, so when Congress wanted to limit the cause of action to any fiduciary or any person, it knew how to do it."
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.55,399.552,"Or any person who's violated, so you really think that the best--"
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,399.552,399.872,Well--
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,399.872,405.518,"--reading of this provision is that you can bring the action against anyone, even someone who has not been in violation of the law."
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,405.518,406.467,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.596,446.364,"Well, but it doesn't say just constructive... I mean, it's an extraordinary, extraordinary intent to attribute to Congress, that it essentially left it up to the courts to decide who is liable."
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,446.364,447.165,"Well, it is based--"
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.165,465.648,"Because I mean, a court could say, somebody who knew of this violative transaction, who has no other connection with the thing at all, just knew about it and did not blow the whistle, presumably a court could say that person should cough up some money."
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,465.648,468.89,"--Well, first, this is in the language of the statute."
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.513,474.954,That's right.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,474.954,477.976,"And second, it is a self limiting type of relief."
1999.99-579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.5,491.725,"Well, a constructive trust is pretty much of a gimmick, isn't it, that courts have made up to do something that they wanted to do and couldn't find any other reason for it?"
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,492.005,494.179,"--Well, I wouldn't call it a gimmick, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,503.095,506.765,I thought you were seeking... your client was seeking restitution.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,506.765,516.472,"--Well, restitution pursuant to a constructive trust is a classic form of equitable relief, so that is... that's how a constructive trust gets into it."
1999.99-579,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,516.472,518.865,Where you allege unjust enrichment--
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,518.865,519.143,Yes.
1999.99-579,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,519.143,526.8,--on the basis that the respondent was employed as the investment advisor for this plan--
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,526.8,528.38,Yes.
1999.99-579,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.38,532.503,--and you allege knowingly sold worthless property.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,532.503,539.018,"Yes, precisely, and again, to switch back to... we have the narrower argument and the broader argument."
1999.99-579,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,551.316,553.387,"Well, it doesn't say that exactly, does it?"
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,559.881,559.951,--Yes.
1999.99-579,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,559.951,561.103,--and so forth.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,561.103,591.102,"That is correct, Your Honor, but the Court has always refused, in construing ERISA and other statutes as well, to look simply to any single phrase, and when you look not only to 406 but to other provisions such as 3003, that's a provision of ERISA that says... it refers expressly to a part... a violation of section 406 by a party in interest, so there's an express statement in the text of the statute that a party in interest can violate section 406."
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.102,591.403,Mr.--
1999.99-579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,591.403,594.365,"--It provides penalties by the Secretary of Labor, doesn't it?"
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,594.365,601.481,"Well, section 3003 simply is a reporting provision coordinating between the Labor and Treasury Departments."
1999.99-579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,653.854,661.079,"But Mr. Long, why does that follow, because in other schemes... take title VII, for example, of the Fair Labor Standards Act."
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,695.573,703.107,"--Well, and our submission is that Congress did make it clear here in these carefully crafted provisions of section 502."
1999.99-579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,703.107,709.462,"Well, the conspicuous absence is, here it says, executive, you can go after the party in interest."
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,709.462,710.734,That's correct.
1999.99-579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,710.734,724.115,"It doesn't say, private plaintiff, you can go against the party in interest, and that is what these other statutes that have dual enforcement schemes do say."
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,724.115,751.483,"Well, but in this statute, I mean, in each case the court's obligation, of course, is to follow the plain language as Congress wrote it, unless there's some strong reason to depart from it, and here the language of 502(a)(3) and 502(a)(5), which is a parallel provision that gives the Secretary of Labor authority to bring an action for appropriate equitable relief for any violation of ERISA, both of those provisions are broadly written."
1999.99-579,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,774.276,791.928,"Mr. Long, with respect to the catch all I've been assuming, and tell me whether my assumption's right, that but for ERISA and its preemptive effect, you would be entitled to seek this kind of equitable remedy in a State court under its equity jurisdiction."
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,791.928,792.669,That's correct.
1999.99-579,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,792.669,815.476,And so the real reason... I guess one of your reasons for saying you've got to find it in the catch all here is that it would have been very odd for Congress in effect to take away a remedy for the benefit of the ERISA beneficiaries by preemption without allowing it under the Federal jurisdiction created by the statute.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,815.476,844.865,"Yes, that's absolutely correct, but our argument is not simply that we don't think Congress in any respect could have cut back on any rights that participants or beneficiaries had pre ERISA, and our argument is again based on the language of the statute, this carefully crafted language in section 502, and when you see how the pieces dovetail together it's just clear that Congress did not limit this to any person who violates ERISA, or any fiduciary who violates ERISA."
1999.99-579,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,844.865,862.425,"But if you're right... what... the thing... I'm having trouble with the case, and maybe it's only tangentially relevant, but if you're right, I thought stockbrokers are always selling investments to people, and companies hire stockbrokers and so do plans, and why wouldn't you do this."
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,878.167,878.596,Well--
1999.99-579,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,878.596,881.648,So there's something I'm missing in how this statute works.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,881.648,882.559,"--Well, I think... a few points."
1999.99-579,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,894.167,896.721,My difficulty is probably something very basic.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,903.353,903.713,--Well--
1999.99-579,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,903.713,907.757,It seems to say you can't buy computers from a computer servicing company.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,907.757,907.917,--Right.
1999.99-579,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,908.287,913.381,"It seems to say you can't buy investments from a stockbroker, and yet I thought that's their job."
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,913.381,913.681,--And--
1999.99-579,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,913.681,916.742,And so there's something basic I'm not understanding.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,917.053,917.524,--Well--
1999.99-579,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,917.524,921.107,"--Maybe it's not relevant, in which case just tell me that and don't answer."
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,921.107,927.101,"--No, I mean, I think in part you're quite right, and it shows how serious Congress was about these prohibited transaction provisions."
1999.99-579,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,940.56,946.624,You're saying the real issue in this case is whether Salomon Brothers is or is not a party in interest.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,946.624,952.619,"Well, I think if we get by the issue that's before the Court today, that will be an issue."
1999.99-579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,956.5,965.128,"Well, isn't it... didn't Salomon say that if it loses here it does want to contest whether it's a party in interest and whether this is a prohibited transaction?"
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,965.128,965.496,"Oh, yes."
1999.99-579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,973.062,974.532,So we are supposed to assume for purposes--
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,974.532,974.713,--Yes.
1999.99-579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,974.713,980.765,--of the decision two things that may be the case to be decided no matter what we said here.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,989.782,990.023,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-579,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,990.023,991.976,Although neither may turn out to be the case.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,991.976,992.527,That's correct.
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.947,997.291,Although you say it doesn't matter whether Salomon Brothers is a party in interest.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,998.571,998.751,--Well--
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,998.751,999.532,--you say that you--
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,999.532,999.943,"--Well, it--"
1999.99-579,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.943,1002.775,--You would have a cause of action under this provision whether or not.
1999.99-579,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1002.775,1003.365,--It... no.
1999.99-579,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.339,1026.58,"Very well, Mr. Long."
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1028.143,1038.401,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-579,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1122.255,1148.992,"Well, the part that was worrying me about that is that it says, other services necessary for the operation of the plan, and so I could imagine an enormous litigation growing up where the plans are saying in respect to a losing investment, well, the service wasn't actually necessary, it was sort of a frill, and therefore we get back the loss that we incurred."
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1165.332,1181.414,"Well, Your Honor, as it stands, however, the parties in interest and fiduciaries are all bound by these rules and regulations because they can be subject up to 100 percent penalty and tax on these transactions, but the structure of the law makes clear that the--"
1999.99-579,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1181.414,1194.222,"But that's up to an administrator to bring that suit, and I'm willing to, and I think Justice Breyer is willing to assume some good faith on the part of the Secretary or on the part of the Department of the Treasury in bringing a lawsuit."
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1198.606,1207.812,"--Well, Your Honor, the Secretary of Labor in good faith needs to be able to come to court to also, to get restitution under the parallel provision of (a)(5)."
1999.99-579,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.574,1268.831,"Is it the Government's position, as it is petitioner's, that it is not only an interested person who can be sued under this provision but also anybody else, so long as there's a violative... a violation?"
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1268.831,1279.009,"So long as they are a person from whom appropriate equitable relief can be obtained to redress a violation, and that is quite a limiting principle, Your Honor."
1999.99-579,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1283.012,1283.982,"Well, who says it is?"
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1317.707,1324.182,"Your Honor, I think 25 years of experience or more would actually show that it's not a problem and not extraordinary."
1999.99-579,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1337.462,1348.388,"Well, Ms. Brinkmann, isn't the... I'm searching for the same thing that Justices Breyer and Scalia are searching for, and is the answer maybe simpler than we tend to assume?"
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1360.977,1363.458,--That's correct.
1999.99-579,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1363.458,1366.551,"The stock goes down, nobody's going to be able to sue."
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1372.885,1380.302,I do think the concerns Your Honor... were very well put by Your Honor that it may be the scope of the prohibited transaction--
1999.99-579,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1380.302,1392.45,"All right, but in respect to that particularly, I guess that you can buy an investment from a broker dealer provided that a certain number of conditions listed in the regulation are met."
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1392.45,1393.461,--In addition--
1999.99-579,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.461,1408.061,"And those are fairly technical, and therefore we're asking the brokers and the dealers to become ERISA experts, understand that regulation, and if they get it wrong, it's not just that the Secretary might sue them."
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1425.793,1428.193,"--Your Honor, I can understand that."
1999.99-579,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1474.094,1482.14,"Ms. Brinkmann, do you know what exemption is urged by Salomon Brothers to cover them?"
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1490.705,1501.901,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor, because the reason that the... the transaction in question is the selling of these interests in the hotel industry, the hotel--"
1999.99-579,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1501.901,1505.664,Do you know what exemption is urged?
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1505.664,1505.935,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.99-579,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1532.632,1533.834,Do the two go together?
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1537.857,1546.653,"That would be a difficult matter, I think, as far as statutory construction would go, Your Honor, but we would certainly urge that the Court find some--"
1999.99-579,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1546.653,1550.435,Because the very same language is used in the provision allowing the Secretary to sue.
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1552.578,1553.7,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-579,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1574.203,1582.448,"Yes, but you can't want to open it up to recovery of every bad investment that the plan makes."
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1582.448,1583.028,"But it's not, Your Honor."
1999.99-579,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1585.51,1588.024,That's what everybody is concerned about.
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1588.024,1591.336,"--I think the long history of this makes clear that it is not, Your Honor."
1999.99-579,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1608.928,1614.403,"What, in your view, would make this a prohibited transaction?"
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1614.403,1621.629,Under subsections (a) and (d) there was an exchange of plan assets.
1999.99-579,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.011,1643.283,"Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann."
1999.99-579,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1643.283,1643.554,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1999.99-579,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1643.554,1646.308,"Mr. Hein, we'll hear from you."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1646.308,1651.781,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1679.571,1680.963,May I just ask you about 406?
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1680.963,1681.442,--Sure.
1999.99-579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.442,1682.143,I've got to kind of go a little slow.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1691.971,1694.052,If it was--
1999.99-579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1694.052,1702.946,"If it is... was the transaction at issue in this suit prohibited by 406(1)(a) or 406(1)(b), in your view?"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1702.946,1706.018,"--That is an issue, Justice Stevens, that has yet to be determined."
1999.99-579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.328,1717.629,That's what I mean.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1729.467,1733.62,"--Again, Justice Stevens, with the caveat that we will be disputing that in the future--"
1999.99-579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1733.62,1733.791,Correct.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1734.251,1735.052,"--Yes, for present purpose--"
1999.99-579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.052,1742.759,"But we're assuming that they may be able to prove whatever they have to prove on remand that would establish those facts, and your argument is, that doesn't matter, you still win?"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1742.759,1743.978,--That's correct.
1999.99-579,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1743.978,1747.581,But you're not... you don't win because it was not a prohibited transaction.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1747.581,1757.588,"At this level we win because there is no prohibition directed at the counterparty, whether it's a party in interest or not."
1999.99-579,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1757.588,1757.798,I understand.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1757.798,1758.828,The statute is clear.
1999.99-579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1776.081,1779.174,"No, but the ones we're talking about do refer to a party in interest."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1788.491,1809.995,"--Yes, Justice Stevens, those provisions do refer to the party in interest, but the entire section, 406, prohibited transactions, is structured to prohibit conduct by the fiduciary, so in section 406(a) there's a list of prohibitions that says the fiduciary shall not, and one of those does not even refer to party in interest."
1999.99-579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1809.995,1814.597,"Yes, but what you're only saying, it's a prohibited transaction because of misconduct by the fiduciary."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1815.628,1817.37,"That's exactly correct, Justice Stevens."
1999.99-579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1817.37,1830.11,"It nevertheless is a prohibited transaction, and the argument by them is that a party in interest who engages in such a transaction knowingly may not keep the benefit of the transaction without being unjustly enriched."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1830.908,1834.11,"Well, at the district court level petitioner's argument was strict liability."
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1861.138,1867.443,"--Why isn't what you've just said the answer to the problem that I earlier raised, or that we were talking about?"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1917.375,1938.93,"What we're saying, Justice Breyer, is that Congress made a deliberate choice, and this was a legislative compromise, a legislative compromise where there would be this administrative mechanism, civil penalties or excise taxes as an administrative mechanism that could be pursued to obtain a correction or restitution from the--"
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1938.93,1950.086,"Why would Congress not have wanted to follow the more elementary sort of law of getting assets back for trusts in this kind of situation, where we get out of the case--"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1950.086,1951.208,--Well--
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1951.208,1952.939,--the party at interest issue--
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1952.939,1953.5,--I think--
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1953.5,1959.086,--so we focus on a clear case where there really is a party in interest and they shouldn't have done it and so forth?
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,1959.086,1970.333,"--Justice Breyer, let me address you in two ways, because I think that the first question that you're asking is, in effect, why would Congress have set it up this way?"
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2079.342,2104.901,"Mr. Hein, why, any more than many schemes where Congress has said, like the Fair Labor Standards Act, if the Secretary went out suing all the employers who violated the wage and hours law there would be no need for private suits, so I don't think that what you just said really holds up, because there are many times when Congress provides for executive action and penalties and still allows a private action."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2104.901,2105.632,"--Yes, but--"
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2105.632,2106.523,They're not inconsistent.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2106.523,2110.697,"--Justice Ginsburg, you're correct that they're not inconsistent."
1999.99-579,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.95,2152.943,"The difference here is that it is not just the allowance of suits by private individuals, but it is also an allowance of a suit by the Secretary herself for the restitution, which would make the other administrative remedies that the Secretary has available in order to coerce restitution superfluous."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2152.943,2154.085,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2154.085,2165.953,"So it's... 502(a)(5), you say these two travel together, and the Secretary no more than the private individual can bring a suit against anyone other than the fiduciary."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2166.484,2174.962,"That's correct, with the caveat that you do have the excise tax and the civil penalty scheme, and--"
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2174.962,2187.758,"--But the Secretary's right is identical to the private person's right, and that is, it's only against the fiduciary under (a)(3) and (a)(5), is that--"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2187.758,2189.581,--That's I think substantially correct.
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2196.884,2198.617,--But I wanted to know what is your position.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2214.596,2219.25,--That is correct in this situation.
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2254.824,2261.748,"But I want... my question really was, you see the same limits on (a)(5) as (a)(3)?"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2278.619,2278.93,--Yes.
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2301.004,2310.01,"Well, I asked if that was your position that the Secretary has no broader authority than the private suitor--"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2310.01,2311.53,Under--
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2311.53,2315.504,--to bring this kind of suit against a party in interest--
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2315.504,2315.764,--Under--
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2315.764,2319.277,--or anyone who was allegedly unjustly enriched.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2319.277,2326.082,"--Under (a)(5), that is correct, but of course under (a)(6) they can bring an action to collect a civil penalty."
1999.99-579,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2346.264,2349.878,But you couldn't get back the billion dollars that the employers made off with?
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2349.878,2351.47,"Well, you could--"
1999.99-579,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2351.47,2351.9,How?
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2351.9,2362.748,"--if you were successful through the administrative mechanism of forcing the correction, assuming that the person who has made off with the money is a party in interest."
1999.99-579,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2383.143,2391.941,"If you prevail on your principal argument here, are State causes of action for recovery preempted?"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2391.941,2401.515,"Our position is that if Salomon, for example... our position is, Salomon is not a party in interest."
1999.99-579,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2415.015,2418.978,"But if you are a party in interest, but prevail on your argument here, then what?"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2418.978,2440.282,"Then I think, Your Honor, there may be a closer question, because under Pilot Life there's a recognition that Congress... if Congress set up a remedial scheme to deal with parties in interest and the remedial scheme was to rely on administrative enforcement, the civil penalty and the excise tax, there would be an argument, I think, under Pilot Life that that is exclusive."
1999.99-579,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2525.732,2536.718,"But you have other doctrines that can take care of it, like the clean hands doctrine, if this was to be an equitable remedy, that would bar some people in the situation you're describing."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2536.718,2551.768,"That may be, but Mr. Chief Justice, I would go back to the fact... and this is central here, that under 502(a)(3) there has to be... and this Court indicated this in Mertens, embraced it the next year in Central Bank."
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2564.377,2587.532,"But Mr. Hein, why isn't it... if this is... the Secretary of the Treasury can get these stiff penalties against the party in interest specifically, why isn't it clear from that that this transaction is prohibited as to the party in interest, otherwise how could the... how could Congress say, Secretary, you can hit them with 100 percent?"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2607.755,2608.446,--Yes.
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2625.328,2652.877,"But I'm just trying to clarify the argument that you were making before, which seemed to say that the person, the party in interest is out of it, and that is certainly not the case, because 4975 puts the party in interest right into the position of being a violator of 406 prohibited transactions."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2652.877,2661.623,"No, Justice Ginsburg, because 502(a)(3) refers to violations of title I. 4975 is part of title II."
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2665.156,2668.208,"But where does it pick up the word, prohibited transaction from?"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2669.32,2679.337,"--4975 is a self contained excise tax provision, and was established as an excise tax provision quite deliberately."
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2680.367,2687.363,Does it or does it not hit a party in interest who engages in a prohibited transaction?
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2698.159,2728.8,"--With regard to certain parties in interest the answer is yes, but it does not create a duty or a liability under ERISA enforceable in suit under (a)(3) and (a)(5), both of which are confined to title I provisions, and 4975 in creating the excise tax mechanism, and yes, the Secretary of Treasury can go after a disqualified person, which is most parties in interest, if the other conditions of 4975 are met to collect the excise tax."
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2728.8,2746.801,"And... but in effect and in purpose, to get that party in interest to disgorge and return to make restitution, because if the party does, then they're not subject to the 100 percent tax."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2746.801,2748.043,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.99-579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.838,2755.178,Mr. Hein--
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2755.178,2776.891,"--relative to most parties in interest who qualify as disqualified persons and to me this proves our point, because, as is evident from the legislative history, the Senate was proposing both the administrative mechanism with excise taxes and expressly imposing a civil duty on the party in interest."
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2777.722,2786.658,--The only simple point I wanted to make is that you can't say the party in interest is not liable for entering a prohibited transaction.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2788.791,2788.961,--Yes.
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2789.452,2791.422,I think Justice Stevens had a question.
1999.99-579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.422,2805.113,"May I ask you one question about... it's a little bit of a variation of Justice Breyer's question, but the other appropriate relief language in 502(3), or... what about rescission?"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2837.003,2842.406,"--That's correct, because 502(a)(3) does not create duties or liabilities."
1999.99-579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2842.406,2847.549,"Well, I understand, but I... but you would apply the same reasoning to the rescission suit as you would to the unjust enrichment claim."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2847.549,2847.95,Yes.
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2853.175,2853.336,All right.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2901.468,2905.462,--I think that is certainly--
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.462,2907.552,The heart of it.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2907.552,2907.843,--Yes.
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2907.843,2909.385,I'm not saying the little... because you're an expert.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2909.803,2910.084,Yes.
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2910.084,2911.466,--all these extra things--
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2911.466,2912.435,"I think, Justice Breyer--"
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2912.435,2913.337,"--that I don't know, but I mean, is that the heart of it?"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2913.337,2916.138,--that may well be getting to the heart of it.
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2916.138,2916.398,All right.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2949.572,2950.814,I think the answer--
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2950.814,2951.204,And you're back to your--
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2951.204,2957.586,"--The answer is, there has to be a threshold duty and liability under ERISA to point to."
1999.99-579,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.749,2979.671,"--Mr. Hein, about the tax."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2992.069,2993.409,The tax--
1999.99-579,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2993.409,2995.863,How does it get back to the fund?
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,2995.863,2999.394,"--Justice Scalia, the tax is the prospective sanction--"
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2999.394,3000.075,"No, no, penalty."
1999.99-579,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3001.807,3005.958,A tax equal to 100 percent of the amount involved.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3005.958,3006.158,--Yes.
1999.99-579,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3006.158,3006.779,That's a tax.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3007.951,3009.051,Justice Scalia--
1999.99-579,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3009.051,3012.083,Does the Government turn around and give it to the defrauded--
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3012.083,3023.212,"--Justice Scalia, the scheme that Congress came up with was one where this tax or penalty would be used as a lever by the Government to force correction."
1999.99-579,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3023.212,3031.927,"--I know, but you have an intransigent object, and he says, you know, I don't like this fund."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3033.527,3035.229,Then--
1999.99-579,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3035.229,3036.73,And so he coughs up the 100 percent.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3037.911,3038.89,--Then the Government--
1999.99-579,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3038.89,3039.812,The Government keeps it.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3039.812,3041.772,"--The Government would keep it, and again--"
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3041.772,3052.341,"Has that ever happened in all the application of this penalty, that somebody has opted to give... in effect, to make restitution to the Government rather than to the trustee?"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3052.341,3054.915,"--I would have two answers, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3072.436,3077.288,"It's serving its purpose to get the money back to the plan, rather than in the coffers of the Treasury."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3077.288,3078.099,--That would be my--
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3078.099,3080.07,"Yes, but still it's an important point, isn't it?"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3109.589,3128.352,"--Justice Breyer, if it does not have its desired force as the sanction to force the correction... the whole theory of the excise tax and civil penalty was, it would force people to correct, and so the plan would get the money back, and I might add that the plan in a situation... take this situation."
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3139.983,3140.153,"Yes, but--"
1999.99-579,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3140.153,3140.921,--If the fiduciary is solvent.
1999.99-579,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3140.921,3141.672,Yes.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3141.672,3148.268,There's provision in ERISA that a plan can insist that it's fiduciaries have insurance.
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3178.427,3191.775,"But in this very case, the whole object of going after Salomon, I take it, is that they are the party that ended up with the money and nobody else and then the investment, when it was in the hands of the plan, went down the tube."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3199.732,3214.733,"--Well, here there are two fiduciaries, Ameritech Corp., which is the plan sponsor, and NISA, which was its appointed investment advisor, and Ameritech Corp. was actively involved in the transaction with NISA."
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3218.572,3226.439,"Yes, but just the simple point is, who ended up with the money and who had nothing as a result of this?"
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3236.565,3249.493,"--Yes, that is correct, Justice Ginsburg, but when you look at the potential for pernicious consequences with litigation, private litigation with the benefit of hindsight, I think this case illustrates such a situation."
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3251.354,3254.456,--This is not getting into the... I don't mean to get into the merits of it.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3264.694,3265.445,--But you can--
1999.99-579,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3265.445,3272.841,"And then of course you would have to show that it was indeed a prohibited transaction, that you are dealing with a party in interest."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3272.841,3276.094,--But you could also sue the fiduciary.
1999.99-579,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3294.894,3300.307,It's not displacing any common law liability if we don't find liability here.
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3300.307,3301.439,That's correct.
1999.99-579,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3301.739,3309.426,"Well, is that so, because if you posit a common law situation in which there... let's leave ERISA out of it."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3359.669,3376.372,"--Well, Justice Souter, what I was referring to is here the act of a trustee for a trust dealing with... transacting with the service provider to that trust was not a breach by the trustee and was not a breach by the service provider under the common law, and I think this--"
1999.99-579,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3376.372,3377.932,"Well, nobody's claiming it is."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3391.752,3410.473,"--And Justice Souter, again I would point to this Court's opinion in Mertens, echoed the next year in Central Bank, where this Court indicated that there has to be a substantive duty and liability under ERISA, that there was no provision of ERISA that prohibited participation in the fiduciary breach--"
1999.99-579,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3410.473,3420.881,"Well, that gets us perhaps back to Justice Ginsburg's question, but it... I guess the bottom line of your argument is the one that came out in your earlier answer to Justice Breyer."
1999.99-579,2,38019,peter_c_hein,,3449.489,3461.067,"--Justice Souter, that's the legislative compromise that Congress worked out both as to the enforcement scheme as well as its decision on preemption."
1999.99-579,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3461.067,3462.269,"Thank you, Mr. Hein."
1999.99-579,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3464.339,3467.801,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-579,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3621.642,3637.771,"Would it be reasonable to say, this is equitable relief, so in an instance where the only violation of this reg you cited that makes it a prohibited transaction is a technical matter like failing to keep adequate records--"
1999.99-579,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3637.771,3638.372,"--Oh, yes."
1999.99-579,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3638.372,3640.565,--then it is not equitable to get back the money?
1999.99-579,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3640.565,3644.228,"That's very important, and I mean, equity itself is self limiting."
1999.99-579,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3662.009,3668.854,"How would (a)(3) cover the situation if we find for you, of payments that were made excessive?"
1999.99-579,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,3673.066,3675.77,"That is a prohibited transaction, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-579,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3693.361,3695.251,"Thank you, Mr. Long."
