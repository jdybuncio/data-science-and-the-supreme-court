1978.77-926,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,66.555,"We'll hear arguments next in 77-926, Cannon against the University of Chicago."
1978.77-926,0,29631,john_m_cannon,,69.194,73.527,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-926,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,218.515,233.771,If HEW sees a violation here do you have any hypothesis to suggest why HEW has not proceeded to enforce the statute as you construe the statute?
1978.77-926,0,29631,john_m_cannon,,233.771,245.313,"Yes, I -- two things, I -- obviously, there was some confusion between the District 5 office in Chicago and the National Office."
1978.77-926,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,288.226,296.979,Would you agree that the Congress has given HEW a lethal weapon to deal with these problems?
1978.77-926,0,29631,john_m_cannon,,296.979,315.907,"Quite frankly Your Honor, the Carnegie Foundation characterized it as the atomic bomb and I think it's perhaps too lethal in the sense that we referred in our reply brief to -- going through the fund-cutoff procedures with HEW as playing Russian roulette with an institution."
1978.77-926,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,335.696,357.21,"Well, Congress -- you're making a very good argument that the Congress should have affirmatively, clearly and unequivocally provided for a private action as an alternative but is that an argument that we should weigh?"
1978.77-926,0,29631,john_m_cannon,,357.21,370.43,"Well, in considering why they may not have done that, I would point out that legislating in that particular area gets very touchy particularly with the background being Title VI."
1978.77-926,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,482.906,484.501,How many of them are there do you suppose?
1978.77-926,0,29631,john_m_cannon,,487.323,503.35,"Cases, the current predicted backlog on the civil rights area for office of civil rights is the 3570 predicted as of this October with 889 involving allegations of sex discrimination."
1978.77-926,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,503.35,515.015,"So if you're talking about private enforcement, I suppose you're talking about the possibilities of that many cases plus a lot others that would -- which would never get into the HEW at all."
1978.77-926,0,29631,john_m_cannon,,515.015,516.523,Right.
1978.77-926,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,522.948,525.098,We could easily handle those.
1978.77-926,0,29631,john_m_cannon,,525.098,526.014,Not at all.
1978.77-926,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,589.147,600.136,"Now, you've spoken of these numbers, that 55 million figure of course is pretty staggering but 3500 isn't all that staggering."
1978.77-926,0,29631,john_m_cannon,,631.266,644.12,"Absolutely and it's really, as HEW pointed out in their brief, the availability of the judicial remedy that is going to lead to meaningful internal compliance procedures."
1978.77-926,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,688.378,689.893,Mr. Solicitor General.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,1969.077,1972.287,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-926,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2086.388,2087.78,You're speaking -- the reply brief of the --
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2087.78,2088.61,Yes sir I am.
1978.77-926,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.61,2089.969,-- of the federal respondents?
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2089.969,2091.186,"No, of the petitioner --"
1978.77-926,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2091.186,2092.444,Okay.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2092.444,2094.464,-- Mr. Justice White.
1978.77-926,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2094.464,2096.464,Filed January 4th?
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2096.464,2097.979,Yes sir.
1978.77-926,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2101.905,2101.932,(Voice Overlap) it was January 4th --
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2101.932,2104.14,-- and I'll refer to page 14 of that brief.
1978.77-926,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2104.14,2105.268,Alright.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2105.268,2113.476,By the exchange between Senator Talmadge and Senator Humphrey has described and it concludes with the following quotation which is set out in the brief.
1978.77-926,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.162,2118.237,Mr. Bernstein I'm sorry --
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2118.237,2118.29,Yes sir.
1978.77-926,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2118.29,2119.619,-- what page of the reply brief on the --
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2119.619,2120.073,I'm sorry.
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2384.772,2390.048,Doesn't that boil down Mr. Bernstein to suggesting that they were not opposed to a private right of action though.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2390.048,2395.028,"Well, sir if you anticipate me because Senator Keating then immediately chimed in."
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2395.096,2396.308,Talking about his own bill.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2396.308,2396.673,Pardon?
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2396.673,2397.808,Talked about his own bill.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2397.808,2407.692,"Well, no, he's -- he comes right along and he said that he understood the point that Senator Case was making and he was glad he got it cleared up but he had another problem."
1978.77-926,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2458.334,2464.734,You say that negates any idea that Congress submitted it because they thought it was unnecessary and already in there.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2464.734,2465.588,Yes sir.
1978.77-926,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2471.879,2473.22,Did Senator Case introduced --
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2473.22,2473.676,Pardon?
1978.77-926,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.676,2480.113,-- an amendment -- did Senator Case introduce an amendment along that line?
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2480.113,2482.776,"Well, if he did sir, I'm not aware of it."
1978.77-926,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2482.776,2483.868,"Senator Keating did, did he not?"
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2483.868,2492.22,"Senator Keat -- well, what Senator Keating did was ask the Department of Justice of drafting the bills to include such a provision and they did not."
1978.77-926,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2492.22,2493.736,But was that earlier Mr. Bernstein?
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2493.736,2494.357,That was earlier.
1978.77-926,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2494.357,2494.523,Yes.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2494.523,2500.567,"But three weeks later then the -- I'm -- what I quoted occurred on March 13, 1964, three weeks later."
1978.77-926,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2572.461,2576.406,"So he says, this was not included in the bill, he means the Department of Justice didn't include it in its bill."
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2576.406,2576.965,That's correct.
1978.77-926,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2596.89,2600.167,"Yes, but the request by Senator Keating was to Department of Justice."
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2604.406,2605.384,That's correct.
1978.77-926,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2612.433,2620.316,I don't see how you can consistently say they had try to get it in when they didn't propose an amendment.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2620.316,2620.864,"Well, certainly if (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-926,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2620.864,2621.696,They assumed that they --
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2621.696,2622.264,Yes sir.
1978.77-926,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2622.264,2630.773,-- knew they could propose an amendment or why didn't they just talk?
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2630.773,2633.655,"Well, I suppose all of the congressional debates are just talk sir and that's --"
1978.77-926,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2633.655,2637.694,"On -- but when they put an amendment, it's no longer talk."
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2637.694,2640.913,"Well, what he is saying is he tried to get it and he didn't get it and I don't see how we could --"
1978.77-926,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2640.913,2648.72,"Well, why didn't he -- why did he -- did he ever make an explanation as to why he didn't offer an amendment?"
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2648.72,2653.415,I don't know except his concluding statement which I didn't read where he said both the Senator from Connecticut --
1978.77-926,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2653.415,2654.355,What page?
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2654.355,2654.41,Pardon?
1978.77-926,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2654.41,2655.063,What page?
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2655.063,2668.923,"Oh, I'm reading in -- on page 24 of our brief where he completes the statement before the Senate where he says, however, both the Senator from Connecticut and I are grateful that our other suggestions were adopted by the Justice Department."
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2679.252,2679.715,May I ask Mr. --
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2679.715,2680.96,Yes sir.
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2680.96,2685.016,Your comments go to Title VI only or to Title VI or to Title IX.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2685.016,2686.876,No sir -- and Title IX sir because --
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2686.876,2696.062,But I gather -- your comments to the extent they address Title VI disagree with Mr. Justice Stevens' conclusions in Bakke?
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2696.062,2696.793,Yes sir.
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2696.793,2697.137,I see.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2698.468,2700.586,Yes.
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2701.952,2703.136,Lest you must (Inaudible)
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2703.136,2704.15,"Yes, I think it was wrong."
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2704.15,2705.709,Of course you do.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2709.465,2709.976,I think so.
1978.77-926,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2710.701,2718.365,"But even if that were true that -- if the Congress came along and enacted Title IX, there could be a different provision in Title IX."
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2718.365,2718.937,It could be.
1978.77-926,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2718.937,2732.014,There could be a different legislative history in Title IX or there could be the existing legal environment could be such that you had to assume Congress knew what the law was or what the lower courts set the law was.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2732.014,2732.592,That's correct.
1978.77-926,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.985,2765.559,(Voice Overlap) the courts had already sent what they thought that Title VI did even if you might disagree with what some lower court said.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2773.36,2781.938,"Well, as the Court of Appeals pointed out below, there was no indication that any Senator or any legislator was aware of anyone of these cases that had been referred to in their briefs."
1978.77-926,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2792.04,2808.284,"And I take it that it also in the legislature viewed Title IX, there were some Senators who expressly addressed the question and said, it should -- this shouldn't be -- we are not indicating that there is a private cause of action."
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2808.284,2811.947,There is an implication that there is such a thing but I haven't found.
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2816.568,2820.492,Isn't it more accurate to say what they said was we don't intend to change the law whatever it is now?
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2820.492,2822.419,That's -- this is the thrust of the law.
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2830.86,2835.659,Nothing of the colloquy that Congressman Railsback in that Judge Bauer referred to.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2835.659,2841.225,"Oh, that referred not to the adoption of Title IX but to the Civil Rights attorney's award --"
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2841.225,2842.247,"Oh, that's --"
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2842.247,2846.501,-- which occurred just last year while this case was in the Court of Appeals on a hearing.
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2874.931,2876.379,"Well, is that fair Mr. Bernstein."
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2884.742,2885.851,"Well Your Honor, I --"
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2885.851,2888.05,There's no exclusivity provision in the statute.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2888.05,2896.658,I suppose we have trouble on how we read the words but what he says that the citizen who denies the benefits has no right to bring the suit in Court.
1978.77-926,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2899.472,2900.432,Under the bill.
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2901.331,2902.582,On the bill of their passing.
1978.77-926,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2945.712,2959.279,"You haven't mentioned --before you leave that, you haven mention the Congressman Celler, attorney, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House and certainly on top of this problem but he said over on page 25 of their brief --"
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2959.279,2960.738,"Well sir, I --"
1978.77-926,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2960.738,2964.505,Now was he -- it was he bearing on six -- Title VI?
1978.77-926,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,2964.505,2965.291,Excuse me sir.
