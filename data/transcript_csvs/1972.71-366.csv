1972.71-366,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,25.165,"Next in number 71-366, Tidewater Oil against United States and Phillips Petroleum."
1972.71-366,0,36243,moses_lasky,,27.227,30.774,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1972.71-366,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,108.978,115.988,"Well perhaps you have put your finger on the essence of the case, it works if they both feel the same way about it?"
1972.71-366,0,36243,moses_lasky,,115.988,116.182,Oh!
1972.71-366,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,124.685,129.149,"Broadly, they did not feel the same way about it for different reasons?"
1972.71-366,0,36243,moses_lasky,,129.149,131.943,They didn't consider the matter on its merits.
1972.71-366,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,510.015,513.309,You are speaking discretionary to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in this one?
1972.71-366,0,36243,moses_lasky,,513.309,513.486,Oh!
1972.71-366,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,844.938,848.739,The colloquy of course is -- this language was later coated in Brown Shoe?
1972.71-366,0,36243,moses_lasky,,848.739,849.512,Yes it was.
1972.71-366,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,849.512,853.075,And after the enactment of the new law in 1958?
1972.71-366,0,36243,moses_lasky,,853.075,857.115,Now the point the Brown Shoe was that it was pure dictum.
1972.71-366,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,970.533,974.202,Mr. Lasky let me get back with you if you will.
1972.71-366,0,36243,moses_lasky,,990.367,991.116,Definitely.
1972.71-366,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,991.116,1000.384,"Now, then I suppose it was decided and accepted that would be final disposition of the case there will no petition for cert."
1972.71-366,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1009.464,1010.841,"Well, I can answer that."
1972.71-366,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1010.841,1015.528,The final disposition of the case was to here as a matter of right?
1972.71-366,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1015.528,1020.246,The Expediting Act was enacted under certain suppositions.
1972.71-366,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1134.019,1154.842,"Mr. Lasky, supposing that the Ninth Circuit had held otherwise as to its jurisdiction and entertained your appeal and ruled with you, would the result had been in that case goes back to the district court for a dismissal and then doesn't the government have a right to appeal under the Expediting Act to this Court?"
1972.71-366,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1154.842,1172.861,"It would have a right to appeal under the Expediting Act to this Court at the end of the whole case or immediately if the Court made a proper order I think it is under Rule 54, I don't have the exact rule number, but could have specified no reason for delay on that appeal, that is true."
1972.71-366,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1172.861,1173.48,It could.
1972.71-366,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1180.658,1181.503,Yes.
1972.71-366,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1419.42,1435.127,"Mr. Lasky, if you are right in your last contention that 1292 (b) did repeal something, it did not repeal 1292 (a)’s limitation on right to appeal injunctive decrees to the court that had jurisdiction?"
1972.71-366,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1435.127,1442.242,In this -- it not really repealed add to because 1292 (a) is a right to appeal as a right.
1972.71-366,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1529.961,1531.293,Thank you Mr. Lasky.
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1537.845,1539.86,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-366,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.231,1634.193,"Well, then was the Evarts Act and not the Expediting Act that precluded interlocutory appeals, wasn't it?"
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1634.193,1640.721,"Well, I think that question can be cleared up when I discuss the cases that have interpreted the Expediting Act."
1972.71-366,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.722,1871.873,"Mr. Randolph I have read the footnote of Brown Shoe and I do not get any impression from the footnote that the Court was even aware that 1292 (b) had been passed several years early, do you think I am wrong?"
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1871.873,1874.335,"Well, I do not know whether the Court was aware of it of it or not but -"
1972.71-366,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.335,1875.654,There is certainly no indication in the footnote there?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1875.654,1884.166,I think it's significant that the Court in making that statement as the Court has said since 1929 in all of the cases I have just discussed.
1972.71-366,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.98,1899.481,"But if they were not aware of a statute passed in 1958, certainly that footnote isn't addressed in to detain the construe --"
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1899.481,1900.101,Oh!
1972.71-366,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1940.98,1944.985,Did any of those separate opinions mention 1292 (b)?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1944.985,1962.333,"Not (b) but Mr. Justice Harlan did mention the Interlocutory Appeals Act and he said that if this were other than a Government civil antitrust case, it could have been -- the decree could have been appealed to the Courts of Appeals under 1292 (a), that’s on page 365-370 US 365."
1972.71-366,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1962.333,1970.672,"Well, all of that is generally of justice through the statement of the general rule and the general facts of the matter."
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1975.238,1978.995,"Well, I think they did in the sense that I am now about to propose to the Court."
1972.71-366,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1978.995,1982.285,I was here then and I read the opinions before they were published?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1982.285,1988.266,"1292 (b) certainly [Attempt to Laughter] certainly was not involved in any of these cases, we agree with that."
1972.71-366,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2003.905,2006.726,But Congress changes purposes in the new Act?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2006.726,2011.997,And I think that is one of the questions that I am gong to discuss.
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.563,2086.659,Except that for a (Inaudible)
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2086.659,2089.632,I am sorry I do not understand your question Mr. Justice White.
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2089.632,2094.436,"Well, is it their position they can review and give injunction orders to interlocutory exempted orders?"
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2094.436,2096.761,Is it Tidewater's position?
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2100.078,2108.639,So you think from 91 -- 992 (a) is clear that Courts of Appeals may not review interlocutory exempted orders?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2108.639,2109.21,That’s right.
1972.71-366,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2115.049,2124.899,And you said this approach that Mr. Lasky fancies would defeat the objective of having this Court and only this Court be the final arbitrator?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2124.899,2125.501,Yes.
1972.71-366,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2162.92,2168.55,"But the Expediting Act does not by its terms deal with interlocutory appeal, does it?"
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2168.55,2169.545,This Court said --
1972.71-366,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2169.545,2174.966,Does the Expediting Act by its terms deal with interlocutory appeals?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2174.966,2186.055,"Not on its face but I think you have to forget about 50 years of history and the legislative history behind it to say that Expediting Act as its purpose did not preclude interlocutory appeals, that was one of the reasons that it was passed."
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.055,2187.793,Does it say final judgments?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2187.793,2189.889,It says only final judgments on the face.
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.889,2195.397,So it does deal with interlocutory appeals since the interlocutory appeals may not be solved here?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2195.397,2198.035,"Well, that is right."
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.733,2202.416,If possibly it means that no interlocutory appeals should be taken in?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2202.416,2205.119,So that is what this Court had said for since 1929.
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.119,2206.852,(Inaudible) interlocutory appeals?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2206.852,2213.764,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked me whether one can see that on his face, it does not say interlocutory appeal and that was my -- what I was trying to --"
1972.71-366,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2213.764,2216.973,It deals with apply explicit exclusions?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2216.973,2221.873,That is right and that was not in inadvertence or that was one of the very reasons it was passed.
1972.71-366,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2221.873,2226.197,Does the legislative history give us any aid there?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2226.197,2230.236,Of the Interlocutory Appeals Act or the Expediting Act Mr. Justice?
1972.71-366,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2230.236,2232.307,"Well, either, either."
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2232.307,2238.493,"Well, with I think so and I am about to discuss, discuss that question."
1972.71-366,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2418.42,2424.761,"Mr. Randolph, is there no a statute of limitations at all in the Government civil antitrust action?"
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2424.761,2425.682,For injunctive relief?
1972.71-366,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2425.682,2426.443,For injunctive relief?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2426.443,2430.637,"There is one in the private treble-damages action, it is four years after the cause of action accrues."
1972.71-366,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2430.637,2431.745,But none under Government?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2431.745,2434.035,That is right.
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2434.035,2440.519,What would you suggest as the reason for 1292 (b)?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2440.519,2447.855,I think the reason is the same as the reason for allowing any interlocutory appeal which is simply that it says the litigants in trial courts is great deal.
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.855,2457.869,And I suppose the reasons for 1292 (b) would apply equally do the kind of the suit we have in this case?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2457.869,2458.721,Yes.
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.721,2468.835,And there would be no reason if you could think of to exclude this kind of case from 1292 (b) if you were approaching it rationally (Inaudible)?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2468.835,2469.993,Well --
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.993,2471.207,You would have your interlocutory of appeal?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2471.207,2472.771,"Yes, I can think of a reason."
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.771,2475.489,"You have an interlocutory appeal somewhere, anyway?"
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2475.489,2476.956,"Well, let me just say this."
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.238,2557.537,Now is that -- are those reasons expressed in the --
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2557.537,2558.283,In the committee report?
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.283,2558.611,Yes.
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2558.611,2564.957,"Yes, they are."
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.99,2582.747,"So you think there is some reason, some sensible reason for saying that the policy of 1292 should not reach cases like this?"
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2582.747,2583.425,Yes.
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2647.714,2665.191,Do you agree that if Court of Appeals had allowed this interlocutory appeal and it decided for Tidewater that -- that would that -- the matter would have gone back to the District Court and that issue would have been appealable here by the government?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2665.191,2666.682,"It would depend, it would depend."
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.423,2679.636,"I know, but if that -- that means that if you don't have an appeal as a right?"
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2679.636,2693.914,"Well, if it goes back, this is a question that has never been decided by the Court, but it's possible, when you have multiple parties in the case under Rule 54 (d) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, a district judge may enter an order as to one party --"
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.914,2694.329,This is the final --
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2694.329,2699.681,-- a final judgment order and then we may appeal just simply that part of the case under the Expediting Act.
1972.71-366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2699.681,2700.887,As a final judgment of both party?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2700.887,2712.929,"As the final judgment, but anyway take for example, a case that derives under the Clayton -- Section 7 of the Clayton Act and the question in the case is that is there is a motion to dismiss by the defender."
1972.71-366,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2780.861,2781.604,Well --
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2781.604,2782.181,Suppose --
1972.71-366,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2782.181,2785.126,That wouldn't be the only basis on which the appeal could be taken.
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2788.593,2788.923,Yes.
1972.71-366,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2790.735,2792.088,For following the Court of Appeals?
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2792.088,2792.849,Right.
1972.71-366,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2843.234,2850.42,"Mr. Randolph, supposing that we were to hold that 1292 (b) did apply to this sort of situation."
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2868.431,2873.071,"Well, I just have no basis on which to make that judgment."
1972.71-366,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2889.373,2893.614,"District judges do not traditionally act that way very often, Mr. Randolph?"
1972.71-366,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2893.614,2898.967,"Thankfully not, I maybe hypothetical with myself, but anyway that possibility is real."
1972.71-366,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3001.147,3002.58,Thank you Mr. Randolph.
1972.71-366,2,36243,moses_lasky,,3004.134,3006.7,"No, if the Court please, I have to submit."
1972.71-366,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3006.7,3007.317,Thank you gentleman.
