1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,223.138,228.181,"He was the attorney for the government, yes sir, he was one of two Court attorneys and the other prosecutors name was Keilp."

1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,233.45,252.743,"Yes sir, they are, now the government has contended that in its reply in its brief that because the court did not grant the writ as to the notes in Newmanâ€™s handwriting that we petitioners foreclose from discussing this matter."
1975.74-6293,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.542,276.866,"Well, are you assuming Mr. Smaltz that anything impeaching within the language of the Jencks Act necessarily is embraced within Brady?"
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,285.479,316.316,"Well, I am not saying that all Brady materials are necessary to Jencks materials or all the Jencks materials are necessary to Brady materials but there is an area there were they overlap and if the government fails to produce upon timely demand, materials in its possession which will impeach its key witness if all they were in gender, a violation of Jencks I submit Mr. Justice Rehnquist that they can also in gender a violation of Brady."
1975.74-6293,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,316.316,320.339,Which your authority from this Court for that proposition?
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,320.339,338.011,"Well, In Palermo vs. United States and the concurrent opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan, I believe he indicated that the commence of the constitution were closed to the surface of the decision of this Court in Jencks versus United States."
1975.74-6293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,338.011,340.762,With that opinion did not have much support for it.
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,343.227,354.647,I think that Mr. Justice Douglas in Augenblick indicated that the commence of the Sixth Amendment are closed to surface of the Jencks Act.
1975.74-6293,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,406.999,418.56,And what is your authority from this Court for that proposition that what might be playing error when reviewed by a Court of Appeals as a basis for expanding the grant of the writ in this Court?
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,418.56,455.018,"Well, Your Honor I thought that the Plain Error Doctrine is a doctrine that is used only in extraordinary circumstances but when some act or some error exists which substantially affects defendant's integrity or probable reputation of judicial proceedings, I believe that is an accepted definition of when the Plain Error Doctrine will apply and that be in the case I submit that the government is further to disclose the true character of the, of what was in its possession rises that to the level of plain error."
1975.74-6293,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,455.018,461.541,"Mr. Smaltz, let me back up a minute, when were this material handed to the Court of Appeals?"

1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,667.182,667.771,Yes sir.
1975.74-6293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,667.771,668.538,And what was the explanation?.
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,668.538,678.356,"Because Solicitor General said that they were going to order up, they were going to file these notes with this Court and also they were going to file other materials which were not part of record with this Court."

1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,692.896,697.439,"I would like to view as a concession Your Honor, but I do not think the government so regarded it as it --"
1975.74-6293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,697.439,699.714,Why would they give you the -- why would they?

1975.74-6293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,712.807,723.118,Because they were going to be lodged in this Court and it is a practice that for counsel whenever he lodged as anything with this Court in pending litigations the adversary know about it.

1975.74-6293,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,724.945,729.183,And this was filed with the limitation in camera and examination.
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,729.183,733.76,"And at the time that the notes were filed in the appellate court, the Ninth Circuit, the government did not provide me a copy."
1975.74-6293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,733.76,741.447,"Well, my experience with Jencks Act cases I have and then quite a few since I came here, since the Jencks Act was passed since I wrote the Jencks opinion."
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,741.447,742.597,Yes sir.
1975.74-6293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,742.597,745.522,Those things were always handed up in camera.

1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,765.776,766.742,No I did not Your Honor.
1975.74-6293,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,766.742,770.078,"Well, that is the date I think left in some dike (ph)."
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,770.078,779.926,"The petition for certiorari was filed in this case on April 3, 1975."
1975.74-6293,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,938.374,941.822,On what page of the appendix do we find that?
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,941.822,968.377,"Your Honor that is at pages 48 to 50 the precise page is 48 and 49, let us turn out Mr. Newman was the 35th and last witness called by the government and its case in chief."
1975.74-6293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1077.431,1078.95,"By a reporter, you mean a court --"
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,1078.95,1081.333,"Court reporter, yes sir."
1975.74-6293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1123.383,1127.554,"Before you leave that, you did have a copy of the transcript for the May 11 interview?"
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,1127.554,1128.609,"Yes sir, I gave --."
1975.74-6293,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.609,1132.848,So you work unnoticed that there would be further conversation?
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,1132.848,1141.089,"Yes sir, Justice Steven I was and that was where our cross-examination commenced when we began it with Mr. Newman."
1975.74-6293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1224.223,1231.014,Were any of the -- I know what you are taking about now.
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,1236.218,1239.053,I do not know what they included at that time Mr. Justice Brennan.
1975.74-6293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1239.053,1241.921,You do not know when those 40 pages notes where handwritten by newsman?
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,1241.921,1244.097,No sir.
1975.74-6293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1244.097,1248.166,Certainly they have not referred to on the original transcript copy which you did have.
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,1248.166,1250.468,"No sir, they are not part of the May 11 statement."
1975.74-6293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1250.468,1257.802,Which must mean they must have been -- sometime later on one of the dates that you given us up to June.
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,1257.802,1259.714,I think that that is a fair inference.
1975.74-6293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1272.892,1274.412,As on those particular date.

1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,1280.231,1286.229,"Yes, I assume so, I never saw the notes but according to solicitor general's office, I so understand."
1975.74-6293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1286.229,1291.904,Now that you have been interrupted may I ask you some just to clear my own mind.

1975.74-6293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1300.416,1302.333,As only the discussion that is in Court of Appeal?
1975.74-6293,0,21561,donald_smaltz,,1302.333,1309.174,"Yes sir, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1975.74-6293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1309.174,1310.389,Was it 122?

1975.74-6293,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3993.601,4004.071,Why did you moved three times during the trial for Jencks Acts statements if judge Kopal already entered an order prior to trial request -- requiring the government to turn them over?
1975.74-6293,2,21561,donald_smaltz,,4004.071,4021.212,"Well, I moved three times because I believe that Mr. Lebowitz had taken notes which constituted Jencks Act statements and I believe that the prosecutor did not feel that that complied or that attorney's notes were required as Jencks Acts statements."
