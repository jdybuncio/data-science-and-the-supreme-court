1999.98-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.428,We'll hear argument next in Smith v. Robbins.
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,8.428,28.69,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1037,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,168.122,193.54,"Ms. Jorstad, the problem that I have with that is not a theoretical problem, but kind of a practical one, and that is this, that if we require a demonstration of Strickland prejudice at the habeas stage, once there's been found to be an Anders violation, if we require the demonstration of Strickland prejudice at that stage, as a practical matter, what we are going to do is require the argument of the appeal in the first instance in a Federal court."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,243.554,251.48,"Justice Souter, I believe that that's not an overall concern."
1999.98-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.132,311.362,"Ms. Jorstad, doesn't the strength of your second argument on the prejudice and so forth from Strickland depend to a certain extent on whether we agree with you that the constitutional rights for the appellants discussed in Anders do not require that the particular Anders remedy be etched in stone, that other remedies would be equally effective?"
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,320.138,321.851,"Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-1037,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,372.98,399.206,"Do you believe as a general proposition that, if this Court identifies a constitutional violation, and says the way this violation is to be avoided in the future is to follow steps A, B, and C, that any court, State or Federal for that matter, is free to say, well, we really don't like A, B, and C, we'll try C, D, and F?"
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,414.547,444.287,"I certainly don't think that any court is free to ignore this Court, but I would say that lower Federal courts certainly seem to me to be obliged, because of this Court's supervisory powers in addition to its constitutional jurisdiction, to follow whatever procedure this Court sets forth, but it has been the custom over many, many years for State courts to have some flexibility in interpreting this Court's procedural suggestions..."
1999.98-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,444.287,456.816,"Do you think this Court is free to interpret its own opinions to decide that perhaps a suggestion in the opinion, or a formula, was not mandatory but could be replaced by an equally acceptable one?"
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,456.816,458.248,"I do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-1037,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,458.649,460.621,"But if it is mandatory, what's your answer then?"
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,460.621,462.183,But if it is mandatory?
1999.98-1037,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.441,478.335,I thought we...  we don't mandate anything.
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,492.429,493.641,I would agree with that.
1999.98-1037,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.641,514.715,"And the further statement that in order to comply with the Constitution you have to do this, this, this, and this can be regarded as dictum, which you would be well-advised, if you're a lower court, to follow, but I'm not sure that a legislature has the obligation to follow that prescription as though we were laying down a prescription."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,519.961,521.573,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1037,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,579.608,586.072,"Well, but I guess...  why don't you help us understand what the California procedure is."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,609.818,611.11,Let me...
1999.98-1037,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,611.11,612.359,Is that right?
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,614.922,616.404,"No, it is not, Your Honor."
1999.98-1037,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,617.936,638.709,"I thought what happened here was that the lawyer found no grounds that he thought justified going further, and so advised the California courts, and did not ask to withdraw, and did not point out any so-called arguable issues."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,638.709,646.085,"If I may recap, that's I guess correct as far as it goes, but there are other aspects to it."
1999.98-1037,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,726.252,736.409,"Now, does the appellate...  does the counsel for the Appellate Project continue to participate at that point, or does he stand aside, just as the attorney stood aside?"
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,754.862,758.445,"No, he would not assist the court, Your Honor."
1999.98-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,778.95,805.499,"Yes, but the thing I wonder...  I think California has a pretty good system, frankly, and if I were designing one, maybe it would be California's, but the problem that I see is that we have an adversary system, basically, in the country and Anders says, you have a right to a lawyer, criminal defendant, and you have a right, as part of that, to have the lawyer think through on appeal what are his best arguments."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,825.084,837.612,"Your Honor, first of all I would say that I certainly agree that the...  that any appellant has a right to a conscientious and diligent lawyer who looks for issues."
1999.98-1037,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,853.253,860.809,"Well, here the Federal courts apparently concluded that there were some issues that ought to be raised and litigated."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,860.809,872.609,"Nobody...  well, first of all, I would have to say that there have been two issues raised in this context, and I think both of them are, frankly, the definition of frivolousness."
1999.98-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.639,907.568,"But wasn't the issue...  not the original Faretta, but later in the proceeding it is argued, I don't know if the record supports it, that the defendant made known a desire to have assistance of counsel later on..."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,907.568,908.309,That's absolutely...
1999.98-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,908.309,914.283,"and that is not mentioned at all in the, what would pass as an Anders brief by the lawyer."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,916.816,917.297,Yes.
1999.98-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,918.509,919.22,And also...
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,919.22,919.85,I'm sorry.
1999.98-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,919.85,927.367,I don't see that his statement did mention that another lawyer in the public defender's office reviewed what he'd done.
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,927.367,929.17,It did not.
1999.98-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.17,929.551,It didn't.
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,929.551,930.573,Actually I don't think that's true.
1999.98-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.723,933.034,"So we don't know from the record whether that was actually done, do we?"
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,933.034,945.323,"Yes, Your Honor, we do, because there was a declaration by counsel, and I believe it's in the joint appendix...  yes, at page 43."
1999.98-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.28,959.864,"But we don't know what the appellate...  he asked permission to file, and he got permission."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,959.864,959.984,Yes.
1999.98-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.984,963.587,But it doesn't show that the Appellate Project read through the record again.
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,963.587,964.358,It does not.
1999.98-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,969.403,971.295,"What are the rules, Ms. Jorstad."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,971.295,981.912,"I don't know the rules verbatim, but they provide for supervision, review, and concurrence on no-merit briefs."
1999.98-1037,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,983.665,1003.42,"Can you tell us...  take us through, because I want to get to Justice Breyer's question again, after the Wende brief is filed, then I take it that the district court of appeals has a staff that looks at this brief and talks with the court about it, is that right?"
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1003.42,1009.784,Either somebody on the attorney's staff or a justice reviews the entire record from scratch.
1999.98-1037,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1009.784,1015.289,"Now...  now, as Justice Breyer indicated, that's an interesting system."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1018.152,1033.954,"I think, again, to return to an earlier theme, that it only really makes sense to talk about an adversary system if there is some basis for adversarial representation."
1999.98-1037,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1041.549,1050.477,"Ms. Jorstad, one thing that is bothering me about this argument is, it's a kind of a trust-me argument."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1120.611,1126.496,Let me take those two questions seriatim.
1999.98-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1232.251,1235.305,I think you could have said the same thing about the certificate in Penson v. Ohio.
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1240.37,1242.784,"Well, I mean, I certainly...  I guess that's possible."
1999.98-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1245.227,1251.312,"The only difference between the...  his certificate and the certificate in this case is, you've also got a statement of facts here."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1251.312,1255.055,"Your Honor, this is...  no, Your Honor, that's...  there are other differences."
1999.98-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1347.569,1350.383,Has that ever actually happened in California?
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1350.383,1351.014,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1037,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1368.334,1369.786,Some or uniformly?
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1369.786,1370.237,I'm sorry?
1999.98-1037,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1370.237,1371.959,"Some, or uniformly?"
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1371.959,1387.19,"Well, I can't speak for the entire bench in California, but I do know that we have reported decisions, published decisions in which judges complain bitterly about the amount of time...  I mean, they're not happy, all of them, to be doing this work."
1999.98-1037,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1387.19,1396.045,"Ms. Jorstad, wouldn't it be helpful to the court to have an explanation of arguable issues and why they were rejected?"
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1410.106,1420.803,"Well, Your Honor, it's interesting, because both sides of the...  not both sides of the bench, but both sides of the bar, both the people and the defense, feel the same way about this."
1999.98-1037,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1445.319,1460.49,"Does this record have any statistics or figures on how often these no...  these Wende briefs are filed in California, percentage wise?"
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1460.49,1466.644,"As of a few years ago it was in roughly 20 percent to, maybe, in some districts as much as 25."
1999.98-1037,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1466.644,1480.064,And do the statistics also tell us how often under a Wende procedure the courts would actually find arguable issues on their review and send it back?
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1480.064,1481.336,"They do not, Your Honor."
1999.98-1037,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1494.246,1521.975,"Well, it takes a lot of courage, but one countervailing consideration, I take it as a general matter, the enormous workloads that the assigned counsel are laboring under, and that seems to me one of the distinctions that goes to the analogy you tried to draw between the situation of normally retained paid counsel and the counsel who are subject to Anders."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1524.966,1526.857,I believe you are.
1999.98-1037,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1526.857,1527.588,"Tell me, then."
1999.98-1037,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1527.588,1529.599,[Laughter]
1999.98-1037,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1529.599,1531.412,but I'm not sure where I have done it.
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1531.412,1562.203,"The counsel who are appointed by the court...  or, excuse me, appointed by the Appellate Projects, and that duty is delegated by the courts, don't have enormous case loads, at least from the Appellate Project, because the work is divided up and I think a reasonable workload is assumed and, of course, whatever the workload is for these people who file no-merit briefs, the same could be said for people who are filing merits briefs."
1999.98-1037,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1565.367,1584.849,"Well, yes, but except that if they're normally retained counsel, number 1 they don't have an inducement to give short shrift to issues which they could litigate and be paid for litigating, and number 2, I had supposed that as a group they were more likely to be able to control their own work loads and not take more than they could handle."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1584.849,1590.195,"I think, Your Honor, that these attorneys are equally as well able to control their work load."
1999.98-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1599.624,1607.891,"May I ask if you disagree with the representations made in the amicus brief filed by the retired California judges, who say the system isn't working very well?"
1999.98-1037,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1607.891,1608.241,I was going to ask the same question.
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1609.944,1610.625,"Yes, they are."
1999.98-1037,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1610.625,1614.688,"Do they just disagree as a matter of policy, or are they making a constitutional argument?"
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1614.688,1618.683,"Thank you for asking, Justice Kennedy, because that is the point of this brief."
1999.98-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1643.686,1645.359,"Very well, Ms. Jorstad."
1999.98-1037,0,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,1645.359,1646.118,Thank you.
1999.98-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1646.118,1648.091,"Mr. Nessim, we'll hear from you."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,1648.091,1660.751,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1697.507,1722.814,"Well, Mr. Nessim, supposing that under a State which follows the Anders rules, an Anders brief is filed, but...  and the State...  the Federal court finds that there was some issue that should have been raised, what does the Federal court...  can the Federal court examine that on habeas, and if it does find an issue should have been raised, what is the remedy?"
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,1722.814,1743.489,"I believe the remedy should be prejudice per se, Your Honor, because the Federal court will not be guided by the advocacy process, would not be able...  does not have the information, would have to speculate, as this Court has repeatedly found, to make that determination without an advocate's presentation, if there's a finding of an arguable issue that a merits brief is required."
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1762.473,1764.405,"Well, talk about consuming time, though."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,1796.677,1799.471,"Well, I think Anders is an efficient procedure."
1999.98-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1843.414,1844.466,That's a different question.
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,1896.463,1903.699,"In answer to your question, Anders requires that there be an advocate on appeal."
1999.98-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1934.122,1938.215,"That's the other question which I have, a more important question, on which I'm quite undecided."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,1972.669,1984.159,"Your Honor, the aspect of Anders which was criticized in California is the aspect of the independent judicial review, which is independently required by California law."
1999.98-1037,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2102.079,2109.265,"Well now, let's get down to what you really are complaining about so that I can get this in perspective."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2131.149,2132.942,"Yes, but I think from an..."
1999.98-1037,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2132.942,2141.347,"Okay, and also you want, as I understand it, to require that the lawyer, having filed that, then withdraw."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2144.74,2145.231,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1037,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2145.231,2145.531,No.
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2145.531,2148.683,First of all I think terminology is important.
1999.98-1037,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2175.112,2180.938,"Well, so that's what we're quibbling about, some description of issues that aren't even arguable."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2180.938,2188.975,"The points served by that, Your Honor, are two, and the Anders court said this."
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2217.357,2223.722,What is going to be the reaction of a typical court when it gets the kind of brief you say ought to be filed?
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2228.226,2233.08,The purpose of an Anders brief is not to decide the case on the merits.
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2233.08,2234.692,"Well, answer my question, if you will..."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2234.692,2234.852,Yes.
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2234.852,2236.683,not just go into some recitation.
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2236.683,2245.689,"If the court receives such a brief, the court will be able to look at those issues and maybe the court will have a different opinion on whether those issues are arguable or not."
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2253.026,2256.569,"If the issues are arguable, he has to file a merits brief, doesn't he?"
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2256.569,2257.891,"That's correct, but..."
1999.98-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2257.891,2258.681,Is that so?
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2261.016,2261.397,"Yes, sure."
1999.98-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.397,2275.619,"I think McCoy holds to the contrary on that, because McCoy approved the Wisconsin procedure in which, after identifying arguable issues, if the lawyer went ahead and explained why he thought they did not justify a merits brief, that satisfied Anders."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2275.619,2276.948,That's correct.
1999.98-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2284.203,2285.032,Right.
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2285.032,2296.011,"Anders requires, in fact...  requires not only a reference of the relevance facts pertaining to those issues, but a reference to the relevant law which pertains to those issues."
1999.98-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.011,2308.429,"But I thought the purpose of Anders in part, which you haven't referred to, so I might be wrong, was to say to the lawyer, lawyer, do the following: read the transcript"
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2333.277,2335.871,"You are correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1037,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2359.975,2369.552,"But the lawyer in Anders, in the Anders procedure, need not follow the final step outlined by Justice Breyer, which is to say why these arguments are frivolous."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2369.552,2370.744,That is correct.
1999.98-1037,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2370.744,2378.881,"He can say, I hereby certify that the following issues should be examined pursuant to Anders, and then list these things."
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.881,2381.303,"Which means that he thinks they're frivolous, doesn't it?"
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2381.303,2385.947,"That is correct, and the purpose is not to decide them on the merits, but you're right."
1999.98-1037,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.47,2405.945,"It's strange, I suppose there are innumerable frivolous issues that could be found in any case."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2445.992,2451.987,"In response to that, first of all we're talking about not...  we're talking about issues which appear to be frivolous."
1999.98-1037,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2472.313,2477.516,"So he would say, this is as close as I can get to a nonfrivolous issue."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2486.893,2488.185,I think that's correct.
1999.98-1037,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2522.109,2526.063,And it will get the court there faster than the court will get if it has to do it all by itself.
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2526.063,2526.524,That's right.
1999.98-1037,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2540.565,2542.347,What about the appellate process?
1999.98-1037,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2542.347,2546.831,"On that point, Justice Stevens and I were both interested in the brief filed by the retired justices."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2560.72,2561.121,Yes.
1999.98-1037,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2617.002,2632.292,"You suggested, I think, in your brief that these appellate projects where not uniform in their approach, and that some of them do require an identification of issues that the lawyer considered."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2655.82,2661.596,"Your Honor, we said very little in our brief on the merits about the CAP system."
1999.98-1037,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2805.876,2806.697,"Well, I suppose..."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2806.697,2806.987,It's efficient for judges.
1999.98-1037,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2806.987,2819.636,"I suppose in the Anders opinion itself there's some indication that we wouldn't preclude other systems that were equally as effective, right?"
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2819.636,2819.897,The...
1999.98-1037,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2819.897,2825.753,"I mean, Anders isn't necessarily the only way that the right to counsel can be satisfied."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2825.753,2839.681,"This Court has repeatedly held that advocacy is necessary to reliably decide a case, and we would submit that the lawyer has...  Anders is a limited exception."
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2855.851,2855.851,So...
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2855.851,2861.347,"I should add that Anders, McCoy, and..."
1999.98-1037,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2861.347,2864.87,"But it's so odd when the court itself says, we don't want it and need it."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2868.253,2871.315,"First of all, that's what the Warden..."
1999.98-1037,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2871.315,2877.109,"I mean, if it's...  this was for the benefit of the court presumably, and the court says, I don't need it, thank you."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2877.109,2881.562,"First of all, Your Honor, the California courts have not said that."
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2888.197,2888.357,"Well, but..."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2888.357,2889.258,They need that brief.
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2889.258,2894.302,I thought in Wende the supreme court of California had approved this system.
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2894.302,2895.394,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2914.338,2922.292,"Well, here the court of appeals in this case said they were satisfied the respondent's attorney had fully complied with the responsibilities in Wende."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2935.611,2939.535,"I would submit, Your Honor, that the...  many California courts..."
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2939.535,2940.156,"Well, but..."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2940.156,2942.96,"have misinterpreted their own law, and..."
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2942.96,2947.543,"Well, that's not a question for us, whether California courts misinterpret their own law."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,2948.635,2950.825,"Well, I agree with that, Your Honor."
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2991.818,3012.455,"Well, I...  before you go back to any other question, I wish you'd answer mine, and here the California court of appeals said it examined the record, found no other arguable issues, and the response attorney fully complied with his responsibilities, citing Wende, and then the California supreme court denies review."
1999.98-1037,1,40087,ronald_j_nessim,,3019.99,3025.606,"Yes, Your Honor, and I refer you to Wende, and I agree that Wende is not the clearest..."
1999.98-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3025.606,3025.816,Okay.
1999.98-1037,2,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,3407.004,3409.358,"Thank you very much, Your Honor."
1999.98-1037,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3459.851,3463.124,"Yes, but we rejected that point in the Wisconsin case, McCoy, didn't we?"
1999.98-1037,2,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,3467.007,3477.285,"And I think, Justice Stevens, that what we can say about McCoy is that this Court approved that procedure, which was in fact a deviation from Anders, but it didn't require it."
1999.98-1037,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3481.568,3482.019,"Well, we didn't hold it was a deviation from Anders."
1999.98-1037,2,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,3484.332,3484.803,I under...
1999.98-1037,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3484.803,3497.512,"It performed the function of having a lawyer identify for the court in a way that would be helpful to the court when it looks through the record what arguable issues are there, and this...  it required that there be some discussion of legal issues, and that's what's missing here."
1999.98-1037,2,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,3500.113,3509.43,"That's correct, Your Honor, just as, as a matter of equal protection, no client with retained counsel would ever put before the court a discussion of the legal issues he rejected."
1999.98-1037,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3537.875,3540.977,"Well, of course, the difference in the prejudice is, in Strickland the fellow gets a new trial."
1999.98-1037,2,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,3544.73,3547.643,"Well, in Strickland...  but on appeal Strickland..."
1999.98-1037,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3547.643,3550.297,But he's not going to get out of jail if there's a violation of Anders.
1999.98-1037,2,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,3550.297,3557.203,"Absolutely not, Your Honor, but Strickland also applies on appeal in merits situations, and that's when a new appeal is given."
1999.98-1037,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3571.914,3573.426,"Thank you, Ms. Jorstad."
1999.98-1037,2,19283,carol_f_jorstad,,3574.726,3575.727,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1999.98-1037,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3575.727,3576.856,The case is submitted.
