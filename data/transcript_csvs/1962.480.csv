1962.480,0,39533,raymond_e_harth,,22.29,27.311,Mr. Chief Justice Warren and may it please the Court.
1962.480,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,129.848,131.675,Where is Chenot?
1962.480,0,39533,raymond_e_harth,,131.675,133.091,The Chenot School is in Centreville.
1962.480,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,133.662,137.352,"I mean, where is the community in rel -- in the state?"
1962.480,0,39533,raymond_e_harth,,137.352,141.539,"It's in Southern Illinois, just outside this City of East St. Louis."
1962.480,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,141.539,143.944,That's not (Inaudible)
1962.480,0,39533,raymond_e_harth,,143.944,146.159,Yes.
1962.480,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,146.159,149.785,That's not what I thought because Illinois goes much further south.
1962.480,0,39533,raymond_e_harth,,149.785,150.56,It goes much further south.
1962.480,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,150.56,150.87,I thought it was called --
1962.480,0,39533,raymond_e_harth,,150.87,152.194,-- this is not in the very southern part.
1962.480,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,152.194,153.703,Little Egypt or whatever it's called.
1962.480,0,39533,raymond_e_harth,,153.703,154.612,That's correct.
1962.480,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,154.612,156.114,But this is not in that area?
1962.480,0,39533,raymond_e_harth,,156.114,156.64,No.
1962.480,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,156.64,157.651,It's in the St. Louis Area.
1962.480,0,39533,raymond_e_harth,,157.651,159.448,"In the St. Louis Area, that's correct."
1962.480,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,216.129,222.559,"What we have -- what you're telling us, Mr. Harth, is disclosing this case, if it all, only by the pleadings, isn't it?"
1962.480,0,39533,raymond_e_harth,,222.559,229.046,"This is all by the pleadings, that's correct, and by the motion to dismiss, of course, the defendants admit all facts while pleading."
1962.480,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,229.046,229.199,Yes.
1962.480,0,39533,raymond_e_harth,,229.199,230.945,Yes.
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2157.06,2164.158,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1962.480,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2306.795,2309.112,(Inaudible)
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2309.112,2313.703,"As such, it was created in 1949."
1962.480,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2313.703,2317.474,(Inaudible)
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2317.474,2325.268,"In 1949 and 1951, there was annexation of the period, the territory that these -- that we're interested in here now."
1962.480,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2325.268,2328.964,That's the territory now that's been pointed out.
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2328.964,2336.501,The particular area that's involved in this case was annexed in 1951 or 1953.
1962.480,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2351.237,2356.0,That doesn't make -- that doesn't bear upon the -- whether or not cause of action?
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2356.0,2367.645,"I hope not, sir, but the impression, even as I sit here and hear it, is -- makes me cringe a little bit and I would not want that impression to be accepted at face value."
1962.480,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2432.192,2439.613,How many whites and how many blacks are there in the city in that school district?
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2439.613,2443.037,I frankly don't know.
1962.480,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2465.518,2470.426,(Inaudible)
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2470.426,2473.146,"Yes, but that's just in the elementary school."
1962.480,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2473.146,2474.194,In Chenot?
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2474.194,2492.505,"Yes, sir, and then there are good many colored children in the Centreville School system -- Centreville School District which adjoins the Chenot School and there's a sprinkling -- predominantly white schools but a sprinkling where there are Negro families in, as I understand, all of the other grade schools."
1962.480,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2492.505,2502.226,(Inaudible)
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2502.226,2502.764,"Yes, sir."
1962.480,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2502.764,2507.206,(Inaudible)
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2507.206,2509.086,"Yes sir, yes."
1962.480,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2509.086,2525.25,They had assumed the (Inaudible)
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2525.25,2528.953,"Yes sir, I suppose, for that limited purpose."
1962.480,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2636.67,2639.131,"What are the distinctions, Mr. Harth?"
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2639.131,2639.617,Sir?
1962.480,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2639.617,2646.915,"One distinction, Mr. Harth, is that the damages under (Inaudible)"
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2646.915,2649.096,I don't see any distinction between the two.
1962.480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2657.15,2660.993,(Inaudible)
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2660.993,2661.488,The same section.
1962.480,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.488,2662.32,(Inaudible)
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2662.32,2662.849,"Yes, sir."
1962.480,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2677.819,2683.547,What remedy do they have if they can't go this way?
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2683.547,2684.643,The petitioners?
1962.480,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2684.643,2686.048,Yes.
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2686.048,2691.615,"Of course, there is remedies galore in the State of Illinois."
1962.480,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2724.909,2728.861,You mean they could go into the federal court and ask for equitable relief?
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2728.861,2731.34,"I should think so, sir."
1962.480,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2731.34,2736.462,"Under which section of the code, which jurisdictional statute?"
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2736.462,2755.554,"I'm not able to say that right off, but I should think under the same ways that they went into the southern states for equitable relief in many, many instances claiming a denial of rights of children secured to them by the Fourteenth Amendment."
1962.480,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2755.554,2764.315,"Then you -- so far as you are concerned, there's a forum in which they file the preceding which denies them the right to proceed in this case."
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2764.315,2765.736,"Yes sir, that's true."
1962.480,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2765.736,2770.852,Did we prove it then as a (Inaudible)
1962.480,1,26542,howard_boman,,2770.852,2785.203,"I think so, and that's why we've continued to argue this saying that, there, clearly, the administrative remedy as an alternative would be a defense."
1962.480,2,39533,raymond_e_harth,,4184.086,4184.483,May it please the Court.
1962.480,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4184.483,4189.644,"There's one more counsel to argue, Mr. Harth."
1962.480,2,39533,raymond_e_harth,,4189.644,4190.572,Oh I'm sorry.
1962.480,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4193.091,4194.808,Mr. Reiter.
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,4194.808,4199.202,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1962.480,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4290.877,4293.797,(Inaudible)
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,4293.797,4294.391,Yes.
1962.480,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4294.391,4295.266,(Inaudible) the school district that was involved.
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,4295.266,4329.686,"Yes, and we have the same problem in this case, too, and I think, probably, that Judge Juergens had this in mind when he decided and which is all that he decided, as found on page 22 of the record, that â€œLook, fellows, before you come into the federal court and ask me to go into this whole problem of boundaries, transportation, questions of economics, the question of building new schools, and so forth, at least shouldn't you give the State a chance?"
1962.480,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4469.793,4473.713,(Inaudible)
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,4473.713,4474.54,"Well, he had a choice."
1962.480,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4881.508,4894.765,"Well, don't the allegations of the complaint say that that has not been done, that there is this discrimination in the schools?"
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,4894.765,4897.08,They assert that discrimination does exist.
1962.480,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4897.08,4902.038,"Yes, well, don't we have to accept that as being the fact for the purposes of this case?"
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,4902.038,4903.873,"Yes, but someone has to determine whether in fact they do exist."
1962.480,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4903.873,4908.278,"I know, but you say there's nothing in the record, nothing on the record to show this."
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,4914.496,4916.339,"That -- Mr. Chief Justice, you misunderstood me."
1962.480,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4932.208,4937.659,"Mr. Reiter, (Inaudible) despite the question in the plea to cease and desist."
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,5051.079,5060.191,"Unfortunately, we have an extremely poor record here, and as a matter, if we had understood conceivably that we're coming to the Supreme Court, we might have done it differently."
1962.480,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5096.789,5107.486,"We didn't need that record to contest what we have been told here today that, in fact, in East St. Louis, schools have been desegregated."
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,5160.666,5165.01,"Well, the structure in which the case comes before this Court is the complaint."
1962.480,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5202.393,5218.084,"Not necessarily because of this, that the question of what relief might be available under the administrative procedure and a necessity to have recourse to it might very well depend upon the given facts, don't you agree?"
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,5218.084,5219.558,"I agree, absolutely."
1962.480,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5219.558,5226.448,"And therefore, how do you, how do you treat it in isolation, as this case has now before us?"
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,5226.448,5226.687,Well --
1962.480,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5226.687,5230.149,"Of course, the parties made their choice, your clients --"
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,5230.149,5230.715,We then --
1962.480,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5230.715,5230.934,To basically file --
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,5230.934,5234.74,"He filed the motion, not thinking that it would come up on that basis."
1962.480,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5244.218,5248.722,"Yes, but Mr. Reiter, I must say I have difficulty understanding."
1962.480,3,40261,robert_h_reiter,,5279.389,5284.712,"Mr. Boman has indicated that he has the answer to this and since he was on the spot, may I defer to him on this matter?"
1962.480,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5284.712,5286.462,You may.
1962.480,4,26542,howard_boman,,5286.462,5301.327,"This is simply, as I understand the law and the pleadings, an admission for the purpose of the motion and one doesn't swallow these things for any other purpose."
1962.480,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5301.891,5313.454,"Well, on the basis that this is just legal strategy, we can't take it at face value to what Mr. Reiter says because, certainly, a Federal District Court is a place where issues can to be tried out."
1962.480,4,26542,howard_boman,,5313.454,5338.346,"Yes, sir, and the law, as I understood it at that time and as the Seventh Circuit held it to be, was that, as a prerequisite to that type of action in the District Court, there was a resort to the state administrative remedy as a prerequisite."
1962.480,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5343.222,5343.896,"Well, as my Brother --"
1962.480,4,26542,howard_boman,,5343.896,5344.059,It --
1962.480,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5344.059,5347.238,"-- Douglas says, that sounds just like lawyer strategy."
1962.480,4,26542,howard_boman,,5390.196,5399.704,"Sir, it's the law, as I understood it to be, and the fact is, I mean, if somebody want to talk about these things --"
1962.480,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5399.704,5401.375,But sometimes law and action is a lot --
1962.480,4,26542,howard_boman,,5401.375,5402.068,The petitioners --
1962.480,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5402.068,5404.277,"-- is a lot better than law enforced, isn't it?"
1962.480,4,26542,howard_boman,,5404.277,5407.891,The petitioners never even spoke of it or wrote a letter to the Board.
1962.480,5,40261,robert_h_reiter,,5436.58,5456.95,"Let me say, in connection with what Mr. Justice Harlan said, that this Court itself in Cooper versus Aaron said this, â€œEvery state legislator and executive and judicial officer is solemnly committed by oath taken pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 3 to support the Constitution."
1962.480,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5620.663,5624.346,"The Federal District Courts have been doing this in many, many situations."
1962.480,5,40261,robert_h_reiter,,5624.346,5630.644,"Well, not very much, as I understand, in the area of redistricting whole communities."
1962.480,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5637.25,5643.351,Your argument is reminiscent of the argument of the losing party in Baker versus Carr.
1962.480,5,40261,robert_h_reiter,,5643.351,5649.241,"Well, I think, however, voting is a little bit clearer than schools."
1962.480,5,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5656.462,5658.617,I hope you're right.
1962.480,5,40261,robert_h_reiter,,5658.617,5665.002,"That is -- that's a -- voting -- this is, at least, a serious problem as Baker versus Carr, and I'd say more serious."
1962.480,6,26542,howard_boman,,5678.496,5678.862,Sir --
1962.480,6,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5678.862,5679.608,Mr. Harth.
1962.480,6,26542,howard_boman,,5679.608,5680.95,-- could I make one point?
1962.480,6,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5680.95,5681.63,You may.
1962.480,6,26542,howard_boman,,5682.337,5688.57,"In the indulgence of the Court, in response to the question over here, it comes back to me."
1962.480,6,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5756.388,5759.471,Mr. Harth.
1962.480,7,39533,raymond_e_harth,,5759.471,5761.065,May it please the Court.
1962.480,7,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6064.495,6068.249,How can we assume that the affidavit isn't false?
1962.480,7,39533,raymond_e_harth,,6068.249,6088.275,"I would have to assume that, since this district, District 187, has gotten state funds and since, in the allegations of our complainant, it shows that there has been discrimination in the school district, that there must be either a false affidavit or an affidavit by a person who does not know the facts."
1962.480,7,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6103.601,6139.645,(Inaudible)
1962.480,7,39533,raymond_e_harth,,6139.645,6140.799,"To a certain extent, yes."
1962.480,7,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6168.034,6179.885,(Inaudible) they are not bearing proof in here particularly?
1962.480,7,39533,raymond_e_harth,,6179.885,6180.729,They are not.
1962.480,7,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6217.341,6219.281,"Of course, that cuts both ways."
1962.480,7,39533,raymond_e_harth,,6219.281,6219.931,It does.
1962.480,7,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6219.931,6224.704,"You could've walked over there and filed your complaint, and it might have been tossed out but you could've done it."
1962.480,7,39533,raymond_e_harth,,6224.704,6225.83,"Yes, we might have."
1962.480,7,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,6241.834,6245.194,"So, both parties here are relying from the law on whether they are of more than expensed."
1962.480,7,39533,raymond_e_harth,,6246.112,6250.561,"I would say that this is true, yes."
1962.480,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6300.759,6305.635,"Gentlemen, there's one matter that I'd like to get cleared up."
1962.480,7,39533,raymond_e_harth,,6333.93,6335.389,That is correct.
1962.480,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6361.745,6367.319,And it's your position there's nothing in the law that gives him the right to withhold funds.
1962.480,7,39533,raymond_e_harth,,6367.319,6368.223,That is correct.
