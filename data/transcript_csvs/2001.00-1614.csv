2001.00-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.825,"We'll hear argument next in No. 00-1614, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Abner Morgan."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,16.884,33.437,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 25 years ago in United Air Lines v. Evans, this Court observed that an employer was entitled to treat a past act as lawful after respondent failed to file a timely charge of discrimination."
2001.00-1614,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.393,106.255,"Well, Mr. Englert, there are, I assume even in your view, a few exceptions to this rule."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,108.584,110.674,For certain diligent plaintiffs--
2001.00-1614,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.674,111.456,Yes.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,111.456,117.029,"--who bring suit within 300 days after their cause of action first accrues, we would look back."
2001.00-1614,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.258,138.964,"And there's no other circumstance, you think, where you would end up looking back beyond... where the... the full thrust of... of what was going on didn't become evident until the statute had passed as some early... on some earlier events?"
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,138.964,149.888,"We would allow plaintiffs, in exactly the situation you described, Justice O'Connor, to look back, the situation in which it was not fully evident until within the 300-day period what was going on."
2001.00-1614,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,152.201,155.09,I don't understand how's that's an exception.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,167.434,168.631,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2001.00-1614,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,169.413,169.95,What is that?
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,169.95,182.582,"--if the events outside the 300-day window were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to rise to the level of being actionable, then we would concede that the cause of action doesn't accrue until they've become sufficiently severe or pervasive."
2001.00-1614,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,182.582,190.589,"What about the circumstance where they're very much related to what did occur within the 300 days, but the person isn't certain?"
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,202.356,204.352,"Well, there may be close cases, Justice Breyer, and--"
2001.00-1614,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,204.352,205.245,"No, no."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,222.806,224.564,--We... we would give away that case.
2001.00-1614,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,224.564,225.102,Okay.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,225.102,226.588,If a reasonable person would not have known--
2001.00-1614,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,226.588,227.081,Fine.
2001.00-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.081,228.484,Would not have known his injury.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,231.994,235.338,"--Well, Justice Scalia, that gets into the debate, of course, this Court has had--"
2001.00-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.338,235.726,I know it does.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,239.053,239.508,--No.
2001.00-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.223,255.4,"--Oh, in practice, that's always an exception to the knowledge of injury rule."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,260.063,262.747,That's why I'm not trying to give away anything on injury versus injury discovery.
2001.00-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,262.747,267.744,With due diligence... with due diligence... the person had due diligence but didn't know.
2001.00-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,270.838,279.177,Not a subjective knowledge of injury but knowledge of injury that... that would have occurred to a reasonable person.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,279.177,280.952,"Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice, and--"
2001.00-1614,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,280.952,281.573,All right.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,299.982,301.097,--That plaintiff loses.
2001.00-1614,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,301.097,303.781,"I mean, because after all, we're trying to settle this thing right within the company."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,303.781,305.639,"That plaintiff loses, Justice Breyer."
2001.00-1614,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,306.026,306.586,He loses.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,306.586,308.155,That's quite clear under cases like Robinson Meyers.
2001.00-1614,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,308.155,309.476,And... and why should he lose where the other one doesn't?
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,309.476,311.333,Because this Court has said so.
2001.00-1614,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,314.638,316.124,Are you talking about EEOC cases?
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,316.124,329.704,"--Those... those are title VII cases in which... Robinson Meyers was a case in which the plaintiff exhausted union grievances and then filed the EEOC charge, and the Court said, no, you should have filed your EEOC charge within the statutory period."
2001.00-1614,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,329.704,357.735,"Mr. Englert, I'm not aware that there is a case... perhaps I'm wrong about this... quite like this where there are a succession of similar acts, a number of disciplines, a number of refusal to give training opportunities, and the employee goes to the EEO... the in-house person, tries to settle it, tries not to make a Federal case out of it."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,382.831,386.546,"Well, it's not when in doubt, sue, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.00-1614,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,396.843,400.004,But he's always... he also has the in-house.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,438.642,454.534,"That much I am saying, and that is very consistent with the purposes of the title VII charge-filing requirement, which is to cause plaintiffs to go promptly to the EEOC, as this Court itself has said in a number of its cases, and to get that process started quickly."
2001.00-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.623,488.304,"Well, I guess any statute of limitations of any sort means you... you have to sue 10 times instead of one time, doesn't it?"
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,488.304,488.797,--Yes.
2001.00-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.797,494.741,"I mean, it's the nature of a statute of limitations that when you're hurt, you have to sue."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,502.271,503.575,"Yes, Justice Scalia, and--"
2001.00-1614,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,503.575,507.661,"Mr. Englert, I don't think that this is in any case."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,534.661,535.897,--Yes.
2001.00-1614,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,539.862,563.761,"In other words, you're... you're saying that there is no pervasive hostility, no pervasive hostile environment until the acts are repeated, or is it there is a pervasive hostile environment, but it's just not discovered until the acts are repeated?"
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,565.497,575.732,"The case I'm willing to concede, looking back beyond 300 days, is the case in which there is no hostile environment until within the 300-day period."
2001.00-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.472,581.965,Wait.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,589.274,595.59,I'm conceding that you can get back pay or damages for those events as the Seventh Circuit said in Galloway and as the First Circuit said in Sabree.
2001.00-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.59,601.162,"Well, why if... if you assert that there hasn't been any offense when those events occurred?"
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,609.995,617.631,"Well, the hypothetical example, Justice Scalia, that I think makes the point is suppose there is an epithet at the office Christmas party one year."
2001.00-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,632.741,635.464,"Well, sure, but it doesn't make the first one a hostile environment."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,635.464,643.887,"No, but the statute of limitations, under standard accrual principles, didn't begin to run until it became a hostile environment, and we're suggesting--"
2001.00-1614,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,643.887,652.348,"But if that's the case, you don't have to concede anything because the hostile environment doesn't occur, as you're analyzing it, until... within the 300-day period."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,671.667,672.244,--Yes.
2001.00-1614,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,672.244,673.07,Okay.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,684.67,686.173,"No, I--"
2001.00-1614,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,686.173,687.371,Maybe that isn't what you meant.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,687.371,689.045,--I think--
2001.00-1614,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,689.045,689.788,That's how I understood him.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,689.788,705.188,"--Justice Souter... and I don't know that I want to spend much more of my argument on concessions, but-- [Laughter] --I think the... the point is that the entire series of actions that constitute the hostile environment are all part of the hostile environment, but it may not--"
2001.00-1614,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,705.188,705.681,Okay.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,719.798,723.68,"--In 20/20 hindsight, this is how hostile environment cases work."
2001.00-1614,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.336,729.774,Good.
2001.00-1614,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,755.836,757.116,And that was my... and that was my question.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,768.55,769.626,Okay.
2001.00-1614,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,781.143,783.455,"Is this a hostile environment claim, do you think?"
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,783.455,787.709,"Not primarily, but there is a hostile environment claim in this case as the Ninth Circuit saw it."
2001.00-1614,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,787.709,788.202,It is in the case.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,791.629,793.115,"No, Your Honor."
2001.00-1614,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,806.035,811.569,But it could be a hostile environment claim included here.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,811.569,813.344,"The Ninth Circuit believed there was, yes."
2001.00-1614,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.753,826.468,May I ask you about a hypothetical that's perhaps a little simpler to discuss?
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,859.328,864.735,"--I think not, Justice Stevens, but that raises two issues that are not in this case."
2001.00-1614,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,871.794,873.901,"I'm assuming there's no discovery, but I'm assuming--"
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,873.901,874.56,--No.
2001.00-1614,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,874.56,881.536,"--if you can ever describe anything as a continuing violation, I have described a continuing discriminatory policy."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,898.422,899.452,My short answer is no.
2001.00-1614,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,899.452,900.401,Okay.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,900.401,909.317,My longer answer is no unless this Court resolves an issue that is not presented by this case which is injury versus injury discovery in favor of an injury discovery rule.
2001.00-1614,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,909.317,911.712,You're saying injury would not be enough.
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,911.712,918.605,"That issue is not in this case, but that is my... I'm saying injury would be enough."
2001.00-1614,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,918.605,922.282,"Well, arguably it would be in this case to the extent the hostile environment claim is a continuing violation."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,929.917,935.945,"It could be, but the reason I'm making a concession with regard to hostile environment claims is not injury versus injury discovery."
2001.00-1614,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.441,967.274,"Well, my assumption is a case... there was a violation all along, but the... the charge was not filed within 300 days of the commencement of a continuing violation."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,974.416,975.697,There... no.
2001.00-1614,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,980.072,994.478,"Mr. Englert, you have been deflected from what I think is the strongest point on the other side that said, that's all well and good, but Congress understood you could go back way beyond the 300 days because they put a 2-year cap on back pay."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,994.478,995.1,Yes.
2001.00-1614,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,995.1,1008.679,"So, that shows how, whatever you might say, just looking at the words of the statute, Congress understood that you have to shorten the period and the period they picked was 2 years, much longer than 180 days or 300."
2001.00-1614,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1008.679,1011.734,And let me try very quickly to say why that argument is not a good argument.
2001.00-1614,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1047.771,1049.341,"Very well, Mr. Englert."
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1051.032,1066.181,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court's decision in Zipes established and the Court reaffirmed in Lorance that section 706(e) operates as a statute of limitations."
2001.00-1614,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1103.871,1110.392,"When you say ongoing violations and taking my hypothetical, could they recover for damages prior to the 300 days?"
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1110.392,1116.131,"In your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, recovery would only be available if equitable tolling came into play."
2001.00-1614,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1125.064,1129.134,In my hypothetical it would be limited to 300 days.
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1129.134,1130.083,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
2001.00-1614,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1134.519,1141.023,"In a nutshell, where do you think the Ninth Circuit went wrong, which I take it you believe is the case here?"
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1141.023,1142.221,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
2001.00-1614,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1194.727,1204.653,"On your theory then, the... the only thing that the continuing violation concept gives, in effect, is a right to use evidence of something that happened prior to the period."
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1218.383,1219.413,--No.
2001.00-1614,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1238.157,1238.561,Oh.
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1257.226,1266.764,--Suit... suit could be brought within 300 days for the entirety provided that it accrued within the 300 days.
2001.00-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1284.325,1289.138,Let's... let's assume you have a hostile work environment that goes on for 900 days.
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1319.269,1320.384,"That's right, Justice Scalia."
2001.00-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1323.856,1326.373,It became... it became a hostile work environment--
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1326.373,1326.661,Yes.
2001.00-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1326.661,1326.95,--900 days ago.
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1326.95,1327.859,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2001.00-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.859,1331.119,But it continued to be a... a hostile work for all 900 days.
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1332.894,1333.516,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2001.00-1614,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.516,1334.259,--even though it's--
2001.00-1614,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1334.259,1346.352,--And you also think he can... don't you think he can get damages for the whole 900 days if a reasonable person wouldn't have realized that those first 600 days were actionable?
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1346.352,1349.241,"That, Justice Breyer, is the question of accrual under Harris."
2001.00-1614,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1357.786,1358.157,All right.
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1401.919,1412.155,The... the reasonableness that would allow... that would extend the limitations period is... is reasonableness that would qualify under the equitable tolling or equitable estoppel doctrines.
2001.00-1614,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1421.155,1427.471,"Well, there... there are a lot of reasons for not going to court too, but we've never said those toll the statute of limitations."
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1427.471,1429.55,"That's correct, and if it's a reason which does not--"
2001.00-1614,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1429.55,1434.28,Do you think the Seventh Circuit has adopted the right test in that regard?
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1434.28,1444.394,"--The result of the Seventh Circuit's test is generally consistent with our rule, but the... the Seventh Circuit's test is in our view less definite than our own."
2001.00-1614,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1464.723,1480.227,"But the agency here... I mean, that's... the position that you are taking, on behalf of the United States, differs from the EEOC's position which, I understand it, is the position that the Ninth Circuit followed."
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1480.227,1482.578,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.00-1614,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1513.497,1516.552,"Well, what is the EEOC's position on... on this case?"
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1516.552,1527.038,"--In section 706 cases, respondent correctly points out that the EEOC has filed briefs and taken a position which is consistent with the Ninth Circuit's test."
2001.00-1614,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1533.104,1539.791,And your answer to the question about the 2 years is that there are cases.
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1546.19,1563.281,"I can give you two cases from the Southern District of New York last year, Sye v. The Rockefeller University, 137 F. Supp. 2d 276; Bardniak v. Cushman and Wakefield, 2001 WL 1505501, both last year."
2001.00-1614,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1579.051,1583.343,And you agree with those equitable... whatever those equitable tolling reasons were?
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1586.769,1588.832,Yes.
2001.00-1614,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1604.891,1609.077,I'm not sure I understand why hostile environment cases are unique.
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1626.167,1633.005,In our view hostile environment cases are not unique and are not properly exceptions in which... in which a continuing violation doctrine apply.
2001.00-1614,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1653.065,1654.347,But I thought you said the opposite.
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1665.531,1667.843,"--If I may answer, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.00-1614,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.843,1668.669,Yes.
2001.00-1614,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1668.669,1679.072,In that case there is an occurrence within the 300 days and it's that occurrence that is the basis for the charge and the complaint within the 300 days.
2001.00-1614,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.072,1680.186,"Thank you, Mr. Schlick."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,1682.249,1694.388,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Ongoing violations of the law must be treated differently from discrete acts."
2001.00-1614,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1726.46,1730.813,"Well, I mean, the claim is not stale, of course, as to the continuing acts."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,1735.831,1736.946,This is true.
2001.00-1614,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.946,1743.14,And... and so the... the question is not whether or not you can sue continuing acts.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,1749.1,1750.653,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.00-1614,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1811.721,1814.388,"But Havens was a different statute, was it not?"
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,1814.388,1816.095,"--It is a... it is... yes, sir."
2001.00-1614,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1834.367,1844.315,"Well, have we ever set aside this type of statute and said we give all possible breaks to plaintiffs on it?"
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,1845.695,1846.505,No.
2001.00-1614,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1889.889,1910.528,"Ms. Price, the Ninth Circuit, whose judgment we're reviewing here, as nearly as I can tell seems to take a different view of what can be included for damages as actionable than that taken by other circuits that have looked at the same statute and the same problem."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,1910.528,1913.583,"It is... yes, ma'am."
2001.00-1614,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1913.583,1914.864,Would you agree with that?
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,1914.864,1915.979,"Yes, ma'am."
2001.00-1614,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1920.809,1923.242,"Yes, a very lopsided split really."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,1923.242,1927.801,"--Well, I think the Ninth Circuit's position is actually in the majority view."
2001.00-1614,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1927.801,1929.437,It's a big circuit.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,1930.18,1930.69,Yes. [Laughter]
2001.00-1614,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1956.679,1979.259,"Well, if there are separate events that have occurred and if each one standing alone would be actionable and if no charge is filed or suit brought until after the time limit established for some of the violations, what do we do?"
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,1979.259,1986.855,"Well, you look, as the circuits have uniformly looked, as to whether or not it is a practice or a continuing violation."
2001.00-1614,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2005.82,2014.348,Do you think the acts that occurred before the applicable statutory period had expired were actionable?
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2014.348,2016.661,"--I... no, I don't."
2001.00-1614,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.751,2043.243,"But if you... if you say that an event, if it occurred in isolation, would be actionable, you are saying then that it was actionable by itself without combining it with anything else."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2043.243,2046.504,"--Yes, sir, I am saying that."
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2053.152,2067.02,"Well, what do you mean by a continuing... let... let's... let's take the failure to give a person a promotion because of her sex or his race or whatever."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2091.085,2105.082,"Well, a promotion, as I understand the law, is a distinct area, and there are some circumstances where the courts have held that a promotion would result in extending the time for one to recover damages."
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2150.324,2160.189,"Well, I... I don't... I'm not sure what your answer is to my hypothetical, and... and I asked the hypothetical because frankly I don't see how a hostile environment claim is any different from a failure to promote claim."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2170.22,2177.529,--This Court has defined a hostile environment as the... the actionable part of it is the environment itself.
2001.00-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2222.232,2231.686,"What you're saying, if I understand it correct, is the promotion is a discrete violation with continuing effects, whereas a hostile environment is a continuing violation."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2231.686,2231.975,Yes.
2001.00-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.801,2233.915,Which is two quite different things.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2233.915,2234.658,"Yes, sir."
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.658,2235.69,Suppose you have a continuing--
2001.00-1614,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.69,2236.888,--Is this case--
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2236.888,2241.801,"--Suppose you have a continuing violation, a hostile environment, made up of many minor acts."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2241.801,2242.46,"Yes, sir."
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2242.46,2244.335,"And it goes on for many, many years."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2263.349,2268.179,The ability to recover damages in that circumstances depends on a number of factors.
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.867,2275.36,"Well, he does."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2276.269,2293.914,"--Then his ability would be affected by this Court's decisions in both Faragher and Burlington Industries where this Court said that if there's no tangible employment action and the employer can show that it has taken appropriate steps to prevent or remedy discrimination, and the plaintiff--"
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2293.914,2294.407,"No, they didn't."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2294.407,2294.64,--Okay. [Laughter]
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2310.532,2311.191,I just wonder.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2326.052,2330.51,--The damages question again is a separate question from liability.
2001.00-1614,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2348.056,2349.17,But would you--
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2349.17,2357.92,"--Why is it that if there's a continuing violation, say, for 900 days and you file on the 900th day, that you can go back for the first 600 days?"
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2358.58,2365.35,Because the statute must have the ability to reach practices.
2001.00-1614,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.555,2375.26,It does reach it.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2389.127,2399.324,"Well, but if you limit the period for which you can reach it to only 300 days, you're essentially immunizing the employer who has engaged in a longstanding--"
2001.00-1614,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.324,2399.63,"No, you're not."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2405.268,2406.095,--Well--
2001.00-1614,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.095,2408.157,--which is the whole purpose of statutes of limitations.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2408.157,2417.695,"--You're telling the person not simply to take action, Justice Scalia, but to take action that it may in fact result in greater retaliation or a loss of employment."
2001.00-1614,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2420.129,2421.261,"Well, but that's... but that's always true."
2001.00-1614,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2421.261,2423.035,Retaliation is a separate claim.
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2423.035,2435.445,I... I thought your answer might be that it's difficult to know that there's a pervasive environment until you look at a whole context of acts.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2445.598,2449.025,"--Well, I think that there are cases where it's difficult to know."
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2450.799,2451.082,All right.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2463.597,2477.139,"--It's not that... well, it's because it's fundamentally a continuing violation of the statute, and the statute itself allows for you to deal with practices."
2001.00-1614,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2489.687,2496.951,And you say that for compensatory damages you rely on the lid in dollar amount.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2496.951,2497.572,Yes.
2001.00-1614,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2497.572,2498.603,For back pay time.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2508.097,2513.298,"That is correct, and the reason why is because Congress looked at this problem."
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2531.585,2543.352,"Ms. Price, I don't understand the rationale for treating continuing violations differently in so far as how far you can go back to get damages."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2543.352,2551.526,I can understand why you should treat them differently for purposes of determining whether you can bring suit at all.
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2591.938,2597.361,You... you can't bring suit for that if you don't sue within 300 days.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2610.347,2611.007,Yes.
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2611.007,2612.455,It continues on and on.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2634.042,2640.069,706(g) determines how far one can go for back damages.
2001.00-1614,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2677.509,2678.79,You're saying it's not a continuing violation.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2678.79,2679.328,--Right.
2001.00-1614,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2732.866,2740.834,"Well, should we look to what a reasonable person should be expected to recognize as a cause of action?"
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2740.834,2742.858,No.
2001.00-1614,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2745.847,2750.039,There shouldn't be any objective test element in it?
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2750.039,2760.73,I think that it's appropriate to look at this continuing violation circumstance in the same way in which the Court has looked at the hostile environment claim.
2001.00-1614,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2818.937,2828.596,"But it's not certain because if it is a truly continuing violation... every promotion, every... every training I ask for is going to be denied... it will never end."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2850.953,2851.918,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.00-1614,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2851.918,2862.897,I think your basic position is these filing periods are like a statute of limitations in some respects but not in other respects.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2862.897,2867.084,"This is true, and I believe that's why there is that language in Zipes."
2001.00-1614,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2910.33,2916.646,Or the 45 days that you have if you're a Government employee to start consulting in your own house.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2916.646,2917.139,Exactly.
2001.00-1614,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2924.531,2937.367,One of... one of the peculiarities is the difference between 180-day and 300 which makes very good sense as far as administrative exhaustion is concerned.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2937.367,2938.11,Yes.
2001.00-1614,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2938.11,2952.684,But as... why should the person who's in a deferral state get 300 days while the person who's not get only 180 days if we're talking about a statute of limitations as measuring the ripeness or staleness of a claim?
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,2952.684,2954.291,"Yes, that is true."
2001.00-1614,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3022.651,3027.852,"But if... he complained in October 1991 to the EEOC, didn't he?"
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,3033.015,3041.41,"Well, there's no indication that he discovered... he knew that there were racist practices going on at the yard."
2001.00-1614,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3077.802,3079.659,But he did go to EEOC.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,3079.659,3089.403,"--He went to EEOC, yes, when they indicated that they intended to fire him, and that would result in the absolute termination of his relationship with Amtrak."
2001.00-1614,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3089.403,3099.35,"There's some confusion in the... you are referring not to the EEOC charge that didn't come to till the end of the line, but the EEO charges that he filed in-house."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,3099.35,3099.655,Yes.
2001.00-1614,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3099.655,3101.124,And that's what you're saying he did earlier.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,3101.124,3101.496,Yes.
2001.00-1614,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3111.981,3115.863,When... when was the first time he filed a complaint with the EEOC?
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,3115.863,3119.328,--It was in February of 1995.
2001.00-1614,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3119.328,3125.456,"You know, 300 days is... it's almost a year."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,3168.181,3180.152,"In this case, Mr.... Justice Scalia, the... as I pointed out, the... the statute of limitations operates somewhat differently."

2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,3260.567,3264.737,"I regret, Justice Ginsburg, I'm not... I don't know how many."
2001.00-1614,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3264.737,3272.206,"Because that would be a very odd statute of limitations to say, depending on your... the State that you're in, you get 180 days or 300 days."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,3272.206,3273.115,This is true.
2001.00-1614,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3303.785,3317.038,"But Mr. Englert said that the limitation, the 2-year limitation... that's because Congress was reacting to a time when there was no limitation and there were fears that you'd have to go all the way back to 1965."
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,3331.611,3333.59,Congress had an opportunity.

2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,3407.334,3410.289,"Not under the petitioner's theory, no."
2001.00-1614,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3465.645,3473.447,But you recognize that you can't turn every discrete act into a continuing violation.
2001.00-1614,2,38214,pamela_y_price,,3495.904,3505.126,"I think that the courts have not... have been able to determine where there's a discrete act, and there's nothing happens."

2001.00-1614,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3615.55,3617.846,What's the difference between your position and the Government's?

2001.00-1614,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3675.803,3684.181,Could you explain the logic in statute of limitations terms between giving some people 300 and others 180?
2001.00-1614,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3684.181,3687.07,The only logic is that that's what Congress said.
