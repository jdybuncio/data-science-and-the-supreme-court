1971.70-60,0,15635,arnold_bauman,,36.927,41.41,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-60,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,225.12,225.838,Mr. Bowman.
1971.70-60,0,15635,arnold_bauman,,225.838,226.809,Yes sir?
1971.70-60,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,226.809,233.186,"It is a term a issue in this case, in connection with the purchase of (Inaudible)"
1971.70-60,0,15635,arnold_bauman,,233.186,236.726,"Your honor, I was just this moment coming to that."
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,1902.964,1906.701,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.735,2144.146,You do accept whatever the bonds applied?
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2144.146,2155.495,We separate the bonds from the stock only to the extent that we say that the government relies on the bond sale as the basis for which we say the Court of Appeals below should be reversed.
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.495,2157.832,Not the (Inaudible)
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2157.832,2158.518,Certainly not.
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.518,2160.689,You do not need to go (Inaudible)
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2160.689,2167.376,"That all, as long as we show that someone part of the scheme involved the purchase or sale or is in connection with the purchase or sale of --."
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.376,2173.736,(Inaudible)
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2173.736,2177.068,We say the stock selling section was a part of the overall scheme.
1971.70-60,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2216.239,2219.58,(Inaudible)
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2219.58,2224.001,"We have suggested that on a number of occasions, we have suggested it in the Second Circuit itself."
1971.70-60,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2224.001,2224.714,Are you suggesting?
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2224.714,2239.91,"And we suggested in this case, largely just by a way of a footnote that says that we have never agreed to that theory, but we realize that in order to win this case on that ground you had to overturn Birnbaum whereas you do not necessarily overturn it and the other is context."
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2412.366,2419.818,(Inaudible)
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2419.818,2423.526,You mean under 10 (b) (5)?
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.526,2428.248,(Inaudible)
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2428.248,2434.887,The representative of the creditor certainly would have that right and here the plaintiff in this case is the Superintendent of Insurance.
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2434.887,2437.658,(Inaudible)
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2437.658,2439.258,Pardon?
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.258,2443.772,(Inaudible) to bring derivative actions on behalf of the corporation?
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2443.772,2447.222,"No I do not say that, but I do not think that is the key thing here."
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2461.048,2465.246,Are those creditors' claims been unsatisfied?
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2465.246,2473.118,"I do not know to what extend there are still outstanding unsatisfied claims, I think I have to refer that question maybe to private counsel but I do know that --"
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2473.118,2480.359,"The important fact of the creditors have been paid in full, would not that be a relevant fact?"
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2480.359,2487.548,"In the process to whatever extent the creditors have been paid, I will assume that in the process, someone else has been subrogated to their right."
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.964,2531.404,So you look at this as something like the transfer by a corporation and fraud of creditors?
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2531.404,2532.662,Yes something of that.
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2532.662,2535.87,That might have (Inaudible) an act of bankruptcy reasons.
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2535.87,2538.433,"That is right, if that could be."
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.831,2681.438,"Would you take the thing of course that the sale of the bonds went through and there had been no previous intention to steal the money and then one of the officers, they just walk off with the cash‚Äù?"
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2681.438,2683.145,Well that would be a little harder case but --
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2683.145,2697.04,"Well, it is the proceeds, you will suddenly get the idea walking back to the bank that it might be well to go to South America and you go, the (Voice Overlap) never gets the proceeds."
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2697.04,2710.734,"I would not be prepared to conceive if there would not be a 10 (b) (5) action even under those circumstances, but this case is much stronger than that because there was a pre-conceived plan or scheme to do this very thing and the sale of the securities was a part of that scheme."
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2710.734,2733.467,"It does not Court of Appeals think that perhaps the securities laws, what intended just to cover ordinary fraud by director and officer and it would be difficult to contain the reach of the 10 (b) of this case would cover?"
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2733.467,2747.268,"That is a part of the type of reasoning of the Court below used in this case, but as long as you maintain the integrity of the requirement that the fraud be in connection with the purchase or sale of securities."
1971.70-60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2765.792,2778.478,"Even if that would be true, you say, even if you eliminated the purchase or seller requirement, as long as there was a sale somewhere?"
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2778.478,2783.338,Mr. Justice White I assume you are talking now about the requirement that the plaintiff himself be a purchaser or a seller.
1971.70-60,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2823.025,2824.39,"I think your time is up, Mr. North."
1971.70-60,1,45729,walter_p_north,,2824.39,2827.517,"I believe it is, Your Honor and I am sorry if I ran over."
1971.70-60,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2832.696,2837.522,Mr. Karatz.
1971.70-60,2,45196,william_w_karatz,,2837.522,2841.284,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-60,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3002.727,3011.307,Why is it so important to you though to be in the State Court rather than in the Federal Court?
1971.70-60,2,45196,william_w_karatz,,3011.307,3031.048,"Your Honor, if I may be very frank about the reason why we are here today, and quite frankly I am glad I am here today because I think this is an important issue of law because Chief Judge Ryan invited the defendants to make a motion to dismiss."
1971.70-60,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3212.156,3214.32,"Mr. Karatz, do you represent Irving Trust?"
1971.70-60,2,45196,william_w_karatz,,3214.32,3215.008,Yes sir.
1971.70-60,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3215.008,3221.127,"What did Irving trust did all of these deals, some kind of a fee for this five million dollar check?"
1971.70-60,2,45196,william_w_karatz,,3221.127,3228.722,"Now, quite frankly, Your Honor, Irving received no fee for the five -- let me break up the checks."
1971.70-60,3,28650,irving_parker,,4759.435,4766.089,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-60,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4938.364,4941.035,You are speaking now of the Federal discovery?
1971.70-60,3,28650,irving_parker,,4941.035,4944.365,"Yes Your Honor, in this case."
1971.70-60,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4969.21,4970.959,"That goes to the merits, does not it?"
1971.70-60,3,28650,irving_parker,,4970.959,4974.14,"Your honor, it goes to this jurisdictional question."
1971.70-60,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4974.14,4976.879,Because there are other defendants other than Bankers?
1971.70-60,3,28650,irving_parker,,4976.879,4979.58,"There are, Your Honor and the fact to the matter is, Your Honor --"
1971.70-60,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4979.58,4985.142,"The cause of action against one of them, under the Securities Act, it should be reversed, should it not?"
1971.70-60,3,28650,irving_parker,,4985.142,4991.977,"No Your Honor, there is precedent for what I am contending for here and I will come to that, Your Honor."
1971.70-60,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5258.945,5270.476,"Are you suggesting that we can, even if we can reverse the Court of Appeals, nevertheless (Inaudible)"
1971.70-60,3,28650,irving_parker,,5270.476,5273.937,"In 30 seconds I will answer your question, if I may Your Honor."
1971.70-60,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5349.194,5355.551,Should we have to judge the Court of Appeals on that aspect of decision before we dealt with this?
1971.70-60,3,28650,irving_parker,,5355.551,5359.371,"Dividing Bankers Life from the others, there was no occasion for them to do it Your Honor."
1971.70-60,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5361.008,5362.21,I understand that.
1971.70-60,3,28650,irving_parker,,5366.079,5369.175,And I think they were correct about that Your Honor and I think they are correct.
1971.70-60,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5369.175,5371.499,Assume they were wrong about that?
1971.70-60,3,28650,irving_parker,,5371.499,5382.918,"That there was Federal jurisdiction in some form as to some parties, they still, I would think and I think that on the basis of Schaunbaum and Firstbrook, the Court of Appeals would certainly have dismissed this to us."
1971.70-60,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5382.918,5385.849,Well at least they have a time to refer?
1971.70-60,3,28650,irving_parker,,5385.849,5388.235,"I do not see if there is any need for it, Your Honor."
1971.70-60,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5388.235,5398.464,"Well, that will require us to (Inaudible)"
1971.70-60,3,28650,irving_parker,,5398.464,5401.538,"Well, I think on the basis of the briefs alone that will appear Your Honor."
1971.70-60,4,15635,arnold_bauman,,5487.285,5489.78,"I think perhaps I should have in luncheon recess, Your Honor."
1971.70-60,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5489.78,5490.125,I think that (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-60,4,15635,arnold_bauman,,5490.125,5492.181,At least I have attempted to and --
1971.70-60,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5492.181,5493.781,I think that was the one I was carrying in mind.
1971.70-60,4,15635,arnold_bauman,,5493.781,5496.185,"If there is an outstanding question, I will happy to try to answer."
1971.70-60,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5496.185,5497.507,Very well.
1971.70-60,4,15635,arnold_bauman,,5498.655,5499.303,Thank you sir.
1971.70-60,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5499.303,5503.911,The case is submitted.
