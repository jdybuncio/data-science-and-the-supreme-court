1973.72-812,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,82.169,"We'll hear arguments next in 72-812, 72-6050, Storer against Brown and Frommhagen against Brown."
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,83.523,86.164,"May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.72-812,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,126.657,129.449,You mean recognized in a way?
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,129.449,129.804,That’s right.
1973.72-812,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,215.881,221.017,What you’re getting into now is something I didn’t quite understand when I read the briefs.
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,239.563,239.987,No
1973.72-812,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,239.987,240.968,"Well, what does he vote for?"
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,240.968,247.261,"At the primary election, you have a Democratic primary or Republican primary, and two other primaries."
1973.72-812,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,256.87,260.346,That is to put issues onto the ballot at the general election?
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,260.346,263.516,"To decide legislation -- we decide legislation in California by ballot, voted by the people."
1973.72-812,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,263.516,265.55,"Could you do that in the primary election, not the general election?"
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,265.55,268.752,Do it in both.
1973.72-812,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,268.752,269.52,Or --
1973.72-812,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,269.52,271.132,Either one?
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,271.132,272.125,Yes.
1973.72-812,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,300.71,301.149,Uh-huh.
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,301.149,306.509,But he votes if the election is coterminous for such Offices as City Councilmen and Supervisor on that date.
1973.72-812,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,306.509,307.399,Which are nonpartisan?
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,307.399,321.256,"Which are nonpartisan and so you have a person who go to the primary election and cast ballot and yet in the California Election scheme, although they haven’t participated in the partisan primary, they are not permitted to sign nominating petitions for independents."
1973.72-812,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,321.256,330.011,"Because he voted at what is a primary election and held on the same day as a primary election, although it itself was not a primary election, is that right?"
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,330.011,334.187,It's not by most persons’ terms a primary election so called in California.
1973.72-812,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,334.187,344.624,"Well, I’ve always understood a primary election to be one where there are candidates for the nomination of a particular party and I vote for one or the other candidate, but that’s not what you’re talking about?"
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,344.624,345.598,"No, no."
1973.72-812,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,367.283,368.04,"No, but at the time of the election --"
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,368.04,369.815,But they kept calling it a primary election.
1973.72-812,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,369.815,371.164,But at the election we’re talking about.
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,371.164,372.156,"Yes, ride-in candidate."
1973.72-812,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,372.156,381.493,There were candidates for nomination in the both Republican and the Democratic Parties or perhaps for other parties?
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,381.493,381.809,"Yes, this –-"
1973.72-812,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,381.809,387.003,"For some, and then in addition to that though these nonpartisan things that you –-"
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,387.003,389.882,"Nonpartisan ballots, but Storer, one of the Appellants here can --"
1973.72-812,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,389.882,391.923,But it is still called a primary election?
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,391.923,392.498,Yes.
1973.72-812,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,392.498,406.585,"And anyone who voted, if he voted only on the matter of those initiative or whatever those propositions where, that then disqualified him from signing one of these petitions after August 15, is that it?"
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,406.585,408.911,The Code Section so reads then that’s what the lower court held.
1973.72-812,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,408.911,409.352,Right.
1973.72-812,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,409.352,436.948,"So voter on primary election day goes down to the polling place and he can say I am a Republican in which case he is given a ballot containing the various aspirants for to be nominated under Republican party plus the issues in nonpartisan candidates or in some a Democrat in which case he gets the Democratic ballot plus the issues, or he can say decline -- I decline to state in which he gets only the latter?"
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,436.948,438.261,That’s right.
1973.72-812,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,442.744,447.259,I see.
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,447.259,471.717,"Well anyway, now, those people excluded from signing a petition and the Appellant Storer is also since he cast a nonpartisan ballot excluded by virtue of that from running for offices as an independent, and further he is not permitted to run as an independent because some ten months before the general election he was registered as a Democrat and California requires you if you been a member of a political party to wait 17 months before an election, before you can be an independent."
1973.72-812,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,471.717,473.365,"It just says 17 months, that’s --"
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,473.365,477.927,"Well, it’s the period 12 months before the primary election and then you add the five months then --"
1973.72-812,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.927,479.415,Between primary and general?
1973.72-812,0,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,479.415,479.959,Right.
1973.72-812,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,481.585,485.759,"And that is before you can be a candidate, not before you can vote in the primary, isn’t it?"
1973.72-812,1,32699,joseph_remcho,,1000.03,1003.204,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-812,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1006.473,1007.691,I was just refreshing my recollection.
1973.72-812,1,32699,joseph_remcho,,1007.691,1009.617,"Oh, okay."
1973.72-812,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1166.851,1176.834,"Mr. Remcho, if you are right on the point you are arguing here then was not Lippitt against Cipollone wrongly decided?"
1973.72-812,1,32699,joseph_remcho,,1176.834,1189.013,"I think the Court in Lippitt, that’s the lower case, Your Honor did not address fully that issue of Article 1 Section 2."
1973.72-812,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1208.487,1219.213,The Ohio rule was surely an added qualification which the State couldn't impose over and above those set by Article 1 just as much as the California qualification.
1973.72-812,1,32699,joseph_remcho,,1219.213,1220.663,I think that’s right Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1973.72-812,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1226.803,1227.142,"No, I think (Voice Overlap)"
1973.72-812,1,32699,joseph_remcho,,1227.142,1228.346,"Excuse me, excuse me."
1973.72-812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1274.794,1279.633,Does that opinion use the term fundamental right or constitutional right?
1973.72-812,1,32699,joseph_remcho,,1279.633,1281.799,"They use the term constitutional right, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1973.72-812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1281.799,1284.172,I wonder why you don’t.
1973.72-812,1,32699,joseph_remcho,,1284.172,1284.849,I will in the future.
1973.72-812,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1284.849,1287.894,[Laughter]
1973.72-812,1,32699,joseph_remcho,,1287.894,1299.044,"But I think that case which also spoke of Article 1, Section 2 not specifically to the qualifications, but as one of the basis for the constitutional right."
1973.72-812,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1306.355,1309.765,That was a right to have his vote counted?
1973.72-812,1,32699,joseph_remcho,,1309.765,1313.328,"No, that was a case -- that is right to be counted and also to be a candidate Mr. Justice Marshall."
1973.72-812,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1313.328,1319.545,"The United States against Classic was a right of a voter as a primary to have it vote, can’t it?"
1973.72-812,1,32699,joseph_remcho,,1319.545,1320.342,That is correct.
1973.72-812,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1320.342,1322.057,That’s all it was about?
1973.72-812,1,32699,joseph_remcho,,1322.057,1332.165,"Well, I think now Mr. Justice Marshall, the decision -- this was a case in which to decide whether or not the Defendants in that case violated a constitutional right."
1973.72-812,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1347.551,1349.253,Does the candidate (Inaudible)
1973.72-812,1,32699,joseph_remcho,,1349.253,1354.786,That is right.
1973.72-812,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1423.509,1424.526,Thank you.
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,1430.083,1433.334,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1624.643,1630.301,And how many voters just to take to organize a new party Mr. Clayton P. Roche? 1/15 of 1%?
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,1630.301,1631.715,1% of the registration.
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1664.62,1665.453,I don't follow that?
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,1665.453,1668.063,"Oh, well in other words –-"
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1668.063,1669.721,I mean Georgia was more liberal.
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,1672.251,1680.04,"Well, a party can stay -- that is right, it is -- no, they could have zero."
1973.72-812,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1699.512,1701.396,They are more liberal and less fluid?
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1701.396,1704.503,That’s about it.
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,1704.503,1717.965,"So basically what I’m saying is that without reference to the independent nomination procedure itself, the fluidity of political life is taking care of in California."
1973.72-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1720.568,1733.618,We will resume there right after lunch Mr. Roche.
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,1735.991,1737.572,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1973.72-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2073.371,2078.065,"When you say it is series, all on the same day or –-"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2078.065,2078.281,Oh!
1973.72-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2083.184,2086.373,"They all go to the same polling place, don’t they?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2086.373,2088.884,Yes sir.
1973.72-812,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2111.998,2125.968,"Mr. Roche, do I not detect the disagreement between your position and that of your opponent's so far as participation in the nonpartisan primary leads to disqualification?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2125.968,2128.474,That was our position below Your Honor that I feel that –-
1973.72-812,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2128.474,2131.728,Is it your position here?
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2131.728,2137.82,"If required to sustain the constitutionality, that would be my position, yes sir."
1973.72-812,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2137.82,2143.557,Did I correctly detect your opponent’s position to be the contrary of this?
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2144.682,2155.447,"I understand it that -- unfortunately, the District Court considered the primary as single election."
1973.72-812,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2270.687,2276.746,"Mr. Roche, am I correct that you have five ballots at this primary?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2276.746,2278.431,That is correct Your Honor.
1973.72-812,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2278.431,2280.903,And four ballots at party ballots?
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2280.903,2281.728,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-812,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2281.728,2295.618,"And assuming there’s a valid reason to prevent the persons that participate in the party part of the primary, what then put restriction on the person that does not vote for party?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2295.618,2299.124,"I know of know reason to restrict it, Your Honor."
1973.72-812,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2305.078,2312.206,"But would you want us to strike that down, that part of it?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2312.206,2315.991,"I would be happy if nothing were struck down, Your Honor but [Laughter Attempt]"
1973.72-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2315.991,2322.415,I suppose your interest is in sustaining the judgment that brought you up here.
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2339.167,2339.559,Oh!
1973.72-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2340.211,2341.117,Easy to identify?
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2341.117,2349.823,There are registration list posted right outside of the polls and also the registration books have the registration or whether they are declining –-
1973.72-812,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2349.823,2359.038,"That would mean checking the petitions against those lists for verification, is that done routinely anyway or only –-"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2359.038,2383.29,"I would, I would, yes, I would presume so and actually, I talked to the Registrar at voters at Los Angeles County and this is not in the record, just off the record, we were talking about how they did it and as I understand it, their position was that they counted people who voted a nonpartisan ballot at the primary."
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2422.534,2437.043,"So, you are telling us -- do I understand you correctly, you are telling us what despite what the Federal District Court seemed to hold on this case, the California law may be to the contrary?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2437.043,2438.141,"That is right, Your Honor."
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2438.141,2456.258,"Well then would not this, if there is an ambiguity would this have been appropriate case for the District Court to have abstained to get the California law construed by the only Court’s qualified to do it and is the California Court?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2456.258,2459.114,"Well, Your Honor, I made the argument."
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2463.192,2464.371,But by a Federal Court that you can qualify?
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2464.371,2477.772,"No, we have it and we also have an older construction by the California Supreme Court that the primary is essentially a number of primaries held at the same time."
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2477.772,2481.534,You mean a construction then contrary to the holding of the District Court in this case?
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2481.534,2486.11,I think basically.
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.11,2490.246,"But not really on the point, not on this precise issue, is it?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2490.246,2491.162,Not now if it is regard –-
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2491.162,2510.079,"I mean that the holding here was by the District Court as I understand it at least that because, one of these people had voted as an independent, has to refused to state -- client to state voter at a so called primary which he didn’t vote in the party primary?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2528.985,2544.168,"Well, let me put it this way, if the Court feels it necessary to uphold the constitutionality of the independent nomination procedure, I would go for the construction that it is a series of primaries and not --"
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2544.168,2551.468,"But I am suggesting to you that we, this Court has no power whatsoever to construe the meaning of a California statute."
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2567.143,2567.525,"Well, I --"
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2567.525,2573.318,It’s up to the California Courts.
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2573.318,2581.686,"Well, it seems to me that the California Courts, though not in this context, has sufficiently construed it so that this Court could follow the California law."
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2581.686,2587.267,"But this, but the three-judge District Court in this case did not so understand it?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2604.346,2607.949,"Well, that’s how they construed it, yes sir."
1973.72-812,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2607.949,2623.18,"Was there any of point made to the Three-Judge District Court in this case that it should not defer, should abstain from reaching the constitutional issues here ending a determination of what the California law is by the California Courts?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2623.18,2623.874,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-812,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2642.237,2645.82,"Well it's about three weeks before the election t too, isn't it?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2645.82,2647.578,"[Laughter Attempt] Well, that’s right Your Honor."
1973.72-812,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2652.086,2657.941,"If I may back up, I am intrigued about these five ballots."
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2663.892,2665.04,Pardon?
1973.72-812,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2665.04,2669.138,The independent ballot at the “primary election?”
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2669.138,2694.103,"We also have nominations for nonpartisan officers and if a nonpartisan -- a number of people will file nomination papers, for example for County Supervisor or District Attorney or other County offices, and if they receive a majority of the votes cast at the primary, they will be elected that the primary is then transmuted into the general election and they are declared elected."
1973.72-812,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2694.68,2698.614,"That’s no problem, that is -- become a primary?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2698.614,2706.535,"But because if they do -- if nobody receives a majority of the votes cast, then there will be a run off election at the general election."
1973.72-812,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2709.442,2717.001,Do you have any primary ballots of independents that don’t have any candidates on but just have propositions on it?
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2717.001,2727.976,Not that I -- did not have but we would normally consider the primary election because at least you say in General Law Counties if the County –-
1973.72-812,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2727.976,2736.197,Well would you think it would be valid for the State of California to say that anybody votes in the bond election cannot run for office?
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2736.197,2737.628,No.
1973.72-812,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2737.628,2741.663,How much difference is it?
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2741.663,2756.752,"No, not much difference Your Honor."
1973.72-812,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2756.752,2760.521,"Mr. Roche, let me ask you a question while they are going on."
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2772.009,2772.215,Yes Sir.
1973.72-812,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2772.215,2776.089,"As I remember the Jenness case, we didn’t know such thing."
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2798.304,2812.862,"Oh, well my basic position is that we should examine California law in its totality as was done in Williams versus Rhodes and Jenness versus Fortson and that –-"
1973.72-812,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2812.862,2816.663,I think it wasn’t done in Jenness against Fortson?
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2816.663,2820.684,"As I read it, it was because as I recalled it --"
1973.72-812,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2820.684,2824.262,"Well, it doesn’t make any difference."
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2826.669,2842.783,My recollection was that the Court examined all the totality of the Georgia Election Laws and then showed that all these various alternatives routes to the ballot.
1973.72-812,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2874.013,2880.915,"But if we do that, then why is it necessary to argue as you are arguing now to take up each provisions separately?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,2880.915,2893.346,Because if any of these particular provisions should be considered onerous.
1973.72-812,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3102.189,3118.615,"But it is there really a problem Mr. Roche of Republicans and Democrats desiring to vote as independents in order to nominate the weakest independent candidate so that the Republican or Democrat, a candidate might triumph at the general election?"
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,3123.302,3126.657,"That that would be how the analogy would be, yes Your Honor."
1973.72-812,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3143.923,3153.12,"Now, that is good argument as to the prohibition against those who have voted in a party primary, not nominating any independent."
1973.72-812,2,19918,clayton_p_roche,,3156.895,3161.144,"No, it isn’t [Laughter Attempt] unfortunately."
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3260.998,3263.797,"Well, there are two things going on here though."
1973.72-812,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3282.187,3300.96,But do you think they -- my question is do you think they should have to bites at it; to vote in the primary of the Democrats or the Republicans and then in effect get a “vote” by having his signature on the petition function the same as to vote in the primary?
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3300.96,3310.297,"Well, I don’t think it’s unconstitutional as to such system Indeed Georgia has that system, but I do not think it is unconstitutional to acquire them to make a choice."
1973.72-812,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3313.239,3319.683,"You are suggesting it is unconstitutional, are you not to fail to allow that?"
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3332.34,3338.034,It is violation because they won’t let the independent compete at the time of the primary.
1973.72-812,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3347.232,3355.62,Is there anything that prevents the independents from saying that we are going to have a convention of independence on the day of the primary?
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3355.62,3355.869,Well --
1973.72-812,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3355.869,3365.984,"And don’t go to the Republican, don’t go to the general primary but come to our convention and sign a pledge card that you will sign a petition, anything?"
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3365.984,3370.872,"That’s all very well if independents were in fact like a political party, but they’re not."
1973.72-812,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3397.585,3397.763,I’m not sure –-
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3397.763,3404.209,"Now, what happens to the California is the man can’t even circulate the petitions until two months after the primary."
1973.72-812,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3472.226,3477.487,"Do I understand you that this man doesn’t want a party, doesn’t want any backing?"
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3477.487,3479.402,He doesn’t want any backing of an organized political party.
1973.72-812,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3479.402,3481.494,Does he want to get elected?
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3481.494,3481.856,Pardon?
1973.72-812,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3481.856,3482.894,Does he want to get elected?
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3482.894,3484.237,"Yes, he wants to get elected."
1973.72-812,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3484.237,3485.594,Without any backing?
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3485.594,3488.304,"Well, without a political party’s backing."
1973.72-812,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3488.304,3490.473,"Well, if he gets backing, they’d be a part?"
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3490.473,3493.247,"Well, it won’t be a party under the terms that he conceives of a party."
1973.72-812,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3555.763,3562.377,"But of course, your argument under Article 1, Section 2 isn't absolute foreclosure, it’s burdening or increasing."
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3569.918,3578.773,"Well, what I am saying in Lippitt, the issue was raised essentially as an Equal Protection one and you can go into all kinds of balances at that point, but Article 1, Section 2 does not allow for balance."
1973.72-812,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3628.597,3629.683,(Inaudible).
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3629.683,3632.514,Right.
1973.72-812,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3632.514,3635.274,There's no man running for office in that state?
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3635.274,3643.167,"No, it was group of -- it was Section 19 and 20 case that was a criminal prosecution for people for interfering with the right of those candidates to run for office."
1973.72-812,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3643.167,3645.856,"That is, you suppose (Inaudible)."
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3645.856,3651.043,"Well, I’d say Your Honor at page 308, this is the right of the candidates to run for office."
1973.72-812,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3651.043,3654.784,National (Inaudible).
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3654.784,3657.68,"Oh, let me move to abstention just for a moment."
1973.72-812,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3667.712,3669.497,"But that was after the election, wasn’t it?"
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3669.497,3672.273,"No, no, it was August 18, 1972."
1973.72-812,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3672.273,3673.017,"Well then, what –-"
1973.72-812,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3673.017,3674.147,The election was in November?
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3674.147,3674.598,Yes.
1973.72-812,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3674.598,3675.57,Alright.
1973.72-812,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3675.57,3681.783,"So this was directed not to the primary, but not to the getting on the ballot in the primary but to get out in general?"
1973.72-812,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3681.783,3682.068,Yes.
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3682.068,3684.01,It was filed before the primary election.
1973.72-812,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3689.353,3714.241,"Mr. Halvonik, regardless of whether or not abstention was raised below, doesn’t it appear here as was exposed by my brother Blackmun that there is an argument between you and your brothers on the other side as to what the California law is, at least with respect to the man who voted down as a refuse to what do you call him, “Declines to State?”"
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3714.241,3716.818,"“Declines to State,” no matter how much you want to stay."
1973.72-812,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3716.818,3722.006,“Declines to State” and the primary as to his eligibility to run as a candidate?
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3722.006,3722.673,I do not know we’ve really handled this –-
1973.72-812,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3722.673,3729.458,"You seem to disagree as to what the California law is and as we all know that is a question we could not resolve, we have no power to."
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3729.458,3734.924,"When I brought the case, I had to assume that the language in the Code Section meant what it said, and I had to attack that Section."
1973.72-812,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3747.336,3747.599,I know.
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3747.599,3754.387,"Now, it seems to me that if you interpret it anyway other -- if you interpret the way the District Court interprets it, it is clearly unconstitutional."
1973.72-812,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3764.911,3780.251,"But the -- I do not know what your California law is in this respect, but I would guess maybe that Mr. Roche is hardly authorized to tell us that his statute means something other than what it appears to say?"
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3780.251,3791.057,"Well, I would suppose it and the only answer is that if as I contend it, it is clearly facially unconstitutional is to hold an unconstitutional and if the State Court wants to say you made an error the way you read it, they can do that and revive –-"
1973.72-812,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3791.057,3792.332,"Well, that’s not the only alternative."
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3799.657,3804.023,"Well, one difficulty was that is though we did not file that suit three weeks before the election."
1973.72-812,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3847.011,3848.104,I think your time is up for now Mr. Halvonik.
1973.72-812,3,37991,paul_n_halvonik,,3848.104,3849.552,It is indeed.
1973.72-812,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3850.077,3850.785,Thank you gentlemen.
