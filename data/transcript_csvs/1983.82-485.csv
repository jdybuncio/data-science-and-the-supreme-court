1983.82-485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.919,We will hear arguments first in Kathy Keeton against Hustler Magazine.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,15.198,19.29,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,299.723,300.848,That was the Court's opinion.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,300.848,304.424,The Court's opinion written by Mr. Justice White.
1983.82-485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,342.019,344.159,"I am a little surprised, Mr. Grutman."
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,351.0,351.123,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1983.82-485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,376.911,381.097,--But it certainly bears on World-Wide Volkswagen.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,381.097,400.557,"I think it does, but I think that Volkswagen in its facts and in the more expansive treatment in the Court's opinion is a case which I think provides the springboard from which the Court can find in this lawsuit that what you have present in this case and what was lacking in Volkswagen."
1983.82-485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,558.243,571.456,"Of course, a nationwide publisher creates a forum, presumably, in almost any state, and I suppose it has always been libel plaintiff's position that they are perfectly at liberty to shop."
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,571.456,572.409,They are what?
1983.82-485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,572.409,575.22,They are perfectly at liberty to shop in that kind of--
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,575.22,599.507,"I think that is absolutely correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because libel is a peculiar kind of a tort, and when we are dealing with media defendants that are nationwide in the scope of the economic activities that they pursue, seeking the benefits of the marketplace nationwide, they have the unique ability of simultaneously creating the harm which the libel causes in all of the places where the publication is disseminated."
1983.82-485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,716.99,729.846,--Do you understand respondent's contention in that regard to mean something more than just the state of New Hampshire was willing to accept this case in a state court?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,733.64,734.172,--Precisely.
1983.82-485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,736.437,739.263,"So it must have a constitutional dimension, the term states--"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,739.263,759.411,"--I think that there is a constitutional dimension, and it could primarily be derived from the fact that an indispensable ingredient of state sovereignty is the right of any state to regulate intentional harm which takes place within the perimeter of its geographical confines, particularly where that harm is not unintentional."
1983.82-485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,759.411,766.83,--I meant that I thought the respondent's contention that there must be a state interest had a constitutional dimension to it.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,766.83,769.517,"Beyond what I have said, I am not prepared to concede that."
1983.82-485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,769.517,773.687,"Well, no, I don't ask you to; but is that your understanding of respondent's contention?"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,783.309,794.741,"I am not really sure that I can agree with that, because I think that takes us into a very murky area, where it would be extremely difficult to predict or to understand what kind of state interest they want."
1983.82-485,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,905.978,909.226,"Well, Mr. Grutman, does that include any actual harm to the plaintiff?"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,911.507,911.772,Yes.
1983.82-485,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,916.676,917.629,That harm being?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,917.629,924.97,"The harm occurs in the defamation itself, the negative reputation if she doesn't have a positive reputation."
1983.82-485,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,963.235,969.577,It is alleged that this particular issue which involved the petitioner--
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,969.577,969.889,Yes.
1983.82-485,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,969.889,971.186,--was circulated?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,971.186,972.794,"Oh, there is no question about that."
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,994.41,997.081,"Would this apply in Alaska, too?"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,997.081,997.878,I beg your pardon?
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,997.878,1000.018,Would it apply in Alaska?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1000.018,1004.625,"It would apply, Mr. Justice Marshall, wherever the magazine was circulated."
1983.82-485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.949,1023.398,"Just to clarify the point, that would be even if the plaintiff was totally unknown in the jurisdiction before the magazine was circulated?"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1051.576,1052.84,"A very different case, Mr. Justice White."
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1052.84,1055.589,"I know it is different, but how... what would be--"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1055.589,1056.027,I think that is a case--
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1056.027,1056.745,--Would the result be different?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1056.745,1057.605,--It might he different.
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.023,1063.445,Yes.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1063.445,1070.52,"There you have to look for other... I think your phrase is affiliating circumstances, other connections, judicially cognizable ties--"
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.52,1086.201,"Is your position that if this case had been brought in the New Hampshire state courts, is it your position that the New Hampshire courts would have been required by the federal Constitution to entertain the suit?"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1086.201,1091.59,"--I don't think that is a question that is inherent in the case, but I think that they should have, yes."
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1091.59,1099.118,And you would say that they would not be entitled just to dismiss the suit?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1099.118,1104.522,"I am not entirely sure of the answer to that question, because that is a state court, and your question postulated a state court."
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1115.268,1127.45,"Well, what if you... I suppose you think that the court of appeals held... held that the federal Constitution prohibited New Hampshire from entertaining--"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1127.45,1129.356,"--Yes, the federal court would be prohibited."
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1131.839,1137.899,"--Well, suppose a state court could have dismissed it without having any problems under the Constitution."
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1137.899,1138.79,Yes--
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.79,1150.722,Could a federal court sitting in that district also dismiss it for the same reason that the--
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1150.722,1151.534,"--I do not think so, because the requirements--"
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1151.534,1151.831,--Why not?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1152.05,1154.721,--Because the requirement--
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.721,1158.938,You couldn't say it's a constitutional problem.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1161.421,1166.012,"--Mr. Justice White, I am not sure of the answer to this question."
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.106,1176.15,"Aren't you claiming, though, that the district court was required to entertain it by the Constitution?"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1176.15,1177.056,"Yes, I am."
1983.82-485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1177.056,1178.898,But you don't have to go that far.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1178.898,1182.179,"Perhaps I don't have to, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1182.179,1191.612,"All you have to prove, really, is that New Hampshire would have entertained it, could have under the Constitution, and this was a federal court sitting in diversity."
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1191.612,1192.455,Exactly.
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.981,1213.212,"Well, you do have to... you do have to, though, say that... you do have to say that the Constitution would not have forbidden New Hampshire to entertain--"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1213.212,1222.646,"No, I don't think you can force jurisdiction on a state, on a state court, and as again I pointed out, I think there is a very big difference between state courts and federal courts and their obligations."
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1222.646,1229.19,"--Yes, but you have to say that... you have to say that the constitutional holding of the court below was wrong."
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1231.408,1233.548,"Would you repeat that for me, please, Mr. Justice White?"
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.406,1238.108,"Well, the court below held that the Constitution forbad."
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1238.108,1238.452,Yes.
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.452,1241.357,You have to overturn that.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1241.357,1242.498,"Yes, I do."
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1242.498,1244.013,You have to win on that issue.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1244.013,1252.415,"I think I do, and the reason I think I do is because the court's perception of which end of the scope to look through was just backwards."
1983.82-485,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.415,1266.238,"Well, Mr. Grutman, I understood in part of your colloquy with Justice White, that you think our cases support the proposition that a federal court in a situation like that may have an obligation to take jurisdiction even where the state court doesn't."
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1270.002,1285.965,"Because I think the obligation which the federal rules require is that a federal court cannot substitute an alternate basis of its own determination which runs contrary to what the state has said, and New Hampshire has said it would take this case."
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1285.965,1288.666,But diversity is not a constitutional principle.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1288.666,1290.962,I beg--
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1290.962,1291.446,Is it?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1291.446,1292.071,--Which is not a--
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1292.071,1295.975,Diversity is judicial--
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1295.975,1296.616,--That is correct.
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1296.616,1297.491,--and not constitutional.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1297.491,1298.272,That is correct.
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1298.272,1302.207,"Well, how does that put a constitutional burden on somebody?"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1302.207,1306.535,"Because once you have diversity, and you have a demonstration--"
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1306.535,1312.422,"Well, the only diversity here is that this person has never been in New Hampshire."
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1312.422,1318.138,"--Nor had Mr. Flynt been there, but the publication was there, the publication--"
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1318.138,1319.669,I am not talking about any case but this one.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1319.669,1320.872,--All right.
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1320.872,1328.993,And you say that she could file case in New Hampshire if she were a citizen.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1328.993,1331.165,That is what the district court said.
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1331.165,1332.743,Do you agree with that?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1332.743,1333.446,No.
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1337.038,1338.115,Except that she wasn't.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1338.115,1340.13,--My disagreement is--
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1340.13,1341.505,So what's that got to do with this case?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1341.505,1346.253,--It has to do with the fact that there's a discrimination that is being practiced upon a non-resident.
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1348.253,1351.408,"Well, doesn't diversity automatically discriminate?"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1351.408,1355.889,--I think diversity makes for jurisdiction in the federal court.
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1393.295,1393.795,I have one more question.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1393.795,1394.592,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1394.592,1396.309,Could she have filed 50 lawsuits?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1396.309,1412.585,"No, she could not, because the single publication rule requires that the plaintiff make an election of that jurisdiction in which she intends to make a claim not only for the harm that occurred in the jurisdiction where she properly brings suit, but for the harm that has occurred wherever the libel has been perpetrated."
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1412.585,1421.41,And her damages would be the damages to her reputation in New Hampshire?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1421.41,1421.925,"No, they would not."
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1432.592,1434.544,Including Alaska and Hawaii?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1434.544,1437.48,"Including Alaska, Hawaii, Kampchatga and Tobago, wherever."
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1440.495,1440.932,Guam?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1440.932,1442.995,"--Pardon, Your Honor?"
1983.82-485,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1442.995,1444.946,Why don't you go to Guam while you're at it?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1445.806,1446.774,"Anywhere, Your Honor."
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.314,1467.547,New Hampshire couldn't give remedy for any injury except that which occurred in Ne Hampshire?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1467.547,1468.875,"I disagree, Mr. Justice White."
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.547,1470.764,You just said--
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1470.764,1474.95,--The damages worldwide become--
1983.82-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1474.95,1476.198,"--In the New Hampshire suit, you could recover."
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1476.198,1482.212,"--In the New Hampshire suit, the damages sustained wherever they occur is proof that is to be brought in the New Hampshire action."
1983.82-485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1482.212,1489.866,"Of course, while you say that, you are in effect making an end run around the statute of limitations in all other jurisdictions."
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1489.866,1509.015,"That may be a by-product, or that may be a fact, but I do not think because we are a federal system, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I do not think that because we are a federal system, where the statutes of limitations in the 50 states may vary, that as soon as the earliest statute expires, that all of the others simultaneously are extinguished."
1983.82-485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1510.857,1516.98,"That isn't what I am asking, but is that one extinguished, the one that has expired?"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1519.464,1521.167,"--No, it was not extinguished at the time."
1983.82-485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1521.167,1524.602,"That is your position, and of course I suppose one could take the other position."
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1524.602,1525.477,I think not.
1983.82-485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1540.252,1541.909,May I ask another question?
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1541.909,1542.534,--Certainly.
1983.82-485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1542.534,1553.747,"The... In the red brief, they take the position that the issue is different as to the corporate publisher and the individual defendant and the parent."
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1554.403,1556.949,"That is another case for this morning, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1983.82-485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.932,1561.541,"--Well, it is this case."
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1563.478,1563.978,Exactly.
1983.82-485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1586.89,1593.856,"--Well, but in the trial court, was not jurisdiction overall all three parties challenged?"
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1593.856,1594.356,--In which--
1983.82-485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1594.356,1595.402,In the district court.
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1597.277,1601.119,"--They did, but the district court never considered--"
1983.82-485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1601.119,1601.713,Why didn't you--
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1601.713,1619.814,"--The district court said, inasmuch as they are making a determination that there is no jurisdiction over the publication, that will lump together Flynt and the corporation, and we don't thin that that is correct, because the jurisdictional equation must be separately applied to each defendant and that wasn't done in the district court."
1983.82-485,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1619.814,1623.078,--But you had an opportunity to make whatever record you need to as to the other two--
1983.82-485,0,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,1623.078,1624.172,"No, we did not fully."
1983.82-485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1629.155,1643.164,Mr. Shapiro.
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1643.164,1650.256,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1692.349,1696.737,"You say the other states, the other states have a paramount interest in the parties?"
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1696.737,1698.609,"--In the parties, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1699.141,1702.109,That seems to negate what you started out with.
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1702.109,1713.37,"--The states that have the paramount interest are New York and Ohio, the states of residence, and also those are the states where the damage from the libel principally occurred."
1983.82-485,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1719.102,1734.472,"Mr. Shapiro, would not the Ne Hampshire court have the authority if it found jurisdiction to apply the statute of limitations of the other states with respect to the recovery?"
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1734.472,1758.024,"One would think that the court should do such a thing, and that it would be reasonable to do so, but the law in New Hampshire is that the statute of limitations is procedural in nature, and that the court therefore applies its own local statute of limitations, bringing back to life a tort action that is dead in the other 49 states where 99 percent of the damages actually arose."
1983.82-485,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1758.024,1767.27,"Mr. Shapiro, if your concern is with what you feel to be manipulation of statutes of limitations, it seems to me that is not a jurisdictional argument."
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1772.332,1797.29,"We submit that the choice of the forum here for the purpose of escaping the statute of limitations in the 49 other states is indeed a jurisdictional matter, because it implicates the interests of the other 49 states, which is one of the very most fundamental concerns of the due process clause, and imposes burdens on the party and the judicial system that are unreasonable burdens, which is the other leg of the due process analysis."
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.29,1802.693,"Mr. Shapiro, this argument doesn't dispose of the case, because you still have got New Hampshire left."
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1802.693,1807.458,The suit in New Hampshire has been dismissed.
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.894,1819.561,"Well, I know, but your argument would say New Hampshire couldn't give a remedy for injuries that have already barred somewhere else, but how about the injury in New Hampshire?"
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1819.561,1820.686,"--Well, that--"
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.686,1822.387,You still have to make that argument.
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1822.387,1825.574,--We don't have to make that argument for this reason.
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.056,1841.053,"Well, it may be, but your argument would only say... would only refer to the injuries outside of New Hampshire, the argument that you have made so far."
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1841.053,1847.613,"If this case was filed in New Hampshire just for New Hampshire damages, it would present a very different issue--"
1983.82-485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1847.613,1852.861,How do we know that she will not be able to prove damages in New Hampshire?
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1855.875,1863.201,"--We take that as a finding of the district court, that she had no reputation of any sort in the jurisdiction."
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.275,1875.477,"That may be, but suppose there was proof of it."
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1879.975,1880.788,--Not necessarily.
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.629,1903.246,"I know, but the holding that you are seemingly defending is that the Constitution of the United States prevented the district court from entertaining this suit even if, as I understand it, there was damage in New Hampshire."
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1903.246,1908.104,"That's correct, because the purpose of this lawsuit is to recover damages in all 50 states."
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1908.104,1909.12,You haven't answered that one yet.
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1909.12,1915.601,"If the suit was focused solely on damages in the state of New Hampshire, we say it would be a different case, and it may be--"
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.601,1919.178,"Well, it may be different, but what would the result be jurisdictionally?"
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1919.178,1922.052,--I say that that is a fence sitter for this reason.
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.223,1925.348,"Well, which side are you going to fall off of?"
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1926.94,1941.389,"--I would submit in that case that there may well be jurisdiction over that particular limited cause of action, although it is not at all clear, because the lack of state interest and the inconvenience to the parties is present."
1983.82-485,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1941.389,1943.98,"Well, I know, but aren't there allegations here of injury in the state of New Hampshire?"
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1943.98,1950.01,There is nothing but a general allegation of $80 million in damages throughout the United States.
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.32,1955.367,"Well, I know, but he might prove it whenever he had a chance to prove it."
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1955.367,1959.849,"Well, there were affidavits submitted, Your Honor, in the district court."
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.849,1960.958,"I know, but there has been no ruling on it."
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1971.11,1985.401,"It is the plaintiff's burden to show that the state of New Hampshire had an interest in this cause of action that was filed in this jurisdiction, and there is another lack of evidence, affidavits, arguments in the briefs to that effect."
1983.82-485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1985.401,1998.989,"Well, maybe she can prove it if she has her day in court, and if that happens, the federal court might decide, agreeing with you, that the damages could be only the damages suffered in the state of New Hampshire."
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1998.989,2010.297,"I would submit to Your Honor that that would be inconsistent first with the single publication rule, which says that you have to subsume all of your damages in a single piece of litigation."
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2017.608,2031.742,"That may be, but the judgment you are defending, the judgment you are defending here is that there is no jurisdiction in the district court because of the federal Constitution to hear even a case about damages in New Hampshire."
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2031.742,2035.397,"We disagree, Your Honor, with that interpretation."
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2039.27,2039.973,"Well, what if we don't agree with you."
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2053.155,2057.309,"--I would suggest to you, Your Honor, that that is simply not the holding in this case."
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2064.933,2068.245,"Say it focused on both, clearly both."
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2071.587,2100.746,"--Well, in that situation, if the Court were disposed to look at the case as one seeking both 1 percent of the damages in New Hampshire and 90 percent of the damages in other jurisdictions, if the Court were to do that, the correct constitutional result would he that only that 1 percent of the damages in the local jurisdiction could be collected, because collection of the 99 percent from the rest of the jurisdictions would infringe the statute of limitations in those states."
1983.82-485,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.746,2102.684,But that is not a reason for dismissing the whole suit.
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2123.083,2144.854,"Well, I would submit that if the Court wore disposed to redraft the complaint in this manner to make it a New Hampshire damage proceeding, and to remand with the opinion stating that only damages in that jurisdiction are constitutionally collectible, that perhaps would be a constitutionally permissible result, but it would require a reformulation of the complaint, a reformulation of the--"
1983.82-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2144.854,2159.006,"It would also require reversing the district court's jurisdictional holding, and which I take it you would think we should do, if it were just strictly a New Hampshire suit."
1983.82-485,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2159.006,2163.066,--I said initially that I thought that that was a much closer case.
1983.82-485,2,37117,norman_roy_grutman,,3573.15,3574.445,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-485,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3797.919,3799.325,"Thank you, gentlemen."
