1965.8,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,48.211,"Number 8, United States, appellant, versus Huck Manufacturing Company et al."
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,52.553,62.363,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1965.8,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,193.63,199.704,I didn't quite hear Mr. Turner what you said about the -- what disagreement was about the exclusivity of Townsend's license?
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,199.704,210.24,"Well, the Government put an evidence Mr. Justice attending to show that there was a mutual agreement between the patentee on the one hand and the licensee on the other."
1965.8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,210.24,210.645,That there should be license with nobody else.
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,210.645,220.742,"Whereby that patentee would license no one else, so long as the licensee abided by the patentee's prices."
1965.8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,327.527,328.355,"Oh, yes."
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,328.355,357.47,"Now, before turning to a consideration of the issues -- these issues on the merits, I should like to discuss briefly and all the way, we'll have to come back to it again, a question raised by defendant and fairly read, namely whether in the circumstances of this case it is appropriate for the Court to consider the issue whether the General Electric decision should be overruled."
1965.8,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,447.643,452.577,Is that consistent -- is that consistent with your position here today?
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,452.577,464.502,"Mr. Chief Justice, we accept this finding of the District judge because on this record, we do not feel we can reasonably maintain that it is clearly erroneous."
1965.8,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,464.772,465.445,"Well, but I mean --"
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,465.445,465.551,Yes.
1965.8,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,465.551,479.174,I mean as your -- is your approach to this case for the purpose of overruling General Electric are they consistent with that representation that you made to the trial court?
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,479.174,479.605,"No, sir."
1965.8,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,480.859,497.68,"Well, why do -- why are we proposed to withhold with a situation where you say one thing to the trial court in order to get a judgment and come here and say the opposite?"
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,497.68,510.377,I like to set forth briefly Mr. Chief Justice the reason why we feel it is appropriate for the Court to consider this issue here.
1965.8,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,516.01,516.607,I beg pardon.
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,516.607,525.891,"We would, of course, not think of defending this as standard practice and we are not happy that it occurred."
1965.8,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,528.657,529.244,About what?
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,531.156,532.377,"Yes, I'm sorry."
1965.8,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,532.377,533.605,"Just speak up a little louder, please."
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,533.605,552.07,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice these appellees, I believe agreed in their motion to affirm what is involved here is a question not of jurisdictional part of the Courts considering the issue but whether in the circumstances it should."
1965.8,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,596.436,596.959,Yes.
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,597.989,598.813,Yes.
1965.8,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,598.813,609.819,And it isn't a question of failing to -- failing to present the matter before but you have just read us that portion of the order which says that --
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,609.819,610.72,That's right.
1965.8,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,610.72,621.645,-- the Government stated that it is not attempting to have the doctrine set in the General Electric case overruled and stated only the facts in this case do not fall within that doctrine.
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,634.525,635.273,That's right.
1965.8,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,635.273,637.201,-- misleading the Court.
1965.8,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,637.201,639.239,Was that in the -- in the criminal side of the sentence?
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,639.239,641.764,"No, this is on -- this is on the still sides, sir."
1965.8,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,646.565,649.351,But it took a same position in the criminal side too?
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,649.351,671.089,"Well, the Government as I say below when the defendants proposed that this particular language be inserted, proposed it very strongly on the ground that it did not reflect the position that the Government trial counsel had in fact taken in the pre-trial hearing."
1965.8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,713.386,717.514,"So, in other words we do have to proceed on the premise that that was -- what was represented to the (Inaudible)."
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,717.514,720.143,I think that is -- I think that is fair.
1965.8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,729.238,730.193,Right.
1965.8,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,730.193,734.702,(Inaudible)
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,734.702,735.747,Yes.
1965.8,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,744.117,745.484,But the --
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,745.484,788.748,"I might know that in some of the cases in the past, at least one, and I think a fair rating of the second case would lead to two that that substantially this has been done -- occurred before that is or that is in the Gipson case -- U.S. Gipson case and inline material, the Government in its -- before the court below and in its trial brief now urged conviction or judgment as a case may have been on the basis that the facts alleged went beyond the scope of General Electric."
1965.8,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,811.418,813.164,"No, they did not?"
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,813.164,835.544,"Well in both the cases, the Government argued before this Court that GE should be overrule and as you know, in the one case, the issue was not reached and inline material where as four judges concurred on the ground that should be overrule of the deciding vote by Justice Reed did not take that position beside decisive opinion on this question did not take that position."
1965.8,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,849.336,857.476,"They had three as I remember that it would adhere strictly to General Electric in my material witness, before the court?"
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,857.476,858.464,That's correct sir.
1965.8,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,858.989,860.286,And a report to senate --
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,860.286,877.623,The report incurred as I recall Justice Reed wrote the opinion for the Court with which four justices concurred but wrote a separating concurring opinion saying they would've held the way that the Court held on the basis of General Electric should be overruled.
1965.8,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,877.623,884.056,Then at the time that you try this case but two of your dissenters of the Court had passed on?
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,884.056,884.807,That's correct.
1965.8,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,884.807,887.882,There's only two left here.
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,891.487,899.258,I hope to have some replacement sir.
1965.8,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,899.258,900.457,Thank you.
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,900.457,908.413,"Let me say again, that I will eventually, and I have to deal fully with the question of waiver."
1965.8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1097.447,1105.319,"I suppose Mr. Turner, it's clear isn't it -- if the Court should agree with you today, the case would be remanded."
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,1105.319,1105.569,Of course.
1965.8,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1105.569,1107.126,For a profile on the factual issue --
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,1107.126,1107.187,Of course.
1965.8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1107.187,1108.644,"Mr. Turner, to word or not anything that there's such agreement?"
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,1108.644,1110.968,Of course.
1965.8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1115.68,1116.386,-- hypothesis?
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,1116.386,1135.745,"-- and of course, what we asked for even on the assumption that you would overrule General Electric is not a final judgment but simply a reversal on -- and a remand with directions to the Court to proceed in accordance with the ruling that the General Electric Rule is no longer a good law."
1965.8,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1135.745,1136.54,"Well, about that Mr. Turner --"
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,1136.54,1137.021,Yes?
1965.8,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1137.021,1139.082,-- how long this patent had to run?
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,1139.082,1142.585,It has sir about two years to run I believe.
1965.8,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1142.585,1145.718,It's been after a law suit (Inaudible) years.
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,1145.718,1147.655,I have no idea what will happen to the lawsuit.
1965.8,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1147.655,1150.736,I discover you didn't do anything?
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,1150.736,1159.561,The defendants at the least have the opportunity to put in the additional proof.
1965.8,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1161.54,1165.985,"Yeah, this case decided that we all will be moving?"
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,1165.985,1176.122,"What the eventual outcome of the case might be Mr. Justice Brennan, I don't think really has an important bearing on whether the Court --"
1965.8,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1176.122,1184.016,"Well, I have one case now I wonder if it has any bearing and whether we ought to reach the question in light of these strains of --"
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,1184.016,1185.673,I would say not sir.
1965.8,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1201.196,1211.146,We'll recess now.
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,1211.146,1216.643,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.8,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1991.106,1994.092,(Inaudible)
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,1994.092,1997.44,They did license during the war Mr. Justice.
1965.8,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2025.57,2026.393,After that?
1965.8,0,42329,turner,,2026.393,2027.48,That's right.
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3710.209,3713.916,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4149.984,4152.069,Is there anything on exclusive license?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4152.069,4152.322,Yes.
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4158.38,4159.255,What Section is that?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4159.255,4168.261,"That Section 12 (a), 12 (b) is the price restrictive -- 12 (a) is the exclusivity."
1965.8,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4501.795,4503.594,He did base it on --
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4503.594,4506.099,"Yes, he did."
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4605.283,4607.362,Mr. Looker didn't testify in this case?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4608.662,4609.635,All he had was the record.
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4633.363,4635.567,"You had no live witness in this case, did you?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4635.567,4637.836,There were no live witnesses in the civil case.
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4642.589,4646.318,"So, any findings of the facts were just based on the --"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4646.318,4647.39,On his analysis of the --
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4647.39,4647.844,Of the record?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4647.844,4652.56,-- of the record.
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4783.904,4789.837,This is an argument I don't understand because the case has been tried is it?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4798.596,4800.739,"Well, it depends what the issues are Your Honor."
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4815.063,4815.683,"Oh, yes."
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4815.913,4818.428,-- that would be out of the District Court's hands.
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4851.555,4868.074,"I don't see, and maybe that's not quite my point, excuse me, point of view but what kind of a -- I don't see the piece can be anything beyond the speculative assertions, in any event, what kind of a factual record could you have built?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4875.155,4876.733,Presumably that would've been factual.
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4897.066,4898.77,(Voice Overlap)
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4898.77,4898.934,-- with a --
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4898.934,4901.669,If you can have price fixing as a second source?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4901.669,4916.742,"It's -- as far as the patentee is concerned, I think, the ability to make sure that his second source, that his licensee does not compete price wise with him is a very important thing in his consideration as to whether it's not his second source."
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4916.742,4928.325,"It's not the type of thing that we usually do in the antitrust case -- you don't -- on the bank case, we don't ask for advice of people on how they think that should be?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4928.325,4935.665,"Well, I think in that situation you have a case where Congress pretty clearly established a judgment and --"
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4935.665,4939.88,On price fixing they don't ask the views on others good or bad.
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4939.88,4945.771,"Well, in the White Motor case, if Your Honor recalls, there was a summary judgment granted."
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4945.771,4947.566,That was more than price fixing though.
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4947.566,4954.953,"No, it was more than price fixing but it was an attempt to -- in effect to set up a new per se Rule."
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4954.953,4963.644,"But what I'm getting at is if we agreed with Government on the General Motors, it should be overruled -- everything would go back for a trial."
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4966.166,4968.617,Concerning things that go back for a trial Your Honor.
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4968.834,4969.385,Yeah.
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,4969.385,4987.059,"-- the basic factual questions as to whether there was after 1956, this sort of agreement would go back to the trial but the sort of proofs that the Court indicated that it wanted in the White Motor case that it was deprived of by the summary judgment procedure there."
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5002.448,5007.493,You mean that client instantly would agree with Government there should be a per se Rule of Conduct?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5007.493,5008.197,Right.
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5008.197,5009.32,But not other one?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5009.32,5022.291,"Well, there already is a Rule that restricts these agreements very narrowly and this agreement was very carefully scrutinized in the District Court before both district judges."
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5050.041,5067.566,"With all that if we didn't -- those parts per se, I thought Mr. Turner suggested there were alternatives, he recognized and he did not have to go as far the per se Rule necessarily existed, and if we didn't and we did not would all these become relevant (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5067.566,5068.067,"Well, he mention this --"
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5068.067,5068.847,-- case by case?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5068.847,5071.742,He mentioned the certain alternatives.
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5090.545,5094.737,Did I understand you to say that they are not presently fixing prices?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5094.737,5096.607,They are not presently fixing prices.
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5097.901,5101.682,You could present that evidence in order to avoid the injunction?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5101.682,5109.697,They could on the other hand that presents say question of fact Mr. Looker is testifying that they are presently fixing prices.
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5110.996,5115.459,If you get a trial although when you went back if Mr. Justice Douglas suggested.
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5115.459,5126.946,You would get a trial on that but you would have any -- never had any opportunity to present the economic questions as to whether there should be a per se Rule in this area or not.
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5134.119,5137.398,That would be within our competence to send it back to a trial to that?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5137.398,5139.055,It certainly would Your Honor.
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5140.983,5146.401,"I wonder if that kind of evidence was before the Court, and it decided the General Electric case?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5146.401,5152.039,I'm not familiar with the extent to which the Government proves in that case where or much better –-
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5152.039,5152.394,As I read --
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5152.394,5154.712,"-- than they were in this case, Your Honor."
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5154.712,5161.15,"As I read the record in that case, the Court merely took judicial notice or something?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5161.15,5167.95,I don't believe that at the time of the General Electric case there was a very full development of the economic issues.
1965.8,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5176.379,5178.097,In Line Material was it?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5178.097,5179.113,"Yes, there was Your Honor."
1965.8,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5198.279,5207.043,"But I think that this was where any economic facts as to what the effect of overruling General Electric would be in that case, was it?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5207.043,5211.375,I don't know if the parties put them in or I think the record might have been limited again in that.
1965.8,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5211.375,5214.952,"Well, that's all is just the irrelevant markets may?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5214.952,5215.157,"Well, the --"
1965.8,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5215.157,5216.811,Any of it recovered things like that --
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5216.811,5219.263,There's no showing in this case even of the irrelevant markets.
1965.8,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5237.3,5244.767,"Of course, since the case went off on General Electric, you could raise all that and then reach out."
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5244.767,5247.911,"Well, I don't think we could raise it if there is a per se Rule Your Honor."
1965.8,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5247.911,5251.355,"I don't understand that per se, what do you mean by that?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5251.355,5266.516,That the Rule that the patentee may under certain circumstances fix the prices that which his licensee will sell the patented item.
1965.8,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5273.859,5274.399,That's right.
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5286.662,5291.993,"Well, I think there would be a per se Rule as far as patent agreements between patentees and licensees."
1965.8,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5301.293,5306.471,"Because it's been -- I would say the exception to the Rule, hasn't it?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5306.471,5310.984,"Well, that of course comes together to the question which is first section of the Act."
1965.8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5379.993,5384.554,Excuse me just a minute.
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5397.714,5403.381,"Well this, I think goes to the whether you should believe the Government of its waiver or not."
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5403.381,5407.165,"Well, that's right, I mean,-- if it's waived then it's waived though it doesn't make any deference about the record."
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5430.14,5432.301,I assume that would be the result Your Honor.
1965.8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5432.301,5434.026,Is that what you're urging here or not?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5434.026,5434.373,No.
1965.8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5448.145,5450.039,What if it was waived for another case?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5450.039,5457.7,"Waive for another case, if this problem is such a serious problem, presumably, they'll be one along pretty soon."
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5613.518,5618.91,That would not be -- you're not stuck with that choice in the event that we accept the Government's position of this case.
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5625.719,5628.309,I would hope it would as to the factual matters.
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5651.205,5652.826,I understand that will not solve here --
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5652.826,5669.847,And doesn't solve the problem as to whether -- whether this is the sort of record on which the Court should make an important announcement in the anti trust field and in fact in which the Court should overrule 63 years of several precedents.
1965.8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5669.847,5681.953,"What if the Government had them in the District Court, Mr, Lyons, and if that you said the -- what we urge that the General Electric is no longer good law and what the District Court supposedly have done --"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5681.953,5682.377,I think at that point the --
1965.8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5682.377,5685.631,"-- probably they say that we would take at the Supreme Court with me, is that it?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5685.631,5685.948,No.
1965.8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5710.559,5723.154,"But I'm just wondering about that Mr. Lyons, that that's a lengthy business, the district judge after all, in citing the cases, no matter what the arithmetic maybe, the authority is still outstanding."
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5732.667,5742.141,"I would think then -- if he had done that -- the appropriate thing, once the Government had indicated its desire to get into this question."
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5760.452,5761.733,If that what is done here?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5766.312,5767.887,If that is correct Your Honor.
1965.8,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5776.924,5780.214,"Which should not be any short proceeding, I gather?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5780.214,5787.854,I would think that even then the proceeding with respect to the ascertainment of Looker's credibility.
1965.8,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5864.838,5867.197,That you say the Simpson don't you agree?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5867.197,5868.088,"Yes, we agree Your Honor."
1965.8,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5868.088,5875.2,How do you construe that like the Justice Stewart or how do you construe the reference to General Electric?
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5875.2,5889.121,"Well, I construe the reference to General Electric there as saying that the Court had no reason to reexamine one of the two holdings of the General Electric case and that is the holding on the price restrictive license."
1965.8,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5917.34,5934.944,"Not unless you are risk taking, there, I thought that the Court held that where you had consignment coupled with, of course, tactics, that it might be a violation of the statute."
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5934.944,5935.437,The Court did not --
1965.8,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5935.437,5939.917,"Well, they didn't say that the license itself was made?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5939.917,5940.719,No.
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5960.466,5963.558,"The Union Oil case didn't have anything to do with the issue in this case, did it?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5963.558,5965.436,"I don't think it does, Your Honor."
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5965.436,5970.592,"Alright, go ahead."
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,5970.592,5984.002,"Because of the fact that there is just a short time left to run on these patents, this Court in effect is being asked to do a great series of things here."
1965.8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6076.448,6087.63,"Mr. Lyons, if there -- was there are good deal of -- United States in the record on the GE case?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6087.63,6090.476,"I don't believe the economic proofs were extensive there, Your Honor."
1965.8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6091.458,6094.224,"Well, there any?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6094.224,6105.341,I think because of the fact that there are number of issues involved and because of the fact that the Government there was attacking the practice.
1965.8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6200.732,6207.599,"Well, do you suggest that General Electric is more of the decision that it is no better than the economic evidence record that it supports them with?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6207.599,6210.809,I think these days Your Honor.
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6318.474,6324.306,"I am still little puzzled, more than a little puzzled as to what the nature of that evidence would be?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6324.306,6338.533,"I think there would be evidence as to what their usual requirements of buy-in corporations are in the present day economy, the extent to which they demand second sources."
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6373.846,6386.301,"And then, I suppose would have to be coupled with testimony either from Mr. Huck or somebody else that the only -- that there wouldn't have been a license without price fixing, that I would have to follow."
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6391.259,6394.536,"Well, you have to look into the reality (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6394.536,6399.137,Price fixing is a very good thing and I'm sure you get that to a lot businessman and lot of cases.
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6399.137,6409.952,"But you don't get -- you probably would in a number of cases but the fact of the matter remains here that this businessman had the right to keep a second source from going into business, whereas --"
1965.8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6409.952,6412.022,Yes.
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6412.683,6424.809,-- whether if this kind of business it is not (Voice Overlap) and of course the -- that evidence is not -- the evidence of the business when it is not conclusive without this other means of contradicting this.
1965.8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6470.321,6488.486,"Mr. Lyons, do you think it would make any difference in your argument if the origin of the price fix was the demand of the licensee, the patentee was not interested at all in the price fix, except it just couldn't get a licensee without a price fix, would that make any difference in your argument?"
1965.8,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6488.486,6491.277,"Well, I think that might in a particular case."
1965.8,2,43210,thomas_w_pomeroy_jr,,6626.64,6644.109,"Should there be a remand on that because I suppose it might be argued that independently, the General Electric case, the price fixing here was a result of this alleged agreement which had no relation of the fixing of a condition, the condition of the patent?"
1965.8,3,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6644.109,6653.912,"Mr. Pomeroy, will get into this a little further but fact of the matter is that the oral agreement was before -- the alleged oral agreement was before the written agreement."
1965.8,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6724.224,6726.077,Mr. Pomeroy.
1965.8,4,43210,thomas_w_pomeroy_jr,,6726.077,6730.38,Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.
1965.8,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6901.208,6903.067,Including the exclusivity with the real time?
1965.8,4,43210,thomas_w_pomeroy_jr,,6903.067,6905.02,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1965.8,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6905.359,6906.392,Both aspects.
1965.8,4,43210,thomas_w_pomeroy_jr,,6906.392,6907.375,-- perfectly aspect of the market.
1965.8,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6907.375,6909.244,More extended for the life of the patent?
1965.8,4,43210,thomas_w_pomeroy_jr,,6909.244,6910.009,That is correct.
1965.8,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6910.009,6912.703,And the Court found as to be the fact?
1965.8,4,43210,thomas_w_pomeroy_jr,,6912.703,6922.749,"No, the Court did not -- except Mr. Looker really -- he said this Mr. Looker testified that he did not find --"
1965.8,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6922.749,6922.944,That was true?
1965.8,4,43210,thomas_w_pomeroy_jr,,6922.944,6932.673,-- that what Looker testified too was a fact because there were so much obvious inconsistency in the Looker testimony.
1965.8,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6983.015,6984.638,I don't want to waste your time and I'm asking you the information.
1965.8,4,43210,thomas_w_pomeroy_jr,,6984.638,6984.943,You're correct.
1965.8,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6984.943,6999.476,"-- information, the way the case was tried below, of course, as I understand was the Government's theory that this agreement not to license anybody else went beyond General Electric and for that reason is not covered by any other."
1965.8,4,43210,thomas_w_pomeroy_jr,,7014.815,7018.074,I think it was B Your Honor.
