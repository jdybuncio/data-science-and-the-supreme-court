1975.74-5968,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,35.25,"We will hear arguments next in Geders against the United States, 5968."
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,37.089,39.543,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-5968,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,234.952,237.449,"I thin at this point, let is follow through on that."
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,240.867,246.644,"A noon recess, well, Your Honor --Mr. Justice this was a situation where he was denied 16 hours with his counsel."
1975.74-5968,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,246.644,251.448,"I know I am talking about the noon recess of one hour, would your answer be the same?"
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,251.448,253.052,"Yes, it would be Your Honor by reason that --"
1975.74-5968,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,253.052,263.332,"Suppose it were rest and relaxation period to allow the jury to go to bathroom five minutes, same answer?"
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,263.332,269.163,It would be essentially the same answer Your Honor because it would be a violation of a basic constitutional safeguard.
1975.74-5968,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,269.163,272.122,In logic you have to give that answer (Inaudible)?
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,272.122,275.425,"In logic, and in practice, and in defense of the constitution, as I see it Your Honor, yes."
1975.74-5968,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,275.425,287.558,"And suppose that the judge here had said, we will finish with this witness tonight, declared no recess, would you be here?"
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,287.558,295.53,"If he declared no recess and cross examination was continued immediately subsequent to direct examination, no, not at all Your Honor, I would not be here."
1975.74-5968,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,295.53,300.992,Even though it continued well past your closing time in the middle district division?
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,300.992,313.786,That is correct and I would not object to the fact that counsel for the defense would have not the opportunity to discuss anything with his client during the process of cross examination which I will understand Mr. Justice.
1975.74-5968,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,313.786,319.886,So that your right to discuss is not absolutely depends on the accident of the recess?
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,319.886,322.377,No not completely Your Honor.
1975.74-5968,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,345.437,350.173,You have the right to insist on a recess between direct and cross examination at all times?
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,350.173,351.058,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-5968,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,376.09,380.946,Would it make a difference if you had requested the recess?
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,380.946,383.121,"No, it would not Your Honor, I submit."
1975.74-5968,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,395.897,401.41,"(Inaudible) Making the annotation, granted, provided?"
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,401.41,403.857,Defense is making the application Mr. Justice Brennan?
1975.74-5968,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,403.857,409.75,"And the judge said granted, provided that you do not talk to your client during the recess?"
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,409.75,411.487,I would be here for that Your Honor.
1975.74-5968,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,411.487,412.192,You would?
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,412.192,414.48,"Yes, yes, Your Honor, I would be."
1975.74-5968,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,414.48,425.148,You are saying that the trial judge has no discretion or whatever to limit the conversations of the witness?
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,425.148,426.638,Defense Witness Mr. Justice --Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.74-5968,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,426.638,429.499,Who is under cross examination?
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,429.499,430.335,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-5968,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,430.335,432.444,Defense witness or defendant?
1975.74-5968,0,41491,seymour_l_honig,,432.444,433.753,This is defendant Your Honor.
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2149.689,2153.33,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-5968,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2275.402,2286.921,"(Inaudible) Court judge was really gone ahead without the recess, so the question about the judge's time is being too -- that was what he was getting ready to do, was he not?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2286.921,2288.257,Judge was getting ready to do what?
1975.74-5968,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2288.257,2289.8,"Continue with the cross examination, not to recess?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2289.8,2293.618,"Well, the judge originally said on --"
1975.74-5968,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2293.618,2295.566,On top of page 17?
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2295.566,2303.883,"Right, on the bottom page 16, however, Your Honor, the judge says, does the Government wish to proceed with his cross examination now."
1975.74-5968,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2335.865,2340.553,"Now we come back to this, by record?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2357.948,2358.416,Yes.
1975.74-5968,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2358.416,2359.252,Could they not?
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2359.252,2360.933,"Oh, it could have been solved that way, right (Voice Overlap)."
1975.74-5968,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2360.933,2367.599,Right so the judge chose to go the other way and get the whole long?
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2367.599,2376.317,"Yeah, well, let me -- let me just put this case in little, add some extra facts to put this in perspective, this whole incident."
1975.74-5968,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2683.767,2695.134,"What is the Government’s position Mr. Glazer, if the client -- if the lawyer had said, I do want the recess to talk to my client about his testimony?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2695.134,2703.288,"Well, it is our position if he had asked, if he had said that, we would take the position he should have the right to talk to the client about his testimony."
1975.74-5968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2805.04,2824.17,"What about witnesses being crossed examined as is not unusual for 3, 4, 5, 6 days, you think the Court could say that during the time of the cross examination is continuing, you may not consult?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2824.17,2828.705,"Oh! Yes, we think -- we think that is a reasonable restriction."
1975.74-5968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.005,2887.751,"Do you think -- the judge did not agree with that position herein, did he?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2887.751,2889.055,"No, well -- well --"
1975.74-5968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2889.055,2891.28,So you are not really defending the --
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2891.28,2892.165,"Well, I am defending the judge --"
1975.74-5968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.165,2894.129,The district judge’s decision?
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2894.129,2897.049,"No, I am defending the judge’s decision in this sense."
1975.74-5968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2897.049,2898.339,"Well, not the way he put it to you?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2898.339,2899.815,"Well, well."
1975.74-5968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2902.748,2906.009,"Well yes, can you answer yes, or no, or not?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2906.009,2910.219,"Well, in the circumstances of this case, I am defending the judge’s decision."
1975.74-5968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.219,2913.235,"So you are not defending the decision he made, what he said?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2913.235,2916.043,I am -- I am not defending the practice.
1975.74-5968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.814,2931.515,"You are not defending -- you are not defending the District judge if he said, well you can confer, but you cannot confer about cross examination?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2931.515,2933.286,"I am if, and if the defense not --"
1975.74-5968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.286,2935.362,You have just said that you are not defending that?
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2935.362,2944.884,"If the defense counsel said I -- I -- if the defense counsel said, I want to talk to him about cross examination, I would concede that the defense counsel has the right to talk to him about cross examination."
1975.74-5968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.884,2948.287,"Well, the district judge had a wholly different view in this case?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2948.287,2949.827,Yes.
1975.74-5968,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2954.728,2955.611,I am not saying what --
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2955.611,2956.738,Alright.
1975.74-5968,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2956.738,2959.289,"I do not read judge’s, and Court’s opinions."
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2979.749,2982.754,"Well the denial, let me -- may be, I should back it."
1975.74-5968,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2982.754,2984.737,"No, but how about the Court of Appeals’ opinion?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2984.737,2993.909,"The Court of Appeals -- the Court of Appeals concluded that in the circumstances of this case, there was no prejudice, that is the Court of Appeals’ opinion --"
1975.74-5968,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2993.909,3008.258,"And you do not think, it can be read as, as saying you are entitled -- that the order, if it had gone so far as to forbid you to talk with your client about his cross examination, as saying if that would be alright?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3008.258,3013.634,"Well, the order maybe constitutionally alright."
1975.74-5968,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3079.681,3083.624,"(Inaudible) not raise that kind of a claim, where you could show a constitutional violation, I would think?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3083.624,3086.896,"Well, you could show, if you -- well maybe it could come up with something."
1975.74-5968,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3088.423,3093.081,"But if you could come up something on a habeas, you could not come up with something on the direct, I would think?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3093.081,3103.948,"Oh! Yes you could not, but usually -- usually, if he came up with something during the course of the trial, the chances are, the trial court will try to ride it at that particular point."
1975.74-5968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3117.305,3143.411,"And this is not common, the judge -- trial judge has or he thinks he has reason to doubt whether a witness is going to be improperly coached that he will say we will not begin the direct examination until the beginning of the court session, in someway that he can plan it out, is that not a common thing for judges to do?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3143.411,3145.219,"I am sure, I am sure that occurs Your Honor."
1975.74-5968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3146.905,3158.036,"Just as it is probably quite common for defense counsel putting a witness on the stand to try to have it fall, so that you will have a recess to talk to the client?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3158.036,3160.994,"Oh! I am sure, Your Honor, there is no question about the latter of state."
1975.74-5968,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3173.219,3178.503,"If he is suspicious, you will not get recess, he will let you go through to 9 and 10 o’clock at night?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3178.503,3183.014,"Well, the only trouble with that is the country judges do it, but the city judges do not."
1975.74-5968,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3184.128,3185.923,"Well, this judge was getting ready to go?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3185.923,3187.346,"Alright , alright, alright."
1975.74-5968,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3187.346,3189.09,"He was a city judge, was he not?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3189.09,3189.544,Right.
1975.74-5968,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3201.903,3203.687,(Inaudible) protest about the times of it?
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3203.687,3215.909,"He protested about the times of the recess, but he did not say to judge, look this is going to let the Government think about cross examination overnight and we are not going to able to think about it."
1975.74-5968,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3362.356,3378.643,"Mr. Glazer, actually, on page 18 of the appendix, as I read what counsel said, the bottom of page 18, I feel I do not -- I feel I do have the right to confer with him, but not coach him as to what he may say on a cross examination on how to answer questions?"
1975.74-5968,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3386.243,3410.975,"Yes, but I thought the import of the remark was, but then when we -- but then another reason we took this, we interpreted slightly different is -- is when the counsel says to the court, he has some questions about trials, he has some matters of trial strategy, he only -- so the court says to counsel, what matters are those?"
1975.74-5968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3536.406,3537.144,"Thank you, gentleman."
