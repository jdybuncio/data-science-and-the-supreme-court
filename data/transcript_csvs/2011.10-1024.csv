2011.10-1024,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.979,"We will hear argument next in Case 10-1024, Federal Aviation Administration v. Cooper."
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,8.759,11.415,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,86.054,88.258,Then maybe Congress shouldn't have passed this statute.
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,150.872,161.132,"Well, first of all, Justice Ginsburg, I would like to respectfully disagree with the premise of the question that the Privacy Act is comparable to common law invasion of privacy."
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.03,191.961,"Even if it is -- even if it is, the damages are -- the damages are not of a pecuniary kind."
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,234.118,248.426,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, there sometimes are, as there were at common law, pecuniary damages resulting from either violation of the Privacy Act or invasions of privacy; and the government sometimes pays out very large pecuniary judgments."
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,300.872,311.571,"But that's the -- why -- is it -- is a harm to a dignitary interest, is that an actual injury?"
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,311.571,313.93,"Well, Your Honor--"
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.93,316.083,You describe that injury.
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,324.518,329.217,"--Your Honor, the term ""actual injury"" and the term ""actual damages"", those are ambiguous terms."
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,333.795,336.966,"Well, let's take this case."
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,339.278,342.355,He did not--
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,342.355,345.397,"St least, did he allege that he had suffered an actual injury?"
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,345.397,349.348,--He did not suffer actual damages within the meaning of the Privacy Act.
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.348,350.533,I didn't -- I didn't ask you that.
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,366.247,371.964,"Well, Your Honor, I think my difficulty with the question is that I don't think the term ""actual injury"" has some plain meaning out of context."
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,380.914,386.205,"You have to have an injury first before you can get damages, so my question is was there an injury."
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,386.205,393.407,"--Well, if Your Honor's question is whether he suffered an adverse effect within the meaning of section (g)(1)(B) of the act--"
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,393.407,393.766,Yes.
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,393.766,395.828,"--yes, we believe he did suffer an adverse effect sufficient to confer standing."
2011.10-1024,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,413.291,427.314,"I'm a little bit confused by that, because in your brief, the Solicitor General's brief in Doe, it described the earlier version of general damages in the following way -- and I'm quoting from your brief there:"
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,470.564,473.047,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2011.10-1024,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,473.047,478.136,There is a big difference between presumed damages and proven injury.
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,506.717,507.388,"--I hope not, Your Honor."
2011.10-1024,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,569.705,572.563,So why is that different from actual injury?
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,589.479,595.992,"--Well, Your Honor, the award that person would receive for the additional proof of emotional distress would be classified as general damages."
2011.10-1024,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,617.844,639.6,"I have looked at those cases and in all of them except for two, where the reference wasn't really precise, it was because the use of ""actual damages"" in the particular statute were limited to pecuniary harms or the nature of the harms at issue were pecuniary by nature."
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,639.6,650.425,"Well, most of those cases are cases out of the common law and sometimes they used ""actual damages"" in the same sentence with a reference to emotional harm, making clear that they think that the two types of harms are separate."
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,714.942,721.064,"What does ""actual damages"" mean under the Fair Credit Reporting Act?"
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,721.064,725.436,"Your Honor, we don't have a position on that at this point."
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,759.373,770.605,"But it can mean, and I think it has been held to mean, damages to a dignitary interest."
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,779.367,780.194,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1024,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,831.358,832.126,I--
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,832.126,836.092,"We're discussing what the term means, what the term ""actual damages"" means."
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,836.092,847.678,"Well, Your Honor, again, as we have demonstrated in our brief -- I think again, I'd refer the Court to footnotes 1 and 2 for how this term was used in the common law -- the term ""actual damages"" can mean both things."
2011.10-1024,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,869.187,883.822,"--Are there instances where, if there is an invasion of privacy and there is a documented trauma from psychosomatic illness with medical expenses and lost wages, is that special?"
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,885.07,886.193,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1024,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,895.334,896.8,I'm sorry.
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,901.689,908.685,"The emotional distress component itself cannot be, but medical expenses to treat symptoms of emotional distress--"
2011.10-1024,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,908.685,923.102,"So you're -- as I understand the definition of ""special damages"" in common law, if you proved any pecuniary harm you were also entitled to the mental distress damages as well."
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,929.552,932.535,"--I don't think that's quite correct about the definition of ""special damages"", Your Honor."
2011.10-1024,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,939.625,942.53,We may have a difference of history there.
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,954.072,957.352,"Well, Your Honor, in a common law suit for defamation for--"
2011.10-1024,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,957.352,959.164,"I thought that's what your brief said, actually."
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,959.164,960.163,"--Well, no, Your Honor."
2011.10-1024,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,990.992,992.225,But we're not talking any differently.
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,993.242,994.007,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1024,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1007.706,1022.201,"--Sort of odd for Congress to borrow from the defamation context and with a defined term of art, ""special damages"", and not use it in the Privacy Act if that's what it intended."
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1022.201,1024.276,"Well, Your Honor--"
2011.10-1024,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1024.276,1031.321,"And to use a term ""actual damages"", which has a much broader meaning than ""special damages""."
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1031.321,1042.864,"--Well, Your Honor, as the Court recognized in Doe, there is a structural similarity between the civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act and the remedial scheme for defamation per quod at common law."
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1119.798,1129.499,"Well, the -- the Privacy Study Commission coming after can't say what the statute means."
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1149.816,1151.629,"--Well, two points on that, Your Honor."
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1283.28,1286.871,But that's just saying that he didn't have a good claim for relief.
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1309.064,1320.7,"Well, in that case, Your Honor, the plaintiff might have a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act based on a violation of some State law statutory or common law privacy protection."
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1330.433,1336.821,But wasn't that the very thing that Congress -- why did they pass this in the first place?
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1343.036,1354.158,"Well, they passed it, Your Honor, because they wanted, in the wake of Watergate, to impose a set of detailed substantive requirements about Federal recordkeeping."
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1367.26,1367.806,But does--
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1367.806,1374.509,"Your Honor, even if we look just at the disclosure-related provision, it's broader than common law invasion of privacy in two very important ways."
2011.10-1024,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1436.231,1450.445,"--It did set a pretty high bar for the plaintiff to meet, because the plaintiff would have to prove intentional or willful conduct, not negligence, but--"
2011.10-1024,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1450.445,1451.29,"Well, three points on that, Your Honor."
2011.10-1024,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1525.07,1526.056,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1531.102,1534.178,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1576.22,1608.064,"Could I ask you this question about the damages that your client is seeking in this case: if -- if we affirm the Ninth Circuit, would -- are you claiming all of the damages that -- all of the emotional damages that resulted from his criminal conviction, or are you claiming only the emotional damages that would have been suffered by anybody else whose records were turned over to the FAA under the Operation Safe Pilot program?"
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1608.064,1612.565,"If you affirm, there will be a proximate causation question that arises on remand."
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1640.519,1648.081,But you allege that -- that Mr. Cooper suffered a severe emotional distress when he was confronted with the fact that his records had been turned over.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1674.554,1675.396,--Yes.
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1756.924,1764.232,But you agree that the act does not allow recovery for what would have been regarded at common law as general damages?
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1764.232,1770.682,"What would have been regarded at common law as presumed -- the presumed damages, this act doesn't allow."
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1772.897,1775.818,"""General damages"", that's the term that they peeled off, right?"
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1775.818,1776.383,Right.
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1781.41,1786.83,"But general damages is a term from -- from the remedies in defamation cases, right?"
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1786.83,1788.503,--Yes.
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1788.503,1797.062,"And there are two types of damages in defamation cases, special damages and general damages and if you -- is that correct?"
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1797.062,1797.592,Correct.
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1797.592,1799.823,And you subtract general damages and what do you have left?
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1799.823,1815.366,"But the interesting thing in this case is they didn't take what you have left, special damages, and they used a different term, Congress did, ""actual"", a term that suggests we are going to require proof of the damages."
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1820.081,1832.372,But the problem is that -- that your definition of actual damages and the general definition of actual damages includes some things that fell within the rubric of general damages.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1832.372,1834.712,That's true.
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1865.249,1866.622,Let me just try this one more time.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1877.042,1877.884,No.
2011.10-1024,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1890.893,1891.801,But -- but we--
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1891.801,1892.534,--but you can't presume--
2011.10-1024,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1892.534,1896.878,--Courts don't -- courts allow recovery for conjectural or speculative damages.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1900.812,1901.483,"--No, but this--"
2011.10-1024,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1901.483,1905.687,"--routinely tell juries, now you can come in with conjectural or speculative damages."
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1907.45,1914.59,--But you can in this arena at common law presume damages from the nature of the violation.
2011.10-1024,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1921.804,1933.143,"Can you tell me what your response is to the government's argument that the Privacy Commission which was set up understood the word ""actual damages"" at the time the way they understand it?"
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1939.281,1942.888,Apart from the obvious that the post enactment report was--
2011.10-1024,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1942.888,1943.808,"No, I'm asking you--"
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1943.808,1945.621,--But -- but -- on the underlying point--
2011.10-1024,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1945.621,1946.167,--Thank you.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1946.167,1948.012,--several things.
2011.10-1024,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1964.238,1965.333,Okay.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,1974.033,1978.373,"--Yes, with one other -- with one other proviso I would add."
2011.10-1024,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2014.077,2017.357,And by pain and suffering they mean mental pain and suffering?
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2017.357,2017.903,Right.
2011.10-1024,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2027.449,2029.087,Thank you.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2029.087,2029.633,Another--
2011.10-1024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.633,2046.564,"What -- what the government would say is -- is that -- and they have their own dictionary definitions, I don't -- I don't think it's accurate to say that Black's Law Dictionary defines actual damages the way you would have it defined."
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2086.764,2095.916,"--Well, that's why it's critical to understand the analysis, because you can't say there is a genuine ambiguity unless you understand how they arrived at that conclusion."
2011.10-1024,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2158.73,2173.068,"This would save you some time, possibly, but my guess is you may know that every State or many States have statutes or tort laws or something against invasion of privacy."
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2194.933,2206.067,"Justice Breyer, you have given me a little bit too much credit, I can't give you a number of States, but I can tell you that I am not aware of any State that disallows."
2011.10-1024,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2212.644,2226.636,"Do you know enough to know if they have done so through the use of a term like ""actual damages"" that run analogous thereto, or whether they had to have some special form of words?"
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2226.636,2228.776,I don't know that.
2011.10-1024,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.198,2230.933,Okay.
2011.10-1024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2230.933,2251.059,"Of course you are talking about statutes that require that the material have been made public, not that say establish a violation if one agency provides the information to another agency?"
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2279.345,2286.765,"--Yes, but we are here today only talking about the narrow category of cases in which there is an intentional and willful violation."
2011.10-1024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2293.309,2293.949,"Well, that's right."
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2326.498,2333.014,But -- but this provision is covering the range of intentional and willful violations covered in the act.
2011.10-1024,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2388.442,2396.315,Do you have any statistics on the percentage of actions brought under the Privacy Act in which the plaintiff was able to establish pecuniary harm?
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2396.315,2398.674,I don't have any statistics on that.
2011.10-1024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2427.067,2430.175,You say in the Fifth Circuit or the Ninth Circuit for -- for many years?
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2430.175,2433.38,"--This case is -- in -- coming out of the Ninth Circuit, but the Fifth Circuit passed the rule."
2011.10-1024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2433.38,2433.395,"--for a long time, yes."
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2433.395,2438.532,In the early '80s it first recognized emotional distress.
2011.10-1024,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2438.532,2444.435,Are you aware of any runaway verdicts based on awards of mental damage proof?
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2444.435,2444.841,The only case that I'm aware of--
2011.10-1024,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2444.841,2454.086,I define runaway awards as those in -- in six figures or above.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2454.086,2455.35,--No.
2011.10-1024,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2455.35,2457.616,Or even high five figures.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2457.616,2475.39,The highest I can think of in the moment was a case out of the Fifth Circuit called Jacobs in which a Federal agency revealed -- leaked to the press information falsely suggesting a bank president was a money launderer.
2011.10-1024,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2596.217,2601.278,In -- in your argument do you have to avoid the concession that the term might be ambiguous?
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2626.827,2629.186,I would modify it slightly.
2011.10-1024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2651.788,2653.394,That -- that's a different point.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2690.958,2691.769,"--Actually we don't, Your Honor."
2011.10-1024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2691.769,2692.3,--You don't?
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2692.3,2694.051,And this is how I would clarify it.
2011.10-1024,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2819.33,2829.106,"The argument you have made, and I certainly understand it, that this is the Privacy Act, and so it's precisely these types of damages that you would be concerned about, really cuts both ways."
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,2845.898,2856.952,"--Absolutely, but -- but that circles back to my point that if you're going to -- if your intent is to say presumed, not proven, actual fits exactly."
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3009.42,3025.54,"Well, suppose this were a common lawsuit for slander per quod, and what was said was that Mr. Cooper received Social Security disability benefits."
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,3059.463,3066.867,His -- his economic loss would be special damages.
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3066.867,3068.131,Then let's--
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,3068.131,3070.849,The damages he could prove--
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3070.849,3072.346,--You don't claim any economic loss there.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,3072.346,3072.834,--Right.
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3076.425,3076.94,No.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,3091.949,3096.574,"Well, they could also use actual damages, because of course, in the Gertz case, the Court--"
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3096.574,3097.245,No.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,3102.338,3105.383,"--At -- at common law, it would be general damages, but--"
2011.10-1024,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3105.383,3107.989,"General damages here are excluded by Congress, right?"
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,3107.989,3120.049,"--They were referred for further study, but what was authorized in the text, the substantive provision, is actual damages, not special damages."
2011.10-1024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3135.651,3143.679,"But -- but -- but elsewhere in the statute, it's made very clear that Congress did not think it was authorizing general damages, right?"
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,3159.657,3161.454,--It doesn't include general damages.
2011.10-1024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3188.957,3193.297,You -- you would say that actual emotional damages are not -- are not general damages?
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,3193.297,3197.45,--I wouldn't say -- I would say you could call them general damages.
2011.10-1024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3206.7,3214.398,"No, but it -- it does use the term ""general damages"", and makes very clear that it doesn't think this statute covers general damages."
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,3226.97,3227.332,That -- that is exactly our position.
2011.10-1024,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3227.332,3227.597,Okay.
2011.10-1024,1,38913,raymond_cardozo,,3227.597,3237.842,And the thing I would add to that is general damages -- actual damages was in the statute long before general damages surfaced.
2011.10-1024,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3338.752,3339.423,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1024,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3341.189,3347.186,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-1024,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3376.628,3388.997,"Counsel, you seem to be arguing throughout that general damages meant actual damages, when general damages, in my understanding, meant two things: presumed and actual."
2011.10-1024,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3402.895,3421.874,"--Well, Your Honor, I think if you look at the sources cited in our brief, as well as the sources cited in his brief -- in particular, I'd refer you to the block quote on page 22, ""general damages"", that term, most typically refers to a class or a type of damages that could be presumed but could also be proven."
2011.10-1024,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3441.976,3443.692,I'm still confused.
2011.10-1024,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3470.072,3472.805,"--Your Honor, I think that's essentially Respondent's argument."
2011.10-1024,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3548.96,3551.413,"At common law, if you have a minute."
2011.10-1024,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3578.732,3585.026,"Emotional distress, even physical symptoms of emotional distress, are general damages."
2011.10-1024,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3585.026,3586.024,No matter how well proved.
2011.10-1024,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3588.056,3590.084,"No matter how they're proved, did you say?"
2011.10-1024,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3590.084,3591.851,No matter how clearly they are proved.
2011.10-1024,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3591.851,3592.74,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-1024,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3594.069,3596.444,"And -- and to verify that, I look at what definition where?"
2011.10-1024,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3596.444,3605.408,"First of all, Your Honor, you can look at page 139 of the Dobbs treatise, which is cited in our brief, which very clearly defines general damages in that fashion."
2011.10-1024,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3617.95,3619.213,"Thank you, counsel."
