1977.76-1476,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.736,We will hear arguments next in 1476 Bateson against United States.
1977.76-1476,0,32688,jack_rephan,,49.51,54.522,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1476,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,138.647,139.029,Yes.
1977.76-1476,0,32688,jack_rephan,,139.029,151.449,"The General Service Administration awarded a contract to Bateson to bill in addition to the Howard University Hospital in Washington D.C., a contract of some $39 million."
1977.76-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.247,231.325,Do you question that they have the same standings as with the laborers for?
1977.76-1476,0,32688,jack_rephan,,231.325,244.799,"Yes, Your Honor, we will concede that issue and I think it was resolved in another case by this Court; however, we do maintain they are one tier down and they are at a little bit different position in the one case we referred to."
1977.76-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,244.799,248.965,How Colquitt did do installation work on the job?
1977.76-1476,0,32688,jack_rephan,,250.859,252.374,That is true Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1977.76-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,402.224,407.57,Does that really make sense to you or do you support it?
1977.76-1476,0,32688,jack_rephan,,407.57,421.661,"Your Honor, if you go back to the purpose of the Miller Act, it may make some sense because historically, and even the District of Columbia Mechanic's Lien Law, for example limits, the coverage to a subcontractor not beyond."
1977.76-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,421.661,448.798,"But does it not make then, a lot more sense, as they are talking about the substantiality of the relationship to draw the line between the traditional material man who simply furnishes goods to the job site which are installed by another entity and a subcontractor who installs the stuff, actually puts the stuff into the ground that he can no longer lien for because it is public ground?"
1977.76-1476,0,32688,jack_rephan,,448.798,458.938,"Yes, Your Honor, I would agree that, that probably makes more sense than to apply this test in a vacuum and I think that is what the Court of Appeals did."
1977.76-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,557.047,562.121,"You say Congress said a sub-subcontractor is covered by the Act, but that is as far it goes?"
1977.76-1476,0,32688,jack_rephan,,562.121,566.299,"Yes, Your Honor I think that was even referred to by this Court in the MacEvoy opinion to the --"
1977.76-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,566.299,569.865,But would not that cut against your argument here?
1977.76-1476,0,32688,jack_rephan,,569.865,572.66,The sub-subcontractor?
1977.76-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,572.66,577.062,You do not concede then that Colquitt was a sub-subcontract?
1977.76-1476,0,32688,jack_rephan,,577.062,603.796,"Colquitt was a sub-subcontractor Your Honor, and Colquitt would have been covered by the Act, we are talking about the employees of Colquitt one step removed, now Colquitt, had Pierce not paid Colquitt, certainly, Colquitt could have given notice to Bateson and come and made a claim of the Act, but we are talking about their employees, which is one step removed when Colquitt as a sub-subcontractor."
1977.76-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,603.796,611.335,The employees then are in your view a step removed in the subcontractor material men?
1977.76-1476,0,32688,jack_rephan,,611.335,611.978,That is correct Your Honor.
1977.76-1476,1,20675,donald_j_capuano,,1580.19,1584.397,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1476,2,32688,jack_rephan,,3131.23,3132.124,May it please the Court.
