1993.92-7549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.807,"We'll hear argument now in No. 92-7549, Thomas Schiro v. Robert Farley."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,13.902,14.332,Thank you.
1993.92-7549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,29.823,33.526,You refer to it as the guilt trial and the penalty.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,43.703,46.104,"No, Your Honor, I don't think it makes any difference."
1993.92-7549,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,46.104,49.386,"Now, you began by saying that he was acquitted."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,50.708,52.111,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, and I'm getting to that."
1993.92-7549,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,52.111,52.471,All right.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,52.471,68.799,"The judge overrode the penalty recommendation, but more importantly in our case, the guilt trial verdict and imposed the death penalty, finding that Schiro had committed mens rea murder during the course of a rape."
1993.92-7549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,107.959,111.971,"And presumably mens rea in connection with that felony, didn't it?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,111.971,113.744,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's correct."
1993.92-7549,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,114.054,139.03,"Now, Ms. Foster, I thought the jury was instructed in instruction 8 that regardless of the form of verdict, in any case the jury had to find that the defendant engaged in the conduct which caused the death, and that when the defendant did so he knew the conduct would or intended it to cause the death."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,143.694,146.856,"--Justice... Justice O'Connor, that instruction goes to count I only."
1993.92-7549,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.828,149.46,Then it is not so limited.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,153.26,155.213,"--Yes, absolutely, it was."
1993.92-7549,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.213,170.754,"And it appeared to be understood by counsel for both the State and the defendant that intent was required to be found in any of the forms of verdict, and wasn't that so found?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,170.754,171.084,That--
1993.92-7549,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.084,182.993,"That was the arguments... the arguments made to the jury by... both counsel indicated that understanding, and it would certainly be consistent with instruction 8, as I read it."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,182.993,186.425,"--No, Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree with that."
1993.92-7549,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.842,253.443,"Well, at a... at a bare minimum, you would have to be concede that the courts below haven't found to the contrary of what I said to you."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,270.033,272.457,"--I'm sorry, I don't understand what your question is."
1993.92-7549,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.457,298.296,"Well, I had asked you whether the jury was given instruction 8 telling them they had to find intent regardless, and I don't believe that any court below has said that eight was inapplicable to the finding under the form of verdict that was returned here."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,303.428,307.262,"No, no court has said that 8 was inapplicable."
1993.92-7549,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,324.355,328.155,"It just appeared that... I mean, you may be right under terms of State law."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,335.521,336.202,"--Well, the judge did give final instruction number 8."
1993.92-7549,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,359.463,370.099,"Is it true that counsel for the State, as well as the defendant, thought that only one form of verdict could be returned?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,370.099,372.052,"No, absolutely not."
1993.92-7549,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,372.052,376.296,"That was certainly mentioned in their arguments to the jury, though, wasn't it?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,376.296,388.945,The prosecutor's arguments and his one verdict comments come at a point in the proceedings where the prosecutor gets to get up a second time and deliver his closing argument.
1993.92-7549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.849,397.342,"Did you try this case, Ms. Foster?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,397.342,399.814,"No, Justice... Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I did not."
1993.92-7549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,399.814,402.606,"So you're... you're judging from the transcript, I take it."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,403.888,404.639,Correct.
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,463.63,477.11,"Ms. Foster, you're giving a very complicated analysis, but isn't it true that the defense counsel, as well as the prosecutor, told the jury... and this is appendix page 17 of Brief for Respondent."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,495.385,505.863,The defense counsel was arguing that one verdict was the only proper number of verdicts that should be returned in this case because he was arguing for not guilty by reason of insanity.
1993.92-7549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,602.471,605.443,"Well, why does that mean that he was acquitted on those charges?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,607.876,624.749,"Because, as this Court's precedents in Price and Green establish, a silent verdict is the constitutional equivalent of an acquittal if either the jury had the opportunity to convict and did not or because the jury intended to acquit and--"
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,624.749,626.349,"Ms. Foster, are you confusing--"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,633.363,641.588,--I think it's fair to say that it's questionable whether the offenses at issue in Green concerned lesser included offenses.
1993.92-7549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,673.29,675.433,That's what the Court said in Green?
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,675.433,683.978,The Court said in footnote 14 specifically that the argument... that the offenses at issue were not... lesser or greater did not assist the Government's position at all.
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,689.243,697.838,Is there a difference between subjecting a person to jeopardy and acquitting a person?
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,721.585,723.217,That's exactly correct.
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,723.217,733.085,"So that putting a person in jeopardy is not the same... I mean, you can put a person in jeopardy and there'd be no acquittal."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,743.596,752.692,"Well, I think Green says that if the jury has the opportunity to convict and does not, that that is treated the same as an acquittal."
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,754.793,766.49,"It's treated the same in the sense that you can't try the person for that crime again, but it's not the equivalent of an acquittal, which is the determination of an issue."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,766.49,769.792,--I'm... I think I would disagree with that.
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,786.785,789.918,"Ms. Foster, could... can I ask this question?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,823.202,825.254,Let me make sure that I understand your--
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,825.254,826.165,He's convicted of rape.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,858.966,872.928,"--If the murder charge that he is... if the State convicts him of rape, then comes in and convicts him of murder during the course of a rape, what we would call in Indiana felony murder, is that what you're saying?"
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,872.928,873.288,Right.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,873.288,873.708,Okay.
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.888,885.97,Suppose it isn't a felony murder.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,887.051,888.151,Intentional.
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,888.151,900.178,"--Suppose it's intentional murder, but what is shown at the sentencing phase is that rape was part of the... of the event."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,900.178,907.034,"Well, if he's subsequently charged with intentional murder then, no, I don't think there would be a double jeopardy problem there."
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,907.034,907.204,Why not?
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,907.204,909.024,Because the elements are not the same.
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,909.024,912.427,But he's been treated... he's been tried for the rape.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,912.427,913.278,Right.
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,916.841,917.432,That's right.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,917.432,919.843,"Then separately tried for intentional murder, what we would all mens rea murder."
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,919.843,920.083,That's right.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,920.083,920.985,"No, there's no double--"
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.985,922.174,But rape as an aggravator.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,931.801,932.321,--Yes.
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,932.321,933.764,With no double jeopardy problem.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,933.764,934.996,He's convicted of rape.
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,937.135,939.868,"Not for double jeopardy purposes, is it?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,939.868,940.909,"Yes, it is."
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,942.94,943.14,Is that right.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,948.615,953.49,"In the hypothetical that you've given me, he is convicted of two different things."
1993.92-7549,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,960.446,963.187,"Well, then you're talking about collateral estoppel, not double jeopardy."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,978.949,984.524,"Well, if the... if the elements of the intentional murder are different than the elements of the rape, then no."
1993.92-7549,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,984.524,988.878,It's a question of a second trial for this... for the same facts.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1017.097,1026.292,I think that the element... the elements do make a difference.
1993.92-7549,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1038.633,1041.676,"Well, what if he'd been convicted."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1056.516,1057.578,And there had been no--
1993.92-7549,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1057.578,1062.881,And you say double jeopardy here because they didn't return a verdict of guilty of felony murder.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1064.453,1072.748,"--If he was convicted on count I and the jury was silent as to count II, yes, that would be... my argument is that that would be a double jeopardy violation also."
1993.92-7549,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1072.748,1075.142,"So the States' call it either way here, on double jeopardy."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1075.142,1075.342,"No, absolutely not."
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1115.439,1134.76,"Ms. Foster, did you check in those cases whether there was the kind of instruction that was involved in instruction 8, where the jury was told for murder... seemed to think that murder, without defining felony murder, premeditated, that all of them required an intent, or where the prosecutor and defense counsel says pick one?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1162.573,1174.698,"Justice Ginsburg, the opinions in those cases obviously do not answer the question that you have just asked, but I have looked at 33 of the records in 30... in those 37 cases."
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1190.621,1192.614,That instruction was not given here.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1192.614,1195.105,"--That instruction was not given here, that is correct."
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1215.81,1226.427,"So I take it your answer is no, they didn't have the kind of, perhaps misleading under State law, picture that was presented in this case, or at least you--"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1226.427,1229.068,I'm not sure what you mean by misleading picture.
1993.92-7549,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1242.468,1245.15,--May I ask a... are you through?
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1274.464,1280.958,The transcript of those... of the actual words that the judge spoke is not available.
1993.92-7549,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1282.531,1285.422,"So we don't know how he conveyed the parenthesis, s, close parenthesis to the jury."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1285.422,1285.953,--That's correct.
1993.92-7549,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.953,1288.534,Did the written instructions go the jury?
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1288.534,1293.649,"We don't know the answer to that either, although I know that... that the practice is Indiana is, in general, they do."
1993.92-7549,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1299.753,1304.087,"Because if the written instructions went, then the judge, in effect, said you can return more than one verdict."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1308.679,1318.426,"I mean, at some... at some points, I think, in the instructions he refers to verdicts and offenses, and at other points he refers to offense."
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1335.158,1335.929,But we're all hypothetical.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1338.48,1338.871,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1338.871,1345.346,"Let me just ask you one thing that I find so troublesome about your double jeopardy, that you propose to your issue-preclusion argument."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1390.95,1392.222,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1398.666,1400.906,But there the jury acquitted the person of the conduct.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1400.906,1401.386,--But what I heard you--
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1401.386,1412.435,"And if the sentencing stage... if that acquittal carries over to a sentencing and a sentencing is treated just like another trial, then why doesn't that follow?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1412.435,1421.441,"--Am I not correct that at the sentencing stage, that the... the factor only needs to be established by a preponderance?"
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1421.441,1421.652,Right.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1421.652,1428.697,"And the court could have found... I mean, it's a relative burdens case that the State didn't prove--"
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1428.697,1429.868,But this claim is precluded... the claim is precluded.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1445.064,1450.968,"--I still... my answer would nevertheless be that it's a relative burdens, that the distinction is relative burdens."
1993.92-7549,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1450.968,1462.875,"But isn't the answer that in Indiana to prove the aggravating circumstance to make death-eligible, that must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, so that there's a difference and Justice Ginsburg's problem would not arise in this case?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1462.875,1464.717,"That's absolutely correct, Justice Stevens."
1993.92-7549,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1468.1,1469.642,You have a different standard in the Sentencing Guidelines.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1520.366,1529.562,The bright line rule that you're suggesting is that defense counsel would be required on a collateral estoppel claim to request specific findings from the jury?
1993.92-7549,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1529.562,1529.782,Not findings.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1559.283,1561.584,I don't think we'd be here today if--
1993.92-7549,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1561.584,1569.889,"Why wouldn't it make sense for us to require that, simply to avoid this attempt at reconstruction afterwards, which is never very satisfactory?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1569.889,1584.321,"--Well, I guess my initial answer would be... you know, the State supreme court didn't find any sort of a procedural default, and that sounds to me like--"
1993.92-7549,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1584.321,1585.993,"Well, we've got... we've got a Federal issue here."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1596.321,1599.995,"--Well, Schiro's counsel would have had no notice of that requirement."
1993.92-7549,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1616.978,1632.777,"If we... if we, in fact, find that we cannot draw a sufficiently sound inference to raise an estoppel, would you... would you concede that the suggestion... that the imposition of such a bright line rule would, in fact, be appropriate?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1639.452,1643.926,"Well, I think in our case that there is a bright line that you can draw."
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1661.868,1662.589,But that isn't the question.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1687.367,1689.506,"--Well, standing here today--"
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1689.506,1696.442,"There wouldn't be this question of guessing if the judge had said in each... for each one of these counts, check off either guilty or not guilty."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1696.442,1699.805,--I think you're... I think that that is the proper thing that the court should have done.
1993.92-7549,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1699.805,1702.927,"And as defense counsel, you would have asked for that?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1702.927,1709.011,I'm not sure.
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1709.011,1711.623,It would produce a lot of hung juries.
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1731.229,1732.811,"Well, the fact is--"
1993.92-7549,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.811,1734.371,"It's normally that instruction, isn't it?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1747.943,1755.417,"--The State filed three charges and I think the jury would feel duty bound to return... you know, to give the State an answer on each of their three charges."
1993.92-7549,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1755.417,1757.818,"Well, why... why would it, if the jury was not instructed to do it?"
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1788.811,1799.059,"Because, as demonstrated in footnote 12, juries in Indiana routinely do come back with verdicts on each count."
1993.92-7549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.758,1823.791,"Thank you, Ms. Foster."
1993.92-7549,0,35821,monica_foster,,1827.274,1827.804,Thank you.
1993.92-7549,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.305,1833.689,Mr. Abel.
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1833.689,1836.72,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-7549,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1860.256,1863.798,It isn't... it isn't a requirement for double jeopardy.
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1866.151,1870.383,It is most certainly a requirement for issue preclusion.
1993.92-7549,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1874.077,1874.277,Yes.
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1884.194,1887.626,In many double jeopardy cases you would not.
1993.92-7549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1904.349,1915.306,"May I ask, before you go on to your other three, if the first one, there had been an explicit finding by the jury of not guilty on the intentional murder count, would you still prevail?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1915.306,1919.47,"Under the double jeopardy clause, that's correct."
1993.92-7549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.799,1946.019,What was your second?
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1947.531,1947.732,--I'm sorry.
1993.92-7549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1960.39,1964.494,What do you say about footnote 14 that she relies so heavily on?
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,1964.494,1966.395,"Well, I think it's important to look at."
1993.92-7549,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2052.493,2055.007,"When was this case tried, Mr. Abel?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2055.007,2055.708,1981.
1993.92-7549,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2055.708,2059.502,Were the verdict forms separate?
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2066.489,2069.501,There were three sheets of paper.
1993.92-7549,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2078.777,2080.938,I'll check the record for that.
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2080.938,2086.652,"And... but they were not all on one form, and they were not on separate sheets for each one."
1993.92-7549,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2091.397,2096.268,How do you distinguish Price and Green on the implied acquittal theory?
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2096.268,2110.537,"Well, because, as the Court recognized in Green, the vital thing is that you have a distinct and different offense involved, and felony murder and murder simply are not."
1993.92-7549,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2202.231,2209.306,"In Price and Green, too, Mr. Abel, it was two successive proceedings in each case, wasn't it?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2215.032,2215.681,That's correct.
1993.92-7549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2270.171,2272.481,"Mr. Abel, I'm not sure I understand you."
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2280.972,2281.212,No.
1993.92-7549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2313.466,2320.901,"No, but you would agree, would you not, that the jury, consistently with Indiana law, could have returned a guilty verdict on one, two, or three of the counts?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2323.963,2335.841,"Well, had they... had the jury returned a verdict on more than one of the counts, the trial court would have been required to not enter conviction... to enter conviction on only one."
1993.92-7549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.644,2338.933,"No, but I'm just asking about the jury."
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2343.998,2355.025,"--Well, I... I'm not sure what you mean by consistent with Indiana law, in the sense that if they did so, the court was required to take corrective action."
1993.92-7549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2358.066,2361.499,"But if it would have happened, he would have been able to choose among three different guilty verdicts?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2361.499,2365.131,"The court... yes, the court would have been able to do that."
1993.92-7549,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2368.585,2369.546,And what guides the court?
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2374.561,2375.823,--Um--
1993.92-7549,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2375.823,2377.095,Whatever it wants?
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2377.095,2379.956,--There are no specific standards for guidance.
1993.92-7549,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2385.361,2389.063,"Which in this case would be count III because... I guess count III, because that was the capital charge."
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2389.063,2391.696,--II and III were both capital charges.
1993.92-7549,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2391.696,2391.935,II and III.
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2391.935,2403.112,"And, in fact, under the instructions in this case, count II, I believe, would have been the most serious, the one, in fact, that the jury did return a verdict of conviction on."
1993.92-7549,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2598.503,2610.121,"Mr. Abel, this whole problem would have been obviated, would it not, if the verdict form that was submitted to the jury had asked the jury yes/no on each of the counts?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2632.958,2635.128,That's... exactly.
1993.92-7549,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2643.334,2670.581,"But wouldn't it... wouldn't it have been... for the purposes of clarity and to avoid an appeal, wouldn't it have been appropriate for the... for the prosecutor to say to the judge, give the jury a form which will make it clear to them that they can... that they should... not that they must, but that they should find yes or no on each count?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2670.581,2674.374,"Certainly, it would have obviated a great deal of the confusion."
1993.92-7549,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2679.068,2697.511,"Well, if the... if that had been done and the finding had come back not guilty on the first count, the intentional murder, then would there be a collateral estoppel problem at sentencing if you tried to prove intentional murder as an aggravator for sentencing?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2697.511,2701.612,--Not collateral estoppel under the double jeopardy clause.
1993.92-7549,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2723.879,2728.791,"Well, Ashe v. Swenson, though, has language that is troublesome, I suppose?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2728.791,2734.844,"--Well, you need to bear in mind in Ashe v. Swenson the fact situation."
1993.92-7549,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2773.573,2776.364,"Well, then we'll have to make up something else, won't we."
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2803.023,2803.574,I--
1993.92-7549,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2803.574,2809.799,"I mean, if we don't call it collateral estoppel, let's call it something else, but surely things like that should not happen, should they?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2809.799,2819.176,"--Assuming your proceedings are governed by the same burden of proof, I believe there certainly would be... might be something in the Constitution that would prevent that."
1993.92-7549,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2820.127,2820.936,And they are here.
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2851.706,2881.204,"--If I may explain, I believe that a doctrine that the Court could develop in an appropriate case, a case on direct review where it wouldn't be creating a new rule, would be in the nature of issue preclusion, and that it should be grounded just as the cases, the mixed law and equity cases are grounded on the appropriate right to a jury trial provision, rather than on the notion... on the double jeopardy clause, which is simply not aimed at anything but successive prosecutions."
1993.92-7549,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2889.41,2897.717,"But some issue preclusion is raised, litigated, and decided, so what's the... I don't understand... and I thought your whole point throughout is it wasn't decided."
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2897.717,2900.288,"That... that is the point, Your Honor."
1993.92-7549,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2901.248,2912.005,"So now you're saying even if it was decided, it would still... could be decided again by the judge, in a way... in conflict with the jury?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2912.005,2918.858,"--As I understood the hypothetical, I do think there would... there would be problems with having that issue relitigated."
1993.92-7549,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2931.39,2933.03,"Which was not raised in this case, right?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2933.03,2934.241,--Which was not raised in this case.
1993.92-7549,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2934.241,2941.505,"So, your argument would be even if it was decided and even if there was no Teague problem, that we still couldn't find in their favor in this case?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2941.505,2943.097,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-7549,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2943.097,2953.833,"I thought your argument was it was academic in this case because there was no finding, and for issue preclusion that you must have a finding?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,2953.833,2955.144,That's correct.
1993.92-7549,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3084.829,3098.83,"Can you clarify for me what you mean by... you know, when there are just different theories of the same offense, what is the criterion for that, whether separate sentences could be imposed for each of the convictions?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,3114.508,3126.156,"I believe the criterion is how State law defines the offense, so long as it does so in a manner consistent with due process under Schad."
1993.92-7549,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3134.334,3134.594,Yeah.
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,3141.717,3141.918,Um.
1993.92-7549,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3141.918,3145.43,I assume here you could only be punished for murder.
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,3145.43,3146.462,That's correct.
1993.92-7549,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3146.462,3147.704,One type or the other of murder.
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,3154.419,3161.633,"Certainly if that were the test to be applied, this case would meet it."
1993.92-7549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3187.331,3189.833,"Let me just ask you one other question, if I may?"
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,3201.48,3207.113,I believe it's not really a question of either law.
1993.92-7549,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3222.733,3226.146,"Well, supposing it were perfectly clear."
1993.92-7549,1,15408,arend_j_abel,,3251.103,3259.358,"I still believe that it would be a factual question, depending on what else might be in the record that would determine a resolution of that factual question."
1993.92-7549,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3276.74,3278.051,"Thank you, Mr. Abel."
