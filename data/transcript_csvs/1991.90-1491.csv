1991.90-1491,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.737,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-1491, Union Bank v. Herbert Wolas."
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,50.183,53.468,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,133.385,141.657,"Mr. Graham, before you get into the legislative history of the prior statute, sticking for the moment with the plain language of the statute, how big was this loan?"
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,141.657,142.859,--$7 million.
1991.90-1491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,142.859,147.56,"And are $7 million loans, borrowings, made in the ordinary course of business?"
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,147.56,151.631,"Yes, for Union Bank, which is a large commercial lender--"
1991.90-1491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,151.631,156.583,"No, but for the... is it the ordinary course of business for the bank or the ordinary course of business of the borrower?"
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,156.583,160.968,--The statute requires it to be in the ordinary course of both the borrower and the lender.
1991.90-1491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,160.968,167.605,"No, but my question is, is it the ordinary course of this borrower to make $7 million unsecured loans?"
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,171.343,174.961,That would be a factual issue that would need to be determined in the trial court.
1991.90-1491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,175.445,181.031,"If this is the only loan of this magnitude it had ever made, and never borrowed more than $1,000 before, what would you say?"
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,181.031,187.352,--Then I would say that as to that particular corporation or business' operation it was not ordinary.
1991.90-1491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,195.856,196.022,I understand.
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,196.522,204.293,I do agree with Your Honor that there is a standard of ordinariness that must be analyzed on a factual basis.
1991.90-1491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,204.293,207.545,"Both with respect to incurring the debt, and also with respect to the payments."
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,207.545,219.471,"That's correct, and I would turn... just for example... to Black's Law Dictionary that says something that is ordinary is normal and customary, and not characterized by peculiar or unusual circumstances."
1991.90-1491,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,219.471,226.475,"On that same point, suppose there were a balloon payment, that this was a loan with monthly principal and interest payments."
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,232.812,241.834,"Then I believe that if it was customary for that type of debtor to borrow money and pay by balloon payment, that it would not be considered to be unusual and out of the ordinary course."
1991.90-1491,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,241.834,243.734,The test is what is customary for the particular business?
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,243.734,257.677,"Yes, I think there would have to be an analysis both of... both of what occurs in the industry, and possibly what was proper and appropriate to this particular business... for instance, measuring their net worth, and an examination of their balance sheet at that time."
1991.90-1491,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.677,267.799,Let's assume a small business that incurs a substantial loan at the outset of the business to purchase the real estate in which the business operates.
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,282.226,291.665,"No, I... in answering the other Justice's question, I thought what I was saying is you would have to test it from a factual circumstance, by examining the particular business."
1991.90-1491,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,292.017,296.384,"Well, the particular business, this is the only loan of that magnitude it ever took out."
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,299.52,300.503,--And I would agree--
1991.90-1491,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,300.503,302.722,"So it isn't just the particular business, you say."
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,304.324,305.657,--I would agree with your point.
1991.90-1491,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,309.775,310.225,Of course.
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,310.225,317.013,Yet that would not be considered to be unusual for that particular individual to buy a home and incur a large amount of debt for his personal residence.
1991.90-1491,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.013,317.465,Quite so.
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,318.931,326.571,"Yes, I agree, so long as that particular business, for instance, let's say, only needed one large working capital loan."
1991.90-1491,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,578.406,582.21,That was the year in which the 45-day provision was repealed?
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,582.21,585.245,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1491,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,627.122,636.144,It certainly narrowed the... preferences that could be recovered.
1991.90-1491,0,30500,john_a_graham,,636.144,637.327,"--The new statute, Your Honor?"
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,1036.778,1039.896,"If it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice:"
1991.90-1491,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1051.538,1052.989,"1984, you mean."
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,1052.989,1053.456,'84.
1991.90-1491,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1351.458,1356.362,"You're saying though, that the current expense exception was not statutory under the 1898--"
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,1356.362,1357.564,"It was not statutory, Your Honor."
1991.90-1491,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1780.779,1782.529,"--This is unsecured, commercial paper?"
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,1782.529,1785.481,Unsecured commercial paper.
1991.90-1491,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.076,1867.015,"Mr. Wolas, I don't... I don't see where you're going... or I think I do see where you're going... so these were the three groups who had the complaint."
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,1895.998,1896.7,--Your Honor--
1991.90-1491,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.7,1901.502,Very often Congress enacts a provision that solves a problem and then goes beyond that.
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,1909.092,1912.544,"--Justice Scalia, in Chambers, you explain that to us very carefully."
1991.90-1491,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1946.717,1951.002,You don't need legislative history to tell you that the 45-day rule is gone.
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,1952.954,1953.387,That is correct.
1991.90-1491,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.19,1987.525,Do you apply your argument to both the interest payments and payments of the principal?
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,1987.525,1989.377,"--Oh, principal is even worse."
1991.90-1491,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1989.377,1992.579,"I know, but so you say yes."
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,1992.579,1997.233,I would say principal and interest are not protected under the bank--
1991.90-1491,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.233,2003.387,"Well, isn't it that when you pay interest you're paying right now for the use of money?"
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2003.387,2004.104,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.90-1491,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2011.04,2015.825,"Well, that may be, but you're keeping the loan from being called."
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2015.825,2016.342,That is correct.
1991.90-1491,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2016.342,2020.294,"And you're paying your interest, and you're getting the use of money for another month."
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2020.294,2021.727,"No, you've already--"
1991.90-1491,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.727,2026.781,"Or isn't that just like buying anything else, for cash?"
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2026.781,2030.416,"--One could say that, but you've already obligated yourself for the debt--"
1991.90-1491,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.416,2033.118,But that wouldn't cover the payments on principal.
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2033.118,2040.623,"--No, if the... if we were to read the statute the way the bank wants us to read the statute--"
1991.90-1491,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2040.623,2041.79,"It would cover the principal, too."
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2041.79,2042.773,--the payment of principal would also--
1991.90-1491,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.773,2043.409,"Oh, sure."
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2043.409,2044.142,--be involved.
1991.90-1491,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2044.142,2046.711,"Well, you have to read it that way because it's written that way."
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2059.369,2060.552,That is... that is correct.
1991.90-1491,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.552,2062.054,"So the two would seem to go together, wouldn't it?"
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2062.054,2063.737,That's right; that is correct.
1991.90-1491,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2175.857,2180.595,"Well, maybe that's because other creditors are not as fussy as banks are."
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2180.595,2185.713,"Well, I don't think banks are so fussy these days, Your Honor, but it's quite possible."
1991.90-1491,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2185.713,2186.13,"Well, they used to be."
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2187.165,2188.765,It's quite possible.
1991.90-1491,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.765,2190.967,Or are not loaning as much money.
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2205.108,2212.345,"They... yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1491,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.816,2245.082,But they did.
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2254.87,2267.177,"--The theory of ordinary course is what is necessary to keep the debtor going from day to day: the purchase of inventory, the purchase of materials, the pur... the payment of labor, the payment of rent."
1991.90-1491,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.353,2281.57,May I just interrupt with this?
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2294.613,2297.732,"Well, I would like to win without remand, Your Honor."
1991.90-1491,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2302.903,2305.837,"Well, would your bright... what would your bright-line test do with the case?"
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2321.43,2322.364,--There is a--
1991.90-1491,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.364,2324.216,It was so frequent they didn't need corporate resolutions.
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2330.286,2336.107,"--Assuming your... assuming your facts, Your Honor, there is a case which protected lenders in this situation."
1991.90-1491,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2356.77,2359.472,"Well, what I'm suggesting is even your rule isn't entirely bright."
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2359.472,2361.322,"Well, those are the problems."
1991.90-1491,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2469.305,2471.555,"Iowa Premium was an Eighth Circuit case, wasn't it?"
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2471.555,2472.021,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1491,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2473.007,2476.059,Do you remember who the panel was?
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2476.059,2478.661,"It was an en banc re-hearing, Your Honor."
1991.90-1491,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2601.856,2610.128,"Well, they could just have put in an... in a parenthesis, and said we really mean what this... what these words mean."
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2610.128,2613.33,--They could have done a lot of things.
1991.90-1491,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.98,2619.615,"But they did use these... you don't say that it's an irrational construction of the statute, just on its face?"
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2619.615,2622.317,"I think it's an unreasonable interpretation, Your Honor."
1991.90-1491,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.317,2624.252,But only because of history.
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2624.252,2635.44,"It was interesting that in Mid-Atlantic, you took language that was absolutely clear... clear language from the statute... the trustee may abandon property."
1991.90-1491,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.962,2649.545,"Well, there isn't any legislative history here to speak of."
1991.90-1491,1,28378,herbert_wolas,,2650.33,2652.949,--They're substantial judicial history.
1991.90-1491,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2667.44,2669.69,"It's more than exercise, Mr. Wolas."
1991.90-1491,2,30500,john_a_graham,,2674.677,2676.546,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2676.546,2683.7,"Mr. Graham, before you get into it, would you tell me what you consider not in the ordinary course?"
1991.90-1491,2,30500,john_a_graham,,2693.222,2702.578,"Well, I can refer to definitions of what is not considered ordinary... things that are exceptional, unusual, not customary."
1991.90-1491,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2772.405,2781.344,"Well, suppose you've got... you simply have an unsecured... you've issued an unsecured promissory note and you promise to pay it in 90 days."
1991.90-1491,2,30500,john_a_graham,,2793.402,2801.222,Most probably not... if the facts show that one of the reasons the bank was asking for security was a concern with respect to the credit.
1991.90-1491,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2837.226,2845.962,"Well, certainly, if you've got an acceleration clause in your promissory note, and there's a failure to make an installment payment, it's ordinary business course to accelerate."
1991.90-1491,2,30500,john_a_graham,,2845.962,2852.866,"--Usually it is, if there's no reason why... acceptable reason to the lender why the borrower is not making the payment."
1991.90-1491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2853.232,2858.85,"Well, we're talking about whether it was incurred in the ordinary course, not whether the payment was made in the ordinary course, right?"
1991.90-1491,2,30500,john_a_graham,,2859.986,2860.636,"--Well, the test--"
1991.90-1491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2860.636,2861.836,--Just to keep our eye on the ball?
1991.90-1491,2,30500,john_a_graham,,2863.104,2865.52,"--Well, there are three balls here, Justice Scalia."
1991.90-1491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2871.59,2880.613,"Yeah, but the difference between long-term and short-term debt is a difference that hinges on (a) whether... whether the debt was incurred in the ordinary course or not."
1991.90-1491,2,30500,john_a_graham,,2880.613,2884.898,"That's correct, so long as the terms of the loan are also according to ordinary business terms."
1991.90-1491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2884.898,2917.452,"Right, now, the example you gave a minute ago about loaning $8 million to General Motors leads me to believe that maybe you're backing off from a position you took earlier... I must say I rather invited you to take the position, but maybe I shouldn't have... and that was you now seem to say that whether it's in the ordinary course depends upon whether it's ordinary for the particular business, not whether it's ordinary for all businesses, for example, to make one enormous borrowing at the beginning of their business life."
1991.90-1491,2,30500,john_a_graham,,2917.452,2918.036,I believe--
1991.90-1491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2918.036,2919.988,Do you recall that exchange we had earlier?
1991.90-1491,2,30500,john_a_graham,,2919.988,2920.888,"--Yes, I do."
1991.90-1491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.096,2965.381,We don't have to decide here whether this loan was in the ordinary course or not.
1991.90-1491,2,30500,john_a_graham,,2973.119,2974.869,--Yes.
1991.90-1491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3232.87,3234.287,Are you both wrong or are you both right?
1991.90-1491,2,30500,john_a_graham,,3235.655,3237.071,"--We are both right, Your Honor."
