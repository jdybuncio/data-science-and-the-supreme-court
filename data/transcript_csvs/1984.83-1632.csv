1984.83-1632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.829,We'll hear arguments next in Harper and Row against Nation Enterprises.
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,62.214,65.406,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1984.83-1632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,72.332,72.869,Would you raise your voice a little.
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,72.869,73.961,Yes.
1984.83-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.247,177.6,Do you have any idea of how many words to the page?
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,177.6,180.224,"--No, Your Honor, I don't."
1984.83-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,345.82,355.576,"You say, Mr. Miller, that it included President Ford's summary of his reasons for the pardon, do you mean by that that it quoted directly or that it simply paraphrased?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,355.576,361.4,--There was a quote in which President Ford summarized his overall philosophy.
1984.83-1632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,388.679,390.319,Was that material available anywhere else?
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,390.319,393.4,--President Ford's--
1984.83-1632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,393.4,395.701,"In prior speeches, or articles?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,395.701,404.337,"--That particular material was the material that President Ford created as he wrote the book, and that particular material was not available."
1984.83-1632,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,419.488,438.661,"Mr. Miller, do you take the position that the copyright allows President Ford to license publication of those facts, or just his written expression or choice of words in expressing?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,438.661,447.567,"Just his expression, Justice O'Connor, as that term has been defined traditionally in the copyright courts."
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,447.567,455.582,"How many total words were quoted, actually quoted?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,455.582,458.043,How many were quoted?
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.969,468.441,Seven hundred were quoted?
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,468.441,469.34,Yes.
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,474.655,478.926,How many did the Court of Appeals think were quoted?
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,478.926,488.493,"The Court of Appeals did a stripping away exercise, and ended up with 300 words that in their view represented copyrightable expression."
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,488.493,491.846,Whose word should we take?
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,491.846,497.169,"Well, Your Honor, Justice White, I think--"
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,497.169,499.74,Do we have to count them?
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,499.74,502.144,--I think it is not a question of counting.
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,504.485,515.492,"You say that it included a summary of his philosophy going back to law school, an assessment of President Nixon's character."
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,522.156,531.28,"--Your Honor, I think that 300 words of expression should be protected, certainly in a manuscript that hasn't been published yet."
1984.83-1632,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,549.764,554.548,"The copyright Act applies to works, as I understand it, not to words."
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,555.937,559.649,"Yes, Justice Powell."
1984.83-1632,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,559.649,562.852,"It uses the term ""works"", doesn't it?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,562.852,596.302,"I think the Copyright Act applies to protect expression, and expression has been defined in cases to include the following, this is a reading from a Second Circuit case: What is protected is the manner of expression, the author's analysis or interpretation of events, the way he structures his material and marshals his facts, his choice of words, and the emphasis he gives to the particular developments."
1984.83-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,642.244,656.653,"Mr. Miller, it isn't just a question that he who reads may count as to how many words were copyrightable, is that the Court of Appeals had one view of copyrightability, and I take it that you have a somewhat broader view, and that is why you reach a higher number."
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,656.653,657.654,That's correct.
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,670.572,685.892,"I take it that you would say that even there was not a single instance in this story that you could identify as a literal quote, you would think that there could be a violation of copyright."
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,685.892,695.098,"--I think it is certainly possible, Justice White, that there could be a violation in that situation, but that, of course, isn't the situation here."
1984.83-1632,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,722.276,742.259,"Mr. Miller, do you think that the fact that it was an unpublished work expands your definition of what is protectable under the copyright law, or is the fact that it was unpublished in your view just one element of determining Fair Use?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,742.259,752.637,"I think the fact that it wasn't published doesn't expand the scope of what is protectable, but it is certainly a very important factor in determining Fair Use."
1984.83-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,752.637,771.117,"Mr. Miller, it would be helpful to me, in trying to focus on the difference between your two positions, if you could identify one or two of the passages that you think are clearly copyrightable, and they think are not, because talking in generalities, it is always a little hard to focus on what the difference is."
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,771.117,783.766,President Ford has a discussion in the book that describes his discussions with Alexander Haig during that eight-day period prior to the time that he became President.
1984.83-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,858.355,868.021,"One of the examples that you have given, I guess, is this written statement that President Ford read to General Haig over the telephone, I guess it was."
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,872.475,881.281,"No, there really isn't because our position, and I think the District Court's position was that the totality of Ford's expression is copyrightable."
1984.83-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,881.281,888.644,"Just take the quote itself, is that in your view copyrightable?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,888.644,894.49,"The quote itself, Your Honor, don't I think it was copyrightable, but we are not so contending in this case."
1984.83-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.49,895.059,Is see.
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,895.059,900.632,"The reason why it is not copyrightable, and we are not contending it is, is that the quote itself was disclosed."
1984.83-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,912.94,918.484,Let me be sure I understand your entire position.
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,924.318,924.748,Yes.
1984.83-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,924.748,925.59,I see.
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,925.59,946.393,"Still another example, Your Honor, President Ford describes many factors that influenced him in granting the pardon, the advice that he received from various people, and the advice that he received from Henry Ruth, and so forth and so on."
1984.83-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,999.618,1001.498,Let me ask just one other question here.
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1022.441,1028.906,"--Your Honor, I don't think that that fact should affect copyrightability."
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.12,1162.245,"Do I understand you to say that if President Ford, in his memoirs, revealed that an event that no one had ever known about before and he described that event, do you say that no one could reveal that event without violating his copyright?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1162.245,1166.038,"--They could certainly reveal the information, but they couldn't take his expression."
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.038,1167.439,Yes.
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1175.864,1176.845,That's correct.
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.81,1188.863,"Such as it has to be a literal quote, or something."
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1188.863,1191.544,"--It has to be a literal quote, and such as--"
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.544,1195.257,"You say, it can also violate if it is just a paraphrase."
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1195.257,1197.258,--That's correct.
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.258,1203.262,How do you recognize a paraphrase when you meet it on the street?
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1203.262,1209.597,"Justice White, I think it is a question of looking at the material and exercising judgment."
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1209.597,1214.99,As to whether it is practically the same thing as the quote?
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1214.99,1232.25,"What I think the District Court did in this case was the District Court took the Ford material and compared it in its totality with what The Nation did, and said, overall this is substantially similar and, therefore, infringement."
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1232.25,1234.931,"Substantially similar, that is your test?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1234.931,1243.858,"That is the test of infringement, yes, and I think that's the test that has to be applied when you are dealing with paraphrase."
1984.83-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1243.858,1256.898,"Paraphrase then includes the idea that even though there is not literal quotation, there is so much similarity in arrangement, the sentence structure, and that sort of thing?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1256.898,1258.047,That's correct.
1984.83-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1282.283,1284.524,"Mr. Miller, could I interrupt once more."
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1299.585,1317.746,"I think in The Nation sentence by sentence analysis, they have a chart, which is in the Joint Appendix, and they have a little red line underneath the stuff that they say or concede is possibly expression, or they are arguable expressions, or something like that."
1984.83-1632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.944,1334.489,"Conversely, everything in yellow you contend is copyrightable."
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1334.489,1339.501,"Really, everything in yellow is what we contend was copyrightable."
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.501,1342.834,"Is that the total question, that it is copyrightable?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1360.045,1370.431,"That was part of the holding below, and our contention is that the majority shouldn't have dismissed paraphrasing so lightly because it can indeed--"
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1370.431,1376.926,"Do you say that... The court below said 300, and you say 700?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1376.926,1377.727,--No.
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1388.743,1397.689,"You are just saying, because it was a violation of copyrightable material?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1397.689,1399.141,"--Yes, that is correct."
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.141,1399.92,Eighteen hundred words.
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1399.92,1400.561,Yes.
1984.83-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1400.561,1407.986,"When you say 1800 words were copied, do you say that every one of those 1800 words was copyrightable?"
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1407.986,1409.606,Yes.
1984.83-1632,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1409.606,1415.16,It is just as though President Ford used those words.
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1415.16,1416.812,"Yes, that's correct."
1984.83-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.024,1500.005,So that they'll get some royalties.
1984.83-1632,0,22806,edward_a_miller,,1500.005,1502.739,"And so that they'll get some royalties, too."
1984.83-1632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1587.894,1589.122,Very well.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1593.156,1600.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1984.83-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1633.582,1638.657,"It does protect, doesn't it, Mr. Abrams, a particular method of describing a fact."
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1638.657,1645.06,"It protects expression, Justice Renquist, which indeed is very often a way of describing a fact."
1984.83-1632,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1692.473,1696.186,So the real comparison is between 300 words.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1696.186,1699.198,"That is the starting cut, I think."
1984.83-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.653,1725.856,How about to the Time excerpt?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1725.856,1729.677,"--The Time excerpt wasn't in existence, and never got written, Your Honor."
1984.83-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1734.802,1736.182,So he never saw that.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1736.182,1741.136,"Yes, sir, he never saw it, and so far as I know it never came into existence at all."
1984.83-1632,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1741.136,1745.377,Do the 300 words represent just the direct quotes?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1745.377,1749.44,The 300 words represent direct quotes.
1984.83-1632,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1749.44,1758.975,Do you not concede that paraphrasing other words could constitute a copyright violation?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1758.975,1761.008,"I do concede that, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-1632,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1777.368,1779.311,And perhaps this case.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1779.311,1780.781,"I hope not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1632,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1830.101,1840.089,Why are direct quotes or direct paraphrasing of an author's expression essential to news reporting?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1841.982,1847.055,"It can be rewritten less well, less probingly, less meaningfully."
1984.83-1632,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1872.082,1884.429,Didn't Mr. Navasky himself testify that the words quoted had a definitive quality and were a more powerful statement than he himself could have written.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1887.61,1891.423,"Justice O'Connor, those words are protected, and we agree with that."
1984.83-1632,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1922.763,1927.417,But you also say that that 300 can be published under the rubric of Fair Use.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1927.417,1928.058,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1632,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1932.851,1935.943,Even if it is the essence of the article.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1935.943,1937.703,--It is not the essence of the article.
1984.83-1632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1946.919,1954.445,"Mr. Abrams, did the editor of The Nation know that Time Magazine was going to publish an article on the book?"
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1954.445,1962.23,"By the time the article was published in The Nation, he was aware that Time Magazine was going to publish something."
1984.83-1632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1966.254,1971.937,He was trying to scoop the publication by Time in the vernacular of the news business?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1971.937,1981.881,"In a sense, Mr. Navasky testified that he wanted to be first, yes, sir, and he testified that he wanted to be first because he wanted to put his own perspective on it."
1984.83-1632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1981.881,1988.346,"Did Mr. Navasky contribute anything to the article itself, beyond what he obtained from the Ford manuscript?"
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1988.346,1990.018,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1990.018,1991.438,Besides condensation.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1991.438,1992.7,Two things.
1984.83-1632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2000.534,2004.648,Were any of his ideas incorporated into that?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2004.648,2006.689,"In one way they were, Your Honor."
1984.83-1632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2036.569,2041.081,You characterize this as objective reporting or editorializing?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2041.081,2045.174,"I have to say, Justice Powell, I think it's some of both."
1984.83-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2074.733,2081.137,"Why did you have all the expert witnesses, then, in the District Court testifying that something was journalistically proper if courts can't review that?"
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2081.137,2085.399,What we called them for was to deal with various aspects of Fair Use.
1984.83-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.424,2095.167,I thought you said they testified that something was done well from a journalistic standpoint.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2095.167,2103.04,"They testified to the amount that was taken, for example, Part III of Fair Use, they didn't take any more than was necessary."
1984.83-1632,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2162.88,2169.065,I hope you have a good litmus paper test to identify news as compared to what is newsworthy.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2169.065,2173.747,"We got into, Justice White, arguments about whether something has to be news."
1984.83-1632,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.747,2177.102,You suggest that there is a lot of news that's not newsworthy.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2177.102,2184.015,"I suggest that news doesn't have to be new, and that was one of the areas we drifted off on to at trial."
1984.83-1632,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2184.015,2188.238,Did you say that this was also commercial valuable material that was taken?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2188.238,2192.63,"As any book is, Your Honor, sure."
1984.83-1632,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2200.545,2205.039,The question is commercially valuable to The Nation?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2205.039,2210.052,"I don't know if anything is really commercially valuable to The Nation, Your Honor."
1984.83-1632,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2211.063,2215.094,"I am talking to the party to this action, and not the country with a small ""n""."
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2215.094,2218.349,"I am sorry, I meant the magazine."
1984.83-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2482.312,2483.23,Mr. Abrams.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2483.23,2483.661,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2483.661,2495.78,"I didn't understand your opponent to go that far in his concept of paraphrasing, that simply a relating of the same of the factual account would would automatically be described as paraphrasing."
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2495.78,2501.182,"I don't understand him to go that far in paraphrasing, Your Honor."
1984.83-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2569.267,2579.555,"When you say, 30 chapters--"
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2579.555,2588.961,"No, sir, that is exactly what I am conceding my client was not allowed to do, was to take a chapter out of the book and change a few words."
1984.83-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2588.961,2591.653,--Or 300 words out of the book if he is simply--
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2591.653,2598.937,"When you start to get down, Justice Renquist, to 300 words, then I think you have to apply standard Fair Use analysis."
1984.83-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2598.937,2599.528,--Okay.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2615.827,2621.86,"I should have said, I misspoke a moment ago, you have to use Fair Use analysis no matter what you get down to."
1984.83-1632,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2641.575,2648.869,The first publication right is not a factor for consideration in Fair Use?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2648.869,2654.352,"I think pre-publication, Justice O'Connor, can be a factor in a particular type of case."
1984.83-1632,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2656.375,2657.635,What about this case?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2657.635,2659.347,"--This case, no."
1984.83-1632,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2704.086,2710.18,Do you think the right of first publication is a right encompassed under Section 106 of the law?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2710.18,2711.272,Yes.
1984.83-1632,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2756.23,2761.894,Do you look at the negative effect on the potential market and value?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2761.894,2764.237,"--Yes, that is the fourth factor, and you certainly look at that."
1984.83-1632,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2764.237,2766.218,Wouldn't that be a factor here to worry about?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2766.218,2773.063,It is a factor here but only if the negative effect was caused by taking copyrightable material.
1984.83-1632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2838.423,2848.942,"Would you repeat what you have said about the first factor, whether or not publication was for commercial purposes rather than for non-profit, educational purposes."
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2850.752,2856.015,"This is commercial as opposed to educational, Your Honor."
1984.83-1632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2856.015,2864.623,Is it not commercial in every sense in that you knew that the material would be published by Time in a matter of a couple of weeks?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2864.623,2869.425,I think the commercial relates to my client and not Time.
1984.83-1632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2881.633,2883.363,You flunk that test.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2883.363,2891.39,"--We don't flunk it, Your Honor, because we view it as a sort of a sliding scale necessarily."
1984.83-1632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2903.506,2905.599,Yours is educational for profit.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2905.599,2911.022,"It is hopefully for profits, Justice Marshall, but it's news reporting."
1984.83-1632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2961.084,2966.588,"But you do start with copyrighted material, don't you, which is a little different from most news reporting."
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2966.588,2968.708,"It really isn't, Your Honor."
1984.83-1632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2968.708,2971.59,"This was copyrighted, wasn't it?"
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2971.59,2971.971,I'm sorry.
1984.83-1632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2971.971,2972.842,Was the book copyrighted?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2972.842,2974.222,The book was copyrighted.
1984.83-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2999.429,3008.506,"Yes, but the kind of Fair Use example you give of President Ford is in the context of a work which bears the imprint... the individual imprint of an author."
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3015.74,3035.734,"Your Honor, if we are right for the moment, if I am persuasive for the moment with respect to the pre-publication and post-publication issue, if one just puts that to the side for the moment, it is inconceivable to me that anyone would say that this article, this very article, published after publication of the Ford Memoirs, violates the copyright law."
1984.83-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3061.831,3067.234,"Yes, but most book reviews contain the reviewer's appraisal of the work as a piece of literature."
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3067.234,3075.008,"News articles on books just published frequently do not, new articles about books about politics in particular."
1984.83-1632,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3166.488,3181.628,"I understood your opponent to concede that Fair Use was a proper question for inquiry here, but he takes the view that whether it is a first publication is a factor to be considered under Fair Use."
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3182.97,3183.929,--I think he goes farther.
1984.83-1632,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3183.929,3185.191,Is that the essence of the difference?
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3185.191,3186.814,"I don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-1632,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3229.109,3235.543,"Mr. Abrams, you got us up to 700 words with that memorandum."
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3244.119,3245.13,No.
1984.83-1632,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3249.232,3250.023,Yes.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3250.023,3254.287,--the amount quoted is about 700 words--
1984.83-1632,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3254.287,3255.126,Yes.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3255.126,3259.099,--Our opponents say that an additional 1100 words were paraphrased.
1984.83-1632,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3259.099,3259.7,I got you.
1984.83-1632,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3259.7,3265.154,There is no argument about 400 words... about the other 700 words.
1984.83-1632,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3265.154,3266.293,Thank you.
1984.83-1632,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3266.293,3268.426,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Miller."
1984.83-1632,2,22806,edward_a_miller,,3268.426,3269.255,I have no rebuttal.
1984.83-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3269.255,3272.339,"Mr. Miller, may I ask one question, please."
1984.83-1632,2,22806,edward_a_miller,,3286.047,3295.933,"Justice O'Connor, if that happened, there would be one significant change in one of the Fair Use factors, and a possible change in the other."
1984.83-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3295.933,3298.236,"Yes or no, a violation or not?"
1984.83-1632,2,22806,edward_a_miller,,3298.236,3306.02,"It could be, but I can't answer yes or no because it would depend upon the economic impact of the use."
1984.83-1632,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3345.447,3346.078,Thank you.
