2009.08-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-240, Mac's Shell Service v. Shell Oil Products, and the consolidated case."
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,10.292,29.205,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted the PMPA to regulate two specific, but important, actions: Franchisors' termination of the franchise prior to the conclusion of the franchise term and the franchisors' non-renewal of the franchise relationship at the end of the agreement's term."
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,66.222,80.795,"Mr. Lamken, am I wrong that you don't really object to the recognition of ""constructive termination"", if that phrase is used the way it is used elsewhere in contract law?"
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,80.795,91.507,--We don't believe that in contract law constructive termination exists or in the analogous State franchise statutes that existed at the time that the Congress enacted the PMPA.
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,91.507,107.877,"Gee, I thought -- I thought that if you had a lease and the landlord fails to provide heat, that you can move out and he will be deemed to have constructively evicted you."
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,107.877,108.735,That's right.
2009.08-240,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,124.587,128.1,"But that -- on that point, the government differs with you."
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,138.176,138.8,--Yes.
2009.08-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,176.673,180.655,"Well, but all -- under one view, all the dealer is doing is mitigating damages."
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,193.277,195.196,"On the contrary, Your Honor."
2009.08-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,208.643,208.783,"Well, but there--"
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,208.783,215.233,"--constructive discharge must move out, must quit the job, and the tenant claiming constructive eviction must leave the job."
2009.08-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,239.426,242.377,"--Well, you've lost the rights to operate at a particular level."
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,264.176,264.613,--Well--
2009.08-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,264.613,266.38,--but the deal has been terminated.
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,266.38,269.94,"--I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you have confused breach with termination."
2009.08-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,300.446,302.381,What did Williston say about it?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,302.505,303.005,Pardon.
2009.08-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,303.005,304.272,--What does Williston say about it?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,304.272,305.816,Williston didn't actually address that.
2009.08-240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,312.141,317.749,Is -- is leaving the premises the sine quo non of a termination?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,317.749,324.217,"--It's the sine qua non of any termination under this statute, we would believe, if you recognize constructive termination."
2009.08-240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,324.217,329.837,But aren't there -- aren't there some operators that own their own premises?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,329.837,330.261,That's right.
2009.08-240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,336.868,339.024,So only one of the three would suffice in your view?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,339.024,339.632,--That's right.
2009.08-240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,346.316,346.847,Just--
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,346.847,348.66,--defined within the agreement.
2009.08-240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,348.66,356.373,"--Just testing your view, suppose there are two franchisees, and in each case the oil company reduces the amount they're paying for the gas."
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,369.838,372.509,"Well, in our view the result would be the same in both."
2009.08-240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,375.32,375.819,"No, no."
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,378.35,378.756,--Right.
2009.08-240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,429.656,441.292,"If the government comes up here, as I think they will in a few minutes, and tells us that there is such a thing as constructive termination, do you know what hypothetical they give us to illustrate how that would work?"
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,445.913,446.385,--Well--
2009.08-240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,446.385,456.021,"In other words, there is a small universe of cases in which there is a constructive termination without leaving the premises, without severing the fuel, et cetera."
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,456.021,456.661,--I don't--
2009.08-240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,456.661,459.223,I just don't know what they're going to -- how you would respond to that?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,459.223,459.815,--Yes.
2009.08-240,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.748,477.573,Your position is that the franchisor has to be the one to terminate?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,477.573,478.837,"--That's our position, yes."
2009.08-240,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,498.44,515.305,"So that the franchisor can do outrageous things -- triple the rent, double the price of the fuel -- and you would say, even so, there's -- that doesn't count as a termination because the franchisor hasn't terminated?"
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,515.305,523.833,"--That's right, and precisely because all those things were comprehensively and uniformly addressed by contract law, uniform contract law."
2009.08-240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,524.348,525.693,But then you'd just have a magic words test.
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,525.693,533.391,"--No, it does not reduce -- I mean, because we -- we agree that there can be a termination by deed as well as by words."
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,548.054,549.664,"Yes, but what happens after that?"
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,557.721,565.609,"If -- no, our position would be that where the station owner abandons in response, that would not be an actual termination."
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.965,568.561,"Now, wait, wait--"
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,568.561,569.497,And the problem this gets you--
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.497,578.29,"--I thought you said there is a termination by the company if it fails to provide one of the three basic elements, right?"
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,578.29,579.554,"--Yes, that is correct, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.554,580.147,That is a termination?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,580.147,580.977,That is.
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.977,585.349,What response has to be made by the station owner?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,585.864,586.8,Well--
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.8,588.972,He can continue to take the other two elements?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,588.972,593.831,"--Well, it's particularly -- I mean, since the franchise is described as having three elements--"
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.831,594.33,Yes or no?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,594.33,596.065,--He can continue taking the other two elements.
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.065,597.282,And there has still been a termination?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,597.282,603.263,"Well, there has been a termination of the franchise, which is defined as having three -- effectively three separate franchise agreements."
2009.08-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,614.209,614.334,"Well, what is the government's--"
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.334,615.597,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,617.832,618.627,--No--
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.627,620.597,--You're saying you can terminate a third of the contract?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,620.597,621.439,--Yes.
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.659,635.793,"And they are not contingent on each other, so that at any time the company could terminate one of them and stick the station owner with the other two?"
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,635.793,643.117,"--Well, one could imagine a situation where the trademark is withdrawn, but you can continue to be a lessee of the premises and market the fuel as an unbranded--"
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.117,643.46,Not continues to be.
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,645.07,645.522,--Yes.
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.773,650.534,That sounds like a very strange way to write the contract.
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,650.534,654.238,"Well, the way Congress wrote the statute was to define the franchise--"
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,654.238,655.751,I'm not talking about writing the statute.
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,656.862,658.126,--Well--
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,658.126,661.389,Do you really think that that's how those contracts should be interpreted?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,661.389,670.168,"--Your Honor, sometimes they are, for very good reasons, written as independent contracts and sometimes they will be dependent contracts, depending on the nature of the relationship between the parties."
2009.08-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,670.168,679.351,"--Well, what is -- what is the difference between your understanding of an implicit termination, which is what I take it you have just been describing, and a constructive termination?"
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,679.351,686.116,I think an implicit termination is one that's objectively viewed as ending the nature of the relationship of the parties.
2009.08-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,708.09,713.526,"So if the franchisor completely refuses to supply gas, that's an implicit termination?"
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,713.526,714.571,That's as good as--
2009.08-240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,714.571,719.117,"But if he charges $1,000 a gallon, that's not a termination?"
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,719.117,719.99,--Right.
2009.08-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,735.921,742.997,"Well, you -- you put forth this dichotomy between breach of contract and constructive termination."
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,745.15,751.588,"Oh, in fact, in order to be constructive termination, something would have to be a breach of contract."
2009.08-240,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,772.611,777.357,"And could you, Mr. Lamken, straighten out what happened in the district court?"
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,789.523,790.431,--Right.
2009.08-240,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,790.431,791.445,The award?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,791.445,793.567,The actual damages here -- the amounts were overlapping.
2009.08-240,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,812.37,812.589,That's a rather significant difference.
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.589,820.01,What does the company have to do in your view to effect a genuine termination and not a constructive termination?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,820.01,836.832,"It may do -- one, issue the notice that's required, say that they are terminating, that this is -- in the words of contract, we are extinguishing the future operations; or they can engage in conduct which an objectively reasonable observer would have to understand gives that exact same message."
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.832,838.829,Why isn't that constructive termination?
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,838.829,839.987,"No, it's--"
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,839.987,843.563,"I mean, the conduct is you stopped sending me the gas you are supposed to send me."
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,843.563,845.014,--It's an actual termination.
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.229,863.508,"Well, I don't understand what your number two consists of unless it consists of an act that the other side would call constructive -- or the government would call constructive termination."
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,863.508,870.613,--I think sometimes there is an unclear line between what some people call an implicit or informal actual termination--
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,870.613,871.128,Yes.
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,871.128,873.971,--and what other people would call a constructive termination.
2009.08-240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.971,875.925,I think there's always an unclear line between those two.
2009.08-240,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,875.925,883.918,"But I don't think -- in the highly unusual case of $1,000 per gallon or things like that, that might be the case."
2009.08-240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,921.965,922.702,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,931.761,943.616,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government agrees with Shell that, because there was no termination or non-renewal in any meaningful sense of the word, the dealers failed to state a claim under the PMPA."
2009.08-240,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,951.704,956.064,When would you -- when would you measure your constructive termination?
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,964.121,971.759,--When the franchisee is actually forced to end one of the statutory elements of the franchise in response to the franchisor's conduct.
2009.08-240,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,977.054,992.765,So you -- you would say that the franchisee in this situation would have had to say: I can't pay the increased amount of rent without the subsidy; I'm going to stop.
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,992.765,994.906,That's correct.
2009.08-240,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,994.906,996.295,I'm going to leave the premises.
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,996.295,997.215,That's correct.
2009.08-240,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1000.308,1003.856,And what about the statutory right for a preliminary injunction?
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1008.181,1009.413,--It--
2009.08-240,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1009.413,1018.581,"Because the preliminary injunction stops the change of a contract price -- of a contract term, obviously, or it continues it."
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1021.643,1040.383,"--If a franchisee is faced with franchisor conduct that will leave the franchisee with no alternative but to abandon a statutory element, then the franchisee in that situation can go in and say that he is in the equivalent position to someone who has received a piece of paper saying: You are hereby terminated."
2009.08-240,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1048.474,1057.721,"--And for -- if for whatever reason the judge says no at the preliminary injunction stage, that's the end of it; the franchisee just has to leave the premises?"
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1057.721,1069.358,"Well, a judge would only deny a preliminary injunction if either there were no serious question going to the merits on the termination question or if the balance of hardships did not tip in the franchisee's favor."
2009.08-240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1080.525,1082.228,"Well, the franchisor stops delivering gas."
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1098.86,1101.204,"Justice Scalia, we -- we agree with Shell on this."
2009.08-240,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1127.303,1138.737,"If the conduct on the part of the franchisor is raising the price of gas, how does the factfinder determine whether it's sufficient to justify a constructive termination?"
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1151.715,1167.632,"The test is, first of all, whether the franchisor's conduct was wrongful -- in other words, in violation of the agreement between the parties; and whether a reasonable franchisee in those circumstances would have no alternative but to do what that franchisee did and to abandon the premises."
2009.08-240,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1167.632,1170.003,But what's a reasonable franchisee in that situation?
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1179.845,1188.09,"Well, it's the same kind of question that juries ask all the time -- juries answer all the time in constructive discharge and constructive eviction cases."
2009.08-240,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1213.221,1217.893,"You are putting a jury in sort of the situation of a -- of a rate regulator, aren't you, if you do that?"
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1217.893,1218.844,--No.
2009.08-240,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1218.844,1219.609,Was it a reasonable rate?
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1219.609,1221.485,No.
2009.08-240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.064,1260.452,"--Up -- up to that point, which supposedly a jury can find, the tipping point where a reasonable franchisee would abandon -- up until then, he has a contract claim, right?"
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1267.183,1269.37,When--
2009.08-240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1269.37,1271.184,Why isn't the contract claim alone enough?
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1271.184,1281.333,"--Well, Justice Scalia, the whole point of the PMPA was that State law remedies were inadequate in that narrow context where the franchisee's very existence was threatened."
2009.08-240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1281.333,1284.177,"""In the context of termination"" is what the statute says."
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1284.177,1293.75,"Yes, and under well-established background principles of the law that Congress was drawing on when it enacted the PMPA, termination was not limited solely to explicit termination."
2009.08-240,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1293.75,1294.592,"Well, what are these--"
2009.08-240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.592,1296.542,What background principles were they?
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1302.54,1306.365,The relationship here is in essence one of landlord and tenant.
2009.08-240,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1317.331,1333.323,"Mr. O'Neil, I thought that there were some cases, landlord-tenant cases, where the tenant is not required to leave the premises because, as awful as the situation is, the tenant has no place to go."
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1333.323,1352.627,"Justice Ginsburg, I am not aware of those cases, and I think the general rule is the one that -- that is -- is broadly stated in the cases, which is that if the franchisee -- excuse me, if the tenant wants to claim constructive eviction, they need to leave the premises."
2009.08-240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1358.153,1373.912,"So what happens -- in other words, suppose the landlord here really wants the guy to clear out, so he puts thumbtacks on the ground and horrible-smelling things all over."
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1386.467,1388.312,"That's exactly right, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1388.312,1399.589,"Now suppose it's the same situation, but this person, the franchisee, being quite indefatigable and daring, finds a way of sneaking through the barbed wire that has been put up."
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1409.366,1410.676,"No, and that's where--"
2009.08-240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1410.676,1411.269,No?
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1411.269,1417.344,"--That's where an objective standard is important, because we don't look to the particularly clever--"
2009.08-240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1417.344,1417.66,Objective?
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1426.78,1428.106,"--That's exactly right, and that's why--"
2009.08-240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1428.106,1434.572,"And suppose he doesn't, though, that he doesn't clear out because he's not sensible, and he just desperately needs the money."
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1434.572,1440.694,"--If the franchisee does not leave, then he does not state a claim for constructive termination."
2009.08-240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.049,1462.281,--What do you do about the claim of -- of the -- the Petitioners that only one of the three contracts has been terminated?
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1462.281,1464.044,"--Well, as I said--"
2009.08-240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1464.044,1467.183,The other two continue -- continue in effect?
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1467.183,1474.853,"--As I said, if one of the three elements of the -- of the statutory franchise has been terminated, then that is a termination under the Act."
2009.08-240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1482.867,1492.472,May I ask you -- we often talk about price adjustments as causing the disputes between the franchisee and the franchisor.
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1500.25,1515.463,"In general, these are open -- open-term price contracts, so that in these -- in these leases, for example, Shell had the right to set the price of fuel using a formula that it formulated in its discretion."
2009.08-240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1515.463,1520.568,"But is the formula required by the contract, or it's just its own discretion to use the formula?"
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1520.568,1523.22,It's just in its discretion to use the formula.
2009.08-240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.22,1523.563,I see.
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1523.563,1524.363,It's an open price term.
2009.08-240,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1535.609,1538.027,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-240,1,21324,david_oneil,,1538.027,1538.152,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-240,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1538.152,1546.275,Mr. Farraher.
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1546.275,1558.924,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case, the jury determined that Shell and Motiva engaged in conduct designed -- prohibited by the PMPA when they raised rent to force dealers out of business and convert their stations to direct operations."
2009.08-240,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1586.899,1590.959,"Now, these Petitioners remained in -- in business, is -- that's right?"
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1590.959,1591.708,Your Honor--
2009.08-240,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1591.708,1593.381,Did they make money during this period?
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1593.381,1594.976,"--Your Honor, some of the Petitioners--"
2009.08-240,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1594.976,1597.207,"All but one remained in business, isn't that correct?"
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1597.207,1600.547,"--Some of the Petitioners remained in business, certainly, post-elimination of the subsidy."
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1603.815,1611.092,"But if they do something reasonably designed -- a reasonable person would clear out, then why not clear out?"
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1611.092,1613.357,"Well, Your Honor, we have to take this in context."
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1625.321,1625.446,So what's the test?
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1625.446,1626.21,"--Pardon me, Your Honor."
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1626.21,1627.193,What's the test?
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1657.008,1664.835,"Justice Breyer, I believe that you hit on two points: First off, what is the test sufficient to invoke a constructive termination?"
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1671.521,1672.8,I wouldn't put it that way.
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1701.43,1703.208,"Well, Your Honor--"
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1703.208,1704.351,So he was still there running the business.
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1706.472,1719.637,"--The test, Your Honor -- first off, with respect to whether the conduct is sufficient to force a termination, we believe the First Circuit's standard of materiality, which is effective to end one of the components of the statutorily defined franchise, is sufficient."
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1726.071,1726.508,No.
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1740.597,1742.426,--Right.
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1742.426,1744.127,The franchisor says: I didn't tell him to leave.
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1768.241,1774.176,"And Your Honor, I'm not sure there's a test for that, but certainly the statute doesn't contemplate that the dealer would have to leave."
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1778.5,1782.314,I need -- the injunctive remedies in the State court?
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1782.314,1784.171,"--They are different, Your Honor."
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1784.171,1784.689,"Yes, all right."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1792.293,1792.871,But that--
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1792.871,1810.817,"So if you -- if you can show me some cases or a test or something where he didn't have to leave, even though the franchisor's conduct was so bad that a reasonable person would have left, then I'm on to something and I know where to go."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1810.817,1817.798,--Your Honor -- and the point is that I don't think the franchisee need necessarily leave as contemplated by the statute.
2009.08-240,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1817.798,1819.311,But Justice Breyer asked you for a test.
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1828.572,1829.278,And that--
2009.08-240,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1829.278,1831.901,I'm quite frankly amazed that you say you don't have a test.
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1831.901,1832.4,--Well--
2009.08-240,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1832.4,1838.944,"You're coming up here and telling us that there's such a thing as a constructive termination, I mean -- but then you don't have a test for it?"
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1838.944,1846.303,"--We do have a test, Your Honor, and the test is whether or not the conduct has effectively eliminated an essential component of one of the three elements of the franchise."
2009.08-240,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1865.654,1867.808,"What does that mean, ""effectively eliminated""?"
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1883.91,1886.129,"--Yes, Your Honor, Justice Alito."
2009.08-240,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1915.445,1923.362,"I know, but could you put that in somewhat more concrete terms, or can you not get any more specific than to say the lease is effectively ended?"
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1923.362,1927.16,--We -- we think that that certainly was a sufficient standard.
2009.08-240,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1941.763,1966.907,"Is there -- is there any area of the law, other than this one, if you are right, in which a termination includes a non-termination; that is, where a constructive termination includes situations where the operation continues?"
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,1966.907,1975.327,"--Your Honor, certainly in our -- in our briefs we have referred to cases where constructive evictions in some settings will allow a tenant to stay in a premises."
2009.08-240,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1987.151,1988.04,I may be incorrect.
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2009.748,2020.277,"--Justice Kennedy, on page 38 of the main brief in the footnote, we've cited two cases in New Jersey that allow for that proposition."
2009.08-240,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2031.475,2038.003,"Can we -- can -- perhaps to bring this to more practical terms, you can walk through with me."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2075.47,2082.856,"--Your Honor, I would -- I would concede that in all likelihood, a franchisor would take some affirmative conduct, whether that be through a notice of termination or other step."
2009.08-240,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2083.808,2095.07,"Or -- or, so that in almost all situations, at least with respect to the leased premises, in a breach of the leased premises, the termination would be -- would have to happen."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2095.07,2096.227,Well--
2009.08-240,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2096.227,2112.033,"So why do we need to make a constructive eviction theory when, on a practical basis, there always in this situation has to be a notice of termination, at least with respect to the premises part?"
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2112.033,2114.921,"--Well, Your Honor, I -- I respectfully disagree."
2009.08-240,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2121.839,2121.98,I know.
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2142.455,2144.218,"That -- that may be true, Your Honor."
2009.08-240,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2164.18,2167.242,But the franchisee could always just stop paying the rent.
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2169.273,2170.537,"That's right, Your Honor."
2009.08-240,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2215.38,2222.937,"And you didn't -- you didn't -- well, you sought an injunction, but Judge Zobel thought it was -- it came much too late."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2222.937,2225.81,"Your Honor, this -- this case has had a -- a long history to it."
2009.08-240,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2278.536,2293.154,Can you explain to me -- the question I brought up before -- what was the difference of the elements between the recovery that the jury gave for constructive termination and for breach of contract?
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2293.154,2302.089,"The damages awarded were precisely the same, and the judge instructed the jury that, in fact, there would be no double recovery for the -- for the dealers here, that they would only recover once."
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2314.037,2325.705,"The problem that -- that I see here is that if in fact you are right, that the -- the franchisor -- he breached the contract in your view."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2370.014,2376.745,"Well, Your Honor, again, the -- the reason that the dealers are coming to Federal court is because Congress enacted a statute to protect them--"
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2376.745,2379.557,"You are going to say they have a right to, but the other side thinks they don't."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2396.893,2397.61,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.61,2399.623,Just saying he goes to State court to get it.
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2399.623,2405.2,--I disagree with the Court that the client is not being deprived of a remedy.
2009.08-240,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2421.882,2423.492,"It's a million dollars, right?"
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2428.691,2431.455,"We -- we -- we do in this case, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-240,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2450.184,2451.229,"Well, you have the option, right?"
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2459.727,2462.46,"--They certainly do, Your Honor."
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2477.546,2478.779,"Well, you have a choice, you know."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2496.663,2497.088,They certainly do.
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2497.088,2498.086,"Or, you have the other choice."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2499.475,2501.162,Your Honor--
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2501.162,2507.924,"Then if you move out, you can sue under Federal law, and you will get all these other things like the extra million dollars or something."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2515.438,2525.309,"--It's -- it's a bad choice, Your Honor, because it puts the dealer in a position of having to determine whether they should abandon their lives' works in order to benefit from a -- from a Federal cause of action."
2009.08-240,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.696,2544.693,"Of course, your -- your approach puts -- puts the company -- the oil company in a very strange position."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2565.106,2576.552,"Your Honor, I think in the -- with -- again, with the injunctive relief available, a court could in the initial stages without the aid of discovery determine whether -- what the parties' obligations are during the course of the litigation."
2009.08-240,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2588.141,2588.941,"Well, I don't know."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2596.637,2601.574,"Well, Your Honor, I think, as a practical matter, that would not have happened during the pendency of the litigation."
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2713.48,2721.148,"The theory of it is to protect the dealer, and the dealer here is faced with a company that says, we are not going to renew your lease."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2761.709,2780.749,"Well, certainly, Your Honor, the language of the statute itself, while the -- while Congress provides for injunctive relief, which would be applicable equally to non-renewal claims as it would to termination claims, and while the statute speaks to notice, again, applicable to both, there is absolutely nothing in the statutory language that says this is a mandatory exhaustion of remedies."
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2782.559,2794.507,"No, but there is a purpose, and the purpose is that this system at least brings a judge in to see if that dealer really does have enough of a claim to get this relaxed injunction."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2805.721,2806.595,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2009.08-240,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2806.595,2810.424,"But you don't have a judge in it, at that stage, under your interpretation."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2810.424,2815.622,"--We think that our case, certainly, is distinguishable from the other two circuits that have addressed the issue."
2009.08-240,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2855.748,2868.258,"Counsel, can I ask you, have you accepted the majority's reasoning in the Dersch case, the Seventh Circuit case, with respect to 2805(f)?"
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2891.701,2893.683,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2009.08-240,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2898.901,2904.82,--The Seventh Circuit said there's no implied right of action under 2805(f).
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2904.82,2931.106,"--The Seventh Circuit, if I understand the case correctly, Your Honor, says that there's no implied cause of action under 2805(f) standing alone, that if a franchisor is insisting upon a term that includes a waiver, as in connection with non-renewal, then the Dersch decision in the Seventh Circuit would say that that might be actionable under 2802(b)(3) because they have introduced a term that is not agreed upon and is designed for the purposes of forcing the dealers out of business."
2009.08-240,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2937.775,2995.831,"Well, I would have thought your strongest argument would have been that, if we have a statutory right not to waive any of our Federal or State rights, if there has been a non-renewal on reasonable terms, there has been a breach of that obligation under the statute, then you had a right to be renewed under reasonable terms, and if they are giving you unreasonable terms -- ""unreasonable"" being defined within the statutory constraints -- they impose conditions that were imposed in bad faith to drive you out; those are the two conditions -- then you had a right to sue for that, non-renewal, because you had a right to renew on reasonable terms."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,2995.831,3002.904,"Your Honor, I appreciate the -- the argument, and, certainly, I -- I think it is supportive of the dealers' claims in this case."
2009.08-240,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3002.904,3006.417,"Well, but why didn't you make the argument in your briefs?"
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,3015.199,3016.338,I think it--
2009.08-240,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3016.338,3017.508,--one that you relied upon?
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,3017.508,3026.831,"--Your Honor, I can't answer, in hindsight, why we didn't raise it in the brief, but I do hear the position that you are advocating and think it is supportive of the -- of the dealers' position here."
2009.08-240,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3032.206,3043.169,"Well, just getting back to the constructive eviction, I took a quick look at the Marini and Ireland case that you cite, and I think the -- the Petitioner is correct."
2009.08-240,2,30301,john_f_farraher_jr,,3078.344,3088.792,"--Your Honor, I -- I guess the -- the best response I have to that proposition is that we are not dealing in a traditional landlord/tenant context here."
2009.08-240,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3127.385,3128.181,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-240,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3131.728,3133.476,Thank you.
2009.08-240,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3155.355,3169.273,"But, Mr. Lamken, isn't it true that the statute, as a whole, expressed Congress's feeling that the common law rules were really not sufficient because, under the common law, of course, they could just non-renew because they wanted to take over the franchise themselves."
2009.08-240,3,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3181.268,3181.814,--Right.
2009.08-240,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3334.527,3335.447,"Thank you, counsel."
