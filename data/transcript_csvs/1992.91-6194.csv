1992.91-6194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.026,"We'll hear argument next in Number 91-6194, Michael Crosby against the United States."
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,56.137,69.376,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-6194,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,88.838,91.181,"Mr. Nyvold, would you speak up just a little bit."
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,98.485,101.109,--Thank you.
1992.91-6194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,109.604,112.006,Why should the advisory committee notes be conclusive?
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,114.056,115.498,--That's true.
1992.91-6194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,131.939,138.114,"Well, you... that's all perfectly legitimate argument, but you said the advisory committee notes are conclusive."
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,138.114,141.376,"I think... I'm sorry, I think I used too strong a word."
1992.91-6194,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.397,192.298,"And you take the position that even if the defendant at the time of arraignment said look, I... I understand my right to be present at trial but I don't want to be, I give up that right and you folks go ahead without me."
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,193.2,198.254,"That's not sufficient for two reasons, or for one reason, that he's not initially present."
1992.91-6194,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.116,217.956,"Well, of course, the practical effect, I suppose, if you are correct here, is that more people ought to be incarcerated pending trial if there's a risk they won't show up."
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,217.956,219.907,Exactly.
1992.91-6194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,241.412,245.772,But is it a situation we want to bring about if we have any choice in the matter?
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,251.068,256.583,--That it would permit a defendant who didn't appear to put off the date of his trial?
1992.91-6194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.583,257.653,Yes.
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,257.653,265.65,"That is the result that the common law permitted, and it's obvious that Rule 43 adopts the common law rule in toto."
1992.91-6194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.65,281.329,"Well, well, I wonder if we should bring to the interpretation of a rule adopted by a rules committee and forwarded to this Court and ultimately put to Congress exactly the same sort of construction materials as we bring to a statute."
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,295.189,298.412,"Oh, certainly the rule did not change the common law rule."
1992.91-6194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,299.884,302.605,"You said... well, then, you and the Government disagree on that."
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,305.537,311.331,"As far as I can tell, the Government says that Rule 43 doesn't address the situation of a defendant not initially present."
1992.91-6194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,320.277,328.962,"But what was the situation at common law before there was... or, say, in this country, before the rule was adopted?"
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,328.962,333.964,A defendant could be tried in his absence only if he initially appeared at the trial.
1992.91-6194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.452,382.398,"Mr. Nyvold, I... am I correct that (b)(2), subsection (b)(2) of Rule 43 was later added?"
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,393.247,395.077,"That was added, yes, sir."
1992.91-6194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.077,395.988,That was a later amendment.
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,395.988,402.614,"In response to Illinois v. Allen, which allows a... the disruptive defendant to be removed from the courtroom after being warned."
1992.91-6194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.614,404.555,"Well, how could we have decided Illinois v. Allen?"
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,404.555,415.18,"Illinois v. Allen was certainly within... or the result in that case, that the defendant who departs or who is disruptive can be removed, that result was clearly within the contemplation of the rule, and here's why."
1992.91-6194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,416.432,417.844,The old rule that didn't have that exception.
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,417.844,419.083,--The old... the old... the old rule.
1992.91-6194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.181,434.443,To say that making a fuss at trial is being voluntarily absent.
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,435.234,439.146,"--Well, the disruptive defendant can be equated to someone who is voluntarily absent."
1992.91-6194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.146,441.379,Only if you want to.
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,442.168,446.923,"Well, as it's... it's not difficult to, or it's certainly within the scope of the language to conclude that--"
1992.91-6194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.923,451.023,"--No, I think... I think that... I mean I have a problem with that as far as your case goes."
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,474.111,477.413,"--Functionally, that's the equivalent of being voluntarily absent."
1992.91-6194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,486.529,497.987,"This doesn't even... even speak to the situation here, and I gather you're saying that it's just like the rule just doesn't speak to a disruptive defendant."
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,497.987,505.262,"My point is that the rule, as it was previously written, permitted the result in Illinois v. Allen."
1992.91-6194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,629.604,634.048,"Well, the... the... the comment went further than the actual rule did itself."
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,634.048,634.749,"--At that time, yes."
1992.91-6194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,647.266,650.368,"Well, that may reflect on the competence of the advisory committee."
1992.91-6194,0,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,650.368,653.56,"Well, they... they were citing the Diaz case, though, in connection with that."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1497.842,1504.477,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-6194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1544.532,1546.983,"Of course, that doesn't always prevent us from ruling the other way."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1546.983,1548.545,--That's correct.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.833,1569.319,"Well, how do you parse down a rule that says shall be present at every stage of the trial except as hereafter provided?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1569.319,1580.426,"We think that... you're referring to subsection (a) of Rule 43, and we think that Rule 43 means that in general the defendant has both a right and a duty to attend all of the criminal proceedings against him."
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.426,1582.569,But it says shall be present.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1582.569,1583.537,That's correct.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1583.537,1585.488,It doesn't say anything about his right.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1588.412,1590.533,It requires him to be present.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.675,1594.424,"Well, it requires."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1596.667,1598.659,It is addressed to the court as well.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1600.599,1601.43,"All right, go ahead."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1601.43,1604.591,--defendant before the court if it is possible to do so.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.472,1607.243,It doesn't say that.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1607.243,1607.934,--to do that.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.934,1609.794,"It doesn't say that, if possible to do so."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1609.794,1610.886,That's right.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.583,1627.688,"Well, it says shall be present except as is provided elsewhere in the rule."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1634.023,1634.581,That's right.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.997,1659.308,"Well, I... arguably, it... it... it deals with it expressly."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1661.671,1662.761,The--
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1662.761,1664.123,It says there are no options.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1664.123,1664.874,--That proviso--
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1664.874,1668.247,"There are no options, that's what it says, shall be required."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1668.247,1674.502,"--Well, that's... that's the part of the rule that has to be read in by negative implication, that the trial should not go forward."
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1677.894,1678.835,It sure is.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1687.461,1690.422,What it doesn't say is or else the trial may not go forward.
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.422,1697.137,"No, but it says... but if he's not present, obviously it can't go forward if he's required to be present at the commencement of the trial."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1697.137,1698.057,"Well, we--"
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1698.057,1700.25,But it also doesn't say he can't shoot the judge.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1701.539,1704.351,--That's right.
1992.91-6194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1719.031,1723.605,What effect do you give to the words except as otherwise provided?
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1733.609,1735.042,"It's... well, that's right."
1992.91-6194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1739.584,1745.698,"But you could make that argument if the phrase, except as otherwise provided by this rule is not present."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1749.481,1751.341,We do give effect to that language.
1992.91-6194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1783.594,1791.729,My point is I take it you could make precisely the same argument if the words except as otherwise provided were absent from subsection (a).
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1791.729,1801.885,"If that except as phrase were missing from 43(a), there could be questions concerning conflicts between subsection (a) and subsection (c)."
1992.91-6194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1848.59,1849.809,"But what I don't understand, Mr. Seamon, is this."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1864.148,1864.859,--That's correct.
1992.91-6194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.859,1867.97,"If that's so, then why is (b) even necessary?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1880.938,1891.267,What Rule 43(b) does is it addresses two specific factual situations in... in... and then specifies what the court's options are in those situations.
1992.91-6194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1891.267,1894.5,Which wouldn't have to be addressed if the... if the prohibition of (a) did not apply to them.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1894.5,1902.225,"It wouldn't have to be addressed, but the reason it was when Rule 43 was adopted was because this Court had addressed those situations."
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.423,1917.406,--was addressed in Illinois against Allen?
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1917.406,1919.757,--That situation--
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.757,1920.518,That was a State case.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1920.518,1921.307,--That's correct.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1921.307,1923.989,And the only thing that was at issue was the... was the Constitution.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1923.989,1924.96,That's right.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.773,1931.444,"Well, the Court didn't address it... address the rule then."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1933.666,1935.675,--That's right.
1992.91-6194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1988.334,1994.936,"Mr. Seamon, can a defendant be arraigned in his absence?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1994.936,2000.649,In... in the... the defendant's presence is required at arraignment under Rule 43(a).
1992.91-6194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2000.649,2005.475,"Well, but how is that different from the requirement for trial?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2014.551,2015.069,That's correct.
1992.91-6194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2020.704,2021.986,At arraignment as well as trial.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2021.986,2022.947,That's correct.
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2022.947,2024.437,"Well you go farther than that, if I understand it."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2027.85,2029.72,That's correct as well.
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.72,2034.324,"So that would mean that, apart from the Constitution and the common law, the judge could just do anything he wanted."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2043.05,2051.726,"Now, what would prevent the judge from doing that are the principles enunciated in this Court's decisions concerning waiver of the right to be present, and as well as--"
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.726,2057.28,"Yeah, but what if he does... there's nothing here that says he must waive, so he just doesn't show up without waiving."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2093.344,2101.389,"--It would be a decent waiver, but the question would still remain whether the trial court should accept that waiver and say we'll go forward in the defendant's absence."
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.389,2102.06,"Well, what... what's your answer?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2103.558,2104.95,That's right.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.582,2112.945,But it doesn't say... it doesn't say what happens if he isn't present.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2112.945,2114.237,--That's correct.
1992.91-6194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2114.237,2116.668,You read it as kind of addressed to the bailiff.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2116.668,2126.015,"We read it as, under the facts of this case, it was addressed to petitioner and... and he violated his duty to show up."
1992.91-6194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2139.383,2147.727,"Do you think that without the rule, the judge could... was... is without power to require the defendant to be present at all stages of the trial, subject to the penalty of contempt?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2147.727,2149.48,No.
1992.91-6194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2158.016,2159.578,And in order to appear subject to contempt.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2159.578,2160.637,That's right.
1992.91-6194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2161.649,2167.192,"So then the rule doesn't really serve a very important purpose at all insofar as it's directed to the defendant, does it?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2167.192,2168.824,--It serves an important purpose.
1992.91-6194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2206.057,2217.905,"Well, there's language in the Diaz opinion, albeit dicta, that suggests that our Court was of the view that the common law thought that a defendant could not waive his presence at the beginning of trial."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2217.905,2225.47,It's... it is correct that Diaz's description of the prevailing rule at that time suggests that.
1992.91-6194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2275.864,2285.461,Was there a proposed amendment of Rule 43 at one time to deal with the absence at the start of trial?
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2285.461,2287.021,"Yes, there was."
1992.91-6194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2293.445,2294.577,And what happened to that?
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2294.577,2296.517,It was... it was never passed.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.919,2298.62,By whom?
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2298.62,2299.549,--are unclear.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.549,2300.13,By whom?
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2300.13,2305.714,"It was never adopted by the advisory committee on the rules of criminal procedure, nor presented to this Court."
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.752,2475.367,"Well, yeah, but you would be... you would be making the same argument if there was just a single witness."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2475.367,2482.589,--But our argument would have less force in that situation because postponing the trial--
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2482.589,2484.032,But you're making the argument and you think you should win it.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2484.032,2485.341,"--Certainly, sir."
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.341,2489.876,"And like, apparently, the Government has won in every case where... in the case... when the issue has come up."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2489.876,2492.296,We've... we've been very successful with the argument.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2492.296,2494.758,And I doubt very much if there were 100 witnesses in all those cases.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2494.758,2496.49,That's right.
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.735,2543.801,"Of course, in at least one of those cases from the other circuits, isn't it a fact that the... although the defendant was not there at the very beginning of the trial, he was there for most of the trial?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2543.801,2545.312,"Yes, that's right."
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.312,2548.034,"That makes it... it's a little different situation, I suppose."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2548.034,2550.205,It... it certainly is different.
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2550.205,2550.826,Yeah.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2550.826,2563.114,"Obviously... and, certainly, the Government prefers to try defendants in their... in their presence, and it... it imposes a great burden on everyone, no matter what a court ultimately decides to do, when a defendant is absent."
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2576.413,2582.256,"Well, has the... the Government always has a... or the Justice Department always has a representative on the advisory committee, doesn't it?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2582.256,2583.668,I believe so.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.668,2590.892,And I suppose if these cases kept coming up and they're... how many courts of appeals have held in your favor?
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2590.892,2591.913,Eight circuits.
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2591.913,2592.745,Eight circuits.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2604.583,2609.785,"Well, we... we didn't think the rule needs fixing, and neither have any of the courts of appeal."
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2612.357,2622.705,"Well, it may not have needed fixing except that all the courts of appeals haven't ruled on it yet, but I... I... I would almost bet that sooner or later they would have to."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2622.705,2624.885,"--Well, that's right."
1992.91-6194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2638.924,2641.145,"Mr. Seamon, have they ever found Mr. Crosby?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2641.145,2643.389,--They did find Mr. Crosby.
1992.91-6194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2647.58,2648.391,"Say it over again, I can't hear."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2648.391,2651.964,He was arrested about 8 months after his trial was scheduled to begin.
1992.91-6194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2651.964,2653.143,I'm sorry.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2654.715,2656.054,Yes.
1992.91-6194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2656.054,2657.196,He was arrested where?
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2657.196,2660.348,He was arrested in Florida about 8 months after the trial started.
1992.91-6194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2660.348,2662.099,So he is in custody now.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2662.099,2665.441,"He is in custody now, and he was sentenced upon his return."
1992.91-6194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2665.441,2674.097,"If you lose this case, apart from this case, to what extent is the Government... Government discomforted?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2674.097,2676.868,"Well, significantly."
1992.91-6194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2705.678,2708.65,"Well, maybe defendants would abscond earlier, hum?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2708.65,2711.114,--Some do.
1992.91-6194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2711.114,2713.084,Or bail would be higher or something.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2713.084,2726.803,"Some do and the... the enhanced risk that defendants would flee before their trial would tend to... to have the Government argue in favor of pretrial detention in more cases, and may well dispose courts to grant those... those requests."
1992.91-6194,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2726.803,2733.707,"And yet here you've sailed along on the face of the language in the rule without any concern, I guess because the courts of appeals have being going your way."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2733.707,2739.701,"The courts of appeal have consistently gone our way since the rule was adopted, and... and--"
1992.91-6194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2739.701,2747.566,It might even be easier for you to argue that... that a pretrial conference is part of the trial and he was present at the pretrial conference.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2747.566,2751.679,--We... we don't think that that's a tenable argument.
1992.91-6194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.174,2760.005,"Plain meaning, I guess, right."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2763.678,2766.059,--That much is clear on the face of Rule 43.
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2767.241,2772.512,"Mr. Seamon, do you happen to know... I don't know the answer to this... what the practice in most State courts is?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2772.512,2775.805,Most State courts have rules very similar to Rule 43.
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2775.805,2778.306,"What do they do when the... in facts like this, do you know?"
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2778.306,2800.791,"In facts like this, the majority of them... although not all of them... do the same thing that the Eighth Circuit did here, which is to first make an inquiry to determine if the defendant really has absconded and is voluntarily away and the, as a second point, looking to whether, in fact, the trial can be postponed or rescheduled or it needs to go forward because of the witnesses or because of codefendants, and that sort of thing."
1992.91-6194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2800.791,2801.512,Thank you.
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2801.512,2805.075,If there are no other questions.
1992.91-6194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2805.075,2807.356,"Thank you, Mr. Seamon."
1992.91-6194,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2807.356,2807.866,Thank you.
1992.91-6194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2807.866,2809.666,"Mr. Nyvold, you have 5 minutes remaining."
1992.91-6194,2,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,2809.666,2810.518,Thank you.
1992.91-6194,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2851.914,2853.804,"Well, I don't understand."
1992.91-6194,2,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,2856.957,2871.947,"Well, the prosecutor... when the question arose, let's think about trying Mr. Crosby in absentia, the prosecutor got out the rule and her comment was, quote: The rule appears to require that the defendant be there at the beginning of the trial and that you proceed if he takes off, and that is usually the way it happens."
1992.91-6194,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2872.949,2880.182,"Well, but... but, in fairness, the Government goes on to say: But the cases indicate you can proceed against him in his absence even if he's not there at the outset of the trial."
1992.91-6194,2,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,2880.182,2887.959,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy, that was the point I was making, that the Government went on to urge the cases, or to cite the cases in the circuits that permit the--"
1992.91-6194,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2887.959,2891.859,"Well, I assume the Government was saying that this is the way the rule has been interpreted by the courts."
1992.91-6194,2,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,2891.859,2897.375,"--Well, the plain reading, or the reading the prosecutor was giving it was not the one the Government is giving it now."
1992.91-6194,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.848,2909.663,"Well, he was... but he did... he did point out that apparently the courts of appeals knew more about the rule than he did."
1992.91-6194,2,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,2909.663,2916.867,"No, the prosecutor then cited the cases or went on to urge that the cases indicate you can proceed... proceed against him."
1992.91-6194,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3067.999,3083.209,"The arraignment, though... if the defendant absconds before he's arraigned, the State has not marshaled the witnesses and that sort of thing for the arraignment the way they would have for the trial, so the... the amount of inconvenience is considerably different."
1992.91-6194,2,36406,mark_d_nyvold,,3083.209,3084.178,--That's true.
1992.91-6194,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3095.556,3096.537,"Thank you, Mr. Nyvold."
