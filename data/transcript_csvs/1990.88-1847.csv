1990.88-1847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.24,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-1847, Ford Motor Credit Company v. Department of Revenue of the State of Florida."
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,35.914,47.183,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.88-1847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.912,139.664,Have we previously extended the internal consistency test to property taxes?
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,139.664,146.628,"Well, the answer to that is slightly involved in this sense."
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,222.794,223.094,Mr.--
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,230.47,232.841,"No, we don't see it that way."
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,267.388,268.59,But you are not a domiciliary.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,268.59,269.281,"--No, we're not."
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,274.677,274.817,And the--
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,274.817,279.672,"--imposes applies only to nondomiciliaries, just like the West Virginia wholesaling tax, but only--"
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,279.672,294.0,"--But just focusing on this for a moment, if they, if they collected... what... would it not be complete relief here to say they cannot collect taxes from domiciliaries except to the extent that the debts have a situs in Florida?"
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,294.0,298.622,"--I think, one, that would be one solution to the--"
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,298.622,301.226,And do you have standing to insist that that be done?
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,301.226,302.535,--We think we do.
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,302.535,306.489,Are you prejudiced at all by the fact that domiciliaries may pay more taxes than you do?
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,306.489,312.364,"The question, Justice Stevens, is the interaction of this two elements of the tax."
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,312.554,317.589,"Well, I understand, but are you prejudiced at all by the fact that Florida domiciliaries may pay a higher tax than you do?"
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,321.821,326.365,"--Well, the discrimination as we see it really isn't... is really interstate commerce versus intrastate commerce."
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,326.365,332.409,"Well, but you are not prejudiced by the fact that Florida domiciliaries must pay a higher tax than you do, theoretically, are you?"
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,332.409,336.172,"Well, I... I can't answer that question no."
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,340.726,343.989,You're hurt by the possibility you might be taxed in Michigan as a domiciliary.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,343.989,344.83,--No.
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,363.473,363.613,I don't understand.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,367.807,372.382,"They are paying taxes, but only under the... only under the concept of a domiciliary tax."
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,385.891,388.803,But the tax is just the same as your tax.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,388.803,393.408,"--Well, let me try to... let me just try to draw the parallel to Armco, because we don't think there is any distinction in principle--"
1990.88-1847,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,393.408,396.209,"Well, I'd like to understand it without reference to precedents, is just how this whole thing hurts you."
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,397.1,399.862,"--Well, let me... let me present it this way."
1990.88-1847,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,404.054,405.636,That you might be taxed in Michigan as a domiciliary.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,405.636,405.996,--That is correct.
1990.88-1847,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.996,406.807,"That's the whole case, isn't it?"
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,406.807,408.559,"Well, I think that's, that's a part of it."
1990.88-1847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,445.385,453.8,"And you, I suppose you say that's a... you're permitted to raise this issue by the internal consistency rule?"
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,453.8,453.99,Precisely.
1990.88-1847,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.428,486.453,"The problem is that the whole, the whole internal consistency test is based upon prospective damage and not actual damage, isn't it?"
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,486.453,486.573,It is.
1990.88-1847,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.865,495.9,"Because it doesn't matter whether you are actually being taxed twice, it's the theoretical possibility of your being taxed twice that causes us to apply the test."
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,495.9,496.431,--That's correct.
1990.88-1847,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.431,502.485,"So it's sort of hard to get upset about potentiality as a basis for standing, if you are going to apply that kind of a test."
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,502.485,511.32,"Well, I think, Justice Scalia, there is, although I know some members of the Court don't necessarily agree, there is good reason for viewing the test as a hypothetical test."
1990.88-1847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,530.334,532.585,Which would suffice the Court for 180 years.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,532.585,536.057,"Well, I... Justice, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not sure that's correct."
1990.88-1847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,550.809,563.137,"Well, I... you certainly can cite language in the Pullman Palace-Car, but to say that was the precise rationale of the decision was the... an internal consistency... I think pushes the language a little far."
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,563.137,565.919,"We don't say it was the whole rationale of the case, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.88-1847,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.701,662.827,It sounds like a good argument against the internal consistency rule.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,662.827,667.109,"No, it's a good argument in favor of the internal consistency test, Justice White, because none of this becomes necessary."
1990.88-1847,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.23,740.148,"Well, it wasn't until the last decade that we somehow found it necessary to explicitly adopt it in order to prevent all of these horribles."
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,740.148,741.159,"Well, I think it was--"
1990.88-1847,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.159,746.722,Somehow we stumbled along for 190 years without... without this great disaster.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,746.722,763.675,"--Well, I think what the Court stumbled along with was an internal consistency analysis without the label on it, because the cases repeatedly reflect the Court assuming, for the sake of consideration of a tax, that other States might, in fact probably will, adopt the same tax if it's approved."
1990.88-1847,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.675,780.667,"You cited a few cases in which we had language that could be interpreted to be the internal consistencies test, but failed to cite dozens of cases in which we make no mention of it, where it would have been relevant to an analysis of the decision if... if indeed we thought it to be the law."
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,780.667,782.067,"Well, there are very... Justice Scalia--"
1990.88-1847,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,782.067,783.369,One swallow doesn't make a spring.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,784.271,788.985,"--Well, that may be right, but there... there are no cases that the State has cited that took a contrary position."
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.542,815.714,"--Mr. Evans, can we go back to the Armco case?"
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,827.394,827.902,That is right.
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,827.902,829.364,That's not like this.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,829.364,830.945,"We think it is, Justice Stevens."
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,831.546,835.329,What of... which one of your competitors does not have to pay a tax you have to pay?
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,835.329,838.812,--Any one of our local Florida competitors does not pay our tax.
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.286,849.841,But it... doesn't it pay the... doesn't it pay a tax at the same rate on all its commercial paper the way you do?
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,861.67,870.636,"--Well, insofar as we're dealing with intangibles that are... that have a Florida business situs, it looks like they are paying the same thing."
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,878.544,878.724,Right.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,878.724,881.805,"That in fact they are paying the same thing, on the same kind of basis."
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.09,891.452,"One was paying on manufacture, and the other was paying on wholesale receipts."
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,894.534,896.056,"--Well, the--"
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.056,897.637,Which has a situs in Florida.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,897.637,901.19,"--Well, but the question is whether domicile and business situs are the same thing."
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.339,906.122,"Well, but the tax... the intangibles being taxed are the same, aren't they?"
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,908.125,926.348,"--Well, the difference is, and this may come back to your earlier point, the difference is that in looking at a competitive market in Florida, Ford, because it's an out-of-state domiciliary, carries baggage, which is that risk that it might be subjected to another... another tax during the life of that receivable--"
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,926.348,926.895,--Yeah.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,926.895,929.419,--sometime by another State.
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,932.043,945.912,But in the... but in this case your concern would be satisfied if there was an injunction by the district court in effect saying do not levy this tax or a comparable tax against domiciliaries to the extent they have out-of-state business.
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,954.997,957.009,"That was true, I think, in Tyler Pipe, and it was also true in Armco."
1990.88-1847,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.261,958.391,"Well, I'm not sure."
1990.88-1847,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,958.391,967.838,--that one of the choices that the Florida legislature could make in order to make its statute internally consistent is that it would still wind up taxing us the way it does now.
1990.88-1847,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1172.041,1173.664,"Very well, Mr. Evans."
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1175.357,1189.194,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.88-1847,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1313.829,1325.995,"Well, I think... I suppose you would argue then if Michigan had exactly the same scheme as Florida, that both... both States' tax laws would be valid?"
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1325.995,1331.411,"Well, we would in fact make such an argument based on the Due Process Clause cases."
1990.88-1847,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1333.451,1339.157,Because you think the domiciliary basis for taxation is perfectly valid.
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1339.157,1346.381,"--That there is an additional basis for taxation provided by domicile, as the Court has recognized, that goes beyond the usual situs basis."
1990.88-1847,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1372.199,1376.841,"But, Mr. Farr, why can't we do that with companies, like in Armco, that have only one manufacturing plant?"
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1376.841,1380.514,"What I am looking at, I think, Justice Stevens, is the general run of cases."
1990.88-1847,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1386.177,1395.623,"Yeah, but most taxpayers don't have plants in 49 States, and if you look at the general run of Florida out-of-state companies, presumably there is one from each of the 49 other States."
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1400.037,1400.987,But you can be assured--
1990.88-1847,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.987,1402.499,"You can do it for each one, one at a time."
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1402.499,1402.639,--Right.
1990.88-1847,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1438.387,1442.271,Is it perfectly clear that the domiciliary State would be Michigan and not Delaware?
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1442.271,1448.465,"There has been no argument about it in this particular case, Your Honor, and I don't think it would make any difference."
1990.88-1847,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1449.085,1451.178,Except it makes it two you have to look at instead of one.
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1451.178,1453.139,--It might in a possible case.
1990.88-1847,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.139,1453.299,Yeah.
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1453.299,1465.827,"I mean there is, frankly, I think there's a question after Wheeling Steel v. Fox whether a domiciliary State which bases its claim to domicile solely on incorporation would in fact be able to tax."
1990.88-1847,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1469.32,1492.387,"Under your view, Mr. Farr, if Michigan had a tax and Ford could show double taxation in this case, and if the Court, when it went on to say that this was a violation of the Commerce Clause, would the tax then be invalid just as Ford, so that companies that came from States that did not have the domiciliary tax would still have to pay the tax?"
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1496.96,1507.287,"The suggestion I am making, I believe, Justice Kennedy, is that in this kind of situation for this type of claim, that really the tax should be looked at as applied to a particular taxpayer."
1990.88-1847,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1519.886,1523.389,Do we have examples in our jurisprudence where this approach has been followed?
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1523.389,1535.087,"Well, there are certainly examples where the Court has said, for example in Northwestern States Cement, which is 358 U.S., the Court says we are not going to look at a hypothetical claim."
1990.88-1847,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.533,1722.501,"Mr. Farr, the test you propose really ends up, doesn't it, to create all sorts of odd incentives for companies to do business in some States or not?"
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1740.206,1745.468,"Your Honor, I hate to interrupt your question, but I don't concede that one or the other would have to be disallowed."
1990.88-1847,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.244,1761.018,"Oh, you're not even acknowledging that when there are two taxes levied it would be invalid?"
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1767.893,1774.008,Then you would have to decide the issue as to whether both taxes could legitimately be sustained.
1990.88-1847,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.008,1774.679,"--Oh, I see."
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1774.679,1777.902,"That, that is the approach the Court took in cases like Curry v. McCanless."
1990.88-1847,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1777.902,1778.042,"Oh, I see."
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1783.735,1785.897,I would argue that both are valid.
1990.88-1847,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.897,1786.477,That's what I thought you said a while ago.
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1786.477,1787.027,"That's correct, Justice White."
1990.88-1847,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.626,1799.084,I see.
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1799.084,1803.268,"--benefits that the Court has recognized the State gives, that it could indeed have extra taxing power."
1990.88-1847,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.459,1834.672,"Well, I suppose that if Michigan had a tax like Florida's on domiciliaries, it would certainly be... it certainly would put a... it certainly would deter, I suppose, a domiciliary in Michigan from doing business in Florida or any other State that had a tax like that."
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1834.672,1839.394,In the sense that it would then be subject to double taxation.
1990.88-1847,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1839.394,1839.524,"Why, yes, yes."
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1847.308,1850.801,"Your Honor, I think that is a possibility."
1990.88-1847,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.105,1868.395,And never got a fall.
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1868.395,1868.945,--I'm sorry?
1990.88-1847,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.945,1870.618,And never pinned.
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1873.551,1887.838,"Well, it came closer to pinning at the end, I think, when it made its second reversal, if I can continue the wrestling metaphor, to say that in fact there was a legitimacy to double taxation of intangibles by both the domiciliary State and the situs State."
1990.88-1847,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1887.838,1891.0,"Mr. Farr, can I suggest a problem with your approach?"
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1911.387,1912.747,"No, I would not make the same argument."
1990.88-1847,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1921.235,1921.385,I see.
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1926.37,1926.5,--That's correct.
1990.88-1847,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2046.212,2051.377,"--Mr. Farr, are there any Florida cases pending in which a Florida domiciliary has challenged this tax?"
1990.88-1847,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2051.377,2052.856,"Not to my knowledge, Justice Stevens."
1990.88-1847,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2140.026,2142.888,"Very well, Mr. Farr."
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2144.198,2152.395,Let me just start where Mr. Farr left off on credits.
1990.88-1847,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2220.858,2233.575,"Counsel, is it possible to speculate that these intangibles are included in some overall tax schemes of other States, general property tax?"
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2233.575,2234.627,"Well, I think there--"
1990.88-1847,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2234.627,2240.48,And so that it would follow from that that Michigan has foregone... has foregone to levy on these in lieu of its tax?
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2240.48,2242.901,"--Well, I think to a certain extent that may be, that may be right."
1990.88-1847,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2415.081,2415.301,Where is this?
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2415.301,2415.862,--I'm--
1990.88-1847,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2415.862,2416.153,Where is this from?
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2416.153,2416.944,--I'm sorry.
1990.88-1847,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.005,2450.209,"Let me, let me ask you, supposing we're talking about tangibles instead of intangibles--"
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2450.209,2450.359,--Yes.
1990.88-1847,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2450.359,2451.16,--talking about real estate.
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2458.847,2459.237,No.
1990.88-1847,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.237,2460.196,He could not?
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2460.196,2462.079,Oh... by Florida.
1990.88-1847,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2462.079,2462.53,By Florida.
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2462.53,2462.94,No.
1990.88-1847,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.231,2465.534,It could not be taxed on its out-of-state wealth.
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2465.534,2468.526,"That would be... I mean, I think that's pretty settled in the Court's decisions."
1990.88-1847,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2472.009,2477.174,"Mr. Evans, several of us don't seem to have the reply brief here on the bench."
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2479.557,2489.492,"This was Chief Justice Stone's dissenting opinion in Northwest Airlines, which is in 332 U.S., and the quote I was reading to you was at page 318."
1990.88-1847,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2508.826,2510.638,This was 332 U.S.?
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2510.638,2512.419,"332 U.S., and this was at page--"
1990.88-1847,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2512.419,2513.491,Chief Justice Stone?
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2513.491,2515.271,--Chief Justice Stone.
1990.88-1847,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2515.271,2515.701,I thought he was dead by then.
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2515.701,2519.554,"Well, I think the citation is--"
1990.88-1847,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.554,2520.744,Okay... we can check it out.
1990.88-1847,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2520.744,2522.136,--I will double check it.
