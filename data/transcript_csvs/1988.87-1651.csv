1988.87-1651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We'll hear argument now in No. 87-1651, Massachusetts v. Douglas Oakes."
1988.87-1651,0,32848,james_m_shannon,,13.474,16.426,"Thank You, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-1651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,71.762,78.166,"Just so I get it straight, you talk about overbreadth."
1988.87-1651,0,32848,james_m_shannon,,87.188,100.062,"It... it is our position, Your Honor, that although the court below specifically did not react the question as to whether the Respondent's activity was protected or not... it is position that it was clearly not protected."
1988.87-1651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,100.062,101.947,And it certainly wasn't under the statute.
1988.87-1651,0,32848,james_m_shannon,,103.164,103.447,It--
1988.87-1651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,103.447,105.899,"I mean, the statute would certainly forbid it."
1988.87-1651,0,32848,james_m_shannon,,105.899,106.866,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1988.87-1651,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,108.951,112.57,And you say that it's... it could constitutionally do that.
1988.87-1651,0,32848,james_m_shannon,,112.57,113.339,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1651,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.339,114.155,xxx--
1988.87-1651,0,32848,james_m_shannon,,121.409,122.195,"It has, Your Honor."
1988.87-1651,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.195,125.48,To add a lasciviousness requirement?
1988.87-1651,0,32848,james_m_shannon,,125.48,130.967,There is a requirement now of lascivious intent which didn't exist prior to the Supreme Judicial Court's decision.
1988.87-1651,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.967,144.274,"And I gather, would you think that the defendant in this case would have been subject to prosecution and he could be found guilty under the new statute as amended?"
1988.87-1651,0,32848,james_m_shannon,,144.274,156.932,"I think that the defendant in this case, Your Honor, could have been prosecuted under the nude statute... the new statute because the definition of lascivious intent in that statute includes inappropriate attire and... and suggestive poses."
1988.87-1651,1,40674,richard_j_vita,,1558.815,1561.565,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1651,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1626.591,1628.61,"Well, what's the purpose of the overbreadth?"
1988.87-1651,1,40674,richard_j_vita,,1635.446,1636.081,--Yes.
1988.87-1651,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1636.081,1637.298,Is that the purpose of it?
1988.87-1651,1,40674,richard_j_vita,,1637.298,1639.433,I believe that that is one of the central purposes--
1988.87-1651,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1639.433,1650.206,"Well, if that statute isn't on the books anymore, as Justice Scalia has suggested, why should we hold it... hold anything invalid under overbreadth analysis?"
1988.87-1651,1,40674,richard_j_vita,,1655.277,1657.062,--The original statute--
1988.87-1651,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1657.062,1657.829,Yes.
1988.87-1651,1,40674,richard_j_vita,,1657.829,1658.795,--under which Mr. Oakes--
1988.87-1651,2,32848,james_m_shannon,,3270.982,3274.267,"Your Honor, unless the Court has further questions, I have nothing further to add."
1988.87-1651,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.267,3274.734,Very well.
1988.87-1651,2,32848,james_m_shannon,,3283.707,3292.062,"It... the old statute can be used, Your Honor, to prosecute those activities which took place prior to the enactment date of the... of the... of the new statute."
1988.87-1651,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3292.062,3297.797,"So that if we were to reverse, as you ask us to, that would revive some prosecutions or potential--"
1988.87-1651,2,32848,james_m_shannon,,3297.797,3298.547,"Yes, Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3298.547,3299.063,--Thank you.
1988.87-1651,2,32848,james_m_shannon,,3305.217,3309.502,Any... any acts that would be prosecuted under the old statute have already... have already taken place.
1988.87-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3309.502,3315.656,And it doesn't seem to me like the old statute would be any basis whatsoever for a finding of overbreadth.
1988.87-1651,2,32848,james_m_shannon,,3329.582,3332.784,"The... the old statute, of course, Your Honor, did not have a lascivious intent requirement which--"
1988.87-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3332.784,3336.069,"I... I know that, but it's gone."
1988.87-1651,2,32848,james_m_shannon,,3336.069,3337.771,--Except for purposes of prosecution.
1988.87-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3337.771,3338.754,"Yes, but the reason for overbreadth is--"
1988.87-1651,2,32848,james_m_shannon,,3338.754,3339.138,Yes.
1988.87-1651,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3339.138,3346.96,--the state has to get rid of its... its price for having the statute unnarrowed is you can't prosecuted anybody.
1988.87-1651,2,32848,james_m_shannon,,3348.944,3351.512,The old statute will have no chilling effect on future conduct.
1988.87-1651,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3352.429,3355.65,Was the old statute repealed?
1988.87-1651,2,32848,james_m_shannon,,3355.65,3361.554,It was... it was reenacted.
1988.87-1651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3387.752,3388.668,"Thank you, General Shannon."
