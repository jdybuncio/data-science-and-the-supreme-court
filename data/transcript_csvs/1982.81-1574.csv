1982.81-1574,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.59,"We will hear arguments next in Local 926, International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO, against Jones."
1982.81-1574,0,34498,laurence_gold,,108.141,133.211,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the procedural history of this case is set out at Pages 2 through 6 of our brief, the blue brief, and I will very briefly summarize that history."
1982.81-1574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,198.793,209.649,"Mr. Gold, is it possible to tell from that letter whether or not he took his action on the basis of no evidence, or that it was the type of thing that the board didn't go into?"
1982.81-1574,0,34498,laurence_gold,,209.649,282.086,"--It appears to us from the language he used that he found the evidence insufficient to find that the union had caused the discharge, that he found the evidence insufficient to find that the union had restrained or coerced the employer, that he found that the union had participated in discussions with the employer concerning who should be a supervisor on this job, and all of these questions are of the very essence of Section 8(b)(1), and what is designedly left unregulated and is permitted by Section 8(b)(1) so that it would be our view that he was not taking the position, this is none of our business, but rather, was taking the position that this was not the type of activity which warranted the issuance of a complaint."
1982.81-1574,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,282.086,287.257,"Was review available to Jones, of course?"
1982.81-1574,0,34498,laurence_gold,,287.257,289.445,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1574,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,338.954,341.516,Does he have any other relief than that?
1982.81-1574,0,34498,laurence_gold,,341.516,348.075,The... I think the short answer under the decisions is no.
1982.81-1574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,638.177,648.858,"Mr. Gold, as between you and Ms. Stillman, have you divided up the responsibility for talking about the particular sections of the Act and whether conduct was pre-empted?"
1982.81-1574,0,34498,laurence_gold,,648.858,649.923,Yes.
1982.81-1574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,674.069,676.272,Let me know when you are ready for questions.
1982.81-1574,0,34498,laurence_gold,,676.272,677.442,"--Any time, Your Honor."
1982.81-1574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,677.442,678.3,Okay.
1982.81-1574,0,34498,laurence_gold,,678.3,725.702,"Ms. Stillman was going to develop what the exact nature of the Labor Board's regulation, scheme of regulation is in this area, because one prong of our argument is that this is an area where there is a substantial body of Labor Board regulation, and therefore even if one assumes that we look only at the arguably prohibited aspect of Garman, this is, as Perko holds, an area where the particular system of procedures, rules, and remedies stated in the Labor Act pre-empts state law."
1982.81-1574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,725.702,732.234,"Well, I will ask you, and you tell me if I should ask Mrs. Stillman rather than you."
1982.81-1574,0,34498,laurence_gold,,749.631,755.861,"Well, the 8(b)(1) has two parts."
1982.81-1574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,801.002,807.748,"Are there two different lines for that Board rule, one being if it can happen to him, it can happen to me, that type of thing?"
1982.81-1574,0,34498,laurence_gold,,811.796,828.272,"Not from that aspect so far as we can tell, because they cited and reaffirmed Taladiga Cotton, which this Court relied on in Perko, and which is part and parcel--"
1982.81-1574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,828.272,838.441,"But the reason they withdrew at least a little in Parker Robb, isn't it the feeling that they were really putting an end run around the exemption of supervisors in the Act if they went further?"
1982.81-1574,0,34498,laurence_gold,,838.441,861.07,"--We can hardly say that we want the Board to push further and further into this area, but the discussion we are having certainly demonstrates that this is arguably prohibited."
1982.81-1574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,861.07,877.548,"Yes, certainly arguably, but do you think that your best case is on arguably, that if we were to take it on ourselves to decide, is this in fact prohibited, and we came to the conclusion, no, it is not in fact prohibited, that you would then have to rely on the arguably prohibited aspect?"
1982.81-1574,0,34498,laurence_gold,,877.548,937.134,"Well, our view is, and this is the one point I do want to stress before I allow Ms. Stillman her time, that in the area of the extent to which unions can have an impact on supervisors' employment rights, the logic of the entire Act is, as shown by the use of the words 1947 debates on the status of supervisors, is that employers should have very substantial protections in being able to make whatever judgments they want on how they treat supervisors."
1982.81-1574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1038.358,1041.683,"Well, as you see it, then, there are three bright squares in this area."
1982.81-1574,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1048.839,1072.938,"Yes, and whenever a state tort action focuses on precisely the same facts and circumstances that the board would consider in determining which of those boxes to put alleged conduct, then the state action is pre-empted."
1982.81-1574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.938,1075.672,"Well, of course, does that fully explain our Sears decision?"
1982.81-1574,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1081.607,1101.49,"In Sears, there was an added factor which is not here, namely, the consideration that there was no way to secure the... a board determination or a general counsel's determination."
1982.81-1574,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1143.191,1152.952,Mrs. Stillman.
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1152.952,1175.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is the board's position that the trial court judge in this case did exactly the right thing in finding that the complaint, the state action was pre-empted in dismissing the complaint, because, as he said, I am being asked to take a second look at the same matter that the board has looked at here, and in fact has resolved in manners displeasing to the plaintiff."
1982.81-1574,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1212.973,1215.816,"Well, the superior court dismissed the employer, didn't they--"
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1215.816,1216.799,Yes.
1982.81-1574,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1216.799,1219.439,"--saying that under any theory, you couldn't hold the employer liable."
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1219.439,1232.748,"He is totally free to do what... and that raises the interesting question, Justice Rehnquist, of what happens if an employer wanting to make a decision about a supervisor calls in the union and asks for the union's advice."
1982.81-1574,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1242.243,1249.913,"Well, I suppose other than whatever prohibitions may be placed on it by conflicting federal law, Georgia is free to fashion its tort law--"
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1249.913,1250.428,"Yes, yes, yes."
1982.81-1574,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1250.428,1251.286,--and malicious interference--
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1251.286,1285.648,"But it does seem to us that elements critical to the Georgia tort are also resolved by the board in considering 8(b)(1)(A) and 8(b)(1)(B) and in fact were resolved by the regional director in this case, and I would like here... first let me say our brief addresses mainly 8(b)(1)(B), because it is quite clear that when the regional director said, this union did not coerce the company, that they should not be able to go over to the state court then and say that they coerced the company."
1982.81-1574,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1291.989,1318.51,"--Are you saying that... so supposing that the regional director were to make a finding, a mistaken finding as it turned out, in an area which wasn't even... which wasn't designedly left free, wasn't in fact prohibited, and wasn't arguably prohibited, but he was just sticking his nose into things that the board really wouldn't have authorized him to go ahead with, and he made a finding on some facts that were never appealed."
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1318.51,1322.537,"Well, that is not present here, because the finding that he did make is relevant to this case."
1982.81-1574,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1322.537,1323.211,Yes.
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1323.211,1326.331,I suppose if he was on a complete frolic and detour--
1982.81-1574,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1326.331,1330.957,"So it isn't a type of res judicata or collateral estoppel charge, is it?"
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1330.957,1336.237,"--Well, that's... but that's embodied to some extent in, I think, the policy reasons here."
1982.81-1574,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1450.519,1453.596,"That wouldn't be true as to Mr. Jones, at least in the facts here."
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1457.78,1465.981,"Your Honor, we are going on the complaint here, and I don't know what those facts might be."
1982.81-1574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1604.939,1606.031,"May I ask you one question, Ms. Stillman?"
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1624.683,1625.821,It's--
1982.81-1574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1625.821,1627.541,What would the board's view be?
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1627.541,1631.539,"--I am reluctant to commit the board, but I would say that this particular rationale I have given you for the construction industry--"
1982.81-1574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.539,1632.194,That wouldn't apply.
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1632.194,1636.819,"--the board has not applied that theory outside the construction industry, so far as I know."
1982.81-1574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1649.718,1661.105,"What I understand you to be saying is, you would not contend for pre-emption if the theory of the charge were an interference with the employer's right to select his supervisors for his own bargaining representatives."
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1661.105,1661.76,Excuse me?
1982.81-1574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1662.493,1675.599,Your theory would not apply if the theory of the... of the charge before the labor board had been based on a claim that there was an interference with the employer's right to pick his own bargaining--
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1675.599,1676.676,"--Yes, the 8(b)(1)(A) theory would not apply."
1982.81-1574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.676,1677.081,--Yes.
1982.81-1574,1,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,1677.081,1684.908,"8(b)(1)(B) would still be active here, and the whole problem of whether there is a Congressional scheme that is being unbalanced by what the state court is doing."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,1802.891,1809.995,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I would like to address myself very briefly to the jurisdictional issue."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.237,1909.89,"I would suppose you would argue that even if the Georgia court might be wrong, it nevertheless only erroneously applied settled principles."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,1909.89,1911.311,I believe that is correct.
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.311,1914.935,And that we don't usually... just take cases to correct error.
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,1914.935,1916.685,"I believe that is correct, Justice White."
1982.81-1574,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1974.426,1982.127,"Well, that is sort of a strange doctrine of exhaustion of remedies, that you have to exhaust your federal remedies before you can go to the state courts."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,1982.127,2001.885,"Well, yes, Justice Rehnquist, it is a strange doctrine, but it flows from the federal labor policy that they don't want two forums, a federal and a state forum, looking at the same facts where there are potential conflicting decisions."
1982.81-1574,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2009.974,2015.534,"Well, to say that the federal agency dropped out and the federal interests dropped out are really two different things."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2038.65,2045.225,"--Well, the federal interest that is involved here is the protection of certain persons under the Act, namely, employees."
1982.81-1574,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2062.048,2064.703,"Well, unions are protected by the Act, too."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2064.703,2069.278,"Yes, sir, but not in... we are talking here of a union unfair labor practice, so I have limited it to that--"
1982.81-1574,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.278,2070.093,"Oh, I see."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2070.842,2071.934,--Yes.
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.934,2077.618,"Well, do you think... Suppose a state had a labor law."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2092.831,2099.203,"If they are mirror Acts of each other, he can't... the supervisor in that instance--"
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.203,2100.404,Why not?
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2102.842,2110.009,"--Well, does the state act protect supervisors, I guess would be the real criterion."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2112.93,2121.785,"Well, no, but then your... I don't want to get off on the supervisor ground, because that isn't the ground the general counsel dealt with."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2143.373,2144.902,--I think the state board--
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2144.902,2145.339,Why not?
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2148.166,2153.258,"--Yes, sir, but the state law would be precluded there by Section 14(a)."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.258,2153.522,Why?
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2153.522,2155.242,Because of Section 14(a) of the Act.
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.242,2155.664,Why?
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2156.615,2163.942,14(a) says that no national or local law relating to collective bargaining will make supervisors to be treated as employees.
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.942,2164.488,"Well, I know."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2183.308,2189.228,"No, sir, but in Georgia, with the same facts here, you've made him an employee now."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.228,2189.992,Yes.
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2189.992,2191.54,And the union has interfered here.
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.788,2196.41,"Arguably they've interfered, but the board has decided he didn't."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2196.41,2200.941,--But it would have never gotten to the board because of the state right to work law.
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2211.438,2218.684,"Well, yes, but the... but the board has rejected the charge, said the union had nothing to do with getting him fired."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2218.684,2222.822,--But that's not the board's area where it should be looking.
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.368,2229.197,"Well, all right."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2233.148,2249.673,"Well, it is the plaintiff's position that the fundamental issue in this case is not whether pre-emption took place, but whether an unfair labor practice proceeding is a supervisor's exclusive forum to seek relief from union interference."
1982.81-1574,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2472.596,2479.373,"Are you suggesting that had the regional director investigated further, he would have uncovered evidence?"
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2479.373,2488.838,"We have pursued it further in the state court, and we haven't come up with any further evidence, so the answer I don't believe is no... I believe is no."
1982.81-1574,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2488.838,2494.492,"Well, then, what did you do, just file a complaint and figure that you might come up with some evidence later, and you haven't come up with it?"
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2494.492,2502.818,"Well, in taking the depositions, which are not in the record, of some of the management officials, they vehemently denied that they were coerced."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.269,2506.066,"You don't have to prove coercion, do you?"
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2506.066,2509.127,"--No, we don't have to prove coercion in the state plan."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.127,2511.298,But it was necessary to prove that in the federal--
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2511.298,2512.53,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2512.53,2514.671,--But you don't have to prove coercion.
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2516.184,2519.495,"Exactly right, and that brings us to Paragraph 6 in our complaint."
1982.81-1574,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2525.325,2528.605,But Georgia malicious interference doesn't require coercion.
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2528.605,2529.026,"No, sir."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.804,2584.189,But the... I take it the submission is that even if you could win under the state cause of action by just proving causation--
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2584.189,2584.77,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.77,2585.768,--rather than coercion--
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2585.768,2586.923,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.923,2597.403,--that the federal law pre-empts that because a union should be free to cause a discharge by non-coercive means?
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2598.042,2601.557,"No, sir, we do not believe that this is protected activity."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.577,2713.261,"--Yes, but the general counsel did say that there was no causation."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2715.824,2717.668,"There had been no hearing on that, Justice White."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.668,2719.868,"Well, there may not have been, but that is what he said."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2719.868,2722.679,But it... I don't think that is essential to--
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.679,2733.348,"Well, suppose he had issued a complaint and the board had itself... there had been a hearing, and the board had decided that there was no causation whatsoever."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2733.348,2734.284,--We are out of court.
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2734.284,2734.959,Why?
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2734.959,2739.58,Because we have had our look at the federal law.
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.25,2750.234,"Well, I know, but the federal... all they had to find in the federal proceeding was that there was no coercion, and that is the--"
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2750.234,2755.727,"--I think if we had a hearing on the merits, and we took it up to the board, and took it to the court of appeals--"
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.727,2760.399,"--Well, is that because of pre-emption, or because of some notion of res judicata?"
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2760.399,2761.479,--I think it would be more of res judicata.
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.571,2763.85,Administrative res judicata?
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2763.85,2766.958,"Well, we would have certainly appealed it on up, but yes, sir."
1982.81-1574,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2854.564,2857.423,"Well, then you really arguing the evidence, aren't you?"
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2857.423,2862.937,"--I think we are arguing the facts, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2948.73,2952.259,"Mr. Gore, could I ask you this before the break?"
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2973.063,2974.545,Was this a supervisor?
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2974.545,2975.5,No.
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2975.5,2976.561,And this was an employee?
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2976.561,2977.31,Yes.
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2977.31,2978.405,"Yes, I believe it has."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2978.405,2980.074,"Because he has coerced him, hasn't he?"
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2980.074,2990.104,"He has... He has requested that the employer discriminate based on some irrelevant... well, not irrelevant--"
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2990.104,2994.554,So what is the... what is the unfair labor practice?
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,2994.554,3002.692,--That the union has approached the employer and asked him to discriminate against an employee.
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3002.692,3008.408,"And if it is found that the union actually did that, there is an unfair labor practice."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,3008.408,3009.188,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1574,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3009.188,3020.949,"But 8(b)(1)(A), if I am reading my bench memo right, says it is to coerce employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed in Section 7."
1982.81-1574,2,39401,robert_f_gore,,3036.582,3038.958,That would not be an unfair labor practice there.
1982.81-1574,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3044.845,3047.673,We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock.
1982.81-1574,3,34498,laurence_gold,,3067.057,3115.208,"Mr. Chief Justice, it is our view that the respondent's argument simply ignores the fact that Congress in 1947 did not only give employers wide areas of freedom with regard to the hire and fire of supervisors, but that Congress also in Section 8(b)(1) regulated union conduct to a substantial extent with regard to what unions can and cannot do in interfering with such employment relations."
1982.81-1574,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3115.208,3130.903,"What if an employee... what if a supervisor has an agreement like the respondent here apparently was contemplating with the employer for a term of years' employment and that sort of thing, and the employer breaches it."
1982.81-1574,3,34498,laurence_gold,,3143.682,3152.257,My understanding from this Court's decision in Beasley is that the answer is that he cannot go into state court against--
1982.81-1574,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3152.257,3153.646,That is preposterous.
1982.81-1574,3,34498,laurence_gold,,3153.646,3154.831,--the employer.
1982.81-1574,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3154.831,3159.55,"Don't you think it's preposterous, putting Beasley to one side?"
1982.81-1574,3,34498,laurence_gold,,3159.55,3165.032,We certainly didn't lobby to take supervisors out from under the Act.
1982.81-1574,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3281.998,3295.104,"Mr. Gold, was it necessary for the general counsel to find that the union did not cause the discharge as well as that the union did not coerce the employer?"
1982.81-1574,3,34498,laurence_gold,,3295.104,3296.87,Only in one narrow sense.
1982.81-1574,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3304.241,3304.896,Exactly.
1982.81-1574,3,34498,laurence_gold,,3304.896,3310.051,"--complaint, but it is irrelevant in our view on the pre-emption question."
1982.81-1574,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3310.051,3311.049,Coercion.
1982.81-1574,3,34498,laurence_gold,,3311.049,3343.333,"Well, on the pre-emption question as well, because it is our view that whether, as in Perko, the individual never goes to the labor board or as in this case, he does go to the labor board, the fact that the labor board determines not to go forward doesn't open the union to a state court proceeding which in all--"
1982.81-1574,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.333,3351.987,"Is it an unfair labor practice for the union to go around to the employer and convince him non-coercively to discharge an employee, not a supervisor?"
1982.81-1574,3,34498,laurence_gold,,3351.987,3354.127,--An employee?
1982.81-1574,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3364.168,3370.95,I suppose the board takes the position that a breach of the duty to represent fairly is an unfair labor practice.
1982.81-1574,3,34498,laurence_gold,,3370.95,3371.541,That is right.
1982.81-1574,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.541,3372.12,Yes.
1982.81-1574,3,34498,laurence_gold,,3372.12,3380.553,And the board carries that same irrational reason line over into supervisors under 8(b)(1)(A).
1982.81-1574,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.553,3381.333,Yes.
1982.81-1574,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3381.333,3383.189,"Thank you, gentlemen."
