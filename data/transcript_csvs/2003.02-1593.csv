2003.02-1593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.628,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-1593, BedRoc Limited and Western Elite v. the United States."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,10.031,13.625,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,53.499,55.978,"It applied only in Nevada, did it not?"
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,55.978,56.554,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,99.817,102.379,Does the gravel excavation take up what?
2003.02-1593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,102.379,108.945,"About 16 to 20 acres out of some 500, which is the total surface area or?"
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,108.945,110.431,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,118.066,120.667,"Do we know, is that the sum total of the gravel that's there?"
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,124.382,133.836,We have photographs of the site in the joint appendix of the case that show the area of the... of the land in the general vicinity to be essentially the same.
2003.02-1593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,166.985,170.245,Are you now... the time you're referring to is 1919 or 1940?
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,170.245,172.119,"--1919, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,185.644,188.056,"Mr. McCrum, you left out one word in the Mining Law."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,202.158,212.561,"--Your Honor is... is correct that valuable mineral deposits is the... is the language referred to in... in 30 U.S.C., section 22 of the 1872 Mining Law."
2003.02-1593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,287.979,291.323,"Now, what would... what would Land Management have done in 1940?"
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,291.323,306.183,"In... by 1940, the... the Interior Department had modified its view in 1929 and there said that... that sand and gravel could be subject to the Mining Law if valuable on a site-specific basis."
2003.02-1593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,318.034,319.93,At... at the time of the patent?
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,319.93,328.353,"At... well, the Layman decision involved a... a question of whether it was valuable at the time of the patent in that case, which was a Mining Law patent being considered."
2003.02-1593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.303,353.122,You say the Interior Department took that position.
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,355.856,356.006,Yes.
2003.02-1593,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,367.662,375.425,"Well, Western Nuclear certainly cuts the other way from your argument here today."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,385.123,406.466,"Justice O'Connor, the Western Nuclear decision did hold that gravel could be reserved under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916, but importantly, the issue of whether that sand and gravel had to be valuable at the time of the patent was not addressed in the holding of the Court, as the Government has acknowledged in its brief."
2003.02-1593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,406.466,412.41,"Well, wasn't that because the word valuable didn't include in the... wasn't included in the reservation of Stock-Raisers Act?"
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,412.41,416.664,It... it could well have been... that... that could have been part of the Court's thinking.
2003.02-1593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.011,439.41,Why couldn't it be that the... the word valuable doesn't mean at the time of the patent?
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,475.325,526.39,"Well, Your Honor, that... that could be a possible construction, but in this case the Interior Department in the 1956 solicitor's opinion took note of the common nature of sand and gravel and how widespread it is across the western public domain and recognized that there was a need to look at... at value on a site-specific marketability basis, which was actually consistent with the... the approach the Department took in the Layman v. Ellis decision in... in 1929, looking at the site-specific marketability of sand and gravel, because unlike a precious metal like gold which, once you extract it, it can be sold on an international market without regard to transportation costs and has intrinsic value, sand and gravel and... and similar materials are... are common and widespread across the western public domain and, in fact, across the country."
2003.02-1593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,533.282,552.397,"What would happen, though, if you... what... would any bad thing happen if the words were interpreted to mean any mineral at all that ever becomes valuable in the future so that then a person who bought this land could never take anything off of it?"
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,565.112,603.628,"Justice Breyer, if... if you took that interpretation, you would have western landowners essentially being... having a very, very limited surface... surface estate interest that would essentially be at the discretion of the Government where when local... local demands for these materials arose, the Government at any time could come in and assert that they have ownership of these widespread common materials which would actually destroy... potentially destroy the value of the land and... and further, eliminate any private incentives to develop the private land, which was the intent of Congress in 1919."
2003.02-1593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,603.628,625.01,"One... one way to... to rule for your client here would be for the Court to hold that it is not a mineral if it can't be removed without disturbing the... the surface, and that certainly would resolve this case."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,632.729,634.586,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,649.241,650.25,"Yes, that's what's bothering me."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,658.695,658.983,Well--
2003.02-1593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,658.983,659.976,--assuming there's a different owner.
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,662.167,662.238,--Yes.
2003.02-1593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.07,690.268,"Of course, but you're... you're in that boat too."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,709.215,741.454,"Well, Justice Scalia, we... we... so, I mean, we have two positions here and... and one is that sand and gravel was... was not reasonably within the... the meaning of this phrase as it was... was used in 1919 considering the common legal understanding which had... had been developed by the Interior Department quite clearly between 1901 and 1919 that made it very clear that... that common, widespread sand and gravel was not what the... was not what was considered to be a valuable mineral at that time."
2003.02-1593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.454,754.169,"Well, if it wouldn't be considered a valuable... I mean, that... that does bring you into... into contradiction of our prior cases because if that... if that were so, it wouldn't have been considered a mineral either, it seems to me."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,754.169,762.425,"That's correct, Justice Scalia, but we... we... in this case we do have the further express language of... of valuable."
2003.02-1593,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,762.425,766.019,"Yes, the problem is you have Western Nuclear, which said that gravel was a mineral."
2003.02-1593,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,784.8,785.46,Is that right?
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,785.46,786.741,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-1593,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,799.539,809.032,"It's a little odd in this Pittman Act because it... it does in section 8 refer to valuable minerals, but at various other times in the act, it just says minerals."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,809.032,818.032,"In... in section 8 of the Pittman Act, it... the statute makes it quite clear that only valuable minerals are reserved."
2003.02-1593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,839.004,839.254,Suppose--
2003.02-1593,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,839.254,846.146,"--Is that term used in any other act that we'd be concerned with the term, valuable minerals, as a reservation?"
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,846.146,857.951,"Not as a reservation that I'm aware of, Your Honor, but it is... is, of course, quite similar to the language used in the 1872 Mining Law which described what... what... how... what would be done with the reserved mineral estate."
2003.02-1593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,857.951,869.652,"Suppose... and... and it's only a supposition... that we were to reconsider our... our earlier case, Western Nuclear, and... and overrule it."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,897.887,918.775,"Well, as we... as we point out in our reply brief, Justice Kennedy, the amount of land that is potentially subject to contract issued by the Government for gravel on reserved mineral estates appears to be on the order of less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the lands patented under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act."
2003.02-1593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,934.834,947.094,"But your fall... your fall-back position would extend only to Nevada, I take it, and the fact that it was valuable would be distinguishing from the Western Nuclear case."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,947.094,949.036,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,989.121,998.531,"Mr. McCrum, I don't understand what your response to Justice Ginsburg's question is under your fall-back position."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1014.672,1015.871,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-1593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.071,1021.527,"Oh, it is now."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1022.27,1022.846,--Yes.
2003.02-1593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.846,1024.498,"I mean, it was rare but not valuable."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1024.498,1030.98,"Yes, and... and therefore, it is... it is clearly within the class of minerals that the... that the 1872 Mining Law applied."
2003.02-1593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1031.435,1033.042,"Well, why is it if it's not valuable?"
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1046.046,1052.323,"--Justice Souter, the... uranium is clearly of a... a valuable, rare nature."
2003.02-1593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1052.323,1053.848,"No, but you're changing the hypothesis."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1070.423,1074.325,"Of course, the Court may... may view it that way, Justice Souter."
2003.02-1593,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1084.689,1102.189,"Well, I guess you could take the position that a mineral like uranium has some intrinsic value, very little as of 1919 and more today, but that sand and gravel neither in 1919 nor today has any intrinsic value as a mineral."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1111.439,1112.553,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-1593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1118.125,1122.295,"Well, I mean, you... you could say uranium only has... only... has no intrinsic value."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1128.982,1136.329,"But uranium is... is not dependent upon local transportation costs in the way that sand and gravel was, and that is the fundamental distinction--"
2003.02-1593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1136.329,1140.954,"This must have come up under... under... it has nothing to do with... I don't think, with the word valuable."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1177.158,1195.984,"--The... the way that it has come up is... would be in the... the most analogous way that I can think of is in the context of the 1872 Mining Law where, although that language was enacted in 1872, the Interior Department has had no trouble with the administration of that law determining that... that uranium is subject to location as a mining claim under the 1872--"
2003.02-1593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1195.984,1197.592,It was a mineral in 1500.
2003.02-1593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1198.956,1199.494,"--Yes, but everything was."
2003.02-1593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1199.494,1203.68,"--nobody disputes that it was a mineral, which is what the... what the mining act says."
2003.02-1593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1214.521,1226.038,"Didn't we have a case that involved, was it methane, that was thought not only did it have no value, but it was a positive detriment to have it?"
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1230.33,1234.705,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that would have been the Amoco v. Southern Ute case in 1999."
2003.02-1593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1251.301,1251.689,So who had the reserve?
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1253.53,1254.152,Yes.
2003.02-1593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1285.359,1290.848,May I ask you a question about an... an argument that hasn't specifically come up this morning?
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1326.226,1326.597,"Yes, Justice Souter."
2003.02-1593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1327.053,1328.911,My... my question is this.
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1391.863,1400.242,"Justice Souter, you're... you're correct that there is... there's always some level of uncertainty when a party takes land subject to a mineral reservation."
2003.02-1593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1417.787,1422.039,"So are you saying basically, look, that's the way we've done it and you ought to defer to the practice?"
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1422.988,1423.443,--We are... we are--
2003.02-1593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1423.443,1424.807,--is that the foundation for your argument?
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1424.807,1430.546,"--We are saying that this is the way the Interior Department itself has done it, and this... and this is the Interior Department that here is asserting a different rule today."
2003.02-1593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1448.462,1460.722,"When... when you say today about... and you cite the opinion of the solicitor from 1956, but the position that the Government is arguing today in this Court is not new."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1467.781,1482.27,"Justice Ginsburg, the... the position... the litigation position which the Government is taking here today that value does not matter at the time of patenting actually has... is not supported by Interior Department decisions."
2003.02-1593,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1538.469,1541.153,But they didn't... they didn't make sacrifices to get the sand and gravel.
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1541.153,1548.173,"Justice Stevens, they made sacrifices to get the land, and the sand and gravel makes up the bulk of the land."
2003.02-1593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1559.186,1561.381,You're saying it makes up the bulk of the land?
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1589.801,1596.738,"Justice Souter, the Government's position is that they own all the common sand and gravel that makes up this entire parcel of land."
2003.02-1593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1609.946,1615.807,"Well, you'd have an argument on the first prong of Western Nuclear if they took that position in fact, wouldn't you?"
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1615.807,1616.057,Well--
2003.02-1593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1616.057,1621.38,"I mean, that... that would be inconsistent with the... with the purpose of the grant in the first place I suppose."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1621.38,1635.498,--We do... we do believe that... that we... that the Government's position is... is contrary to Western Nuclear in the sense that it is not... that it... that it is relying on the value of the sand and gravel today without regard to what the value was in--
2003.02-1593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1635.498,1637.438,"No, no, but I'm talking about the extent of it."
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1653.042,1665.757,"--What is in the record is that... is that this sand and gravel deposit is extracted from the surface, that the... that the character of the land is widespread, abundant common sand and gravel."
2003.02-1593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.93,1686.152,"You wish to reserve the balance of your time, Mr. McCrum?"
2003.02-1593,0,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,1686.152,1686.524,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.524,1686.979,Very well.
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,1688.548,1699.406,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1699.406,1712.242,"Mr. Sansonetti, I looked in the... to get some statistics about what Nevada was like in 1940, and it had a... a total population of 110,000."
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,1733.668,1740.022,"--The United States is saying that the sand and gravel was, indeed, valuable as a matter of a category of minerals."
2003.02-1593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1754.39,1756.331,"Well, dirt is valuable on that basis."
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,1764.52,1771.307,"In that case I wouldn't, though, Your Honor, because topsoil also mixes both organic and inorganic materials."
2003.02-1593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.717,1796.471,"What if... what if you had only sand, which wasn't covered by Western Nuclear?"
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,1796.471,1804.439,"That would not be a problem in this particular instance, Mr. Chief Justice, because sand and the gravel are really just a matter of size."
2003.02-1593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1808.526,1809.89,So you say that's no problem for the Government.
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,1811.459,1813.417,"Oh, yes, because sand is a mineral."
2003.02-1593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1813.417,1815.358,"It's a problem for me, even if it's not for you."
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,1815.358,1815.729,"Yes, yes."
2003.02-1593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1815.729,1818.125,"Doesn't the Government get... I mean, it gets everything."
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,1837.694,1845.496,"Now, I think that the first thing we have to do is take a look at the purposes of the passage of both the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and the Pittman Act."
2003.02-1593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1845.496,1859.614,"Am I right in thinking the Government gets absolutely everything with the possible exception because of the fourth point of Western Nuclear that I'm not sure why it even came in, but that if it's mixed with something you could grow something in, then they don't get it."
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,1861.183,1862.465,"Surface, yes."
2003.02-1593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.558,1888.016,"So and then... if it's so, then at this time what this amounted to what seemed to be giving the land away... it amounted to a lease or a right to use a piece of land to grow crops."
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,1896.272,1923.948,"--Initially the answer to that... that question is yes because if you look at section 3 of the Pittman Act, it refers to an affidavit that must be signed by the patentee coming onto the land, and that affidavit states that they are applying for this patent for the purposes of reclamation and cultivation and it states that they are not there as an agent for any other corporation, mining company, or anything like that."
2003.02-1593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1951.357,1926.754,All right.
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,1954.208,1971.176,"--And... and let me... if I may shorten our own then, let me say that Congress, in looking at both the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and the Pittman Act, was basically saying to the patentees through the mineral reservation, you could have the surface of the land... initially the thought was, of course, farming."
2003.02-1593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1971.176,1974.975,"--Well, what if... what if the surface had... what if the gravel was on the surface?"
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,1974.975,1975.513,Okay.
2003.02-1593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1981.928,1984.263,So they didn't even get that part of the surface.
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,1984.263,2002.262,"If they wanted to use the sand and gravel as part of their surface operation as in the farming where you want to gravel a road, when you turn it into cement, as was done in this case... the farmer Butler that obtained the patent in 1940 used some of the sand and gravel to make concrete to provide patios, et cetera."
2003.02-1593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.55,2011.921,Why is that?
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,2013.202,2015.226,The... the--
2003.02-1593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.226,2017.993,"So long as he uses the gold in his house, it's okay?"
2003.02-1593,1,43276,thomas_l_sansonetti,,2017.993,2019.729,"--Well, I think that it--"
2003.02-1593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2019.729,2020.034,Or his teeth.
2003.02-1593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.034,2021.048,"Or his teeth, yes."
2003.02-1593,2,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,3505.544,3506.742,Thank you.
2003.02-1593,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3545.751,3550.043,"Well, your opponent flatly disagrees with you, doesn't he, on that?"
2003.02-1593,2,39919,r_timothy_mccrum,,3550.043,3557.807,"--I have great respect for my opponent, Mr. Sansonetti, but I... I think that this point that I'm making is... is as clear as could be in the record."
2003.02-1593,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3633.68,3635.333,"Thank you, Mr. McCrum."
