1992.91-1030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,32.369,"We'll hear argument next in Number 91-1030, Pamela Withrow v. Robert Allen Williams, Jr. Mr. Caminsky, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1992.91-1030,0,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,32.369,51.349,"For the last seven or eight hundred years, the writ of habeas corpus has been one of the Crown Jewels in Anglo-American jurisprudence, providing a measure of protection for all who share the heritage of the English common law from tyranny and oppression."
1992.91-1030,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.639,227.762,"Did you complain in the Fifth Circuit, Mr. Caminsky, about the district court's taking up the involuntariness issue as well as the Miranda issue?"
1992.91-1030,0,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,227.762,228.346,"Yes, we did."
1992.91-1030,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,263.353,264.503,"More specifically, though--"
1992.91-1030,0,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,264.503,264.903,--Yes.
1992.91-1030,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.903,272.041,--Did you object that the involuntariness claim had never been raised in the district court?
1992.91-1030,0,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,272.041,272.375,Yes.
1992.91-1030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,336.049,342.805,"Well, is one of your questions in your petition the failure to exhaust?"
1992.91-1030,0,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,342.805,347.09,"Yes, it is."
1992.91-1030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,393.82,399.658,"Well, if you really raised the exhaustion claim and we agreed with you, why, that would be the end of the case, wouldn't it?"
1992.91-1030,0,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,399.658,399.991,--No.
1992.91-1030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.278,407.262,Yeah.
1992.91-1030,0,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,407.262,411.866,"--Of the statement, so as far as that is concerned, that would be the--"
1992.91-1030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,411.866,418.603,"Well, I don't know that I see the... well, I guess I can read your questions as well as you can."
1992.91-1030,0,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,418.603,419.003,--Okay.
1992.91-1030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,419.805,420.405,Never mind.
1992.91-1030,0,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,420.405,426.475,"--See, this is one of the points of some confusion in the Sixth Circuit."
1992.91-1030,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.842,481.044,You think Stone v. Powell covers this case.
1992.91-1030,0,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,481.044,482.977,"--Yes, I do, for a number of reasons."
1992.91-1030,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,551.954,568.849,"Isn't there a very pragmatic difference, though, because in the Fourth Amendment case, if you preclude the litigation of these claims that's it, it's all over, whereas if we preclude litigation in the Miranda claims we then face the voluntariness claim."
1992.91-1030,0,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,568.849,569.633,"Well, this Court has--"
1992.91-1030,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1600.92,1603.789,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1661.626,1666.962,Or whether we should adopt such a rule even if Stone v. Powell had never been decided.
1992.91-1030,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1666.962,1669.481,"That... of course, you could adopt such a rule."
1992.91-1030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1676.151,1692.161,"Well, I know, but I take it that if... say we thought that Stone v. Powell was completely different from this case, it would still be open to us to say but nevertheless we should say that the Miranda claims aren't open on habeas."
1992.91-1030,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1692.161,1702.453,"--Certainly, Your Honor, if this Court were to conclude that Federal courts had no jurisdiction to hear Miranda claims, it could and must reach such a conclusion."
1992.91-1030,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.38,1934.267,"Excuse me, how are they ever enforced outside of habeas corpus?"
1992.91-1030,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1934.267,1942.104,"--They... excuse me, I... they could... they are not enforced, for example, on direct appeal to this Court from a State conviction."
1992.91-1030,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.104,1950.127,"Yeah, I mean, I don't understand how they are ever enforced unless a non-Mirandized confession is sought to be admitted."
1992.91-1030,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1955.864,1956.147,Well--
1992.91-1030,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.147,1959.066,"It's not enforced in any forum, neither habeas or elsewhere."
1992.91-1030,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1959.066,1967.572,--It's not enforced because under Miranda and under this Court's decisions interpreting Miranda it doesn't announce a constitutional rule.
1992.91-1030,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1971.374,1975.344,"No, but my point is that habeas is not distinctive in that regard."
1992.91-1030,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1975.344,1978.027,"And that's precisely my point, too, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-1030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2057.879,2062.347,Do you think it violates the Fifth Amendment to make him speak?
1992.91-1030,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2062.347,2069.937,--It violates the Fifth Amendment to make him speak in custodial interrogation if he doesn't understand that--
1992.91-1030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.937,2075.304,I thought the Fifth Amendment was violated only by the introduction of the evidence.
1992.91-1030,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2075.304,2084.862,"--Well, that's the... the holding I... this Court's jurisprudence is that the amendment itself is only violated once the statement is used."
1992.91-1030,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.068,2102.322,"Well, he has a right not... you say he has an unqualified right to remain silent under the Constitution, does he?"
1992.91-1030,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2102.322,2103.188,--That's not accurate.
1992.91-1030,2,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,3411.12,3414.072,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.91-1030,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3514.15,3517.871,Did all the State judges agree with the same result on direct review?
1992.91-1030,2,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,3517.871,3518.704,--I beg your pardon?
1992.91-1030,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3518.704,3520.573,Weren't the State courts divided on the issue?
1992.91-1030,2,29751,jeffrey_caminsky,,3520.573,3522.523,"No, not on this issue."
