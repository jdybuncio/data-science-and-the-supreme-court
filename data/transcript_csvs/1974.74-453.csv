1974.74-453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,109.621,"We'll hear arguments next in 74-453 and 74-5054, Van Lare against Hurley and Taylor against Lavine."
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,117.843,120.691,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-453,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,382.946,388.355,We're talking about the AFDC program only or other?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,388.355,393.156,"This is both, for both the AFDC program and the home relief program."
1974.74-453,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,404.498,405.878,AFDC and home relief?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,405.878,407.709,AFDC and home relief.
1974.74-453,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,407.709,410.91,"And is the -- there's federal participation in home relief, is there?"
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,410.91,412.746,"No, there is no federal participation in home relief."
1974.74-453,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,412.746,413.314,Wholly state?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,413.314,419.061,That is wholly state and locally financed.
1974.74-453,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,926.911,927.206,No.
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,943.814,945.935,That's exactly the point I was coming to Your Honor.
1974.74-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1004.254,1014.478,"Does the availability of that added kind of relief, does that bear on the statutory question or the constitutional question or both?"
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1014.478,1025.477,"The fact -- if I understand you correctly Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you're asking me whether or not the fact that any individual can obtain assistance bears on the operation of this regulation?"
1974.74-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.477,1028.126,"Oh, I didn't ask whether it bears on the operation the regulation."
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1036.709,1050.649,I don't think it would bear on the statutory question because the statutory question is limited in this case to the AFDC program and the consistency of this regulation with the AFDC program.
1974.74-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1584.277,1586.152,Mrs. Gordon?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1601.262,1605.163,"I apologize -- first Your Honor, I'm not familiar with the Court's rule."
1974.74-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.875,1613.045,Then you have a lot of company --
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1613.045,1613.493,"Yes, I --"
1974.74-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1613.493,1634.099,-- in this Court effective with Government counsel.
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1634.099,1651.55,"As I was noting, the federal legislation notes that which obvious; namely, the dwellings maybe shared in common, and that when if that is in fact the case, it is necessary to separate one need from another in order to compensate only those needs of the recipient."
1974.74-453,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1756.667,1761.532,Why is 35 -- or was it 352.30?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1761.532,1762.599,How long is it?
1974.74-453,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1762.599,1762.897,When was it enacted?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1762.897,1765.687,Oh!
1974.74-453,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1815.75,1823.498,Did New York ever have a rule of the kind that was held invalid in King against Smith?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1823.498,1825.121,Absolutely not Your Honor.
1974.74-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.203,2068.61,Now can you tell me Mrs. Gordon why the state makes its reduction?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2080.672,2083.61,"No Your Honor, we are not assuming any kind of contribution."
1974.74-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.59,2113.397,You're saying you're just familiar that the state is just entitled to withhold funds that are obviously being used to support someone who isn't entitled to assistance?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2113.397,2115.689,That is absolutely correct Your Honor.
1974.74-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.829,2142.462,"What does the state do if it discovers at some welfare or some AFDC, a mother is giving $15.00 a month to her mother who lives down the street?"
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2153.679,2163.67,"They are both civil and criminal penalties, available of civil remedies shall we say, as well as criminal penalties available under the present system."
1974.74-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.011,2168.859,Can you recover the money that --
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2168.859,2177.845,We can recover -- we can -- one must understand first of all that we're talking about two different types of grants and allowances: one the flat grant.
1974.74-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.31,2243.979,Can the state find -- is there some other way that the state can solve this problem of diversion other than doing what -- just doing what it does that --
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2243.979,2244.292,In other words --
1974.74-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2244.292,2260.598,"Not only -- even if you left the grant, the flat grant the way it is without reduction, the child is -- it doesn't have as much space as if you thought it was going to have because the lodgers moved in and then sharing the space."
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2260.598,2260.909,I --
1974.74-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2260.909,2264.49,"But then if you reduce the grant, you --"
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2264.49,2264.785,If --
1974.74-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2264.785,2270.349,-- further -- you even make it harder on the child.
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2270.349,2270.776,Yes.
1974.74-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.604,2274.834,"Now, how is that concerning the welfare of the child?"
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2274.834,2276.303,Two points should be made clear.
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2359.387,2369.827,"Well, if the lodger is there and you cut the amount right and the lodger leaves, you give their amount back?"
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2369.827,2369.974,Yes.
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.974,2372.675,With the only purpose is to get the lodger out of it?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2372.675,2375.026,No Your Honor because if the lodger --
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2375.026,2376.648,"Well, what other purpose is it?"
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2376.648,2376.974,Because --
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.974,2382.535,You said “If the lodger goes the money goes back.”
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2394.876,2395.512,[Attempt to Laugher]
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2395.512,2398.443,Then you go back to the 100.
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2403.867,2406.131,"Well, [Attempt to Laughter]"
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2406.131,2406.839,Am I right?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2406.839,2410.337,"Just like the rest of us Your Honor, to provide for his own shelter need."
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2431.578,2433.667,Is that the $100.00 in my case?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2433.667,2435.279,That one.
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2447.184,2448.215,It's a $100.00.
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2448.215,2456.988,"Now, let's assume for example that at the time their needs were budgeted, there were three recipients and a lodger."
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.387,2465.35,Mine is a $100.00 with three recipients and nobody else.
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2465.35,2467.084,"Alright, on my example Your Honor."
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2469.47,2472.285,"First, you answer mine."
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2472.285,2473.195,I'm sorry Your Honor.
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.531,2474.985,You got three recipients?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2474.985,2475.894,Yes.
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2475.894,2483.343,They say that minimum requirements for you -- for the three of you is a $100.00 a month.
1974.74-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2510.809,2521.007,"I take it that one possible answer is that with the lodger in, the people are still living in they have proved by the behavior that they don't need as much as they --"
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2521.007,2523.052,"No, that is not the answer."
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2617.678,2621.768,"But the trouble is, in the houses you don't add on room."
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2621.768,2622.77,That's right Your Honor.
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2624.455,2628.941,So the fact that it would hold four --
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2628.941,2629.138,Yes.
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2629.138,2630.175,You knew that.
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2630.175,2630.515,Yes.
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2630.515,2632.183,When you put the three in there.
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2632.183,2634.166,It might hold either three or four Your Honor.
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2634.166,2634.519,Right.
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2634.519,2635.255,You can put --
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2635.255,2640.664,"So, you gave a $100.00, and when all four moved in."
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2640.664,2642.714,"Your Honor, we didn't give a 100.00."
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2642.777,2646.161,We gave a hundred because you couldn't get it for any cheaper that's why you gave it a hundred.
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2646.161,2649.363,"That's right Your Honor, you couldn't -- perhaps so."
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2712.254,2716.393,You also cut down the food allowance when he eats?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2716.393,2717.836,Absolutely not Your Honor.
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2719.98,2725.688,"So, if he lived next door and came and then eat three meals a day, that's fine?"
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2725.688,2743.725,"No, that's not fine Your Honor because that would be as in the examples Justice White gave, probably a diversion of grants for the benefit of another, for which various civil remedies could be applied to the woman, for which various criminal remedies could be applied to the woman, and which indeed, ultimately, perhaps the ultimate sanction is --"
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2743.725,2746.155,Is that a crime to get somebody a meal?
1974.74-453,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,2746.155,2748.305,"No, it's not a crime to give somebody a meal Your Honor."
1974.74-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2797.585,2817.347,"Mrs. Gordon, what if there were a situation where the mother and children occupied a couple of bedrooms and a lodger moved in and the social services people determined that that was just one too many people in the house to be helpful."
1974.74-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2825.489,2826.128,Yes.
1974.74-453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2925.38,2927.816,Mr. Schwartz?
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,2937.413,2940.521,Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleases the Court.
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3070.205,3087.44,"But on the other hand, in Mr. Justice Rehnquist's example, mother and children are occupying two bedrooms and the mother's sister moves in with them and the children move in with the mother and the sister occupies the other bedroom."
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3092.687,3102.33,"I think that if New York had a rule that was based upon an assessment of the space needed for the family, and if in fact --"
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3102.33,3113.173,But the fact is that the lodger is being -- the space he occupies is being paid for by the state?
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3113.173,3117.036,"Well, I have to disagree with that characterization Your Honor."
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3118.866,3120.614,"Well, he isn't paying for it?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3120.614,3121.296,He is not paying --
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3121.296,3122.462,Somebody is.
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3122.462,3137.862,"He is not paying for it, but the state, when it initially computes the family shelter allowance has computed the amount of shelter allowance that the state itself has determined is necessary to meet the needs of the AFDC family."
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.862,3146.613,"That maybe so, but that's space, it's necessary, is no longer being used by the children?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3146.613,3146.839,Well --
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3146.839,3154.046,"Because the lodger's using it, and whatever the state computed is being needed by the child isn't being used anymore?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3154.046,3155.947,"Well, I think it's clear --"
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3155.947,3157.8,"Well, isn't that so or not?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3157.8,3159.97,That is so by definition.
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3175.755,3180.979,"Wherever he is, the three members of the family can't be?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3180.979,3234.604,"Well, I can have no quarrel with that – [Attempt to Laughter] that the states however may not reduce the AFDC grant solely because the caretaker relative has invited another person into the home is substantiated, both by the regulation of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare which was promulgated subsequent to this Court's decision in King, and which was designed to implement the decision in King, and that regulation is now Section 233.90 (a) of the code of Federal Rules and Regulations, Title 45 and secondly, by this Court's decision in Lewis versus Martin, which upheld the validity of this HEW regulation."
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3566.417,3567.457,Mr. Schwartz?
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3567.457,3568.577,Yes.
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3568.577,3580.574,"Do you agree that this person is getting shelter paid for by the state, the lodger?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3580.574,3583.034,"Well, that is a characterization I say."
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3583.034,3586.084,"Well, is it true or not?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3586.084,3597.787,"Judge Oakes dissenting in the Court of Appeals, made the point that the lodger is not the beneficiary of any funds from the state."
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3604.981,3608.493,"But, who's paying the rent?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3608.493,3609.903,I submit that the AFDC --
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3609.903,3611.159,The state is paying the rent?
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3611.159,3615.643,"The state initially provides the funds for the rent, but that rental allowance --"
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3615.643,3624.385,"While the state is paying for rent and he is living there, so, he is getting a bounty from the state?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3624.385,3625.24,I submit --
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3625.24,3632.017,"Well, without the state, would they be there?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3632.017,3633.68,"Would the lodger be there, is that the question?"
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3633.68,3636.556,Would the family be there without the state wanting --
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3636.556,3641.353,I assume that the family would be some place.
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3641.353,3643.728,They wouldn't be in that premises?
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3643.728,3645.677,I agree that wherever they are --
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3645.677,3648.55,"So, if the state is paying the bills?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3648.55,3655.243,"Indirectly Your Honor, the person residing in the home is getting --"
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3655.243,3676.27,"Since I can't get an answer to it, assuming that the state is paying it, and assuming that he is the lodger, he or she is getting the benefit of the state money, without the state's permission, what can the state do about it?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3676.27,3677.829,"Well, I submit --"
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3677.829,3682.403,"With you, I'd have to say “What if anything can the state do about it?”[Laughter]"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3682.403,3712.219,"First, if the lodger were a relative, which is one possibility for example as reflected in the Taylor situation, and it is also reflected in the Otay situation, the State of New York I believe it would be within its police powers as the State of California in Lewis versus Martin to enact of statute which would provide for an obligation of support by that relative."
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3713.926,3715.132,One possibility.
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3715.132,3720.681,Now I think the question is more difficult if the person is a non relative.
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3732.127,3733.217,How?
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3736.25,3742.541,"I'm only of course, hypothesizing the state could possibly and I'm not conceding the --"
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3742.541,3744.556,The state might get its money --
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3744.556,3747.207,"I'm not conceding the validity of such a statute, but I'm saying --"
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3747.207,3750.778,"When you do that, aren't you going to concede that the state has the right to get that money --"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3750.778,3750.884,No.
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3822.358,3827.275,But the state says that that applied only to men.
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3827.275,3828.316,The --
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3828.316,3830.363,The King case applied only to men [Attempt to Laughter].
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3830.363,3837.758,"Well, I think the key to King versus Smith relates not so much to the technical use of the term."
1974.74-453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3868.548,3874.529,"Just that he should take on the obligation of paying for his lodging, his own lodging, that's the theory."
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3874.529,3874.758,Yes.
1974.74-453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3879.441,3889.612,"He can do is support of the children, as I understand the state, the theory behind this lodge it just is that the -- his share of the shelter is attributable to him."
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,3889.612,3892.37,"Now, I recognize the differences."
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4028.302,4036.043,"Assume there was a -- assume the state calculated how much a family of four needed for food, is a $100.00 a month."
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4050.262,4050.492,Yes.
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4051.637,4052.341,What can they do?
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4052.341,4052.824,Alright.
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4064.196,4077.348,"The facts are perfectly clear, and the recipient -- and the AFDC recipients says well of course, they've fifth person who's living here and the relative didn't mine and I intend to keep him and we can all live on a $100.00 a month, it's just that we're not eating as well as we did."
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4077.348,4077.527,Right.
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4086.566,4090.4,"I know, by the recipient, he says “go about your own business, I'll go about mine.”"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4090.4,4096.29,"Now of course, this Court in Wyman versus James said that the recipient cannot make that assertion."
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4099.313,4104.283,Do you mean that -- you mean that the state could say “Well either move the lodger out or we are going to cut you off entirely”?
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4104.283,4107.118,"Well, the state can."
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4107.118,4108.795,You suggest that and know it?
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4108.795,4111.635,No because that would conflict with our assertions --
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4111.635,4112.767,I will take it would.
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4112.767,4114.725,Of the rights of privacy and association.
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4134.89,4144.791,"Oh I know, but whatever -- in my example, whatever food comes into the house by five people now sharing instead of four and what can the state do about it?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4144.791,4150.229,"I mean, this is an assumption, but there's nothing in the record in the Instant case."
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4160.363,4164.756,"I understand that, I understand that, but they are sharing the space?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4164.756,4168.604,They are sharing the space.
1974.74-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4217.843,4226.251,"What if they decided that the family didn't have any excess of space, just without the lodger and that the lodger was one too many?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4226.251,4228.125,Is the example that they did have excess --
1974.74-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4228.125,4228.573,"No, they haven't --"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4228.573,4229.876,-- that they were over crowded.
1974.74-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4229.876,4232.217,Yes.
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4232.217,4244.055,"I would concede that if the state determined that the family was residing in over crowded quarters, that perhaps the state could take steps to compel the lodger to leave."
1974.74-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4245.074,4254.877,"Well certainly, if your example of the state could proceed on a case-by-case basis is to mean anything, presumably if the care -- the state found the facts in the individual case that they would have to be --"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4254.877,4256.296,"Yes, I agree."
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4273.762,4278.325,What good would they do if you say “How much difference would -- (Inaudible)
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4278.325,4289.964,"I would concede that in that instance, any rights of privacy in association that the caretaker relative has would give way to the --"
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4289.964,4291.212,Give way to what?
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4292.144,4297.837,I think in that instance that the state could insist that the lodger leave the home.
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4297.837,4301.846,(Inaudible)
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4301.846,4308.507,"It may ultimately result in a neglect proceeding, having to be brought against the parent."
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4310.966,4312.263,What kind of procedure --
1974.74-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4312.263,4317.081,-- to cut off payment if you don't take the aid off?
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4317.081,4320.36,I don't think cutting the aid off would solve the problem.
1974.74-453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4343.493,4354.068,"Well, you really come back to what Mr. Justice White suggested that all they can do is -- the state can do is initiate a proceeding to take the children away from the mother?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4354.068,4362.668,"Well as I say, there are steps prior to that drastic steps that possibility of case work services is there."
1974.74-453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4365.925,4368.964,All to the end of persuading the lodger to get out?
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4368.964,4372.091,"In a case where the children are being curbed, only in that --"
1974.74-453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4372.091,4378.535,"-- doesn't get out, and then say (Inaudible) with the procedure from taking the children from--"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4378.535,4388.504,"I would say in the case where the parent is doing something that's causing harm to the children, that a neglect proceeding may well have to be the ultimate remedy."
1974.74-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4388.504,4394.499,Do you suggest the state would be enabled to bring an eviction proceeding against the lodger?
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4394.499,4399.14,"Well, the state would have no standing under New York state law to bring an eviction proceeding."
1974.74-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4400.092,4405.915,What if these mediation efforts that Mr. Justice White was asking you about failed.
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4407.308,4414.04,"Well as I say, if they fail, the Department of Social Services may well have to bring in neglect proceeding."
1974.74-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4420.095,4421.313,"Against whom, against the --"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4421.313,4424.523,"It would be brought against the parent, against the caretaker relative."
1974.74-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4424.523,4428.511,And then the State of New York will have to do something about supplying a lawyer for the --
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4428.511,4441.475,"Well, the Department of Social Services in New York routinely unfortunately in a social sense, it has to bring neglect proceedings in New York family court."
1974.74-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4441.475,4445.571,"Well, they have to supply an attorney for the lodger also to defend his rights?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4445.571,4454.072,"Under state law, there is a statutory right of assigned counsel."
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4458.116,4461.63,You have the lodger party to the --
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4461.63,4462.526,No.
1974.74-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4468.643,4469.741,"Yes, I --"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4469.741,4473.107,The lodger would not be a party to the neglect proceeding --
1974.74-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4473.107,4485.324,"On you definition, the lodger is some sort of a third-party beneficiary here, and his rights are being attacked by someone I -- he probably would claim a right to counsel, wouldn't he?"
1974.74-453,1,36723,martin_a_schwartz,,4485.324,4491.532,"Well, I don't believe that the lodger would be a proper party in the neglect proceeding."
1974.74-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4656.218,4657.117,Thank you Mr. Schwartz.
