2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.653,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-702, Moncrieffe v. Holder."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,7.838,8.903,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you very much."
2012.11-702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,48.46,49.836,Excuse me.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,53.708,54.913,They were not.
2012.11-702,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,129.051,132.815,It's a massive amount of conduct that the statute contemplates?
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,135.533,135.985,--Yeah.
2012.11-702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,147.152,156.804,"Well, now, Mr. Goldstein, when you say this case, is there any proof in the record that there was a small amount and no remuneration?"
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,156.804,162.583,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, although this is -- we believe the case is proceeding under the categorical approach, the answer to your question is yes."
2012.11-702,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.882,202.194,Excuse me.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,202.615,203.005,--Sorry.
2012.11-702,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,203.005,204.834,Material weight says less than 1 ounce--
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,204.834,205.146,Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.146,210.079,"--parentheses, approximate weight is 1 -- 1 -- oh, I see, 1.3 grams."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,210.079,210.878,Yeah.
2012.11-702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,273.087,288.517,"You -- we are discussing the categorical approach, but let's assume he had pled guilty, and in his allocution, he had admitted to not a smaller amount or to remuneration."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,303.106,309.555,"Under our rule, the plea colloquy is irrelevant, but we would win under a rule in which it was relevant."
2012.11-702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,338.327,340.651,That's the issue with this case.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,348.789,349.694,--You said still felons.
2012.11-702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,350.118,350.945,--Well -- they're--
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,350.945,352.458,--That's exactly right.
2012.11-702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,352.458,354.567,--they're still subject to removal--
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,354.567,354.973,Right.
2012.11-702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,354.973,355.643,--either way.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,355.643,358.596,"So, you know, lawyers often try and avoid the strength of the other side's case."
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,394.19,396.565,I see that.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,425.367,425.648,Okay.
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,425.648,435.567,"--who work with the statute in Georgia, and say, now look, the indictment here says possession with intent to distribute, and I can show from the documents that it's a tiny amount."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,475.908,488.858,"Because I don't think anybody would believe me if I went to an immigration judge and I said, judge, I promise, I promise that the fact that this isn't a possession with intent to distribute case means that there are never cases in--"
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,488.858,489.716,You don't have to say never.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,495.62,496.042,--We -- I think--
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,496.042,501.664,"And the kind of statute that it is, is a statute that is used to prosecute people--"
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,501.664,502.21,--Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,502.21,503.318,--with small amounts when they don't sell.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,503.318,503.65,Right.
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,503.65,512.722,"If your version of what that felon intends to distribute, the distinction there is really picked up by the district attorneys."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,522.67,526.293,We have not read this Court's cases to suggest that we call the state attorneys.
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,531.199,531.402,Okay.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,533.668,534.011,--Yeah.
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,534.011,543.053,"--which is the only other one I really have, aside from making that suggestion, but here, what happened to this person?"
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,543.053,543.49,Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,543.49,550.222,He was -- was he sentenced under 16-13-2(a)?
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,557.36,557.641,Yeah.
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,557.641,558.608,But was he or wasn't he?
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,558.608,558.936,Yeah.
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,558.936,559.704,All right.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,568.276,568.497,Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,568.497,575.649,"And it says, if he completes it, he then is discharged without court adjudication of guilt."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,575.649,576.102,Yeah.
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,576.102,580.68,"And shall not be deemed a conviction, it says for purposes of this code."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,580.68,581.117,Yeah.
2012.11-702,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,581.117,583.145,"Well, why are we saying he was convicted of anything?"
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,583.145,583.461,Sure.
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,611.806,613.354,And that question's not before us today.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,613.354,613.775,That's exactly right.
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,613.775,614.274,Okay.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,629.315,629.751,Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,639.106,640.03,"No, no, I'm sorry."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,642.56,642.982,--Yeah.
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,642.982,649.494,"841(b)(1)(D) lists the elements, and conviction in -- Georgia, right?"
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,649.494,649.791,Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,649.791,654.022,--conviction in Georgia under their provision satisfies -- has each of those elements.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,656.994,658.304,That is one way of looking at it.
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,675.282,676.576,"They want to do that at the tail end, right?"
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,676.576,678.607,"--No, they want to do it in every single case at the beginning."
2012.11-702,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,681.154,682.059,"Again, I didn't hear."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,682.059,682.371,--Sorry.
2012.11-702,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,682.371,683.747,They want to do it in every--
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,683.747,685.479,In every case at the beginning.
2012.11-702,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.931,689.667,--At the beginning of the state prosecution?
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,689.667,692.023,"--No, in the middle -- at the beginning of the immigration proceedings."
2012.11-702,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,692.023,692.351,All right.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,692.351,692.619,So let me--
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,692.619,695.586,Before you get on -- I didn't understand that to be their position at all.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,702.161,704.817,--So let me explain.
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,704.817,705.473,--Go ahead.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,705.473,712.734,"So our position is it is a controlled substances offense, and you take account of the seriousness of the offense in cancellation."
2012.11-702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,726.759,744.596,"Mr. Goldstein, it's because they are trying to mirror the Federal statute, which makes the small amount and no remuneration, makes that like an affirmative defense."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,755.92,756.856,--That's correct.
2012.11-702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,756.856,761.995,So what the Government is suggesting is as close to the Federal statute as you can get.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,761.995,766.916,"Well, let me just say first, I do want to make -- just want to focus on what the parties' positions are."
2012.11-702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,814.553,816.725,You said Carachuri.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,839.432,840.121,"--No, we disagree."
2012.11-702,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,861.784,862.704,What is the conviction?
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,862.704,863.391,Okay.
2012.11-702,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,863.391,865.235,What does the conviction mean?
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,867.578,867.906,Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,867.906,877.26,"Is it the categorical statute under which you have been convicted or, as you seem to be saying, the indictment?"
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,877.26,880.29,It is what you are convicted of.
2012.11-702,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.395,898.112,"Is he convicted of that or is he convicted of violating Georgia Code 16-13, whatever it is?"
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,898.112,912.279,"--As I was -- I mentioned very briefly to Justice Sotomayor, when you have a divisible statute like this, that includes possession with intent to distribute, sell, possess, all of those things, you use the modified categorical approach to figure out which one applies."
2012.11-702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,918.727,924.834,"Well, Mr. Goldstein, assuming he was convicted of that, as you suggest, you have an underinclusiveness problem."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,928.005,928.395,--Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,928.395,939.361,"If you assume that this statute covers and is regularly used to cover both sets of people, both people with these very minor offenses and people with much more major offenses--"
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,939.361,939.72,Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,939.72,953.949,"--the at least apparent attractiveness of the Government's position is that they've tried to cure their overinclusiveness problem, and they have done it by sticking on -- and, you know, one can ask where this comes from in the statute--"
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,953.949,954.246,I hope we will.
2012.11-702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,954.246,970.319,"--but they have done it by sticking on something that attempts to address their overinclusiveness problem, so that people who are really misdemeanants get classified as misdemeanants, and people who are really aggravated felons get classified that way."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,980.064,981.062,"Well, two reasons."
2012.11-702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1002.384,1003.242,I don't follow--
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1003.242,1004.1,Okay.
2012.11-702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1004.1,1019.655,--your answer because I think you have to concede that under your view a lot of people who are convicted under the Georgia statute who had a significant quantity which they intended to distribute--
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1019.655,1020.33,Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1020.33,1020.969,--for remuneration--
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1020.969,1021.219,Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1021.219,1032.091,"--many of those people would -- under your view of the statute, many of those people would not have committed an aggravated felony."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1032.091,1032.746,I agree with--
2012.11-702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1032.746,1033.76,So you have that--
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1033.76,1035.335,--That is our problem.
2012.11-702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1036.29,1039.788,--a large underinclusiveness problem which you haven't solved.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1039.788,1040.116,Okay.
2012.11-702,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1097.497,1103.588,But all that follows from in Carachuri-Rosendo the Government wanted to go outside the record.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1103.588,1104.602,"--No, Justice Ginsburg, it does not."
2012.11-702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1118.832,1132.481,Do you think that the Attorney General could just issue some kind of directive telling all administrative law judges and officials to deny cancellation of removal to anybody who commits these kinds of offenses?
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1132.481,1136.669,We -- it's an interesting question that I have puzzled about at length.
2012.11-702,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1182.838,1185.428,Would it be permissible -- I had the same question.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1186.227,1186.71,I think--
2012.11-702,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1186.71,1189.818,--or would you be back up here saying that this violates the statute.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1189.818,1193.55,"--Well, we think we would win, so I wouldn't be back for this client."
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1202.048,1204.859,"I'm sorry, could you remind me what the “ it ” is that you're talking about?"
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1204.859,1205.421,--Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1205.421,1206.435,It's an order from the Attorney General--
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1206.435,1206.734,Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1206.734,1207.639,--to the immigration judges--
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1207.639,1207.904,Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1207.904,1208.747,--to?
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1208.747,1213.435,To treat all of these cases as barring cancellation of removal.
2012.11-702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1216.261,1217.619,To do the exact same thing--
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1217.619,1217.931,--Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1217.931,1218.399,--but through--
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1218.399,1218.729,Right.
2012.11-702,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1218.729,1219.696,--an Attorney General directive.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1219.696,1226.77,And I think our argument that it's arbitrary would be supported by the fact that this Court would have ruled that he couldn't do the identical thing on the front end.
2012.11-702,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1286.027,1299.805,"Do you have any statistics, if you take the whole universe of convictions under the Georgia statute, what percentage of them are for these minor offenses and what are for the major?"
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1300.397,1301.275,--We don't.
2012.11-702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1415.772,1419.972,"Mr. Goldstein, there are at least 93 cases, all right."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1420.237,1420.705,Yes.
2012.11-702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1420.705,1427.986,--And I don't know and I'm not going to ask you to prove to me how the burden of proof was met or not met in those.
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1430.606,1430.829,Sure.
2012.11-702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1430.829,1443.666,"Let's assume Georgia has the Federal statute, but, differently than the Federal statute, it has a sale-distribution provision, and it has a small amount, no remuneration statute."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1443.666,1443.932,Yeah.
2012.11-702,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1443.932,1446.9,What would happen in those states?
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1446.9,1458.095,"There are about 15 of those states, and in those states, if you weren't convicted under the small one, then you would infer it wasn't a small amount and no remuneration, and the person would have committed an aggravated felony."
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1468.109,1469.216,"I'm sorry, go ahead."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1469.216,1469.637,--No.
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1487.537,1504.296,"Your use of the statistics, I think, assumes that Georgia and other states are prosecuting every case that comes before them, because that's how you get, you know, at least 750,000 nationwide, so much more than must involve tiny amounts."
2012.11-702,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1518.682,1521.775,"Well, I have one really good example of a prosecution for a small amount."
2012.11-702,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.614,1567.333,"Thank you, Counsel."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1571.099,1574.783,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1587.434,1588.51,What's the free pass?
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1595.37,1609.159,The free pass is that you would never have an aggravated felony for this conviction under any state that did not make an element of the state offense to disprove -- no remuneration or more than a small amount.
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1609.159,1611.705,--But those convicted individuals would still be subject to deportation.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1611.705,1613.533,"Yes, Your Honor, they would still be subject--"
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1613.533,1624.577,"And nothing would stop the INS judge from considering the amount of drugs, correct, that the individual actually was involved in, and that could be introduced through hearsay, through almost any document, correct?"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1624.577,1628.59,"--Your Honor, you're talking about the discretionary cancellation of removal proceeding?"
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1628.59,1629.229,Yes.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1629.229,1630.621,"It's true, Your Honor, that could come in there."
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1640.725,1656.782,"Well, do you suggest that the immigration judges don't know that, and that they wouldn't weigh that desire heavily in a case in which a -- the convicted individual is proven to have sold the larger amount?"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1658.498,1673.306,"--What -- Your Honor, what Congress said when it passed this very provision was that immigration judges were granting too much discretionary relief to this very class of criminal aliens, and that is why it implemented this aggravated felony."
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1682.925,1683.927,"Well, will you pause right there."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1699.653,1703.463,"--Well, Your Honor, it's not an exercise of discretion under Castro-Rodriguez."
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1731.47,1734.157,Is that -- is the authority for that Castro-Rodriguez?
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1734.157,1735.733,--I'm sorry?
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1735.733,1739.277,Is the authority for that the decision in Castro-Rodriguez?
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1739.277,1740.715,To have that secondary proceeding?
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1740.715,1741.09,Right.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1741.09,1745.228,"Well, I think it comes from the statute, the INA, which incorporates the CSA scheme."
2012.11-702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1764.363,1784.652,"Well, Mr. Shah, the Board may have been doing these inquiries, but I just don't understand the statutory argument, because the way the statute -- the way your own statutory argument runs is that if the conviction, the state conviction, was a conviction for possession with intent to distribute, then those are the elements of a Federal -- of a Federal felony."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1822.824,1829.508,"Your Honor, I agree, the Government could have taken the hard-line approach that it's game over under the categorical inquiry because the elements--"
2012.11-702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1829.508,1832.506,"Well, that's what the statute says, and that's what your own statutory analysis says."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1832.506,1835.552,"--Your Honor, I don't think it's inconsistent with the statutory scheme."
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1886.968,1887.42,This is--
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1887.42,1889.093,What our inquiry does is--
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1889.093,1889.81,--Go ahead.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1890.185,1902.479,"--What our inquiry does is allow the Board to get to that second part of the definition, the “ unless ” clause, and that mirrors exactly other aggravated felony provisions in the INA."
2012.11-702,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1902.479,1917.582,"But you've answered Justice Kagan's question by -- she said, doesn't your own interpretation of this statute require the opposite result and -- or the harsh result?"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1922.063,1923.626,"Your Honor, I'm not positing--"
2012.11-702,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1923.626,1926.267,--You -- you said that Congress could write a new statute.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1928.264,1930.482,--I'm not positing a new statute.
2012.11-702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1938.37,1945.32,"No, I'll just read you, Mr. Shah, this sentence from your brief, and I could read you a thousand of these in your brief:"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1964.845,1969.45,"--Well, Your Honor, I -- I would say that it presumptively creates the aggravated felony, and it's because of that--"
2012.11-702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1969.45,1972.105,"Well, now you've just put in words into your brief."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1972.105,1972.714,"--Well, well--"
2012.11-702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1972.714,1975.993,"--and -- and really, truly you say this 10 or 15 times."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1975.993,1988.147,"--Well, Your Honor, the heading to the brief says “ presumptively ”, and so I didn't use that word every time, but I think the point is that it would be the -- the aggravated felony has that “ unless ” clause."
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2027.973,2030.878,This is -- this is a new position for the Government.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2038.908,2050.466,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think that we categorically deny that you could have this sort of proceeding, and in the op to this case, I know Petitioner says this is a new position in this case."
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2056.105,2058.242,"But that was a change in the Government's position, wasn't it?"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2058.242,2063.63,"--Your Honor, I can say that the -- the Government did dispute the particular facts in Castro-Rodriquez."
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2098.025,2109.018,"So what does -- in a case in which the Attorney General can cancel removal, putting aside this case, what are the sort of things he looks at in deciding whether or not to cancel removal?"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2109.018,2110.535,It's a balance of equities.
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2121.059,2134.602,"So one of the things presumably is the amount of drugs involved, whether they were for intent to distribute for remuneration -- all the sorts of things that you say he can consider under the provision that says he does not have the authority to cancel removal."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2134.602,2145.396,"Your Honor, those are the sorts of factors that might be open to consideration, but what Congress did is it took away the ability for the Attorney General to exercise that discretion."
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2151.172,2157.236,"Each time you get -- you say that, you get back into the hole that Justice Kagan has been asking you to climb out of."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2167.728,2169.636,--Your Honor--
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2169.636,2170.806,--overinclusiveness argument.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2170.806,2175.29,"--Your Honor, this will bar discretion in the vast majority of cases, and here's why."
2012.11-702,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2223.769,2233.374,"Do you agree with Mr. Goldstein when he says in reality it's not an affirmative defense, that the defendant never has to prove the amount?"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2233.374,2247.197,"--I -- I don't agree with that, because if it were in fact the case that the Government had to disprove the -- the small amount and, more importantly, the remuneration element, that would be a very different statute."
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2249.01,2249.447,"I'm sorry, counselor."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2271.421,2272.283,"--Oh, I--"
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2272.283,2273.624,How does it raise his burden of proof?
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2273.624,2275.905,--I'm not saying it -- the defendant has to show more.
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2281.715,2291.241,"And I guess my point is that one, which is don't the facts that the Government have either show it or not show it in virtually every instance?"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2291.241,2293.133,--I think it's a very different question.
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2313.372,2314.311,It would be less than an ounce.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2314.311,2314.639,Right.
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2322.353,2324.118,Can I go back to your substantive argument?
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2324.118,2324.649,Yes.
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2324.649,2325.07,All right.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2340.816,2342.329,Yes.
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2342.329,2348.062,"--of burglary, but if you did it with an explosive or you did it with a dangerous weapon, it goes up."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2348.062,2348.64,That's exactly right.
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2348.64,2355.639,And applying the categorical approach is relatively easy there because either the State offense includes the addition or it doesn't.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2375.724,2377.128,Your Honor--
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2377.128,2380.814,"--of Apprendi, because of -- of--"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2380.814,2384.125,--I -- I think it's because of the proper interpretation of the statute.
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2394.841,2395.98,--But that's under Apprendi.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2395.98,2402.024,"Well, both before and after Apprendi, Your Honor, this statute was interpreted the same way."
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2406.273,2406.538,That's a--
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2406.538,2407.724,--To get to the 5-year--
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2407.724,2414.286,--Didn't we -- didn't we talk about the categorical approach in footnote 3 of our case in Carachuri?
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2414.286,2414.801,--Uh-huh.
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2414.801,2436.183,"Where we said that in talking about the generic Federal offense, whether it's a felony or not, that we can't look at just strictly the elements of the crime, but we have to also look at the sentencing factors, because when we're talking about what constitutes a misdemeanor or a felony under Federal law we have to look at both."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2436.183,2439.182,"Well, Your Honor, what Carachuri involved was something very different."
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2490.628,2492.456,But the same elements would go to the misdemeanor.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2504.109,2504.92,I think there are--
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2504.92,2505.89,--choose between the two?
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2505.89,2516.806,"--I think there are -- I think there are two ways, Your Honor, that -- two different lines of reasoning that show that the Government's approach to the categorical part of the inquiry is -- is the right approach, and not Petitioner's approach."
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2517.261,2520.635,"However you do it, the misdemeanor still has the same three elements."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2520.635,2523.774,"--Well, here's -- here's how--"
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2523.774,2526.381,So how do we choose between it being a misdemeanor or a felony?
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2526.381,2526.974,--Right.
2012.11-702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2640.755,2655.826,"Mr. Shah, I think the problem with your main argument is that it leads you to a result that you don't want to accept, because your main argument is all we've done in our past cases, and I can argue with this, but your argument is all we've done is compare the elements."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2696.03,2704.84,"--Well, first, Your Honor, I am glad that we have an agreement on the first part of the categorical inquiry, because I think that is the main part of the inquiry that -- that would establish--"
2012.11-702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2704.84,2705.588,I don't think we really have an agreement--
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2705.588,2706.403,--Okay.
2012.11-702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2706.403,2709.916,--because it seems to me that Carachuri actually says we don't just look to elements.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2716.507,2727.27,"Again, Your Honor, I think you have to look at this particular aggravated felony, which I think is structured similar to other aggravated felonies in the INA."
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2761.145,2766.361,"And the whole point -- the whole point is that there is no similar provision in the statute at issue in this case, right?"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2766.361,2769.688,--I think the point is that there is a similar provision.
2012.11-702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2824.32,2833.692,"I don't think that that is quite right, Mr. Shah, because if you read this statute, what it most looks like is that Congress is simply classifying two different kinds of conduct."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2869.239,2873.536,"--Well, Your Honor, I disagree with that characterization of that statute."
2012.11-702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2961.532,2964.422,"I guess I don't understand, Mr. Shah."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3000.968,3002.828,"--Two things, Your Honor."
2012.11-702,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3024.521,3024.942,Counsel--
2012.11-702,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3024.942,3044.245,"Counsel, I thought that when Congress enacted this provision there was not the distinction between elements and sentencing factors that we now have, that the statute was enacted, in other words, before Apprendi."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3044.245,3050.058,"--Your Honor, this statute was enacted before Apprendi, but Apprendi doesn't change the interpretation of this statute."
2012.11-702,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.22,3073.296,"That may be, but it certainly goes to your argument that Congress had in mind some distinction between elements and sentencing factors."
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3073.296,3080.307,"Well, I think what Congress had in mind is that those mitigating criteria would not be treated as elements."
2012.11-702,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3139.704,3147.655,"If you do not -- if you do not prevail in this case, can you simply solve this problem in the discretionary removal proceedings?"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3147.655,3150.576,"Your Honor, I think that's--"
2012.11-702,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3150.576,3155.494,You just say we're going to -- we're going to order you removed unless you bring in evidence that this was a minor amount.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3155.993,3160.446,"--Your Honor, I -- I think that that -- I think that's an open question."
2012.11-702,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3163.928,3169.083,"Well, don't you think it's -- it's under the law, and under administrative practice that it's an option available to you?"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3169.083,3171.879,--It may -- it may be -- be an option open to the Attorney General to do that.
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3184.733,3198.493,"Counsel, under the -- under the -- do you have the same answer as Mr. Goldstein, that the modified categorical approach wouldn't permit the immigration judge to look at the plea allocution to determine the amount?"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3198.493,3204.631,--I think the modified categorical approach would allow -- would allow--
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3204.631,3221.609,"So that in -- in many of these cases that we're talking about, it is possible that the plea allocution itself would set out the amounts that the alien sold or show that he sold something--"
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3221.609,3222.639,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think--"
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3222.639,3227.607,--and that would take care of this issue of how many people are escaping automatic removal.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3227.607,3239.539,"--I think if the plea agreement or plea colloquy set forth the amount and it was more than a small amount, I think the modified -- our position would be that the modified categorical approach would allow you to reach that."
2012.11-702,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3255.937,3262.5,But the vast majority -- the vast majority in my experience do -- do say whether the crime was for sale or distribution.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3262.5,3276.32,"--And if that's the case, then the Government would agree that if we were to lose this case, we could then look at -- look at that evidence to -- to show -- to disprove more than a small amount, something that's not an element in any of the State crimes."
2012.11-702,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3276.32,3277.758,Are there any other consequences?
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3285.347,3288.081,"Yes, Your Honor, there are other consequences that matter."
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3370.73,3376.167,Does that -- does the Castro-Rodriguez proceeding take care of those additional consequences?
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3376.167,3378.822,"If I may respond, Your Honor."
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3378.822,3379.321,Sure.
2012.11-702,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3379.836,3381.196,Thank you.
2012.11-702,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3413.43,3414.291,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-702,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3416.542,3425.351,"Mr. Chief Justice, I told you I was going to acknowledge the strengths of the other side's case, and I want to just recognize that you can conceivably read the statute their way."
2012.11-702,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3479.079,3482.342,"But it's the word “ punishable ”, I think."
2012.11-702,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3482.342,3485.481,"Well, “ punishable ” is a good word--"
2012.11-702,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3485.481,3494.103,"So you're thinking under Georgia law this is punishable as a felony only if it wasn't a small amount used for personal use, you see, and therefore, they go into the hearing."
2012.11-702,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3508.254,3508.816,--Okay.
2012.11-702,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3662.187,3663.045,"Thank you, counsel."
