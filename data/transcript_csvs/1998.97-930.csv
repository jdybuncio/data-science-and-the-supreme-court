1998.97-930,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.496,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97-930, Victoria Buckley v. The American Constitutional Law Foundation."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,10.929,15.782,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,60.711,63.602,May I ask just one factual question?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,63.602,63.913,"Yes, sir."
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,63.913,70.986,"I understand there's a final reporting requirement, a disclosure requirement, and that is not challenged here."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,70.986,73.409,That is correct.
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,84.647,104.77,"Well, does the financial disclosure that's made at the end, and it's not challenged, separate out the amount that's paid for solicitors, so if I read the report I know that they spent X dollars for TV advertising and Y dollars for... to pay circulators?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,107.09,114.717,The final report would list all of the expenditures included among the expenditures of the sponsoring campaign committee--
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,114.717,116.668,"What I'm asking, is it a lump sum, or is it separated out?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,116.668,118.227,--It is separated out in detail.
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,118.227,121.78,And when is that final report due?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,123.402,126.395,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,126.395,133.348,It would also show the amounts that went to the individual petition circulators?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,133.348,134.349,That is correct.
1998.97-930,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,134.349,139.983,--that may be filed with the petition when the petition is completed?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,147.098,149.509,The monthly reports are while it is in circulation.
1998.97-930,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,149.509,161.277,"But when the completed petition is there, and the sponsor says, we have enough votes, at that time the so called final report would go in?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,161.277,165.079,"Your Honor, I'm not sure what the due date is for the final report."
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.079,177.528,"Is there anything in the monthly disclosure statements that break it down expenditure by expenditure, so if I looked at the monthly disclosure statement, could I see how much was paid just for circulating?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,177.528,185.012,The monthly disclosure statement lists the amounts that are paid to each individual circulator on a person by person basis.
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,185.012,185.483,That was struck down.
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,189.756,192.678,The--
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,192.678,193.728,--by the district court's opinion?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,193.728,198.022,--What has been struck down is simply the amount that applies to individual circulators.
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,198.022,198.192,All right.
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,204.216,204.627,Yes.
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,204.627,208.741,"--can I see how much is paid, lump sum, for circulation?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,208.741,213.543,You would have to add up the amount that is paid to each individual circulator.
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,213.543,215.606,"Well, except that's been struck down."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,215.947,225.791,Signature gathering serves the same function as a primary election in a candidate selection process.
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.999,240.171,"Well, there's this difference between signature gathering and a primary election."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,260.848,264.067,"Here, there are three functions that all occur simultaneously."
1998.97-930,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,284.88,296.858,"Well, do... is there any way of telling from this record whether the typical petitioner circulator goes door to door, or sits in a shopping mall?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,298.471,301.542,They may do both.
1998.97-930,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,309.206,310.378,And so--
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,310.378,314.62,--record does not specifically describe that in the trial court.
1998.97-930,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,314.62,323.576,--What is the interest of the State that you say supports the requirement that the circulators have to be registered voters?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,323.576,325.359,That is two part.
1998.97-930,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.267,350.874,"In light of Meyer, I would have thought the State would have a hard time asserting that its interest in having them be registered voters can prevail."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,362.853,368.877,--We are happy to have people debate the merits and to enter into a persuasive function.
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,382.296,382.624,Well--
1998.97-930,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,382.624,392.191,"--Well, why can't somebody who is a resident of Colorado, who's an adult resident, perform that function just as well as somebody who's a registered voter?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,393.272,407.471,--The registration requirement is different from a residency requirement in that it requires a person to swear an oath that they are a resident of the State before they begin the circulating process.
1998.97-930,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,445.376,452.432,"Yes, but you require an affidavit at the end of the day, when the petition is filed, that the circulator is, in fact, a resident."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,452.432,455.213,--That is ordinarily our process--
1998.97-930,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,455.213,471.145,"And you have the normal criminal laws that could enforce that, so it's very difficult for me to understand, in the face of Meyer, what State justification you can offer for also requiring that the circulator be a registered voter."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,471.145,479.289,"--This would ensure that they are a resident throughout the entire time that they are circulating the petition, rather than just at the moment they submit--"
1998.97-930,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,479.289,480.401,Why isn't that--
1998.97-930,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,480.401,489.688,--Isn't there something in the record that suggests that it's easier to determine whether someone is a registered voter than it is to determine whether they're a resident?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,489.688,493.29,--We have specific lists of registered voters.
1998.97-930,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,501.074,519.917,"Is it any part of your rationale on the registered voters that if you don't want to count yourself in the political community by not voting, you shouldn't take part in this, or is it simply a kind of way of verifying that the person is, indeed, a resident?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,519.917,527.942,"It is a way of verifying that a person is, indeed, a resident, and that is correct, but it is also... there's also two parts."
1998.97-930,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,562.387,589.686,"How do you get around the fact that, despite the complexity of function, and I will concede to you that they are performing functions in the electoral process, how do you get around the fact that Meyer says they're also engaging in core speech, and if they're engaging in core speech, they're going to be... your restrictions are going to be judged on a very restrictive standard."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,592.757,601.243,"We believe that, even under a strict scrutiny analysis, that our laws would satisfy that strict scrutiny."
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.243,603.433,Why is that?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,624.487,625.859,"Well, we would like to think so."
1998.97-930,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,658.731,661.442,"Well, do you think registered voters are more apt to leave the State than people who haven't registered?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,669.738,689.201,"--To the extent that we are dealing with the problem of... that is described in the amicus briefs of the State and Local Legal Center and of the States, we are seeing the development of bands of people who go from State to State simply to circulate petitions, and--"
1998.97-930,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,689.201,698.615,"And don't they have to provide you with their... you could require them to provide you with their name and address so that even though they're itinerant you can still... you know, you can find who they were."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,698.615,707.232,"--We may know that they live in California, but we cannot subpoena them in California and we cannot prosecute them for having engaged in fraud."
1998.97-930,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.232,710.764,Have you ever prosecuted any petition gatherer?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,710.764,712.216,"Yes, we have."
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.603,728.505,Were these gatherers or signers?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,728.505,729.587,These were gatherers.
1998.97-930,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,729.587,739.884,"I'll grant you it would be easier if you didn't have to go to California, but I mean, if the fraud is serious you can start an extradition proceeding, can't you?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,739.884,744.587,"We were not able to, as a practical matter, do that in this situation."
1998.97-930,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,744.587,747.239,"Well, why, because it cost too much money?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,747.239,756.804,"It would have... we had a problem with our... because it is a misdemeanor in some situations, we would not be able to do that."
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.33,769.984,But the only justification for the registration requirement you've given us is that it's easier to find their address if they're registered.
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,770.343,771.344,No.
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,779.99,785.356,"Well, you can require that they be residents without requiring that they be registered voters."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,785.356,791.19,We could have a process that would require them to swear an oath saying that they--
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,791.19,793.34,"I'm a resident, and this is my address."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,793.34,795.351,--residence when they begin the--
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.351,795.521,Right.
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,795.521,796.413,--initiative process--
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.413,796.583,Right.
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,796.583,797.813,--and then when they end.
1998.97-930,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,797.813,798.273,But you also--
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,798.273,799.375,It's a question of timing.
1998.97-930,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,799.375,812.054,"--You also said, I think, it was much easier for the State to determine whether someone was actually a registered voter or not than to determine whether they're actually a resident."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,812.054,813.033,That is correct.
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.033,814.555,How many of these people are we talking about?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,826.222,827.544,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,827.544,835.309,And how many people are you talking... how many of these election gypsies are there who wander around from State to State?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,835.309,840.581,There can be several hundreds in any--
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.581,841.813,Several hundreds?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,841.813,845.476,--In any given petition there may be several hundred circulators.
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,845.476,846.956,It's not a whole lot of people.
1998.97-930,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,846.956,862.346,"May I ask on candidate petitions, petitions circulated in order to enable someone to run as a candidate in an election, they also use petition circulators."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,862.346,863.485,That is correct.
1998.97-930,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,863.485,868.26,Does Colorado law require that those circulators be registered voters?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,868.26,869.091,"Yes, it does."
1998.97-930,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,869.091,880.829,So presumably the same argument made here today with regard to the petition circulation would apply to candidate petitions as well--
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,880.829,881.6,That is correct.
1998.97-930,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,881.6,883.521,--if the respondents are correct.
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,883.521,884.593,That is correct.
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,884.593,905.165,"Suppose that it were shown that in most cases in Colorado initiatives were circulated by paid solicitors who didn't really care which side they were on, they were just doing it to get the pay, they'd circulate a petition on either side of any issue."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,929.981,948.856,"The Burdick approach that we would urge the Court to adopt recognizes that there is both core speech aspect, where there would be a severe burden on that speech, potentially, and the ability of the States to have a regulatory process."
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,948.856,973.95,"Burdick was in the context of a primary election, with rules about parties and so forth, and the assumption of Meyers was that a core speech function, a very viable speech function in the initiative process takes place at the signature gathering stage, so that it's not analogous to the candidate qualifying thing, and I'm asking if you think that distinction holds."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,973.95,981.667,"Meyer, I believe, did not adequately recognize the other aspects of the process."
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,990.053,1000.338,"Are you saying that core speech does not take place routinely in the signature gathering process, and you're denying that as an empirical matter that the Court is factually wrong?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1000.338,1000.979,--No.
1998.97-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1002.151,1003.683,"Well, you can say we're wrong if you think we're wrong."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1003.683,1013.25,"--In terms of advocacy, that is one part of it, but there are several transactions taking place simultaneously."
1998.97-930,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1013.25,1017.632,"How much do we actually know about this, or how much did we know about it in Meyer?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1040.529,1049.845,We believe the State and Local Government Center in its brief has presented a fairly accurate view of what the transaction ordinarily looks like.
1998.97-930,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1060.571,1074.171,"Why does the State insist that the circulator have to have the circulator's name on a badge, as opposed to just saying, volunteer, or paid circulator?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1074.171,1080.186,That is to address the problem that we have of trying to maintain the integrity of the process as it is going along.
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1101.639,1102.47,Has this been a problem?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1102.831,1104.742,"Yes, it has, and that is reflected in the record."
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1104.742,1109.416,"--How often, of paying people to sign petitions?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1109.416,1114.719,That is... that has been a problem that has been prosecuted.
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1115.628,1116.38,How often?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1119.061,1121.762,--There have not been recent prosecutions on that.
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.762,1124.744,"Have there been any prosecutions, recent or otherwise?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1124.744,1127.507,I believe that there are some earlier cases on that.
1998.97-930,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1129.479,1153.174,"General Norton, if you have the petition with the person's name on it, and you have a badge that says, paid solicitor, and the sponsor's name, just not that person's name, then the burden that you have been informing us of is substantially reduced, is it not?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1171.427,1181.123,--We've had an example that is reflected in the record where the opponent saw a petition circulator misrepresenting the contents of the petition.
1998.97-930,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1189.338,1203.407,"But if you knew the sponsor, if the sponsor had to be identified, if you had everything that you now require on the badge, why... and you have the picture, well, the sponsor knows who's been hired, don't they?"

1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1255.983,1266.031,That is something that has been largely dictated by Federal legislation in recent years that has caused us to make our laws less strict.
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.031,1266.201,I see.
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1270.773,1273.137,We used to be more careful than we currently are.

I'll assume for argument's sake that you're right, that there's an aspect in which this petition gatherer is like a voting official who sits in a booth, so the State can regulate, but that petition gatherer is also a person who's likely to try to persuade someone to sign the petition, and to that extent there's speech involved, persuasive political speech, so if I think there's both, what standard do I apply, and which case do you look to to give me the right standard?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1333.644,1337.227,I would urge you to look at the Burdick standard.

1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1363.464,1371.749,--Having a flexible standard such that a severe burden on speech would cause a strict scrutiny standard to be applied.
1998.97-930,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1371.749,1372.019,"--What about Buckley, too?"
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1372.019,1372.851,Pardon?
1998.97-930,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1372.851,1373.221,Buckley.

1998.97-930,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1375.623,1375.863,All right.

1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1422.855,1430.439,I would urge the Burdick standard as allowing the examination of both of those aspects.

1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1558.176,1560.568,That is correct.

1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.403,1716.355,And identification as a paid solicitor?
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1719.748,1725.612,--The requirement that by badge they identify themselves as paid solicitors was stricken by the Tenth Circuit.
1998.97-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.612,1726.102,It was also--
1998.97-930,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1726.102,1731.275,"--Yes, but as far as I understand, they were doing that in connection with a name as well."
1998.97-930,0,25851,gale_norton,,1744.663,1746.796,But the Tenth Circuit did not differentiate.
1998.97-930,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1748.816,1751.259,"Very well, General Norton."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1752.94,1755.871,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.807,1781.307,You think it takes fortification?
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1782.709,1783.05,I--

1998.97-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1809.419,1812.041,"Well, Meyer was different factually in a way."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1837.827,1841.23,"Mr. Chief Justice, I beg to differ with you on that issue."

1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1849.184,1849.865,--I--
1998.97-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.865,1851.495,I'm talking about the facts.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1851.495,1862.832,"--I'd say that the facts because of facts differ, that evidence that was presented in this case was not necessarily the same evidence presented in Meyer."
1998.97-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.208,1877.414,"But Meyer was... as I recall was paid circulators, and here we're talking about different requirements."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1879.224,1880.166,I understand.
1998.97-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1880.166,1882.868,--really a prohibition against paid circulators.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1882.868,1884.026,"Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.97-930,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1901.908,1905.841,I didn't think we were dealing with residents versus nonresidents.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1912.966,1913.146,--Yes--
1998.97-930,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1913.146,1914.316,Thank you.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1914.316,1915.237,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1998.97-930,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1916.587,1926.214,"Now, at the same time, I guess Colorado, like other States, requires a certain number of signatures from registered voters."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1926.214,1926.905,That is correct.
1998.97-930,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1926.905,1931.61,"A certain percentage, in order to gain access to the ballot for a petition."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1931.61,1932.058,That is correct.
1998.97-930,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1932.829,1945.729,"Now, under your theory, I guess, that also inhibits speech, because it deters the filing of these initiative petitions."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1945.729,1946.667,--Your Honor--
1998.97-930,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1946.667,1950.731,What if Colorado tried to increase the number of signatures required?
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1950.731,1971.644,"--Your Honor, in terms of how I'm addressing this issue with regard to registered circulators who are aggrieved in the speech process, I do believe there might be a different analysis that would attend whether or not or how the State assures that it has a modicum of public support for the measure so it's on the ballot."
1998.97-930,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1971.644,1975.918,"Well, does strict scrutiny apply to that requirement, in your view?"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1975.918,1978.439,"In my opinion, yes."
1998.97-930,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1978.439,1979.06,Mm hmm.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1979.06,1981.001,Because I believe that--
1998.97-930,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1981.001,1983.121,So that's the next step we'll face.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1983.121,1984.493,--It's possible.
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1984.493,1986.104,Why do you say--
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1986.104,1988.705,"--haven't even paid for that yet or volunteered yet, Your Honor."
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.705,1991.109,--Why do you insist on making your case harder?
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,1991.216,1993.938,Because I'm asked the questions.
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1993.938,2000.954,It seems to me it's quite a different issue how many votes you need to get.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2015.433,2017.025,"Oh, I... no, Your Honor, I don't."
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2023.14,2023.701,That is very different.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2040.72,2042.4,--I was asked that question.
1998.97-930,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2060.696,2061.474,But let me ask you--
1998.97-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2061.474,2070.82,--What about the requirement in most States that there's certain qualifications for circulating nominating petitions.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2080.978,2093.607,"Not to the same extent, because he's proceeding with... I think this Court has consistently drawn a distinction between ballot initiative, where there's a discussion of issues and a discussion of candidates."
1998.97-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2093.607,2093.946,Well--
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2093.946,2095.518,But of course they are engaging--
1998.97-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.518,2103.012,"--You know... so the person in the shopping center collecting signatures says, vote for this anti tax referendum."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2114.27,2135.791,"--Well, the State's interest differs, because under the State... in the State of Colorado, Chief Justice, we have a situation where the people reserve to themselves the right to petition or circulate a citizen's initiative and, in fact, the State's involvement does not occur until that petition itself is submitted to the Secretary of State for approval of the measure in terms of being placed on the ballot."
1998.97-930,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2135.791,2143.058,But I thought people reserved to themselves the right to decide what candidates will get enough signatures to have their names go on the ballot.

1998.97-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.282,2183.894,"Well, let's analyze the thing without necess... without any--"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2183.894,2184.104,--Certainly.
1998.97-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2184.104,2187.128,--more on a factual basis.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2208.65,2218.388,"Because the State... Chief Justice, the State's interest in curtailing debate and consideration and discussion is significantly less in the former than in the latter."
1998.97-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2236.19,2238.211,"Mr. O'Toole, may I ask you a factual question about a--"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2238.211,2239.012,"--Yes, Justice."
1998.97-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2239.012,2239.532,--Colorado law?
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2239.532,2240.193,"Yes, Justice."
1998.97-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2240.193,2244.095,"The provision being challenged here, such as a requirement to wear a badge--"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2244.095,2244.525,Yes.
1998.97-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.525,2247.266,--do they apply to candidate solicitation?
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2251.199,2253.62,"As a factual question it may, but it doesn't."
1998.97-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2254.371,2256.702,"What do you mean, it may but it doesn't?"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2257.942,2259.875,"--No, I'm sorry, you said it may."
1998.97-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2259.875,2260.376,"No, no, no."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2263.867,2275.624,"In fact, it does not apply to recall or candidate petition, the badge requirement, or the paid circulator badge requirement, or the paid circulator reporting requirements do not apply to either the--"
1998.97-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2275.624,2276.225,So the issue--
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2276.225,2278.676,--candidate's petition or the recall petition.
1998.97-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.676,2291.014,"--So if we uphold this... the judgment that we're reviewing, that will have no impact one way or another on any existing Colorado law applying to the solicitation of names to put a candidate's name on the ballot."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2291.014,2292.055,That's correct.
1998.97-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2292.055,2292.997,Could I ask--
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2292.997,2300.363,"--It's hard to see that there's a compelling State interest in having this information if the State doesn't require it for these other matters, isn't it?"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2300.363,2304.337,I... we fail to see a compelling State interest in--
1998.97-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2304.337,2305.216,But is it possible--
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2305.216,2306.327,--in... sorry.
1998.97-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2306.327,2307.629,--that... the compelling State interest--
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2307.629,2307.948,Excuse me.
1998.97-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2307.948,2320.496,"--I take it that's being advanced is that they're afraid that petition gatherers who are paid will say to people in shopping centers, I'll give you a dollar if you sign the petition."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2359.891,2362.103,"The answer is no, Justice."
1998.97-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2362.103,2362.413,Why not?
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2362.413,2371.86,And the reason is that the State interest in avoiding the possibility or view of corruption simply isn't present in a balloting issue.
1998.97-930,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2371.86,2372.551,Mr. O'Toole--
1998.97-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2372.551,2393.264,"--No, I said what their issue... what their justification is, is that we're afraid that Arco or some big company, and maybe it's not true in Colorado, but it's certainly true in California, that very often large companies want measures on the ballot, and they'll pay people to gather signatures."
1998.97-930,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2411.717,2435.953,"--Mr. O'Toole, may I just intervene at that point, because they're... we're talking as though there were no measures in California, and I think it ought to be taken out of this case that how much the sponsor paid must indeed be disclosed, and the Tenth Circuit upheld that final report without any ifs, ands, or buts, so the sponsor must tell how much it is paying to get this measure on the ballot."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2435.953,2438.264,"That is correct, how much has been expended, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.97-930,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2438.264,2449.841,"In addition, there must be the name of the collector of signatures on each one of these petition collection sheets that he hands the--"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2449.841,2453.315,"On every individual petition section, the name of the circulator appears."
1998.97-930,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2453.315,2459.028,"--And that would be plus the sponsor, so we're not talking about a void of information."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2475.177,2477.5,Our answer is no.
1998.97-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2489.729,2493.76,"Well, in a sense any regulations may hinder the process."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2501.116,2503.988,"Chief... Chief Justice, of course they can regulate it, and they do."
1998.97-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2508.379,2511.742,But I'm trying to get this... this is what I'm thinking.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2552.52,2565.378,"--What is sought in Colorado, Justice, is a prophylactic measure to assist the efficiency of the State at the cost of the First Amendment."
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.286,2600.43,I thought you had no objection to applying to your situation what Justice Breyer is worried about applying to contributors.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2601.622,2602.633,--I have no objection to that--
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.633,2603.252,--to disclosing--
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2603.252,2604.123,--None.
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.123,2611.068,"--who the circulators are and that they're paid and how much money is paid, and all of that is, indeed, disclosed, isn't it?"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2611.068,2613.63,"Your Honor, it is disclosed on the petition."
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2613.63,2621.974,"So what Justice Breyer should be asking you is, what if we required contributors to candidates to go around wearing a button that says, contributor to candidate?"
1998.97-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2623.935,2627.087,"I know you're going to say yes, and I know what--"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2630.34,2630.711,I'm glad you know that.
1998.97-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2630.711,2635.545,"Now... maybe what I should be asking, but what I actually am asking, is--"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2635.545,2636.116,"Thank you, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2636.116,2639.166,--Is why you made that concession?
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2646.873,2667.676,"Your Honor, in fact, as we tried this case, and as we presented in our complaint, we did not make that concession, and in fact we challenged the affidavit requirement because we believed there were more or less restrictive means in which to gather the ensuring of a modicum of State support was there."
1998.97-930,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2668.016,2675.862,"Well, that I don't understand based on Buckley, because if... let's just make it with a volunteer contributor."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2700.547,2706.333,"--The public does know, in Colorado, who has contributed to a citizens' initiative."
1998.97-930,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2723.034,2728.227,"But I thought you just said you objected to the whole thing, including the report--"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2728.227,2728.407,--No.
1998.97-930,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2728.407,2740.274,"--that the sponsor has to file, which as I understand it says, I am the sponsor of the initiative, here it is ready to go on the ballot, I spent X amount for paid solicitation."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2740.274,2743.706,"In fact, Justice Ginsburg, I apologize if I gave you that impression."
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2772.357,2774.328,But you're not appealing that here.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2774.328,2775.6,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.6,2776.879,So for present purposes--
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2776.879,2777.359,That's correct.
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2777.359,2780.482,"--why don't you be magnanimous and say, we accept all of that?"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2787.816,2793.652,"At this juncture, it is certainly more than adequate information to allow the State to proceed with any interest they have."
1998.97-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2801.537,2802.699,Would you--
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2802.699,2804.208,"Yes, Justice--"
1998.97-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2804.208,2825.913,"--think it constitutional to require in bold face type on the front, as a cover sheet for any initiative that a voter signs, the statement, this init... this petition is being circulated by a paid circulator, or an unpaid circulator, as the case may be?"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2826.952,2856.792,"--Yes, I would, and it would be the same objection that we have to the badge, Justice Kennedy, and the reason I'd object to it is that the protection that's accorded to somebody that's paid in this sacred area of political discussion is the same, and there is no reason... there are three... I think we have... you know, basically this disclosure says that we have the... forces the individual to fear... I mean, or have the risk of fear of Government reprisal--"
1998.97-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2856.792,2857.152,Now--
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2857.152,2857.733,--All right.
1998.97-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2858.624,2863.026,--It seems to me that this promotes free speech rather than retards it.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2871.952,2878.507,It does not promote free speech of the individual seeking to speech... to speak.
1998.97-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2889.534,2897.227,"--What's the evil that follows from my hypothetical, because you know what's next, because I'm going to say, well, what's wrong with, say, a badge... forget the badge."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2897.227,2897.918,Forget the badge.
1998.97-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2897.918,2900.109,Let's say that it's right on the affidavit.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2905.815,2917.553,"It is our position that that prophylactic... whatever... for whatever... first off, is there a reason for that?"
1998.97-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2919.133,2924.316,"Oh, the State says this gives information to the voter that the voter would need."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2924.316,2930.25,--That's not a compelling State interest that overcomes the right of the individual to participate in anonymous speech.
1998.97-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2932.302,2932.931,It's not anonymous.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2937.725,2940.648,That individual does not have to speak.
1998.97-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2946.111,2947.6,"Well, but you allow it on the disclosure report."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2947.6,2948.371,Ah.
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2971.105,2971.365,Could you--
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2971.365,2971.957,--commit fraud than--
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2971.957,2982.673,"--Could you require a statement on a candidate petition that says at the top, circulated by someone who expects a job--"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2991.21,2992.83,--It certainly would be--
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2992.83,2993.211,Why not require that?
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2993.211,2995.923,--Could you require that.
1998.97-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2997.696,2998.775,That's a tough one.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,2998.775,2999.756,--You could require that.
1998.97-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3016.358,3035.341,"Then why do... why can you then... why could you then compel a company to state in the newspaper that it is contributed $1,000 to Joe Jones, who's a candidate, in the form of promising to give him an employment contract as soon as he's finished."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3039.312,3040.374,I would say--
1998.97-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3040.374,3042.063,Then why couldn't you?
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3044.276,3046.478,--You're... the part of the speech that you're compelling is not the contribution.
1998.97-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3051.401,3052.753,I suppose another--
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3052.753,3053.351,--and the political purpose.
1998.97-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3053.351,3057.865,"--I suppose another answer to my question is, if it's important to the voter, you can ask, are you been paid or not."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3059.037,3059.335,They can ask.
1998.97-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3084.383,3087.895,"--Mr. O'Toole, may I ask you another question about the state of the record?"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3118.306,3118.914,Justice Stevens--
1998.97-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.914,3119.684,Does the evidence support that?
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3119.684,3123.057,"--Justice Stevens, we argued in the brief we think the evidence--"
1998.97-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3123.057,3124.409,"No, I'm not asking what you argued in the brief."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3124.409,3124.437,--I'm sorry.
1998.97-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3124.437,3129.542,"I'm asking you what's in the... what evidence was adduced in the trial court, and what findings, if any, were made?"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3129.542,3132.675,The evidence is more indirect than direct.
1998.97-930,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3151.018,3154.549,Does that indicate how many people were responsible for those fraudulent signatures?
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3154.549,3157.792,--Looked like 15... 9 to 15.
1998.97-930,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3185.601,3192.797,But does the evidence show how many of those who did perpetrate fraud were paid and how many were unpaid?
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3192.797,3206.225,"--The only evidence is that 9 to 15 individuals who were paid circulators may have engaged in fraud, 3 of whom got convicted of forgery."
1998.97-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3218.033,3219.905,"They forged names, I guess--"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3219.905,3220.072,--That's--
1998.97-930,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3220.072,3222.556,--rather than writing in the identity of individuals.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3222.556,3223.117,--They forged names.
1998.97-930,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3226.369,3230.142,"Well, then you're saying there was evidence that they had committed fraud."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3230.142,3230.954,Absolutely.
1998.97-930,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3230.954,3231.194,Okay.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3236.647,3237.458,None.
1998.97-930,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3237.458,3238.428,Okay.
1998.97-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3238.428,3244.601,"And is there any evidence in any other State... I mean, this occurred in a State which had these requirements which they're trying to defend."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3248.535,3262.125,"There was evidence that in the State of Washington, and that's a higher quantum of signatures needed to show a modicum of support, that there was likewise approximately 1,500 signatures."
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3294.085,3296.727,"--Do these circulators get... they get paid by the name, is that--"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3296.727,3298.287,--They get paid by the--
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3298.287,3303.162,"--So when they forge a name they are cheating not just the State, they're cheating the person who hired them."
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3303.162,3303.921,--Absolutely.
1998.97-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3303.921,3308.374,So I assume he would have an interest in preventing their fraud as well.
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3308.374,3312.368,And in fact when I... I was involved in the Worker's Choice of Care Amendment.
1998.97-930,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3317.631,3327.969,"Whatever you did, does the State of Colorado have any laws that are aimed at the sponsor, the one who pays, as distinguished from the person who receives the payment?"
1998.97-930,1,37235,neil_d_otoole,,3327.969,3342.097,"Well, to the extent that a sponsor involves himself or herself in fraud, they are likewise going to be... could likewise be penalty... penalized--"
