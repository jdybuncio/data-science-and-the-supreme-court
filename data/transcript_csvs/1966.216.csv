1966.216,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,25.231,"Number 216, National Labor Relations Board, Petitioner, versus Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company et al."
1966.216,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,26.604,32.264,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.216,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,408.656,410.407,"Well, how far does that go?"
1966.216,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,435.532,446.821,"Not anything, but they have agreed by joining the union to be governed by majority rule of that union."
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,1523.56,1525.126,May it please the Court.
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1563.195,1568.629,"What if the union rules were that there would be no strike codes, the officers just decided it?"
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,1568.629,1576.542,"Mr. Justice White, the common law courts have given relief in that situation for about a hundred years and they have been very rigorous and we cite many cases."
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.36,1578.898,Well that isn't --
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,1578.898,1590.731,"Where any exceeding of the union's constitutional powers and the norm that's applied in the fairness of the procedures is grounds, not only for setting aside fines, but for setting aside suspensions and expulsions."
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.685,1597.658,Would you say there would -- there could be a fine if there wasn't a strike code?
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,1597.658,1609.679,"There could be no fine which the courts -- the common law courts would enforce under any property or con -- contract theory whether you would have a violation of the statute here, there's a different question that I would say not, and I will get to that if you permit it."
1966.216,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1684.698,1689.968,"American Ship Building didn't involve concerted action among employers, it was a single employer, wasn't it?"
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,1689.968,1704.022,"I say -- I say the -- the American Ship held that the employer can invade the right to work under Section 7 of every single one of his employees as a warning device if he decides to lock them out, he -- a concerted work stoppage denial of the right to work."
1966.216,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1722.939,1730.194,"Well, I'm sure you're going to develop this, but it seems to me there's nothing here about the -- anybody's right to go out on strike if he wants to."
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,1734.425,1749.885,"Well, the Section 7 would give the employees all of the right not to engage in a concerted work refusal, and prior to American Ship, that were meant not to be made parties to a consider work refusal whether initiated by the union, by a strike or by the employer by a lockout."
1966.216,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1849.69,1863.413,"That provision for respect to the acquisition of membership certainly must have many, many limitations because it certainly wouldn't enable the union to require solidarity on American foreign policies --"
1966.216,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1863.424,1866.089,"-- solidarity on politics, solidarity on --"
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,1866.089,1875.389,"It should obviously be read to mean the kinds of re -- requirements for the acquisition of membership which unions have traditionally imposed, and this is the most traditional of all that has ever been imposed."
1966.216,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1885.325,1889.376,"I gather in Machinist v. Street, well that was a railway labor case."
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,1893.019,1900.338,"And we believe in that -- and we believe in Street now and we believe it applies under National Labor Relations Act as well, though this Court has not yet so held."
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2108.922,2112.285,"Well, would you say the same rule applies to the wildcat strike?"
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2112.285,2128.028,"We say that we have made an argument, Your Honor please, that at some length that if the unions may not use their disciplinary procedures over those who insist on working during a valid strike, they also may not use their disciplinary procedures in against those who insist on wildcat and we think that adds to the --"
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.028,2130.114,How about the reverse -- how about the reverse?
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2136.475,2152.593,"We can fine them for working and we can fine them for not working, and we have just had a case which is in our supplemental brief which came to public notoriety here last week in Mansfield, Ohio where the whole union was trustee and the officers were from removed from office because a wildcat strike was continuing."
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.237,2160.788,You can enforce a no-strike clause in effect that enforce it by fining members who walk off the job.
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2160.788,2163.615,"More than that Your Honor, we could -- even if their on a no-strike clause."
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.615,2163.644,I see.
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2163.644,2165.161,No contract had yet been negotiated.
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2440.273,2454.768,"Mr. Silard, would you say that the union could perhaps bring a court action against the recalcitrant employees who are working instead of striking?"
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2454.768,2456.592,"To force them not to work, Your Honor?"
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.592,2457.319,In an injunction.
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2459.371,2459.93,Well --
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.93,2460.017,I don't know.
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2460.017,2465.568,"I suppose -- I suppose the -- the answer to that question may have to wait the answer to the question that's here, because if --"
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2465.568,2466.719,That's right.
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2466.719,2467.227,-- if they'll --
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.227,2472.371,"If they can find -- if you win here, could you go to Court against them?"
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2472.371,2481.108,"I think I wouldn't want to say categorically that there might not be a defense, but I would say that if one of the lines of -- if there are number or arguments before the Court, on which this decision concur."
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.224,2536.859,"And you would, I suppose you would say that -- that if you win the question of whether how large the fine can be is, this is irrelevant to 8 (b) (1), I mean maybe there's some other ways that you wouldn't have to pay too large a fine."
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2536.859,2544.233,"Now, Congress meant to leave fines and discipline within the ambit of the union's discretion, and the power of the common law courts to -- to control."
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.968,2573.745,"Well, maybe you've never fined anybody more than $100, but I supposed that literally read -- does it permit $100 a day?"
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2573.745,2579.193,"No, literally read, our constitution permits no more than $100 day -- $100 a day, page 37 of the record."
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2579.193,2580.944,"No, no more than $100 a day."
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2580.944,2596.153,"No, it permits no more than $100 against any charged member, and we have found not a single case anywhere, never mind in our own union in which this theory which one of the two locals in this case misguidedly suggest but then it really only suggested it."
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.253,2621.146,But it needn't be that way.
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2621.146,2622.163,It needn't be that way --
1966.216,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.163,2623.159,But you haven't argued there.
1966.216,1,32788,john_silard,,2623.159,2644.931,"-- there have been cases in which very large fines have been set and there are cases in the courts in which such fines, not only are not enforced, but in which members who are suspended or discharged from the union for not paying such fines have been reinstated by the common law courts on the ground that property and contract rights were involved and that courts could take protective action."
1966.216,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2647.202,2655.71,Mr. Seham.
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,2655.71,2658.727,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1966.216,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2823.04,2832.428,"As I read your brief, you're trying to draw a line between those who voluntarily joined union and those who are forced in by reason of that clause?"
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,2832.428,2836.304,Well I -- I don't think I necessarily have to draw that line Your Honor.
1966.216,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2848.085,2851.577,Your clients are not voluntary members.
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,2851.577,2884.197,"And that's -- that's true Your Honor, and I would submit that the employees in the Allis-Chalmers case are not in fact voluntary members, and I would submit that it is very difficult to conceive of any situation in which an employee is a voluntary member when we think of voluntarism in the sense of a knowing a free, an unimpeded waiver surrendered of a statutory right."
1966.216,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2884.197,2885.785,"Well, that's pretty legalistic, isn't it?"
1966.216,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2885.785,2888.077,Perhaps I -- excuse me.
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,2888.077,2890.021,I'm sure it's not to be le -- legalistic.
1966.216,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2895.582,2902.347,"Perhaps I missed part of your argument, but I -- I understood the statute can't have involuntary membership."
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,2907.967,2918.862,"I think that is so, but again if we're to -- the -- the argument that I am trying to respond to is that there has been a voluntarily waiver of a statutory right."
1966.216,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3046.271,3052.144,Is this what you mean by the phrase in your brief compulsory labor membership?
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,3052.144,3052.232,Well --
1966.216,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3052.232,3058.302,Do you say that people not knowing that they don't have to join the union joined anyway?
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,3058.302,3060.58,"I think that's right, I think that's --"
1966.216,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3060.58,3062.019,That's what it comes down then?
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,3062.019,3067.041,I think that is right and I think it is certainly applicable in our situation.
1966.216,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3082.056,3084.251,"That's not really before us now, is it?"
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,3084.251,3103.937,"No, but -- but it is in part responsive to a suggestion which was, I think, made by Mr. Silard to the effect that well, Allis-Chalmers, you know, knew what the obligations of the employees were and he assumes or he thinks or they -- they would've informed them of their -- of their rights under the situation."
1966.216,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3103.937,3135.28,"What you're saying is perhaps Justice Douglas did inquire it is that this is not really a matter of the union membership who fines applicable to people who voluntarily join unions because there are some other people like these Times -- New York Times advertising salesman, whoever is involved here, who sort of inadvertently and lack of knowing any better, seduced him to join the union, is that what you're saying?"
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,3135.28,3145.329,"I think that's one way of putting it Your Honor, but I think another way of putting it is to emphasize the fact that what we are dealing with is a statutory right."
1966.216,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3170.226,3176.275,That might be a defense -- that might be a defense in the action to collect a fine.
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,3177.682,3199.411,"Well, it may not be relevant except to the extent that I believe the solicitor's and the union's primary argument is, and again I paraphrase Mr. Marshall, to the effect that the Section 7 right does not exist in this situation because they opted to surrender it."
1966.216,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3327.074,3347.061,"Suppose the -- suppose the union fined these men for conducting wild -- wildcat strike instead of for the conduct that's complained up here, would you say that that is permissible?"
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,3347.061,3364.339,"It might be Your Honor, because when we're talking about a wildcat strike, we are talking about the -- an infringement on the authority which the union does in fact have and has in fact been taken away from the employees."
1966.216,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3398.54,3400.721,I wonder if we are talking about different things.
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,3433.252,3435.763,Well I -- I do have an answer to that Your Honor.
1966.216,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3435.763,3438.389,"Well, that's what I'm asking."
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,3438.389,3443.341,But I've also gotten a note which reminds me that Mr. Equitz also has an answer.
1966.216,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3444.443,3453.849,"I know but I think both of you are arguing, I'd like to have the argu -- argument of both of you to find out if there's any disagreement between you."
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,3453.849,3461.822,"Well, I -- a -- as I say, I -- I do not think that -- well let me -- let me put it in another way."
1966.216,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3468.321,3470.333,"No, no I'm not talking about that."
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,3483.232,3489.852,"In my argument I would say, in face of the no-strike clause during the term of the contract, yes."
1966.216,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3489.852,3492.143,Suppose there's no-strike clause in it?
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,3492.143,3502.119,There's not any -- I -- I would think then that the union could not fine them.
1966.216,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3502.119,3503.482,Very well.
1966.216,2,36771,martin_c_seham,,3503.482,3507.389,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1966.216,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3507.389,3511.847,Mr. Equitz.
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3511.847,3515.215,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.216,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3538.892,3539.257,Yes.
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3539.257,3548.485,"It may be in a situation where there was an exclusive, even where there was an exclusive agency that not all the employees in the unit may be members."
1966.216,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3556.507,3558.248,And these people were members?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3558.248,3560.341,"Yes, we are speaking now of members."
1966.216,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3560.341,3562.55,Yes.
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3562.55,3567.196,The question then whether the union may take action is in two parts.
1966.216,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3620.898,3628.463,I thought Section 7 protected the right not to work as well as the right to work.
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3628.463,3632.302,"Yes, if the Court please, the distinction is this."
1966.216,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3691.314,3697.799,We'll recess then now.
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3702.161,3706.825,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3757.025,3762.833,Do you think that's true whether or not there's a no-strike clause in the agreement?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3762.833,3764.429,"Yes Your Honor, I do."
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3764.429,3768.241,Even if there's a no-strike -- even if there's not a no-strike clause?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3768.241,3769.661,Yes Your Honor that is correct.
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3769.661,3775.876,No group of employees has a protected right not to work unless the union authorizes it?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3775.876,3787.265,"Where there is an established bargaining agency, the right that employees have is to pursue affirmatively collective bargaining activity only through that bargaining agency."
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3787.265,3790.996,And you don't think -- but you don't think the reversal?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3790.996,3796.421,"Well, the other proposition is not the reverse of that proposition."
1966.216,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3796.421,3798.606,"Well, why not?"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3800.55,3802.847,The reason for it is this.
1966.216,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3811.936,3812.103,Yes.
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3812.146,3812.532,Striking does this.
1966.216,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3812.532,3823.116,"-- here the labor -- labor union though says, ""Alright fellows, we're going -- we're not going to enter in the bargaining agreement, we're going out on strike""."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3846.947,3848.084,I would say it does not hold to --
1966.216,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3848.084,3851.655,Justice White has asked you.
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3851.655,3870.974,I would say it does not hold true because it was so plainly the reason for protection that employees be given a choice whether to participate in or to refrain from participating in concerted union activities that the law was drafted with that purpose precisely.
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3872.773,3879.79,Does it state concerted view -- concerted act?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3879.79,3891.396,"Yes, it says concerted activity or collective bargaining activity through representatives of the choo -- choosing of the employees, I believe is the full text of Section 7."
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3932.76,3938.957,Do you have the words that to be one of the -- one of the -- these collective bargaining agents are certified members?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3938.957,3944.011,Not with respect to the right of employees to refrain from collective bargaining activity.
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3944.011,3953.338,"Yes, but where they held -- where there are union members in a -- in a bargaining union, there's no place of bargaining contract."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3960.219,3970.002,Well then perhaps there can be one only with respect -- it would have significance only with respect to the employees exposing themselves to employer action.
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3978.006,3998.342,"So they have protective rights under Section 7, isn't that one of these protective rights still unless there's a -- there is a bargaining agent to -- then he loses his right to -- to go to work when the union says don't go to work."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,3998.342,3999.517,"No, that is not correct."
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4010.757,4018.454,"If the bargaining agent is certified, he -- he loses half of that, one side of that but not the other."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4018.454,4023.871,"Yes that is, I think, a fair way of expressing it."
1966.216,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4108.933,4125.957,"Suppose these -- suppose these men instead of going to work had set up a counter picket line saying ""We believe this -- this strike is wrong and we believe that it should not be maintained""."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4140.767,4144.796,The right -- there might be a question of this kind.
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4241.36,4245.24,Suppose they were to stop belonging to the union?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4255.032,4270.65,"If an employee were not a union member had in some fashion validly placed himself in the status of nonmember, the union would simply have no authority by any approach to impose discipline of this fine type on the individual."
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4270.65,4274.534,And could he stop right at the time they called a strike?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4274.534,4275.318,"No, Your Honor."
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4296.929,4300.022,Would that be consistent with the statute?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4300.022,4307.895,"Yes, it is consistent for a union to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition and retention of membership, yes Your Honor it would be."
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4307.895,4318.444,"But that would deprive them of advantage which I thought many claimed to consider much weight, like values to get out when there won't be."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4318.444,4319.828,Exactly so.
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4335.039,4337.242,"Practicalities, but what does the law provide for that?"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4337.242,4344.173,The law provides that rules of this type are not within the prohibition of the 8 (b) (1) (A).
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4344.173,4345.421,What Section says this?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4345.421,4356.969,"The proviso to Section 8 (b) (1) (A), accepts from the scope of that prohibition the rules with respect to the acquisition and retention of union membership."
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4365.692,4371.696,Left with authority to require people to belong to the union who do not want to and hold their job?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4371.696,4372.884,Yes it's --
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4372.884,4377.192,So long as it's put in the form of a rule or what?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4377.192,4391.73,"Yes, the union is left with the authority to make provision that once individuals have become members of the union that that union membership may become terminated only on the terms of the existing union rules."
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4417.403,4418.644,They what?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4418.644,4427.074,They failed to provide with one single detail that the union rules required be followed in order that membership be terminated.
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4442.698,4453.113,So it is not true that that law provides that a person need not belong to a union or remain a union member if he wants to get out?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4453.113,4469.251,I agree with Your Honor entirely about that in the -- in the regard which we are presently discussing and in one other which I will discuss which is the requirement of an employee covered by a union shop agreement to become a member in the first place.
1966.216,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4482.88,4492.779,"Well, neither that rule nor one on fines is specifically mentioned."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4548.899,4560.878,"The point is quite correct Your Honor that both actions, that is rules with respect to the acquisition and retention of union membership are or may be coercive as well as fines are coercive."
1966.216,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4578.735,4581.767,"Well, where does this specifically say so?"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4581.767,4585.43,It says so in the proviso to Section 8 (b) (1) (A).
1966.216,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4585.43,4587.235,Which reads as how?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4587.235,4602.34,"Which reads lastly, I'll read the whole section because it's very brief."
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4648.128,4650.771,And not about discipline.
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4650.771,4653.259,Discipline -- discipline of --
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4653.259,4655.443,That proviso doesn't speak of discipline.
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4655.443,4658.654,The proviso does not speak of discipline.
1966.216,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4658.654,4673.824,"Well then, if it doesn't, how is the -- in implicit in the -- in the Act that wildcat strikes can be -- you can fine them for engaging in a wildcat strike?"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4673.824,4693.12,"The reason for this is not because of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) or the proviso to 8 (b) (1) (A), it is because Section 7, which is the Section that enumerates the rights which are protected in Section 8 (b) (1) (A) does not include wildcatting."
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4714.997,4716.855,What's the citation of that legislative history?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4718.4,4721.704,This particular citation is not in the brief.
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4732.422,4764.368,"I thought the basic reason for the law in this field of the argument whether good or bad that a man should not be forced to join a union or to remain a member of a union, to stay a member of a union in order to get a job if he ought to have the right to keep that job otherwise without that, and that that carried with it the idea that the two -- two alternatives."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4792.833,4792.968,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4792.968,4801.155,"It seems to me like you say that the union got power to take that away from him from that proviso, and I wouldn't have thought that was right."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4801.155,4819.84,"The proviso itself merely governs the rule, for example in the case of an employee who has become a member, how long he must retain that membership and by what procedures -- by what procedures exclusively he may resort to terminate that membership."
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4925.829,4929.825,"Well, with respect to losing the job that if he pays there is --"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4929.825,4939.397,"That's correct Your Honor, but with respect to the obligation to apply for to request membership and with respect to whose option it is on that subject --"
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4939.397,4942.086,"Yes, but what sanction is there on that?"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4942.086,4955.434,"Well the -- the sanction is that as this Court stated in General Motors, in other contexts the question of the union -- of the employee having the obligation to become a member may have great significance."
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4984.345,4985.874,Irrevocable?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,4985.874,4995.508,"Apparently, if the union were to adopt a very restrictive rule as, indeed the UAW rule is quite restrictive on terminating, it becomes virtually irrevocable."
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4995.508,5008.612,"Well, I suppose about your speaking of the validity of the provision that you can't terminate except for the last ten days of the calendar year."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5018.844,5021.219,I was speaking only of the practical restrictive --
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5021.219,5050.757,"I know but you're speaking of it as an unfair labor practice, it -- it's not clear is it, that if one were to attempt to resign from the union at the time of the strike, and then this provision were applied against him insisting that he was still a member for purposes of a fine, then it would necessarily follow that in a lawsuit the common law would sustain the right of the union to enforce that provision against him."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5050.757,5057.167,"Well, the -- what might be the holding of a case at common law is genuinely problematical."
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5057.167,5079.038,"But you're only -- you're only speaking of it in all that the proviso got is to say that whatever the rules are as to acquisition and retention of membership, the union is free to adopt them and whatever the coercion or restraint that may be involved in that, that type of coercion or restraint is not an unfair labor practice."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5080.786,5091.711,There is available to the Court a recorded and existing and current and most relevant practical example of just what happens.
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5118.053,5120.813,But there was no evidence there that he tried to get out?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5120.813,5121.447,"No, that's correct."
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5121.447,5121.714,Right.
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5121.714,5122.451,There was no evidence --
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5122.451,5128.749,"If there had been, I'm only suggesting that might be a very different case."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5128.749,5138.235,We might get to the basic reason why the protection of Section 7 ran to union members as well as to nonmembers.
1966.216,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5138.235,5142.051,"Before you get there, can I ask you one question?"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5154.649,5156.595,I would say this in an answer.
1966.216,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5174.603,5178.472,"Well apparently, somebody believes it's worth litigating."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5178.472,5191.126,"Yes, there plainly could be in any situation a certain contract defenses of course, regardless whether the principle that a union member is liable to a fine might be advanced."
1966.216,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5191.126,5193.138,"Well, what about my question to you?"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5199.528,5199.586,I would say --
1966.216,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5199.586,5204.179,Would you still believe that you had a labor board unfair practice?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5204.179,5232.304,"Yes Your Honor, and I would refer by analogy to a recent decision of this Court in which in reviewing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which endows defendants with the right not to be prosecuted for non-forcible presence in certain establishments covered by the Act that it was a violation of the Act for even a prosecution that was doomed to failure to be in the error."
1966.216,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5253.699,5270.824,"Well, your position then is that even if the labor union has no power, no right to levy a fine, if the labor union merely talks about levying a fine that that's an unfair labor practice."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5270.824,5278.234,"If the union threatens to levy a fine, yes it would be an unfair labor practice."
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5278.234,5292.412,"But I suppose you would agree that even if this isn't an unfair labor practice then that the union could, as far as 8 (b) (1) is concerned, levy to fine the -- that doesn't necessarily mean it can be collected?"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5292.412,5294.458,"Yes, I think I would agree with that."
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5304.305,5309.835,"Well, you don't -- but do you think we have to know in this case?"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5315.192,5323.879,"I would say that frankly, in most jurisdictions, this issue has never arisen in the common law, so just is not known what the fact is."
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5337.911,5340.443,"Have you got those -- are those in your brief, those cases?"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5340.443,5342.585,That case is cited in several of the briefs.
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5347.531,5348.701,Was there any congestion?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5355.764,5358.296,I don't believe there is any such argument.
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5358.417,5373.339,"Well now, what kind of argument if I correctly remember the opinion of the intermediate Wisconsin Court, for example one of them is that this is a kind of a strike that the union was not authorized to call."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5385.968,5392.731,Well that -- that issue arose in the Court collection suit because the defendant asserted a contract defense.
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5401.245,5404.996,"No suits were brought to collect these fines, were there?"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5404.996,5406.219,"The fines involved in this case, Your Honor?"
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5406.219,5406.742,Yes.
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5406.742,5407.215,Yes sir.
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5407.215,5407.655,"Oh, there were?"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5407.655,5416.902,There is one such pilot suit which was brought to confirm the precedent and the union has been scrupulous in preserving its rights so that the statute of limitations does not --
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5416.902,5418.522,Was a judgment entered against the employee?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5418.522,5419.863,Yes sir.
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5419.863,5421.336,And just one of the suits?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5421.336,5423.006,Just against the one employee.
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5423.006,5424.971,Is that final?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5424.971,5426.903,The judgment is appealable.
1966.216,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5439.131,5447.53,What's the argument -- what's the argument by the employees in the -- in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5448.897,5471.016,"Well, the employees have a variety of arguments.One of them concerning a variety of contract defenses to the collectability of the suit, but the one relevant to this case and the reason why the Court is holding it is that it is a cont -- it is contrary to public policy as expressed in the prohibition of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) of the Federal Act that -- that such a fine should be enforceable."
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5481.781,5485.512,"You referred to them in Wisconsin, the work stoppage."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5485.512,5485.781,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5485.781,5488.824,"Before you cite in the page, would you mind giving the --"
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5488.824,5491.696,Yes Your Honor.
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5491.696,5493.748,11 Wisconsin 2d?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5493.748,5495.592,That's correct.
1966.216,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5535.46,5536.685,U what?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5536.685,5540.956,"UAW, the United Automobile Workers Union versus Woychik."
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5540.956,5543.947,What you say was the page number of 93 N.W.?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5543.947,5547.183,93 N.W.2d page 336.
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5547.183,5548.325,Thank you.
1966.216,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5548.325,5557.83,"Mr. Equitz, you -- you may take three minutes more to sum up if you desire to do so."
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5557.83,5574.445,The point of this case which has been a point of astonishment with the respondent is that actually every element of the offense which is charged in the unfair labor practice complaint here has long since and in a multitude of cases been established.
1966.216,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5734.197,5736.622,And not within the proviso for what reason?
1966.216,3,26923,howard_c_equitz,,5736.622,5746.639,And not within the proviso because the rule applied has nothing to do with -- with rules of the union with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership.
1966.216,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5762.96,5764.113,Mr. Solicitor General.
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5764.113,5767.25,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.216,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5986.09,5987.609,"Well, Mr. Solicitor General."
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5987.609,5989.77,Yes sir.
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5989.77,6005.032,"It may be that the -- it may be that -- that it's not a violation of 8 (b) (1) the unfair labor practice to it, but Section 7 might still nevertheless prevent the collection of the fines that goes, I mean logically might."
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6005.032,6010.398,"Might prevent the collection of the fine, you mean in the common law Court?"
1966.216,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6010.398,6028.185,"Well, in any Court -- in any court just because if it -- if it were held that -- that the right to work during a strike was one of the protected elements covered by Section 7 may be to the fine -- wouldn't it be possible?"
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6028.185,6029.384,I can't conceive of it.
1966.216,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6049.325,6050.968,"Mr. Solicitor, I just want to be sure."
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6062.424,6063.054,It's not req --
1966.216,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6063.054,6064.904,-- affects this?
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6064.904,6065.294,It --
1966.216,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6065.294,6065.947,I mean --
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6065.947,6067.529,-- you don't need --
1966.216,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6067.529,6070.636,-- who leaves it of the -- of any unfair labor practice to it?
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6070.636,6079.244,We don't need the proviso in order to find that this is not an 8 (b) (1) violation.
1966.216,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6079.244,6079.343,Did you say that --
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6079.343,6084.429,The reason being that this was left to the union and there was nothing in the Act --
1966.216,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6084.429,6098.826,"Well, this is Mr. Silard's argument that the whole structure of the Act contemplated that internal affairs of the unions were to be the unions concern at least until the Landrum-Griffin Act amendments in 1959, is that it?"
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6098.826,6119.12,"Well it's -- it's our position, it's much the same, but our position is that there's whether or not the man be voluntarily a member of the union or went in there automatic whatever it is, has nothing to do with provision that it's alright for the union to do this."
1966.216,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6121.392,6125.029,"Well, what provision of the statute says it's alright for the union to do this?"
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6128.168,6131.89,"No, I don't know of any statute wherein the statute says it's alright."
1966.216,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6131.89,6132.817,"Well, let me ask it this way --"
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6132.817,6133.791,I mean it's not a violation.
1966.216,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6133.791,6138.135,-- isn't that the government's argument does not rely on the proviso of Section 8?
1966.216,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6138.135,6138.921,Yes sir.
1966.216,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6166.061,6168.45,Very well.
