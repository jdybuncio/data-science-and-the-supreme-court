1975.75-342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.469,"We’ll hear arguments next in 75-342, Federal Power Commission against Conway."
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,47.438,54.476,Thank you.
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,75.753,85.964,"Mr. Tuttle, you didn’t in your petition I know raised the question of the finality of the Commission’s ruling that was reviewed by the Court of Appeals."
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,105.111,118.149,"It is not a common practice and of course when it occurs, the Commission’s position would ordinarily be and indeed was in the Court of Appeals that the issue was premature."
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,215.432,217.462,But what is Conway’s business?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,217.462,224.966,Conway is a -- there is a municipal electric system in Conway and Conway Corporation manages it.
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,224.966,226.424,In the municipality of Conway?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,226.424,228.739,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.669,715.491,"What if the Court of Appeals had just said the Commission could consider it and not that it was required to consider it, would you regard that holding as wrong?"
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,715.491,717.291,I would Mr. Justice.
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.446,758.824,"Mr. Tuttle, is it not true that in making the determination of reasonableness on the wholesale rate, you do have to make some preliminary judgment as to whether costs are probably allocated, do you not?"
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,758.824,760.209,Absolutely.
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,760.209,765.081,Does that not involve some inquiry under the rate base for the retail rates?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,765.081,769.347,"Well, it involves an allocation, as you say, of costs."
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,787.216,797.087,But you say the statute makes it impermissible for you to look and see -- assume hypothetically that the retail rates were much lower than the wholesale rates and the jurisdiction rate.
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,802.072,809.054,My position is that the wholesale rate has to look at properly allocated wholesale costs.
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,809.054,815.828,But my example might suggest to suspicion that there’s something wrong with the costs. Couldn’t you even look at it for that purpose?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,815.828,819.508,We can always look at the entire company’s business --
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.508,819.851,Including rates?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,819.851,822.41,-- in order to determine that the costs are correctly allocated.
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.41,827.422,Including the retail rates?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,827.422,829.388,I don’t think the retail rate would be relevant.
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,833.475,837.725,What percentage of this company’s business is retail and what percent wholesale?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,837.725,846.099,"It’s a hard thing to be absolutely specific about because it’s hard to classify some of the business but between 80 and 90% retail, the revenue is 80 to 90% retail."
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,846.099,850.165,"And you may not look at those rates at all in your -- performing your function, is it?"
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,850.165,865.601,"We may look at the rate based in the allocation of costs but we may not look at that rate. Our job is to determine first what is properly allocated to, in terms of cost to the wholesale business."
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,874.772,880.112,"Mr. Tuttle, if the facts are as alleged by the intervenor -- intervenors here."
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,881.996,885.844,"They have several remedies in my view, Mr. Justice."
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.717,899.328,Did they artificially depress their rates for 90% of their business in order to do this?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,899.328,906.317,"I said, well, I didn’t see -- I'm not saying for a moment Mr. Justice that a price squeeze really exists here."
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.04,918.737,"So the price squeeze can arise in two ways, either by having extravagantly high rates in the wholesale field in normal rates in retail or vice versa."
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,923.541,926.817,"Well, they probably didn’t depress any rates."
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.008,940.359,On accepting that what is their remedy?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,940.359,948.395,"Well, first of all, I’d like to address the question of the fact that if you say could occur from artificially inflated wholesale rate."
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,968.083,971.601,Assuming you’ve done an adequate job of investigating the company and the total cost?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,971.601,975.886,But we accept our responsibility and it hasn’t been questioned in this case that we have.
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.886,978.873,"But now a good answer to my question, what is their remedy?"
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,978.873,984.346,"Well, their remedy, assuming that I am right, that the rate is cost by a depressed retail rate."
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.926,999.343,Do they have standing because they’re not -- they have no interest in that rate anymore than -- don’t they have the same problem there?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,999.343,1008.654,"No, because that would be a rate that if our other assumptions are correct is a rate that’s artificially low in any competitive."
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.359,1018.895,"Let me just back up, to be sure I understand you."
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1023.884,1025.04,"Well, they could make a complaint."
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1025.04,1031.069,They file a complaint with the State Commission and say that you should cause the utility to charge higher prices?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1031.069,1031.94,That’s one remedy.
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1032.689,1034.037,Has that ever been successful?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1035.885,1038.998,"I don’t know, I know there had been interventions in --"
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1038.998,1047.342,"Yes, but that’s not our example because our problem is they don’t have such a pending proceeding under our hypothesis."
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1047.342,1048.971,Conway now has such a pending proceeding?
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.971,1049.286,No.
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1049.286,1049.626,No.
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.626,1055.394,What does Conway do about the problem that it alleges exists if there’s no pending Arkansas State Proceeding?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1055.394,1058.882,It could file a complaint alleging that the rate is improper.
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1082.826,1090.771,But would not the utility have a complete defense because both of those rates are compelled by regulatory agencies and then wouldn’t Parker against Brown apply?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1090.771,1092.073,That’s a very interesting question.
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.363,1163.494,Did you assume a situation in which the rate -- the state rate has been approved by the state agency?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1165.336,1172.448,"Well that -- if the state looks at the rate, you see, the way Arkansas works is more or less likely --"
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1172.448,1174.334,I assume they don’t approve it without looking at it?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1174.334,1176.775,"Well, they do in this sense."
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1223.487,1225.19,And it has no remedy then?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1231.039,1239.666,I would agree but only if the process has gone through the point of the state determining that this is indeed the rate that they think ought to be applied.
1975.75-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.666,1243.607,"Is the rate filed in investigation, they didn’t -- they let it go into effect."
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1246.326,1261.649,"If the allegation were that it would simply went into effect without an investigation, it would seem to me that under the antitrust laws, that doctrine in Parker v. Brown would not create an immunity and one could perhaps achieve a remedy in federal court."
1975.75-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1665.665,1667.941,"Mr. Tuttle, could I ask you?"
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1681.104,1694.645,It is always been our custom to allow the Solicitor in the Justice Department to determine whether petitions would be filed with this Court.
1975.75-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.196,1710.708,Are you suggesting that the Solicitor General isn’t the authorized representative of Federal Power Commission in this Court?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1710.708,1713.579,I'm saying that we have always construed our statute --
1975.75-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.579,1717.091,(Voice overlap) that’s why I’m asking you.
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1717.091,1720.155,"In essence, I'm saying yes he is the authorized representative."
1975.75-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1720.155,1727.894,Well then I take it that it necessarily follows that the views in this brief are his views too?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1727.894,1730.858,I think I have to say what happened in order to answer that question.
1975.75-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1730.858,1736.604,"Well, you can answer it yes or no?"
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1736.604,1741.984,I can say that of course he has expressed no dissent to the views expressed in this brief.
1975.75-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.984,1744.143,"So, your answer is you don’t know?"
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1744.143,1746.8,My answer is that I don’t know.
1975.75-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.25,1758.414,"In any event, if he is required to represent the Federal Power Commission before this Court, we do not know whether we have his views or not?"
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1758.414,1761.907,You have his authorized filing.
1975.75-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1761.907,1762.675,Do we have his view?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1769.442,1774.196,I think that these are the views of the United States as authorized to be expressed by the Solicitor General.
1975.75-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1775.324,1779.477,Well then the answer is I think we do not know whether we have his views or not.
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1788.132,1788.879,It does.
1975.75-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1790.814,1791.535,I understand that.
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1801.395,1806.801,The evidence is that the Antitrust Division has not dissented and has made no filling of its own.
1975.75-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.801,1808.22,Thank you.
1975.75-342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1808.22,1819.828,"Mr. Tuttle, the supplement Mr. Justice White’s mentioned is -- does the law make the Solicitor General the exclusive representative of the Power Commission in this Court?"
1975.75-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1823.387,1826.582,"I think that it does -- I think that it does, Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.75-342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1841.049,1846.691,What is this supplemental memorandum for the United States?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1846.691,1848.801,Supplemental memorandum?
1975.75-342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1848.801,1849.942,For the United States.
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1853.605,1855.371,I’m not sure what document you’re talking about.
1975.75-342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1858.228,1861.466,Which one have I got here?
1975.75-342,0,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1862.473,1866.667,There’s no filing in this case by the Solicitor General that I know of.
1975.75-342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1866.667,1867.523,I got the wrong one.
1975.75-342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1871.846,1875.478,Mr. McDiarmid.
1975.75-342,1,39886,robert_c_mcdiarmid,,1875.478,1885.688,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court."
1975.75-342,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2206.274,2217.286,"Well, of course your tactic here of appealing to the Court of Appeals on an interlocutory motion isn’t really designed to expedite the final decision of this sort of case, is it?"
1975.75-342,1,39886,robert_c_mcdiarmid,,2217.286,2218.352,"Oh, I think not, Your Honor."
