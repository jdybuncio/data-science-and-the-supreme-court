2013.13-193,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.857,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-193, Susan B. Anthony List v. Steven Driehaus."
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,8.95,12.294,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-193,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,49.106,53.387,Are you making that argument on behalf of the other organization?
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,71.533,85.201,"Well, Your Honor, when they filed their complaint, they alleged that they had not spoken those words because Susan B. Anthony had already been drawn into the Commission's procedures and the Commission had already found probable cause."
2013.13-193,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,86.263,99.46,"How is that any different from -- how is that any different from the people in Younger, who the Court dismissed as having no standing because they hadn't been prosecuted despite the same identical claim?"
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,104.77,126.263,"--Well, as Justice Brennan put it in Younger, the -- the speech that the other three speakers were going to engage in was not even of the same genre as that of the person who would be -- was being prosecuted, which is why the Court, quite correctly said, that their chilling effect was based on an imaginatory or speculative fear of enforcement."
2013.13-193,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,136.946,146.394,"I thought that the Court in Younger said with respect to those other three, that they had never been threatened with prosecution."
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,151.533,158.983,"--Well, two of the people were labor picketers that had never been threatened and one was somebody who was simply teaching Marx in a classroom environment."
2013.13-193,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,197.608,199.467,"But the one question is who is the ""they""?"
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,225.754,226.378,"Two points, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.13-193,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,269.578,272.827,How do you square this with Clapper?
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,272.827,273.765,--I apologize.
2013.13-193,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,273.765,276.077,Why isn't this as speculative as Clapper?
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,301.785,305.939,"Well, those are the steps that are required to put my clients in jail."
2013.13-193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,324.042,326.821,And I take it that's -- that's enforced by subpoenas.
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,332.913,334.474,"There's -- there's two things, Justice Kennedy."
2013.13-193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,361.245,374.521,"Now, the State can characterize its own position, but do you understand the State to say that well, the existence of the Commission means that frivolous claims can be washed out, that they can actually get some protection by an advance ruling."
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,375.737,376.086,No.
2013.13-193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,391.669,398.449,"But I mean, I thought -- I thought their position was that this would -- would sharpen the controversy and make it more concrete or something like that."
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,398.449,399.371,That's precisely right.
2013.13-193,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,403.853,417.222,"There is a provision for an advisory opinion, and that's a question that you are arguing strenuously that this statute violates the Constitution."
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,430.857,433.325,"--No, we didn't because we think that's unconstitutional."
2013.13-193,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,451.943,453.959,Mr. -- please.
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,453.959,464.298,"I was just going to say, even the Commission recognizes that the declaratory judgment advisory opinion procedure doesn't work in the heat of an election campaign as it was here."
2013.13-193,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,465.079,476.605,"Is -- is your argument dependent on the following two facts: The first that there was a probable cause determination, and the second that the Susan Anthony group and the other group wanted to repeat the exact same statement?"
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,481.963,484.743,"--We -- we think that makes it all -- all but dispositive, yes."
2013.13-193,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,496.675,497.956,So if -- I'm sorry.
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,497.956,511.311,"--Well, I just want to make it clear that the threat of enforcement is particularly acute here because not only is -- is enforcement power handed to a group of elected officials with certain ethical and political accountability things."
2013.13-193,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,532.754,534.801,But that would suggest something even broader.
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,562.836,570.739,"--Justice Kagan, we can agree that given the amorphous nature of this prohibition in the false statement, it's difficult to predict in advance who and when is going to do it."
2013.13-193,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,638.931,642.977,"Well, let me ask you something going back in part to Justice Kagan."
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,657.892,672.684,"We think that if the commission is going to drag us in front of them to justify our political speech to a bunch of State officials that they -- that is, A, Article III cognizable injury, and B, unconstitutional."
2013.13-193,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,674.621,680.994,"You're -- you're not asking us to resolve the constitutional question, just the question of whether you can raise the Constitution."
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,680.994,682.43,--All we're trying for is our day in court so that we can make this argument.
2013.13-193,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,810.268,815.14,Why did -- why did you say it would be found capable -- not capable of repetition?
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,821.357,832.025,"--Oh, if you accept our view of credible threat, then -- then you're -- you're entirely right, we would -- we would satisfy both the ripeness standard and the capable of repetition yet evading review standard."
2013.13-193,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,866.838,870.399,Your best cases you think are Steffel and Thompson and Babbitt?
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,873.555,881.208,"--Well, Babbitt is certainly the most on point because there the prohibition was, like ours, was saying something untrue, something false."
2013.13-193,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,937.7,942.791,So please -- please define for me the rule you'd like us to announce?
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,945.963,961.879,"--The narrowest rule, and the only rule we need to survive, is that if the enforcement agency has previously announced that your speech probably violates the law at issue, then you have a credible threat of future enforcement if you repeat that speech."
2013.13-193,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,962.785,969.407,"Do we need them to say they are going to, even though the person who they said it against is not running again?"
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,969.407,970.235,--Oh.
2013.13-193,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,971.547,974.951,"And how do you deal with Golden, in other words?"
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,974.951,975.529,"Oh, yeah."
2013.13-193,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1032.709,1040.612,So that you've been prosecuted before and that you are intending to do the identical speech against others.
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1040.612,1050.062,A preliminary finding and identical speech we think more than satisfies the credible threat thing for the reasons I was articulating to Justice Kennedy a few moments ago.
2013.13-193,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1059.026,1062.634,Do you think this is a matter of standing or ripeness?
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1064.166,1070.365,"In all candor, Justice Ginsburg, I can't figure out the difference between standing and ripeness in this context."
2013.13-193,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1095.997,1104.741,Do you want us to just forget about the disclaimer issue and the commission procedure issue or even the as-applied issue?
2013.13-193,0,35611,michael_a_carvin,,1110.583,1112.302,"Well, can we take them one at a time?"
2013.13-193,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1214.244,1215.603,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.13-193,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1223.85,1226.379,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-193,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1250.214,1258.461,"Well, you -- you insist that they -- there has actually been a probable cause finding that their speech would violate the law before they would have standing?"
2013.13-193,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1258.461,1270.753,"Not necessarily that their particular speech would violate the law, but that there have been -- without the probable cause finding, it would simply be speculative whether particular speech would actually result in any sort of enforcement proceeding."
2013.13-193,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1273.345,1277.814,"Even in a case like this, where the procedures can be triggered by any citizen in the State?"
2013.13-193,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1277.814,1297.899,"--Well, Your Honor, again, we don't think that someone can come into court and say, I want to make some speech, I don't think that speech would be violating the statute, I don't have any good evidence that anyone else thinks my speech would violate the statute or that some sort of enforcement action would be brought against me, but nevertheless, I want to get into court--"
2013.13-193,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1297.899,1299.461,Is that a realistic proposition?
2013.13-193,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1315.766,1329.854,"--Well, Your Honor, we may be simply debating how similar the previous speech that was a subject of a probable cause finding, or that there's some other reason to believe will be the subject of an enforcement proceeding has to be to the speech that the plaintiffs allege that they intend to make."
2013.13-193,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1337.273,1362.075,"Well, what would happen, Mr. Feigin, what would happen if a candidate knew -- it seems actually quite plausible that Representative Driehaus would know -- that this was something that Susan Anthony or some other like group would talk about in his campaign, and he were to write letters to all these groups saying, if you start advertising in this way, if you put up billboards, I'm going to take you before the Ohio Commission."
2013.13-193,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1363.841,1368.463,"That would at least be sufficient, Your Honor, to bring a suit against Driehaus."
2013.13-193,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1378.554,1380.085,I'm not sure I understood that.
2013.13-193,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1399.67,1403.058,--That specific threat would be enough to allow for a lawsuit.
2013.13-193,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1423.207,1424.784,"Now, take it just a step further."
2013.13-193,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1450.367,1455.912,"Well, Your Honor, I think in the absence of good evidence of an enforcement proceeding, it would simply be too speculative."
2013.13-193,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1501.551,1507.938,"Are you arguing that the other organization, COAST, also has standing?"
2013.13-193,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1520.574,1527.726,"Your Honor, we don't think that the proceeding before the Commission has to involve the entity that wants to make the speech in the future."
2013.13-193,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1533.49,1540.956,So how do you distinguish the three in Younger v. Harris that the Court said didn't have standing?
2013.13-193,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1540.956,1556.215,"I think in the same way the Petitioners do, Your Honor, and I think that's how we reconcile the case with Steffel, where one of the factors the Court looked to, to find a credible threat of enforcement in that case was the actual prosecution of the plaintiff's hand-billing companion."
2013.13-193,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1664.251,1665.734,How many proceedings have been brought under this Ohio statute?
2013.13-193,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1665.734,1675.84,"So under the Ohio statute between 2001 and 2010, according to the statistics in the green brief by the Ohio Attorney General, it's a little bit over 500."
2013.13-193,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1682.276,1686.664,Any -- any breakdown of whether those were brought by candidates or just interested citizens?
2013.13-193,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1686.664,1690.1,"The -- we don't have statistics on that, Your Honor."
2013.13-193,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1703.953,1705.406,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.13-193,2,35611,michael_a_carvin,,3225.374,3226.233,A few brief points.
2013.13-193,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3448.412,3449.743,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
