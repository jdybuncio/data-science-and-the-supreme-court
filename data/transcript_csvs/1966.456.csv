1966.456,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,23.121,"Number 456, Afroyim, Petitioner, versus Dean Rusk, the Secretary of State."
1966.456,0,22210,edward_j_ennis,,25.608,28.144,May it please the Court.
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1744.853,1747.682,May it please the Court.
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1773.278,1775.033,"Is there -- Mr. Gordon, I beg your pardon."
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1779.256,1781.927,"No, there's a finding that it was voluntary."
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1782.369,1783.752,But his voting was voluntary?
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1783.752,1785.251,His voting was voluntary.
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1793.377,1795.043,Did the Government contest it?
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1795.043,1796.179,They did not contest it.
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1798.556,1800.691,And that's really the issue that we have.
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1808.408,1810.341,"Why, I believe that's one of the issues."
1966.456,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1924.549,1930.191,"This case, however, was not decided at all upon his voting in those two later elections, was it?"
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1930.191,1931.001,I'm not sure.
1966.456,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1931.53,1934.068,"Well, they're decided, I thought on a stipulation of fact."
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1934.068,1934.767,No.
1966.456,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1958.522,1967.987,"Do I understand in the first to those elections, under the laws of Israel, it was not neces -- it was necessary only to be a resident because indeed there was no such --"
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1967.987,1968.026,That is true.
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.026,1969.399,-- thing as Israel nationality.
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1969.399,1969.727,That is true.
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1969.727,1976.49,"And that -- but in the second two elections in which it shown that he voted, there was Israel nation -- such a thing as Israel nationality."
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1976.49,1978.001,And only Israeli -- Israeli nation --
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.001,1979.545,That only Israelis could --
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1979.545,1980.022,Could vote.
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1980.022,1981.035,"-- could vote, is that correct?"
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1981.035,1982.797,And he did vote.
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.797,1989.591,"Well now, it's an -- may be important to know on -- what basis this case was decided."
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,1997.199,2009.549,"Your Honor, the passport file of the Department of State was incorporated by reference in the motion for summary judgment and was considered in the opinion of the District Court and the opinion of the Court of Appeals."
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2023.791,2029.468,But what -- what do you mean there was a reference to those things in the opinion of the court below?
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2029.468,2032.979,"Well, they referred to that --"
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2032.979,2039.38,"I mean, really -- really there ought to be -- ought to be lot of ambiguity about what is and what's not part of the record should be --"
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2039.38,2040.382,I -- I agree with what --
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2040.382,2042.16,-- one of the government case.
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2042.16,2045.191,"Mr. Justice Fortas, this record is a little ambiguous."
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2045.191,2046.578,"Well, that's too bad."
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2046.578,2046.94,I agree with Your --
1966.456,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2046.94,2049.446,"But the stipulation is not Mr. Gordon, is it?"
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2049.446,2049.96,"I'm sorry, sir."
1966.456,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2049.96,2059.63,I think stipulation is not ambiguous and that it says that he voted in '51 in the elections in the second Knesset.
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2059.63,2060.123,That is true.
1966.456,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2060.705,2062.077,Standing about the other.
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2062.077,2072.927,"No, but they in the record and if Your Honor will look at pages 1 and 2, you'll see that the record shows that he voted in two other elections, 1955 and 1959."
1966.456,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2072.927,2074.215,They're not involved in here.
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2076.799,2079.655,The complaint is not in the record.
1966.456,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2079.655,2081.737,Does the complaint mention he other elections?
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2081.737,2083.772,"No, I don't know if it does or not."
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2097.393,2100.646,What do you mean he had been very talkative?
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2100.646,2105.06,"Well, I guess he has been so talkative in some State Department but in this proceeding, he has restricted --"
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2105.06,2110.431,Was he -- was -- is there any oral testimony in this record?
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2110.431,2111.127,"Yes, sir."
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2115.004,2117.247,Was that part of the record of the record before us?
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2117.247,2124.173,"It is a part of the record that was before the District Court and the Court of Appeals and is lodged in the office of the clerk, yes."
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2124.173,2127.445,So this is not a case it's here on the stipulated facts?
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2127.445,2129.601,"Not in my view, sir."
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2129.601,2140.176,"No, I'd like to here your brother Ennis as toward his understanding as in the record because I think it's kind of important --"
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2140.176,2141.513,"I agreed for, Your Honor."
1966.456,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2154.623,2156.441,Where is the testimony?
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2156.441,2157.145,"I'm sorry, sir."
1966.456,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2157.145,2159.113,Where is the testimony?
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2159.113,2165.788,In the transcript of State Department file which is certified by the District Court and is lodged with the clerk of this Court.
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.788,2171.568,"Well, what do you -- did you draw the thing -- a large distinction between the two situations?"
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2171.568,2180.355,I don't draw such a distinction but I want to cover both that in the event as Mr. Justice Clark has suggested that a distinction might exist in the minds of the Court.
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2187.765,2195.37,"Well, you say in the last two elections in which he voted, it is necessary to be a national of Israel on both the elections."
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2195.37,2197.433,"That is true, sir."
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.433,2201.667,How did he evidence that he was national of Israel?
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2201.667,2204.1,"Well, I'll be glad to describe that to Your Honor."
1966.456,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2247.153,2248.328,"Well, is that in the record?"
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2248.328,2251.408,Not in the record.
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.408,2251.496,And why is it --
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2251.496,2252.79,"Unfortunately, this --"
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.79,2254.845,Why isn't it in the record?
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2254.845,2255.213,Because --
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.213,2262.388,Because you wanted -- you wanted to get the issue up here on the -- on that they're voting issue in this or what?
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2262.388,2265.87,"Well, Your Honor, as I was not in the case at the District Court."
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.565,2287.192,But why shouldn't we take the case like that instead of this other evidence which apparently you didn't -- the Government could have put in the evidence if they wanted to.
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2287.192,2307.841,"Mr. Justice White, I believe that in issue of this importance is very desirable to get the record as full as possible and I think that if the record were as full as it can be, it would indicate that petitioner has demonstrated his diminution of allegiance to the United States has indicated that he regard himself as a citizen of Israel."
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.243,2329.055,"Well, we could, on that evidence so that the Court can hold on this current statute unconstitutional and still -- and still say that he'd lost his citizenship on another ground."
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2329.055,2333.501,"Well, the only ground that is involved here is voting in the election of Israel."
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2333.501,2333.945,I know.
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2344.089,2345.121,"Well, I -- I --"
1966.456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.121,2348.368,You might do it on the basis of becoming -- becoming a citizen of another country.
1966.456,1,19054,charles_gordon,,2348.368,2351.863,By being naturalized and by some voluntarily action as part.
1966.456,2,22210,edward_j_ennis,,3874.96,3886.629,"Mr. Chief Justice, I have no further argument but I've been a member of this Court for 30 years and I would not submit and request this Court to rule an Act of Congress unconstitutional and improper record."
1966.456,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3895.804,3898.878,You may take five minutes then.
1966.456,2,22210,edward_j_ennis,,3898.878,3905.173,"Your Honor, under the Nationality Act and the laws of nationality, there are some 15 grounds."
