1973.71-1669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.368,"The Court will hear the arguments first this morning in number 71-1669, Gustafson against Florida."
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,17.565,20.588,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.71-1669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,71.938,75.574,Why did the policeman stop him Mr. Russ?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,75.574,79.839,"He stopped him because he observed him to be weaving, Justice Rehnquist."
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,89.276,90.644,What time of day was it?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,90.644,95.692,"This is approximately 1:30 to 2 o’clock in the morning, Your Honor."
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,97.968,113.08,"Now, that you already have been interrupted, may I do it again just so I can understand this, I think I do that do I understand correctly that -- that in this case, you do not question the constitutional validity of the arrest?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,113.08,115.438,"That’s correct, Justice Stewart."
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,118.979,119.18,Yes.
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,127.903,129.023,Yes sir.
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,129.023,129.531,Thank you.
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,129.531,134.064,For the charge of driving an automobile with no valid driver’s license in his possession.
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,134.064,135.17,Yes sir.
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,135.17,137.347,"Now, after he was removed from the automobile --"
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,137.347,141.299,And a part of that is that you concede the validity of the stock --
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,141.299,142.426,"Yes, we do Justice White."
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,142.426,146.139,And then the validity of the arrest based on (Inaudible).
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,146.139,148.584,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1973.71-1669,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,192.978,197.714,Who has the possession (Inaudible).
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,197.714,200.608,"The police officer, Lieutenant Smith."
1973.71-1669,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,227.294,230.112,Why did he open it?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,230.112,232.865,"Curiosity, Justice Marshall, I assume."
1973.71-1669,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,235.822,242.557,Is it normal to arrest a man for driving without a license and put him under arrest in Florida?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,242.557,244.51,I think it’s normal to arrest in this --
1973.71-1669,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,244.51,247.105,"Think, but do you know it?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,247.105,248.408,I don’t know specifically.
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,248.408,249.676,It gets back to my question.
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,258.012,258.276,There is no question.
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,258.276,262.406,"Normal or abnormal, that you do not question its validity?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,262.406,281.946,"That’s right, because the State Law of Florida states that it’s an offense to drive without a valid driver’s license in your possession is sort of an inchoate offense, but there was a back door to this thing that if you appear in Court with your valid driver’s license at a later date, then the whole matter is dismissed."
1973.71-1669,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,281.946,285.388,Did the automobile had the Florida license of automobiles?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,285.388,290.827,"Justice Powell, it had the New York license on it."
1973.71-1669,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,291.722,298.909,I don’t understand how you can arrest a man for a crime that you can’t convict him of.
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,301.24,304.548,"Justice Marshall, I have problems with it too but --"
1973.71-1669,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,304.548,307.46,"Well, but why do you submit it?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,307.46,314.227,"Well, because we think that the key issue in this case for this Court’s consideration is the matter of the scope of the search."
1973.71-1669,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,314.227,316.255,You want to win it one way only?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,316.255,320.01,"No, we want to win it one way or another."
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,320.01,324.326,"Well, whatever our problems might be and I confess that I share my brother Marshall’s problems."
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,327.686,328.951,Yes sir.
1973.71-1669,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,346.863,356.088,"If the action by the police officer had been confined to a Terry-type patdown, would you be here this morning?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,356.088,357.521,No sir.
1973.71-1669,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,357.521,363.44,"So, you draw the distinction between the search and the patdown?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,363.44,374.16,"Yes sir and we’re complaining essentially about the search, the body search, the going into the man’s pocket and the taking out of the cigarette box and the opening of the cigarette box."
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,374.16,386.025,Are they separate things? Does the opening of the cigarette box in your submission created a different problem than going into his pocket and taking the box?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,386.025,396.495,"No, as far as we are concerned, the constitutional wrong in this set of circumstances occurred when the police officer put his hand into the man’s pocket and took out the cigarette box."
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,396.495,403.223,"And you don’t argue that even of that were alright, opening the cigarette box was improper?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,403.223,411.331,"Well, that is just for the compounding of the wrong, yes sir, but our essential complaint is that going into the pocket, the body search."
1973.71-1669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,411.331,415.858,Could you have than under a Terry search under the Terry case?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,415.858,417.874,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, we don’t believe so."
1973.71-1669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,418.864,434.368,"If you found on feeling the man’s pocket from the outside that there was a substantial package in there that was firm, do you say that he could not go into that pocket under the Terry case?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,434.368,443.639,"Well, we say that under the Terry case, he has to have a reason to believe that what he feels is of such substance that it could qualify as a weapon."
1973.71-1669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,443.639,447.947,Do you think this package could have conceivably qualified as a weapon?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,447.947,449.211,"No sir, we do not."
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,449.211,451.821,Was it a soft Benson and Hedges pack?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,451.821,453.795,"It was a box as I understand it, Justice Brennan"
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,453.795,456.538,Was it a hard box or --
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,456.538,460.192,Yes sir.
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,460.192,474.395,I suppose that you’ll be making the same argument if this defendant have been arrested in his home for stealing television sets and assume there’s a valid arrest to that and probable cause.
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,487.877,489.958,"Well, not necessarily Justice White."
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,504.867,509.25,What kinds of proofs were within -- found in a Benson and Hedges box --
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,509.25,510.491,No sir.
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.835,532.567,"On that basis, there could be a driver’s license in the cigarette box, you can argue like that?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,532.567,537.093,"But he wasn’t charged with having a driver’s license, he was charged with not having a driver’s license."
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,537.093,544.374,I know but he may have lied about his identity like you could have found anything in the cigarette box?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,544.374,546.181,"Well, we submit that under the Fourth Amendment --"
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,546.181,548.593,Like deny the ownership of the car.
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,548.593,553.721,We submit under the Fourth Amendment that the police officer doesn’t have the authority to search for anything.
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,562.621,564.965,"The arresting officer obviously, didn’t know, did he?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,572.422,576.327,"Well, they always refer to it in the sworn testimony as being a cigarette box, Justice Brennan."
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,576.327,581.076,"I know, after he took it out, but did he know before he took it out that it was a cigarette box?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,581.076,582.458,I don’t know.
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,582.458,584.984,Did he testify as to that?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,584.984,589.14,The specific question was never asked of him.
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,589.14,592.876,"Because you do concede, I gather, that the patdown was proper."
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,592.876,593.768,Yes sir.
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,629.882,636.274,"Well, this gets back to the Chief Justice’s question and I gather under your submission."
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,645.984,658.968,"Let us say it was a Peters case where the arresting or the searching officer, the frisking officer felt something hard and substantial in the man’s pocket in which he thought might have been a knife."
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,667.844,681.105,"Well, then your case must turn on that -- when he patted this object inside his pocket not knowing what it was, it did not have the shape or form of something that might be a weapon such as (Inaudible)?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,681.105,682.486,"Yes sir, that is our --"
1973.71-1669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,682.486,703.868,"(Voice Overlap) Then you have to say that under no conceivable stretch of imagination, this hard package of the Benson and Hedges cigarette box could not have been a small pocket-size automatic disc for example."
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,703.868,738.738,"Your Honor, as we read Terry, Sibron and Peters it’s our understanding of those cases that this doesn’t give a wide-open subjective approach on the part of the police officer that he can’t simply come to the trial court afterwards and say, “I intuitively or believe that it might possibly had been a weapon or one sort or another that this is something that is subject to objective evaluation,” otherwise, the Terry frisk is really a wide open authority to search --"
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,738.738,745.906,"Well, you have to get over another point though, this Terry type of stop, You concede that this was an arrest --"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,745.906,746.234,Yes.
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.234,749.534,A question of search incident to arrest as the Terry patdown.
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,749.534,753.664,Right.
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,753.664,761.59,You’re already assuming that the only thing a person can do is -- the officer can do is to do what he does after a Terry stop.
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,763.229,764.818,Yes sir.
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,770.446,780.979,I thought Chimel said that you could have search the person of the arrestee and his immediate vicinity.
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,780.979,798.956,"Your Honor as we read Chimel, Chimel again in that same section of the opinion quoted from the Terry decision where this Court said that “the scope of the search must be strictly tied to and justified by the circumstances which rendered the initiation permissible.”"
1973.71-1669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.956,810.564,"Well, certainly those languages of both Rabinowitz and Preston that your opposing counsel cite that says categorically, that you can have a full search incident to a lawful arrest."
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,813.468,814.316,No sir.
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,814.873,817.569,Rabinowitz already had been disapproved?
1973.71-1669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,817.569,818.566,Not in that respect.
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,818.566,822.424,"We don’t need to do it again, do we?"
1973.71-1669,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,822.424,832.297,"Mr. Russ, why do you think (Inaudible) knows the point that once (Inaudible)."
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,851.07,860.194,"Justice Marshall, I don’t attribute to the police officer any legal authority to open the package once he takes it out of the man’s pocket."
1973.71-1669,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,860.194,861.875,Why didn't you make it that point?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,861.875,866.263,Because I answered Justice Brennan.
1973.71-1669,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,874.385,885.671,"Yes, I think you answered me earlier that you don’t argue independently of putting his hand in the pocket -- that opening the package in and of itself is a Fourth Amendment violation."
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,886.648,891.852,"No, I say that it all falls in one package, so I am not giving it away, I am not conceding it."
1973.71-1669,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,902.411,905.048,Even if it was a gun?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,905.048,910.182,"No -- No, because --"
1973.71-1669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,910.182,914.631,"Then you’re judging the search by its fruits, are you not?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,920.271,920.912,"No, Your Honor."
1973.71-1669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,950.557,969.786,"Suppose when he opened that Benson and Hedges box, it is not a pistol, an automatic, as Justice Marshall suggested, but a folding knife, a rather common weapon that folds in these three sections of about two-and-a-half inches each."
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,978.188,981.17,"Well, I am going back to the basic -- putting his hand on the pocket."
1973.71-1669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,981.17,990.414,"And now we got his hand out of the pocket, he got the box out and he finds a weapon, you say that's an unreasonable search?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,990.414,992.851,I say that the opening of the box is unreasonable.
1973.71-1669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1004.42,1012.242,How about protecting himself against the possible weapon that might be concealed in the box.
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,1012.242,1038.929,"Mr. Rehnquist -- Justice Rehnquist, we believe that unless there’s a rational objective, showing that, what the officer feels on the frisk, is a weapon or falls in that category of an object that could be used to hurt the police officer or the arrestee or to effectuate the escape that it becomes unreasonable for him to extend the frisk into a body search."
1973.71-1669,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1038.929,1054.415,"The officer can’t and just because he uncovers out an object that could contain a weapon, but that he cannot show in advance that probably it contains a weapon, he can’t go further into that object?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,1054.415,1077.102,"That’s our position, yes sir, because our -- the answer to it is that, is it was left to the police officer’s own subjective interpretation that there might have been a weapon in whatever this object is that he feels to the outer clothing, rather than an objective standard and objective test that every Terry frisk is going to develop into a full body search."
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1077.102,1086.479,"Mr. Russ, I think my brother White has already pointed out that you are kind of assuming the answer to the basic issue in this case, are you not?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,1106.494,1107.981,Yes sir.
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1109.029,1124.765,"Right, but instead of arguing that, you’re rather arguing that you assume that he is limited to a Terry type search and now you are arguing that a Terry type search would not permit taking that box out of his pocket which is subsidiary and somewhat different question."
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,1129.271,1130.887,Yes sir.
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.36,1150.335,"But where do you keep razorblades, for example?"

1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.867,1176.619,"-- You can keep that anywhere, can’t you?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,1176.619,1177.827,Yes.
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.95,1190.582,"You may not be able to search for razor blades in the Terry type stop, but can’t search for razorblades if you make a valid arrest and put him on a police car and take him to the station?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,1190.582,1194.821,"If you are going to search for razorblades, you are going to have to go right down to the very scene or environment."
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.821,1201.571,"Alright, let’s assume it gets to the station before they put him in a cell, can they search his pockets?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,1201.571,1203.946,Yes.
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1205.357,1215.218,"Alright (Voice Overlap) but they get him to the station, they’re going to book him and they’re going to take the photograph of him and can they ask him down to empty his pockets there?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,1215.218,1227.872,"Not until such time as he goes from this booking stage to being an actual prisoner in the jail and of course, he certainly has the option to -- as on this case, to pose bail right there at the situation."
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1227.872,1233.469,"Why can’t they make him empty his pockets when they put him in the jail, put him on a cell?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,1233.469,1236.669,It was a matter of protecting the integrity of the whole jail system.
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.669,1242.173,Because he might have a razorblades or something like that or some other what?
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,1242.173,1245.442,Some other weapon or some other (Voice Overlap).
1973.71-1669,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1245.442,1249.597,Some other weapon that you can’t find except by emptying the pockets?
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1249.597,1267.319,"Well, other reasons come into play before a man is put on the cell and they want to take his money out of his pockets for instance and there are various other things and make an inventory out of it for the protection of his property and protection against false claims against the police where you’re taking his property and so on, there are all sort of different grounds."
1973.71-1669,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1267.319,1272.869,"And he is necktie and his shoestring, but doesn’t have anything to do with the pack of shoe box (Inaudible)."
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,1285.51,1286.963,Yes sir.
1973.71-1669,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1286.963,1291.463,"Well, why open up the package to look for them?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,1291.463,1294.249,"Well, we don’t think that it was necessary at all to open a package Justice Marshall."
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1294.249,1302.366,"On the other hand, if the policeman did find razorblades in the pack of the cigarettes, it would put him on the alert that he better do some more searching, am I correct?"
1973.71-1669,0,32647,james_m_russ,,1302.366,1304.655,"Yes sir, that’s true."
1973.71-1669,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1304.655,1305.326,And how is he going to --
1973.71-1669,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1305.326,1309.608,That was a very good point under that theory of opening up the package?
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1406.564,1409.672,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1454.97,1459.538,What if any traffic violation that he committed?
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1463.214,1463.779,"No, You Honor."
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1486.94,1492.137,"Well, would marijuana make him intoxicated?"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1492.137,1493.416,"It may, Your Honor."
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1493.416,1497.661,"Well, could it be that he was searching him for the evidence of marijuana?"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1497.661,1499.047,It may Your Honor and we --
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1499.047,1500.342,"Did you say, it may?"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1500.342,1501.821,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1589.787,1594.884,Is it usual in Florida to arrest the person for a traffic violation?
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1594.884,1598.356,"Your Honor, the officer testified that approximately three --"
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1598.356,1600.316,I’m not asking what the officer said.
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1609.623,1613.268,I don’t know the answer in terms of the factual statistics Your Honor.
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1624.044,1630.784,"But you cannot quote me any Florida law or regulation, or anything, can you?"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1630.784,1634.136,I can tell Your Honor that it is legal in Florida for the officer to arrest.
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1634.412,1636.947,And you cite what?
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1636.947,1637.899,I don’t know the statistical (Voice Overlap)
1973.71-1669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1637.899,1642.951,"Did you cite on your brief about those things -- that issue isn’t in this case, is it?"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1642.951,1643.889,"No Your Honor, it is not."
1973.71-1669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1644.565,1646.016,Is it legal in Florida to do it?
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1646.016,1646.647,It is conceded.
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1657.177,1660.787,"Was he arrested, was he handcuffed?"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1660.787,1663.85,The record does not reflect whether or not he was handcuffed Your Honor.
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1663.85,1668.624,"Well, I ask you again, is it normal in Florida, handcuff a man you arrest?"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1668.624,1670.851,I would imagine it maybe (Voice overlap)
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1670.851,1672.504,I give up.
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1672.504,1680.586,"Your Honor, I must concede to the Court that I do not have a statistical analysis of the frequency with which police officer’s arrest or handcuff."
1973.71-1669,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1681.245,1682.808,I don’t think that’s involved here.
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1687.829,1693.816,"If I might move on, Your Honor so I don’t get hung up on something I don’t know and go on to the things that I definitely do know."
1973.71-1669,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1798.01,1811.501,"In other words, you suggest that this is no different and had the officer seemed this petitioner holding someone up and arrested him were attempted armed robbery?"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1811.501,1814.381,"Well, I would suggest Your Honor that it is certainly different."
1973.71-1669,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1814.381,1824.252,"Well, it maybe different but (Voice Overlap) you’re suggesting in respect of the legality of the search incident to the arrest, it is no different?"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1824.252,1825.538,That’s right Your Honor.
1973.71-1669,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1826.333,1830.794,"That’s so long as there is a proper arrest, whatever might be the offense --"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1830.794,1831.126,Absolutely.
1973.71-1669,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1831.126,1833.261,"-- then this kind of search is permissible, that's you --"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1833.261,1833.777,Absolutely.
1973.71-1669,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1854.679,1857.284,But I would suppose on your argument it’s quite irrelevant.
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1863.947,1864.794,"I agree, Your Honor."
1973.71-1669,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1864.794,1865.168,Alright.
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1867.701,1868.898,"I agree, Your Honor."
1973.71-1669,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1869.818,1870.77,Don’t say you agree.
1973.71-1669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1874.855,1876.846,You said yes in answer to his question.
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1876.846,1879.89,"Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say yes, Your Honor, I hope the Court agrees."
1973.71-1669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1879.89,1880.924,That’s right.
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1880.924,1881.53,I think perhaps --
1973.71-1669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1881.53,1899.492,"And the reason is that, if an officer arrested somebody who he saw as an eyewitness holding another person up and searched him, the same claim could be made that no search of that person could educe any additional evidence of the holdup, is that correct?"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1899.492,1900.856,"Yes sir, that is our position."
1973.71-1669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1900.856,1916.589,Same argument could be made against you that the search would have to be a limited one because nothing that could be found on that person’s pockets would give any additional evidence of that particular holdup that the officer --
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1916.589,1922.296,"Your Honor, this goes to the other issue, which is the search for evidence as opposed to the search for weapons which I'd like to, get in just a moment."
1973.71-1669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1950.747,1963.478,"Yes, but in your brief, you’re rather making the same argument it seems to me and you suggested it in your oral argument, i.e. that this particular search may have been justified because you thought the man was drunk?"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1963.478,1965.169,"That’s an additional reason, Your Honor."
1973.71-1669,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1965.169,1977.401,"I thought your argument was and constitutionally ought to be that Justice Brennan has outlined it that when there is a constitutionally valid arrest, there can be a complete search."
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1983.228,1984.919,That is precisely what we’re arguing and I would agree with it.
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.919,1988.043,Would that go for spitting on the sidewalk?
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,1988.043,2001.718,"Well, Your Honor, I think the important point here is that the Court, the fear that Your Honor raises is that the officer will use the arrest as a ruse to search or to harass."
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.718,2003.267,I didn’t say a thing about that.
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,2009.977,2022.397,"If Your Honor there was a valid statute and it were lawful to arrest the spitting on the sidewalk and the officer lawfully arrested the person and placed him in the squad car to take him to the station, I think it will be perfectly reasonable, Your Honor."
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2023.211,2025.41,"Well, what protection do I have?"
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,2025.41,2027.787,"You need not to spit on the sidewalk for one thing, Your Honor."
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2027.787,2029.384,"Well, I didn’t say I spit."
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,2032.062,2032.528,"Well, of course --"
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2032.528,2034.058,There is a difference you know.
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,2034.058,2064.007,"Well again, then Your Honor -- I think what Your Honor is saying is that you fear that the officer will use an alleged violation as a ruse to search and my response is that the Courts have the obligation to determine that factor and as a matter of fact the Florida Supreme Court in this case cited several cases in which the State of Florida has overturned convictions based upon the fact that they found that the arrest was a ruse and that in fact, there was no good faith lawful arrest."
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2064.007,2065.079,I read that.
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,2065.079,2068.896,"And I think, Your Honor that this is the obligation of the Courts to determine and when they determine this --"
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2068.896,2073.757,But why do you ask for such a broad general rule when you don’t need to?
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,2073.757,2080.036,"Your Honor, I think, I’m not asking for a rule any broader than the Court has laid down before and the reason I think we need to is --"
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2080.036,2084.193,"Well, which one did this Court lay down that deprived the spitting on the sidewalk."
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,2088.609,2094.585,"Admittedly Your Honor, I know of no incidence in which the Court has addressed itself to the question of driving without a license."
1973.71-1669,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2094.585,2098.569,But it did address that this is the only conflict?
1973.71-1669,1,17988,barry_scott_richard,,2098.569,2107.62,"I think, Your Honor -- I think, Your Honor that the Court of course can go to the question of whether or not a crime is to incidental to warrant an arrest but --"
