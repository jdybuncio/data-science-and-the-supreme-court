1984.84-231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.772,We will hear arguments next in Hooper against County Assessor.
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,12.324,15.542,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,127.263,136.305,I take it the law doesn't require that the person be a resident of New Mexico at some point during his service.
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,136.305,143.792,"No, Your Honor, and that is one of the main reasons I contend this statute has no the residency requirement has not rational basis."
1984.84-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.103,227.363,"Mr. Hooper, in your view, would the statute be valid if it were limited in granting the exemption only to veterans who were inducted while they were living in New Mexico and returned or discharged to New Mexico?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,227.363,232.45,That is certainly a very substantial factor which is not present in this case.
1984.84-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.867,235.802,Would it be valid though in your view if it were so limited?
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,235.802,238.336,--I do not believe it would be for this reason.
1984.84-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.376,260.619,"Well, there were a couple of cases, weren't there, from New York which had to do with a statute much like that and I guess this Court affirmed at least one of those cases."
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,260.619,262.419,This Court summarily affirmed one of those--
1984.84-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,262.419,264.571,"And, you think that was wrong then?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,264.571,283.782,"--I believe that distinction is wrong because really all that boils down to is the fact that the veteran is being rewarded for prior residency, not for prior service, because I served New Mexico equally even though I was not a resident at the time of the military service."
1984.84-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.888,303.863,Do you think it is not a legitimate purpose for a state to be concerned about the dislocation that the draft into military service imposes on those drafted?
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,303.863,305.331,--I think it is.
1984.84-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.331,307.065,From within their state?
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,307.065,310.283,I think it most certainly is for those resident at the time.
1984.84-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,315.771,321.757,"Well, yes, except you were telling me that you think even one drafted differently may also be invalid."
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,321.757,322.276,--That is right.
1984.84-231,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,336.15,339.202,"Mr. Hooper, are you a resident of New Mexico now?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,339.202,342.94,"--Yes, Your Honor, I have been a resident since August of '81."
1984.84-231,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,342.94,348.927,"I notice you had your certificate here issued to you as of North Carolina, however."
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,348.927,359.616,I have moved around so much I am admitted in a number of states and North Carolina just happens to be my home state and that was the reason I requested admission from North Carolina.
1984.84-231,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,361.652,363.435,But this is within the year.
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,363.435,365.62,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-231,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,372.357,374.609,I am not making any question about that.
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,380.879,386.017,--It only requires you to be admitted to a Bar.
1984.84-231,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,387.385,388.619,It has nothing to do with a Bar.
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,398.075,403.645,"--Well, that is not based on legal residency though."
1984.84-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,413.2,426.344,"Mr. Hooper, may I inquire also, how much in terms of dollars in Bernalillo County in 1983 would the $2,000 property exemption have been worth?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,428.094,437.95,"--It would be somewhere between $100 and $200 annually is what we are talking about, but I believe this involves a fundamental principle and dollar value cannot be attached to it."
1984.84-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,460.113,464.767,"Is that what you claim is violated here, Mr. Hooper, your right to travel?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,464.767,469.421,"I believe this classification will not pass the rational basis test, however--"
1984.84-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,469.421,474.973,"Well, I asked you, what constitutional right is it that you claim was violated?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,474.973,481.043,--My constitutional right to be treated equally with other citizen residents of the State of New Mexico.
1984.84-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,481.043,484.347,"Well then it is not a right to travel, it is equal protection?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,484.347,485.897,"It is both, Your Honor."
1984.84-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.036,510.046,And you think that people are deterred from moving to New Mexico by the fact that if they are a Vietnam veteran that they won't get a property tax waiver?
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,510.046,513.431,"This Court has specifically ruled that deterrence is not required, Your Honor."
1984.84-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,513.431,515.95,I was asking you a question.
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,515.95,528.792,"No, I don't believe people are necessarily deterred, but I don't believe Whether they consider the exemption as part of their decision to move to New Mexico, I don't believe that is--"
1984.84-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,528.792,530.225,You say that shouldn't make any difference.
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,530.225,531.309,"--I don't believe it should, Your Honor."
1984.84-231,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,531.309,537.898,Is there a similar exemption for veterans of other wars?
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,537.898,540.517,"Yes, Your Honor, there is."
1984.84-231,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,567.085,568.568,Have they been challenged?
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,568.568,572.988,"--No, Your Honor, these have never been challenged in the state court."
1984.84-231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.988,581.594,"Of course, New Mexico, even if you won, New Mexico could satisfy you by just not giving the break to anybody."
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,581.594,592.116,"Well, that certainly is one possibility, Your Honor, but I am hoping that the residency requirement will simply be severed from the remainder of the statute and the exemption given to everyone."
1984.84-231,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,604.508,612.245,"May I ask before you go on, Mr. Hooper, would your point be exactly the same if instead of a tax exemption they had given a cash bonus?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,612.245,614.745,"--It is essentially the same thing, Your Honor."
1984.84-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.363,622.184,"So, under your view if they gave a cash bonus limited in time and I move to Arizona I could pick up the bonus?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,622.184,624.219,"--Well, now the bonus There is one difference."
1984.84-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,628.855,629.321,I understand that.
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,631.707,642.264,"Well, if it is a one-shot deal for a bonus In other words, if in 1983 they had said we are going to give a bonus to people who are resident at this time for 1983, I have no problem with that."
1984.84-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,672.784,675.668,"How many people qualify for the benefit, do you know?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,675.668,690.411,"That is not in the record, but it my understanding that there are about 130,000 potentially qualified veterans in the state and only less than half of those actually qualify for the bonus because of these various requirements placed on them."
1984.84-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.411,693.447,By the date requirement?
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,693.447,694.13,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.13,695.149,Cuts off about half of them?
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,695.149,696.082,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,774.867,783.457,Would it be legitimate in your view to limit the tax exemption to residents of New Mexico at all?
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,783.457,789.159,"--Oh, yes, Your Honor, I certainly believe it is legitimate to limit it that way."
1984.84-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,813.392,821.23,"Why under Supposing you were still living in Tuckasegee, North Carolina, and simply owned real property in Bernalillo County?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,827.284,835.89,"I think the term ""residency"" as used in there, which is not in issue here, is synonymous with domicile."
1984.84-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,838.524,842.393,"Well, why, under you line of argument, may the state require domicile?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,842.393,853.601,Because I think this Court has clearly held that you can apportion benefits between residents and non-residents and that is not the issue here at all.
1984.84-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,853.601,860.54,"If you are right on your right-to-travel argument, it would defeat that kind of a statute as well."
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,860.54,865.675,I am not sure that I understand your comment.
1984.84-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,865.675,878.483,"Well, one of your arguments I thought was to require a different level of scrutiny because this statute violates the right to travel."
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,878.483,879.049,"Yes, ma'am."
1984.84-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,879.049,883.251,"And, if it were limited just to residents of any duration you would have the same problem."
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,883.251,888.071,"Well, my argument is that it will not pass a rational basis test."
1984.84-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,980.415,996.524,"Well, what if in 1983 the New Mexico Legislature had enacted a statute saying that all Vietnam veterans who resided in New Mexico at the time of their entering the service shall now get a $2,000 exemption?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,996.524,1001.244,"That is essentially the same question that Justice O'Connor, I believe, asked."
1984.84-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1019.456,1024.609,"Well, if retrospective as you put it is bad, certainly that is retrospective."
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,1026.811,1030.363,It is retrospective in a sense.
1984.84-231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1111.149,1133.581,"What would you say about a statute of the state which had been enacted at the beginning of the war and followed the pattern of the Civil War bonuses and provided that every resident every person domiciled in the state who entered the military service would receive a bonus of $1,000?"
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,1138.283,1141.069,That is certainly much more legitimate than this is.
1984.84-231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1143.787,1144.805,Would you have any claim?
1984.84-231,0,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,1144.805,1149.774,"No, Your Honor, I would not, because I was not a resident at the time."
1984.84-231,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1539.345,1546.599,Mr. Farr?
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1546.599,1550.217,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1668.341,1673.745,"Mr. Farr, what is precisely the purpose of this tax exemption?"
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1673.745,1677.566,"The tax exemption, I think, has several purposes."
1984.84-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1687.022,1692.409,"If that is the purpose, this is kind of a peculiar date to impose, isn't it?"
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1692.409,1693.859,That is one of the purposes.
1984.84-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1696.778,1702.847,Because it picks up people who were not residents either at the time they were drafted or when they were discharged.
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1702.847,1709.918,I think if you look at the class that it does pick up the people who were residents at the time they went in.
1984.84-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1713.989,1718.624,"Well, it doesn't if they don't come back to New Mexico and they aren't there today."
1984.84-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1718.624,1721.326,They have to come back and be there today.
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1721.326,1722.278,--That is right.
1984.84-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1722.278,1725.547,"But, I guess the war ended in what date, the Vietnam War?"
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1725.547,1737.771,"The official date that Congress has given for the end of the Vietnam era is May 7, 1975 which is the date put in this statute in 1981 and then there was an additional year's grace period provided."
1984.84-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1737.771,1738.437,Now it is '76.
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1738.437,1739.204,That is correct.
1984.84-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1801.944,1809.283,"Mr. Farr, I may have misunderstood the statute, but did I correctly understand you to say that he had to enlist from New Mexico?"
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1809.283,1810.617,"No, no, no, I am sorry."
1984.84-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1836.868,1838.553,But does he even have to come back?
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1840.102,1841.838,"He has to be a resident now, yes."
1984.84-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1841.838,1843.338,--Why does he have to be a resident now?
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1843.338,1846.473,That is a separate requirement of the statute.
1984.84-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1846.473,1847.158,"Oh, is it?"
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1848.008,1848.608,"Yes, it is."
1984.84-231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1870.406,1884.165,"Would you see any problem, Mr. Farr, if they had this same kind of a plan in the state from which he moved so that he got a bonus back at the hometown and then got one here?"
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1884.165,1884.615,No.
1984.84-231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1911.083,1915.97,You intimate that they could constitutionally do that.
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1915.97,1921.29,"I believe they probably could constitutionally do that, but, as I say, they don't."
1984.84-231,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1921.29,1930.812,"But, if they have got a tax exemption back in the home state, then they would just be continuing their tax exempt status in your view here."
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1930.812,1934.43,"Well, the fact is though that... I think again it depends."
1984.84-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2011.578,2017.833,"Of course, this case is a little different because the New Mexico statute doesn't really require that."
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2017.833,2033.927,"It seems to me that the New Mexico statute is, in fact, more generous than the New York statute at issue in August versus Bronstein and, indeed, more generous than almost any other statute, in fact, perhaps any other statute that does give bonuses or other benefits."
1984.84-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.164,2198.318,"What about those people in that extended period, that year's grace period?"
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2204.305,2213.411,"--Well, I think again the fact that they give the extra year in my view doesn't make the thing any... constitutionally more infirm."
1984.84-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.961,2218.629,What if they had said we are going to give five years' grace period?
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2218.629,2227.068,--In one sense I think that the state is entitled to determine how long they think a reasonable readjustment period after a war would be.
1984.84-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.728,2257.523,You are saying these people who get the exemption have a substantial connection residence in New Mexico during a period that the Vietnam War had some substantial impact on people generally?
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2257.523,2258.556,--That is correct.
1984.84-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.341,2294.145,Why should the exemption go on forever?
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2294.145,2298.697,--In terms of the tax exemption?
1984.84-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.697,2299.214,Yes.
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2299.214,2303.251,I think that is simply a matter of how New Mexico chooses to--
1984.84-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.251,2312.941,But you were going to say that the readjustment period lasts for a length of time but not forever.
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2318.928,2326.331,"--Well, I certainly don't think New Mexico would be prohibited from ending the tax exemption but I don't think there is any requirement that they have to continue."
1984.84-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2344.412,2354.851,"I know, but if you are not basing it on a necessity for readjustment, it seems to me to give a life-long exemption rather exceeds the speed limit."
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2354.851,2359.755,I think it is essentially just a matter of state generosity.
1984.84-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2363.039,2364.039,Which it refuses to other people.
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2364.039,2364.689,--Pardon me?
1984.84-231,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.689,2366.541,Which is refuses to other people.
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2366.541,2374.431,"That is correct, because they are not within the class of people that New Mexico feels had the special ties at the time of what you are getting the benefit for."
1984.84-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2444.176,2455.149,"Mr. Farr, if your opponent is right, and I don't say whether he is or not, all that means is... He says they are all unconstitutional and the fact that they follow an unconstitutional pattern after every war doesn't add any force to this one."
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2455.149,2455.933,I understand that.
1984.84-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2548.445,2566.139,"Well, but it does of course give the tax exemption, for example, to someone who had never lived in New Mexico until, let's say, May 6, 1976, and who moves there that date but would deny it to somebody who came there May 9th."
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2566.139,2566.822,That is correct.
1984.84-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2570.441,2574.412,"And, that is the difficulty when you look at Zobel, I suppose."
1984.84-231,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,2574.412,2577.797,"--Well, I don't regard it as the same though for a couple of reasons."
1984.84-231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2821.005,2824.207,"Anything further, Mr. Hooper?"
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,2824.207,2827.009,"Yes, Your Honor, just a couple of comments."
1984.84-231,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2846.203,2850.607,"Mr. Hooper, you rely heavily on the one-year grace period you might call it."
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,2853.559,2857.511,"--No, Your Honor, I do not agree that it would be all right."
1984.84-231,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2857.511,2861.063,"Even then, of course, you would have the coincidence of residence and military service."
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,2861.063,2877.508,"Well, not necessarily, because even if they had said you had to be a resident on May 8, 1975, for example, the Vietnam service could have occurred in 1963 or 1964 and you still wouldn't have the coincidence of service."
1984.84-231,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2892.201,2903.326,What if they were to adopt a theory that they require a person to have been a resident or to have made up his mind to become a resident when he was in the service?
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,2903.326,2908.028,"Well, that certainly is a much more significant factor than what is involved in here."
1984.84-231,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2908.028,2921.72,"If they could do that, couldn't they adopt a short-hand proxy and we will presume that everybody who got here within the period it takes to get demobilized and transported back from the Far East and all the rest presumably made up his mind to come here while he was in Vietnam?"
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,2921.72,2924.655,"But, that is not the situation."
1984.84-231,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2938.749,2942.534,"Of course, the Vietnam War is a little different, but you said this case is really like all the others."
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,2957.393,2965.066,"--Well, in all these other... In fact, the Assessor mentioned that this simply made the residency requirement for Vietnam synonymous with the other wars."
1984.84-231,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2973.922,2976.957,"They all had a period of grace after them, didn't they, each of those?"
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,2976.957,2986.396,But here we are going back eight years prospectively in picking up... and in the meantime a large number of residents such as Appellants in this case moved to the state.
1984.84-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.582,3017.732,You want them to be generous to you?
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,3017.732,3024.438,I want them to treat me equally with all the others is my contention in this case.
1984.84-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.745,3050.672,"Well, you are saying, I suppose, that if New Mexico is giving... in 1985 giving a tax exemption for war service prior to 1975--"
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,3050.672,3053.172,"1976, Your Honor."
1984.84-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3053.172,3061.861,"--1976 and it is going to go on forever, other people who have war service and move to New Mexico ought to get the same break."
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,3061.861,3062.98,That is exactly right.
1984.84-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3067.015,3069.967,If it had been in a lump sum you wouldn't be arguing that.
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,3069.967,3072.252,"--A one-shot deal would not be the same, but if you allow--"
1984.84-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3072.252,3074.287,"Well, it not only wouldn't be the same, but--"
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,3074.287,3076.553,--I wouldn't be qualified for it.
1984.84-231,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3076.553,3077.469,--Yes.
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,3077.469,3098.716,"But, if you allow the exemption in this case, you are also allowing New Mexico to have a different income tax system for those who arrived before 1976 and those who arrived thereafter or charge a different sales tax rate or what would prevent the state in 1983 from saying welfare benefits such as involved in Shapiro will only be available to those who are residents of the state prior to May 8, 1976."
1984.84-231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3101.001,3107.255,"This sounds to me a little bit more, Mr. Hooper, like privileges and immunities argument than a right to travel argument."
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,3107.255,3112.809,--This case is not distinguishable from the Zobel case on the privileges and immunities issue.
1984.84-231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3112.809,3117.761,"Well, Zobel turned on what theory--"
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,3117.761,3124.348,"Zobel, to me, turned on a theory of equality of citizenship and equal protection."
1984.84-231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3124.348,3128.735,"--Equal protection clause, but not on the privileges and immunities."
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,3128.735,3132.521,"But, this case is indistinguishable from Zobel on the privileges and immunities."
1984.84-231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3132.521,3138.507,You are saying that we could not decide this case or should not decide it under the privileges and immunities clause?
1984.84-231,2,16236,alvin_d_hooper,,3138.507,3146.613,You did not decide Zobel on that basis and I would suggest that Zobel controls this case.
1984.84-231,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3146.613,3147.046,Very well.
