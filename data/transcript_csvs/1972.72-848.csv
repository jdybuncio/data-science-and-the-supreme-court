1972.72-848,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,24.105,"We'll hear arguments next in 72-848, United States against Murry."
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,25.982,28.946,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-848,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,186.201,195.319,Mr. Keith is there an administrative remedy provided for any improper income tax dependency claim?
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,195.319,210.454,"No there isn’t and it has been the administrative interpretation of this Act that it does deny food stamps, if the claim of an injunction is made and there's no inquiry into it whether it is valid or invalid."
1972.72-848,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,223.046,232.597,"That would be then, the applicants are helpless aren't they in the face of a -- an invalidly asserted dependency claim?"
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,232.597,250.29,"If the statute is construed as denying food stamps on the basis of an invalid claim, then there is no way for the applicant to establish that their claims is in fact -- that that the tax payer claim was in fact invalid and if they should receive food stamps, that is correct."
1972.72-848,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,261.67,265.297,"Well, does that concern you at all?"
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,265.297,275.725,Well it concerns me in the sense that we have pointed out to the Court that this Court has frequently interpreted statutes so as to avoid constitutional questions.
1972.72-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,418.461,423.318,"The illogical into that argument isn’t it, to the extent the case is moot?"
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,423.318,425.259,That’s correct Mr. Justice White.
1972.72-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,426.986,436.803,I haven’t -- could the Government to take that step you think that would make the case moot?
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,436.803,437.541,By issuing food stamps --
1972.72-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,437.541,441.675,Other than coming here and telling us that somebody made a mistake?
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,441.675,445.595,Well these applicants are scattered throughout the country as far --
1972.72-848,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,445.595,448.197,You start to say by issuing food stamps to them now?
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,448.197,448.689,That’s right.
1972.72-848,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,448.9,451.342,Why don’t you do it?
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,451.342,456.655,If -- I suppose if they would come in to apply for food stamps we could do that except for one fact Mr. Justice Brennan.
1972.72-848,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.655,458.718,You’ll save us a considerable time.
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,458.718,469.391,"Well, we have not conceded however that the statute denies or grants food stamps when the taxpayer dependency claim is invalid."
1972.72-848,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,493.752,498.629,That sounds pretty much like the argument in the previous case?
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,498.629,502.125,"Well, they are related cases which this Court took together."
1972.72-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,828.125,833.128,As a matter -- as a practical matter how does it -- again would this work?
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,846.593,864.101,I think the head of the household fills out the form and the form requests information about whether a parent of any of the 18 and older people in the household is providing support and if so if they're taking the young person as a tax exemption.
1972.72-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,891.204,897.028,"Well, by -- you don’t mean now claiming, this is something that’s done once a year -- by my most people on April -- on or before April 15."
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,897.028,898.92,"Well, that’s when they file their tax return."
1972.72-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,898.92,901.768,"Yes, well that’s when you make the claim too, that’s when you get the exemption?"
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,901.768,906.004,"Well, that’s not the way it’s been administered and I think rightly so."
1972.72-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,927.587,930.472,"Well, but that’s not the statute talks about?"
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,930.472,944.632,Well the statute speaks in terms of “is claimed” and we contend that “is claimed” refers to any claim that the taxpayer makes whether it’s on the withholding statement or in the form provided to the food stamp administrator.
1972.72-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,960.167,960.961,That is the --?
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,960.961,968.541,Common method of administration that you -- at the time of the application to send out to parents who request or stay respond to.
1972.72-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,968.541,970.829,And that’s only if --?
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,970.829,976.599,That’s only if the information provided by the applicant suggests the possibility that there is a tax dependent.
1972.72-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,976.599,977.257,Yes.
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,982.024,999.903,Generally I think it is accepted although other some evidence I think in the appendix that in cases where it looks suspicious they will nevertheless request that the parent’s address be provided in -- the food service does make an inquiry in those cases as well.
1972.72-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1005.118,1007.804,"And if he says yes, of course that’s accepted by (Voice Overlap) --"
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1007.804,1008.642,That would be accepted --
1972.72-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1008.642,1010.743,-- because that makes the man eligible?
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1010.743,1012.006,That’s right.
1972.72-848,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1012.006,1023.945,"And if he says I don’t know my father and I haven’t been on speaking in terms for the last three years then and only then are on this sub-circumstances you -- the agency communicates with the parent, is that it?"
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1023.945,1032.343,"Well, to my understanding that even if the applicant responds yes that there is a form sent to the -- the taxpayer, excuse me, dependent’s parents but (Voice Overlap) --"
1972.72-848,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1032.343,1033.015,"Well, I suppose you could --"
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1033.015,1034.719,(Voice Overlap) You really can’t speak with that -- on that with certainty.
1972.72-848,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1034.719,1048.735,I suppose you could have a case in which the father separated from the household is paying $30-50.00 a month for the support of the child and yet not take the deduction?
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1048.735,1049.594,That’s correct.
1972.72-848,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1049.594,1058.698,"And the -- so that the answer of the mother that -- yes, he is paying support, that’s not the basis on which of the (Voice Overlap) --"
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1058.698,1061.744,"Oh, no, not -- on that basis, they would not be denied food stamps."
1972.72-848,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1067.262,1070.094,"And he says, “No” or rather the mothers says, “No,” then what happens?"
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1070.094,1072.593,"Well, it depends upon the administrator."
1972.72-848,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1079.437,1083.97,Because it’s got to appear that the father in fact is taking the deduction?
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1083.97,1084.596,That’s correct.
1972.72-848,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1084.596,1089.453,"Before the food stamps are denied, isn’t it?"
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1089.453,1093.402,That would certainly be my understanding of how the statute should operate.
1972.72-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1118.304,1135.133,"Mr. Jones, is there any indication in this record as to whether the claims were -- the exemption that were concededly invalid wherever uncovered by a tax auditing process or before or after the suit was brought?"
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1135.133,1138.741,Nothing in the record suggests that Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1972.72-848,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1165.157,1173.761,"So far as this record shows and the people who filed erroneous claims of exemption have obtained the benefits of those claims in the tax area, is that right?"
1972.72-848,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1173.761,1177.391,That’s correct.
1972.72-848,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1295.037,1296.145,Thank you Mr. Jones.
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1298.445,1309.424,"Your Honor, I’d like to concentrate at the outset the appellant’s noble claim and that is a question that there is no standing by any of the appellees in this case."
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1552.531,1556.259,If I may just interrupt you and excuse me.
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1570.827,1574.92,"Yes, however, everyone in the household is denied food stamps."
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1583.383,1585.071,Now who is that person?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1585.071,1586.387,There is a young child by --
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1586.387,1586.814,A child?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1586.814,1592.78,"18 years of age, I think his name is Jordan Murry, and that child has been claimed as a tax --"
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1592.78,1595.409,So it’s not the -- not -- it's not the mother you're talking about?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1595.409,1596.35,That’s correct.
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1596.35,1598.242,The mother gets the income from the husband.
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1598.242,1598.6,That’s right.
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1598.6,1599.171,From her ex-husband.
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1599.171,1601.584,That’s right but everyone in the household is denied of food stamp.
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1601.584,1602.791,Because the child is claimed?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1602.791,1603.241,That’s correct.
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1603.241,1603.548,I see.
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1605.713,1609.905,"Now, appellee -- appellant’s misstate --"
1972.72-848,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1609.905,1615.178,You’re making no point of the claim of a grandchild in that case as of the --
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1615.178,1616.118,That’s correct.
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.567,1832.552,Where do you find it?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1832.552,1837.469,You’ll find that Your Honor on page 50 of my brief.
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.681,1847.097,Is that part of the opinion?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,1847.097,1848.359,"No, that is not part of the opinion."
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2136.994,2143.155,"Somebody under 19 can be a dependent, a child under 19 can be dependent even though he has an (Voice Overlap) --"
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2143.155,2144.768,"Between the ages of 18 and 19, that’s correct."
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2144.768,2146.979,(Voice Overlap) not more than $750.00?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2146.979,2147.351,That’s correct.
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2148.535,2154.257,The Internal Revenue Code makes the very -- the next -- 19 a critical age.
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2154.257,2154.707,That’s correct.
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2154.707,2156.273,And this law makes 18 the critical age?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2156.273,2157.188,That’s correct.
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2157.188,2159.839,"So, between 18 and 19, which are you telling us is not (Voice Overlap) --"
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2159.839,2160.319,That’s correct.
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2163.478,2166.102,Yes.
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2166.102,2174.629,"Now, you can never demonstrate throughout the entire administrative process that you have absolutely no access to nutritional adequacy."
1972.72-848,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2382.509,2391.722,"I guess, they have missed -- somebody takes the tax dependency and found out to be false and he goes to jail, that family would still be penalized?"
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2391.722,2394.034,That’s correct.
1972.72-848,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2447.907,2450.299,Then all that does not (Inaudible)
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2450.299,2451.407,Excuse me.
1972.72-848,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2451.407,2455.014,Granting all of that does not bear on the statute?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2455.014,2460.292,"No, what I am saying however is that’s not reasonably related to any purpose."
1972.72-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2460.292,2462.109,Could you construe the statute?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2468.825,2472.343,"If you wanted to create a pure fiction, I suppose you could."
1972.72-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2473.724,2477.735,Have the statutes never been saved by that process?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2477.735,2485.923,"I mean Your Honor, what in essence you’re doing is you’re saying the provision is so irrational that therefore we’re going to try and legislate it and make it rationale."
1972.72-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2488.298,2489.712,That doesn't answer my question.
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2494.209,2505.602,"I don’t know of an instance, Your Honor where both parties agree on what the statute says and the Court wound up coming up with a new interpretation of the statute just to save the statute."
1972.72-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2505.602,2514.663,"Well, look at -- take a look at Tilton against Richardson sometime when you have a free moment, decided last year."
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2514.663,2517.296,Okay.
1972.72-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2656.235,2668.914,"But you can in some cases, can’t you Mr. Pollack where a statement has been filed at the beginning of the year for the deduction purposes -- for the withholding purposes?"
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2668.914,2674.76,"For -- Your Honor, for withholding purposes, that does not require you to take a dependency claim, quite the contrary --"
1972.72-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2674.76,2677.239,"It doesn’t require it, but permits it, does it not?"
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2677.239,2679.311,"It may be an indication, yes Your Honor."
1972.72-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2723.017,2729.268,Could the statute be saved there again by invalidating if that provision on the carryover year?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2729.268,2740.541,"Your Honor, if you wish to strip all the arbitrary features of the statute, that would be fine because then there wouldn’t -- then we wouldn’t have a harmful statute."
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2755.654,2768.032,"But generally a person wouldn’t claim a dependency unless he hadn't-- unless he had to file an income tax return and he would not file an income tax return if he didn’t have income, won’t that be true?"
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2768.032,2769.112,That’s correct.
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2769.112,2774.089,So it does assume pre-supposed income on the part of the parent or guardian?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2774.089,2776.081,"Yes, that’s right."
1972.72-848,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2776.081,2777.678,"Then I misunderstood you, I guess."
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2777.678,2782.172,"No, the parent -- it is assumed that he does have income."
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2792.416,2800.55,Would your argument that any federal statute that you think is -- that the Court would find irrational is unconstitutional?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2800.55,2801.264,"No, no."
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2802.344,2805.118,"I mean, your argument here has just been irrationality?"
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2805.118,2814.77,"Well, what I’m trying to make clear I think is that this statute has no reasonable relationship to any legitimate governmental purpose."
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2833.505,2843.907,So this is a straight due process argument that any statute that doesn’t implement a legitimate aim is --
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2843.907,2849.358,That is not reasonably related and this provision is not reasonably related.
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.358,2854.233,This isn't then the federal claim of equal protection argument that you're talking about?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2854.233,2857.36,"Your Honor, yes, except to close from the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment."
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.36,2858.196,well I understand that.
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2864.841,2871.874,"Well, one class of individuals here is a group of people living in a household where no one has been claimed as a tax dependent."
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.874,2872.498,Right.
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2872.954,2883.005,The other one is where there is someone who has been claimed as a tax dependent where that dependent is over 18 years of age and the one group is disqualified and the other group is not disqualified.
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.005,2889.081,Can you imagine any situation in which the application to that rule would be justified?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2894.034,2896.668,"It would have to be purely by coincidence, Your Honor."
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.668,2902.385,I don’t -- I just asked if you could imagine though?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2902.385,2907.379,"If by coincidence someone did have adequate income, access to adequate income --"
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.379,2907.727,Yes.
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2907.727,2910.613,-- then if I could imagine --
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.613,2915.615,And what if Congress felt that happened -- that situation happened often?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2915.615,2916.513,"Well, that makes it --"
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2916.513,2927.502,"Would you strike it down to just say that this provision is just invalid because in many cases, the person who doesn’t have access to adequate income?"
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2927.502,2931.263,"Your Honor, I’m not saying that the purpose is impermissible."
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2936.988,2941.248,"Well, you said that they are in some instances it would be perfectly related if they're (Voice Overlap) --"
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2941.248,2957.777,"Your Honor, if we set as an example that all people who are left-handed should be denied food stamps because Congress for some reason thought that left handed people have access to adequate nutrition, I could imagine some circumstances where household containing a left-handed person --"
1972.72-848,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.777,2971.855,And that Congress decided to -- and Congress decided to use this way that that left-handed people so often had access to adequate income that we’re going to just say left-handed peopled are qualified under the food stamp program.
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,2973.671,2975.113,That’s correct.
1972.72-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2975.113,2998.74,"What if Congress hadn’t -- had a report here, in which they said their studies and searches indicated that a very large number of people for whom a deduction was taken actually received an average of $1,000.00 a year support from the person taking the deduction for them."
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,3001.396,3007.17,"Well, Your Honor, even under your hypothetical, the tax dependent is still needy under the appellant’s standards."
1972.72-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3007.17,3016.147,"Well, but does it serve a valid purpose if that’s the finding of Congress that if, what is the deduction now, $750.00?"
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,3016.147,3017.145,Seven hundred and fifty dollars.
1972.72-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3017.145,3034.555,"That for every $750.00, their studies showed in some way that 1,000 was actually given by way of support by the person claiming the deduction and representing more than half of the income?"
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,3034.555,3056.071,"Your Honor, it seem to me that since the entire basis of this provision assumes that those people who have been taken as a tax dependent have access to adequate income would seem to me, we would at least have to make some reasonable search to determine whether in fact that’s true and we can still look --"
1972.72-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3056.071,3056.881,In each case?
1972.72-848,1,40168,ronald_f_pollack,,3056.881,3062.153,"Not in each case, but I think its so clear as to how this provision operates."
1972.72-848,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3098.079,3099.035,Thank you.
1972.72-848,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3101.008,3103.177,"Yes, I do Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.72-848,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3132.333,3132.94,Exemption.
1972.72-848,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3132.94,3144.533,"Yes Mr. Justice Stewart and therefore, those households are different from households for which no tax exemption is provided."
1972.72-848,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3205.895,3208.428,How do they catch up with that file?
1972.72-848,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3208.428,3209.373,How do they catch up with that file?
1972.72-848,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3209.373,3212.214,"Yes, when a claim is made in a later year?"
1972.72-848,2,33866,keith_a_jones,,3212.214,3239.189,"If for example, the parent says during the year in which the applicant first comes to the administration that no, I’m not claiming my son as a dependent and then he files a tax return in the following year claiming the son is dependent then it’s unlikely quite frankly that he’ll be caught unless there is a spot check or a thorough check of the returns of such parents."
1972.72-848,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3248.938,3249.599,Thank you gentleman.
