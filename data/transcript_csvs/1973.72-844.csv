1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,2.864,5.132,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-844,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,472.549,479.464,"On this issue, the Courts of Appeals have given that theory hard going, haven’t they?"
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,479.464,486.262,"Well, yes sir, but I don’t think there was any basis for giving it hard going."
1973.72-844,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,503.367,509.355,"I don’t mean just the Fourth Circuit; I mean all of Courts of Appeals who have been decided, didn’t have go the other way, am I correct or not?"
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,509.355,510.106,No.
1973.72-844,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,549.41,557.073,"Well, does the rental agent’s activity constitute an enterprise within the meaning of the Act?"
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,557.073,561.318,I think that you have decided that it did on the Arnheim & Neely I think that the --
1973.72-844,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.318,566.416,"Yes; yes, and so the real question is what the income of the enterprise is."
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,566.416,570.715,Yes sir and the question is whether the rental income is sale.
1973.72-844,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.589,594.485,He made the sale.
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,595.728,596.251,Yes sir.
1973.72-844,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.976,605.011,"Well, the rental agent made a sale and he earned -- and he earned the commission."
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,605.011,606.754,Yes sir and what he sold was his services.
1973.72-844,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.754,608.253,He sold the owner’s property.
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,608.253,609.03,Sir?
1973.72-844,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,609.03,612.603,"He sold the owner’s property, in a sense?"
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,612.603,617.418,"Well, he -- He is an advisor and assistant to the owner in selling his property, yes sir."
1973.72-844,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,617.418,619.222,How did he sold his own services?
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,619.222,623.593,He sold his services as advisor and assistant as well he’s selling.
1973.72-844,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,836.225,844.342,"And each of those were required to pay the employee, the sum specified in the statute, the employee would have pre-hire pay, wouldn’t he?"
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,844.342,860.737,"Yes sir and certainly would and that the point I am making is that if you say just because he fits the definition of employer, that it is his employee that you take for instance in the Gamet with General Motors, you’ve got the President of General Motors as his employer."
1973.72-844,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,884.356,890.589,"Your argument is that in General Motors, a man -- every employee would have a thousand employers?"
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,890.589,891.303,Yes sir.
1973.72-844,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,891.859,895.912,"Why -- you’re not telling me that is anybody goes that far, are you?"
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,895.912,896.189,No sir.
1973.72-844,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,898.606,900.877,Or will anybody go that far?
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,900.877,914.898,"Yes sir, I am saying to you that the Court of Appeals in concerning this matter in Arnheim said that the definition in this statute says an employer is so and so and therefore there is coverage and that the --"
1973.72-844,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,914.898,923.239,But do you take that Court or any other Court will go that far as to say one employee has a thousand employers?
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,923.239,923.525,No sir.
1973.72-844,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,952.722,957.829,"Well, a lot of companies I know go bankrupt but the foreman retire?"
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,957.829,959.553,Yes sir.
1973.72-844,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1033.213,1035.281,"So, it against the owner would it fail?"
1973.72-844,0,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,1035.281,1035.705,Yes sir.
1973.72-844,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1087.5,1089.272,"Very well, Mr. Kelly."
1973.72-844,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1095.483,1100.148,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-844,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1201.058,1206.646,"That has significance only when you reach the conclusion that it’s one enterprise, doesn’t it?"
1973.72-844,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1206.646,1218.39,"Well, no the Court has decided in Arnheim & Neely that the management company conducts a single enterprise which consists of its building management operations."
1973.72-844,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1218.39,1220.536,That flows from Arnheim.
1973.72-844,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1220.536,1222.524,That was decided in Arnheim & Neely.
1973.72-844,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1229.652,1246.028,Let us assume Mr. Fry that you have a gross sales taxes of some kind in a State which was three percent of the gross income of an enterprise.
1973.72-844,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1250.989,1259.576,"Well, it would rest on income and of course, that is very significant distinction because this case does not turn in any way on the enterprises income."
1973.72-844,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1269.794,1276.371,But it would -- and it would be the answer to the question I suppose you’d have to say it progressed on the commission.
1973.72-844,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1276.371,1278.198,The income would of course be the commissions.
1973.72-844,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1278.198,1280.663,And not only total rentals.
1973.72-844,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1280.663,1283.575,"No question about that, but that’s not the statutory standard for coverage."
1973.72-844,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1283.575,1294.24,"And probably gross income, the gross sale tax would rest on the --"
1973.72-844,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1294.24,1295.342,Would rest on the sales.
1973.72-844,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1295.342,1299.998,"The owners in terms of what they receive, I suppose if the tax is brought and --"
1973.72-844,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1299.998,1300.954,Not at all.
1973.72-844,2,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,2930.345,2933.811,"Yes sir, if I may take a moment."
1973.72-844,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3039.855,3043.118,That would be the rent that was reserved in the lease for a period of time?
1973.72-844,2,27449,herbert_v_kelly,,3043.118,3046.504,"Yes sir, the rents then existing as what I say to you."
1973.72-844,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3140.315,3140.979,Thank you gentlemen.
