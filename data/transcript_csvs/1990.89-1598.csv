1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,54.176,57.258,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,125.604,127.026,Not all of them?
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,127.093,129.697,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1990.89-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,129.697,131.117,Not all of the passengers?
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,131.117,138.002,"Well, there were 162 people on board and there are 25 plaintiffs in this case, so I guess you can draw your own conclusions from... from that."
1990.89-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.008,226.081,"Mr. Murray, if a... if a passenger in an accident covered by the Warsaw Convention did suffer some physical injury such as a cut on the leg in the course of whatever happened in the air, but also says that there were emotional injuries suffered as well, can the damages cover both the injury to the leg and the emotional trauma?"
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,226.081,230.503,"Our position is, Justice O'Connor, that they can."
1990.89-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,240.741,250.334,"Well, is that because those emotional injuries are incorporated under the term ""lesion corporelle"" as a matter of law in France?"
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,250.334,251.406,"No, it's not."
1990.89-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,271.499,278.224,Why do you say that the emotional injury in the case I posed is recoverable?
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,278.224,278.675,I think--
1990.89-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.675,283.677,Under what language of the Warsaw Convention is it covered?
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,283.677,297.535,"--Well, Your Honor, the Convention provides... the original French version of the Convention provides that a past... that the carrier is responsible for damage or dommage in the original French."
1990.89-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,316.87,319.611,And that would include the emotional injury?
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,319.611,321.082,We believe it includes the emotional injury--
1990.89-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.082,331.899,"But you take the position that the term ""lesion corporelle"" requires as a condition precedent some physical injury to the body?"
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,331.899,332.79,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
1990.89-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,344.038,352.273,And the emotional injury can be compensable even though it results from causes unrelated to the cut?
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,352.273,359.108,"I believe that is a fair result, Your Honor."
1990.89-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,374.198,386.023,"You, you rely on the language I presume, which does, does not say damages caused by death, wounding, or other bodily injury, but damage sustained in the event of."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,396.831,397.362,"Yes, I--"
1990.89-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,438.64,451.806,"The problem I have, Mr. Murray, is that I cannot imagine a bodily injury that is not a wounding... I mean, wounding is a very... I'm not sure that's a good... ""a lesion corporelle"" that is not a ""blessure""."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,453.709,478.314,"Yes, Your Honor, the, the research that we've done into the French meaning of these terms indicates that a ""blessure"" indicates a trauma of such force that it is in fact a wounding and the example that the text used is if there's a simply compound fracture of a bone and there is no breaking of the skin, then that is not a ""blessure""."
1990.89-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.194,496.005,"--Very, very elegant, but I'm not... I'm not sure it's right."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,516.03,517.321,Justice Kennedy--
1990.89-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,517.321,527.558,"Because it, it seems to me that ""any other"" might relate ""lesion corporelle"" to wounding or death."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,527.558,552.533,"--Justice Kennedy, it appears that... and our analysis is that ""mort"" and ""blessure"" are not totally inclusive, as I just explained, of any bodily injury, any trauma, any impact, any infringement on the body, and the terms ""de tout autre"", ""lesion corporelle"" were included to expand."
1990.89-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,552.533,556.417,"I'm just referring to the words ""de tout autre""."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,559.248,563.821,"I believe that, that other words could be used to include--"
1990.89-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,563.821,566.893,"Well, it could have eliminated those."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,569.564,571.396,"--Yes, I think they could have."
1990.89-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,571.396,573.696,So that has no effect on your case?
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,573.696,576.779,"No, not... not to my understanding."
1990.89-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.779,593.259,"Well, it may harm your case a little bit, because if you... as you've just described the difference between ""blessure"" and ""lesion corporelle"", ""lesion corporelle"" is not another... I mean a ""blessure"" is one kind of ""lesion corporelle"", I assume."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,593.259,593.57,That's correct.
1990.89-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.573,597.913,You've told me... you've told me that they're two different things.
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,597.913,600.905,--I'm not saying that they're two different things.
1990.89-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,615.004,615.745,I see.
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,623.889,629.352,"Yes, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's the way we read and understand the phrase."
1990.89-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,715.47,722.554,"Now at the so-called Guatemala Accords, which have not yet been approved I gather in this country--"
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,722.554,723.395,Correct.
1990.89-1598,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,723.395,728.179,--would the meaning change under the Convention?
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,728.179,743.627,"Justice O'Connor, we don't feel that the... number one, the original French translation of article 17, the original French version rather of article 17 remains unchanged from the 1929 Convention to the present time."
1990.89-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,826.07,834.897,"But you certainly would get some presumably legitimate claims of emotional distress, not feigned, that would be thrown out under this line of reasoning."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,834.897,837.22,"--Unquestionably, Mr. Chief Justice, there will be."
1990.89-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.57,864.695,"Mr. Murray, they, they argue in response that the requirement of an accident imposes some kind of a limit on the danger that every time you get in a rainstorm, you have a lot of claims."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,867.227,878.086,"Justice Stevens, I think that that is a concern that Eastern has and that other carriers have in this... in this issue."
1990.89-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.557,931.602,I thought so and although the respondents' brief in this case suggests that a turbulence encounter is not an accident as I recall it.
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,931.602,955.687,"Justice Scalia, there are a number of cases that we have dealt with that have... we've treated as accidents and there certainly are cases that hold that a turbulence encounter, an unexpected turbulence encounter, is an accident, as would be, for example, a four-engine aircraft that has a problem with one engine and a precautionary shutdown is made."
1990.89-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,975.991,981.093,Of course the absolute liability came into effect with the Montreal Treaty--
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,981.093,981.924,That's--
1990.89-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,981.924,984.755,--and it seems to me that that's irrelevant.
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,994.862,997.112,"--That's... well, that's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1598,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1035.988,1041.832,"Well, but the point still is that as of the time of the Warsaw Convention you were subject to strict liability."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1041.832,1042.993,That's correct.
1990.89-1598,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.256,1064.838,Has this issue been litigated in the French courts?
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1064.838,1066.929,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1990.89-1598,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1072.572,1072.843,Yes.
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1072.843,1074.844,--manifestation is compensable under the Convention?
1990.89-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1074.844,1075.214,Right.
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1075.214,1076.754,We know of no cases that--
1990.89-1598,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.754,1081.178,"Well, is there, is there some French view about this issue?"
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1081.178,1109.976,"--The... well, the French law in our judgment does contemplate recovery in negligence cases for pure mental injury and I think that that is well covered in the French wording of article 17 where it talks about 17 and they... we would feel that they would contemplate recovery for whatever--"
1990.89-1598,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.976,1114.24,"Well, is there a French... is there a French view about the meaning of the Warsaw Convention?"
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1114.24,1117.342,"--Not in this context that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1990.89-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1117.342,1135.345,"It struck me, Mr. Murray, that both the... your brief and the respondents' brief were quite lacking in any French interpretations of what this term would have meant at the time the Warsaw Convention was adopted."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1137.896,1141.54,"Well, and when you say that term, are you--"
1990.89-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1141.54,1142.397,"""Lesion corporelle""."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1142.397,1143.288,"--""Lesion corporelle""."
1990.89-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.142,1185.768,"You can read through cases construing the code Napoleon then and find no use of the term ""lesion corporelle""?"
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1185.768,1206.02,"I'm not saying we didn't find any use of the term ""lesion corporelle"", but I think that the readings that we did and the things that we cited in our brief and with which there's very... generally no disagreement is the fact that the term ""lesion corporelle"" is translated appropriately to be bodily injury."
1990.89-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.02,1208.701,But lesion does not mean lesion.
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1216.238,1217.297,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.297,1219.49,I mean we shouldn't be misled to think that it means lesion.
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1219.49,1220.359,"That, that there--"
1990.89-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.359,1223.902,"Your position is that when it's combined with ""corporelle"", it means what you say."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1223.902,1224.573,--Exactly.
1990.89-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.717,1265.88,"Do you think that question is fairly presented by your question presented for certiorari, Mr. Murray?"
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1265.88,1274.475,"Yes, Your Honor, we feel that even though it wasn't in the first page of the brief as a question presented, it was certainly raised."
1990.89-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1281.02,1300.251,"Well, let, let me read you... your question presented which of course it at the first page of your brief, whether in view of the presumed liability under Warsaw Convention for death, wounding, or any other bodily injury, an air carrier is liable for fright, psychic injury, or emotional distress, absent objective bodily injury or absent any physical manifestation of injury."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1308.757,1324.237,"Under that question perhaps not, Your Honor, but under rule 14 of the rules of the Court we feel that the question as is discussed later in the brief and is argued and is fully presented, does adequately preserve the question of exclusivity before the Court."
1990.89-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.237,1330.341,"But when we grant cert., I assume we grant cert. on the question that's contained on the first page."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1342.58,1343.93,"It was not, Your Honor."
1990.89-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1349.355,1355.527,"It wasn't [inaudible] a separate section addressing it, but it was sort of by the way, you know, while you're about it, you might want to address this other question."
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1355.527,1356.148,--Yes.
1990.89-1598,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.148,1357.17,Is how you sort of put it.
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1357.17,1358.27,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1358.27,1362.862,"And beyond that, hasn't the Florida court held there's not State law cause of action here anyway?"
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1362.862,1373.091,"They have held that there is no State law cause of action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress as pled in the pleadings of the case that it considered, that's the--"
1990.89-1598,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1373.091,1374.79,So what do want us to preempt?
1990.89-1598,0,32077,john_michael_murray,,1374.79,1393.664,"--Well, Your Honor, there are two cases under the Floyd Eleventh Circuit decision wherein the Court allows an amendment to the complaint, that is, the Khoury case and the Dix case, and we feel that the controversy is in fact alive."
1990.89-1598,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1493.038,1495.519,"Thank you, Mr. Murray."
1990.89-1598,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1498.14,1504.225,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1519.897,1528.041,"I felt that, I felt that was lacking, too, in any discussion of contemporary French law at the time of the Warsaw Convention was adopted."
1990.89-1598,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1528.041,1549.545,"The Eleventh Circuit's analysis is drawn almost entirely, maybe 75 percent, from a book written by Professor or Dr. Rene Mankiewicz of McGill University, who from my reading on this subject is considered the single leading expert on the question of the meaning of the language in the Warsaw Convention."
1990.89-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.529,1579.085,Did Dr. Mankiewicz in his treatise discuss French personal injury law--
1990.89-1598,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1579.085,1579.245,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1579.245,1581.746,--as of the vintage of the Warsaw Convention?
1990.89-1598,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1623.644,1634.901,"Dr. Mankiewicz's opinion was that the phrase meant something broader than either ""dommage personal"" or ""dommage patrimoniel""."
1990.89-1598,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.36,1658.526,"Well, did, did he deduce that I take it not from French legal authorities which you say didn't even use the term, but simply from a translation from the French?"
1990.89-1598,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1658.526,1671.804,"No, he deduced it from a number of facts, Your Honor, one of which was that the French civil law simply did not recognize the distinction that Mr. Murray has asked the Court to read into or impose upon article 17."
1990.89-1598,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1694.209,1701.363,Then there are cases that say you may recover for mental... for some kind of a mental upset.
1990.89-1598,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1701.363,1705.897,"--There are cases in the French civil law and in the Napoleonic Code, as Mr. Murray has conceded."
1990.89-1598,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1705.897,1708.759,"But there were not any... I mean, this is a treaty we're talking."
1990.89-1598,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1759.433,1760.112,Most--
1990.89-1598,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.112,1761.133,"That's must not plausible, is it?"
1990.89-1598,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1761.133,1775.381,"--Most respectfully, Justice Scalia, the English common law recognized and has recognized for centuries various tortious causes of action for the recovery solely of mental injuries, the law of defamation for one."
1990.89-1598,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.554,1778.954,Unintentional?
1990.89-1598,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1778.954,1783.098,"A negligent assault, negligent defamation--"
1990.89-1598,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.098,1784.067,Negligent assault?
1990.89-1598,1,30150,joel_d_eaton,,1785.699,1788.13,--You have... negligence--
1990.89-1598,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1788.13,1788.651,--It's an intentional tort.
