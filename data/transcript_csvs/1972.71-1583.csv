1972.71-1583,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.844,"-- in 71-1583, Brown against Chote."
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,30.493,33.373,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1583,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,190.57,194.197,"In that respect, why is it the percentage, why isn’t a flat fee?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,201.446,222.766,"The answer to that I believe, Your Honor, is that the -- a particular flat fee over the years with the inflation that we have would tend to be perhaps minimal at one period of time and then become rather excessive in other periods of inflation or depression periods."
1972.71-1583,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,269.502,275.188,"But you are charging candidate A more than candidate B, if they are not running for the same office?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,275.188,277.406,"That is true, Your Honor."
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,320.648,337.371,"But then also as I understand your argument, you first quote the language in Bullock, recognizing that the state has a legitimate interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot and preventing clogging of its election machinery by frivolous candidates."
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,357.42,358.655,"That would be true, Your Honor."
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,440.492,441.045,Why?
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,441.045,441.93,And one --
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,441.93,443.394,Why?
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,453.175,470.75,"Well, I think the reasons we have to give for that is really by history of a candidate filing fee, Your Honor is that, the part of it, the -- these candidate filing fees came into avoid this overcrowding."
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,486.203,492.513,"Then, they would -- you could have a selected one and only have two."
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,494.358,494.671,Yes.
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,498.383,503.911,But why do you have it on the -- is this gross or half of the income tax?
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,503.911,505.144,"Well, this is on the gross."
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,505.144,506.476,"Gross, yes."
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,506.476,514.59,"For instance, for a member of Congress which is 42,500, the fee would be $425.00, and --"
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,514.59,519.606,And you think that no man would -- who doesn’t have $400 has a right to run?
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,519.606,537.118,"Well, I’m saying really that the personal well for lack of wealth of the individual candidate is really not the critical issue is that, we all know campaigns cost a lot of money that Mayor may not be a good thing but campaign’s cost a lot of money."
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,574.974,581.532,"Then you say both candidates, use your language in this day and age, just have no chance to run?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,581.532,585.082,"No, I’m saying that a poor man has a good chance of running."
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,587.799,592.481,"Well, the poor man without a rich friend to run?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,592.481,594.066,Poor man without a rich friend?
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,594.393,595.652,If he had budget?
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,595.652,605.66,He would have to -- if he wants to run -- run in the spring of 1974 for instance he knows what our statutory fee is and has been for good many years.
1972.71-1583,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,626.005,637.616,Was it your brief or an amicus brief that made the point that if a man is a serious candidate he should have no trouble finding 425 people who can contribute a dollar an each.
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,637.72,640.207,"We, that as an example, yes Your Honor."
1972.71-1583,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,662.177,674.073,"Well, I take it if you can’t raise $425.00 and plans to run for Congress, his candidacy is pretty well fore doomed, regardless of whether there is a filing fee or not."
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,681.935,702.077,"Yes Your Honor, we agree with that, is that this is merely a threshold requirement really to test his seriousness as to whether he has a sufficient backing in the community to take a place on the ballot and we have to consider also, on with the various types of machines."
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,733.197,734.766,Because of the length of the ballot?
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,734.766,736.582,"That was one of considerations, yes."
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,736.646,738.624,"So, you didn’t cut it down, did you?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,738.624,748.759,"Well as I said, the decision in the case was on March 9, 1972 and there was only a period of 24 hours for people to learn about the decision."
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,762.892,777.888,"But on your question of if the man can’t get enough support, I might very well be willing to vote for you for office and yet not be willing to give you a single nickel, right?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,777.888,778.757,That’s true Your Honor.
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,778.757,784.516,"Am I thinking you are the greatest man in the world, but I mean not -- I don’t have the money to hand around."
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,793.636,805.959,"That would be inclined to agree with that and I also would add that the way that our election system has been operating for a substantial period of time, you really can’t separate the two to determine a serious candidate."
1972.71-1583,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,817.596,823.255,(Inaudible) go in California?
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,823.255,842.839,"In California, there is a division between the Counties and the State for what we term state or federal offices that is the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor or the State Assembly, the State Senate, members in Congress."
1972.71-1583,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,868.699,869.837,They go into the general revenue?
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,869.837,878.619,They would go into the general county revenues and both the state and county to carry that through would have some substantial election expense.
1972.71-1583,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,886.282,896.934,"There’s an intimation in the ACLU amicus brief that never has there been an appropriation of the fees made for the Election Commission, is this correct or not?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,896.934,899.723,"This is hard to be specific, Your Honor."
1972.71-1583,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.609,954.076,"Would you take the same position in the District Court as you did here, as you are arguing here?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,954.076,958.864,"In the District Court, Your Honor, the matter moved very rapidly."
1972.71-1583,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,994.371,1006.741,"So, the District Court was quite right when it said since no showing has been made by the state concerning either the necessity, the purpose or the reasonableness of the filing fee statutes in question we conclude that they’re invalid?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1006.741,1009.851,"Well, I can't agree to what showing would be necessary."
1972.71-1583,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.046,1013.861,I’m just interested --
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1013.861,1014.302,Right.
1972.71-1583,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.302,1018.858,You didn’t even make the argument or the showing that you are now presenting here in this Court?
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1018.858,1020.243,"No, we made that argument."
1972.71-1583,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.679,1031.911,"So, you made -- you made the argument that this was necessary to keep a non-serious candidates off the ballot?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1031.911,1035.208,"That is correct Your Honor, and we cited various cases around the country that --"
1972.71-1583,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1035.208,1041.934,"And what that -- what’s the source of this statement then that you made no showing, is it that there wasn’t evidence introduced --"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1041.934,1043.429,That’s the only thing that I can think.
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1070.782,1078.725,"General Ullerich, something rather fundamentally in this case causes me concern."
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1106.624,1109.935,"That was the extent of the injunction, yes."
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1109.935,1111.912,"Well, that’s all then we’re dealing with, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1111.912,1113.097,"But, that --"
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1113.097,1117.61,"We’re not in other words, analogizing it to Griffin against Illinois."
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1139.074,1141.408,That was the precise wording of --
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1141.408,1143.22,"Well then that’s all we’re dealing with, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1143.22,1155.473,"Well, I’m not so sure we’re limited to that because it seems to me if the statute is unconstitutional as the Court predicated its decision, there was a good argument that it should be unconstitutional as to all --"
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1155.473,1161.801,"Well, maybe there might be a good argument at some other case, but in this case, isn’t that all that this Court held?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1172.293,1172.593,That’s what --
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1172.593,1174.626,And file an affidavit to that effect?
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1174.626,1176.9,That was the precise holding of the court below.
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1176.9,1180.559,"But, it’s argued here as though the holding was something quite different, I think."
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1180.559,1222.594,"But no, that was that the precise holding, but what we’re arguing and part of the reason why we perhaps broadened it is that, we are concerned with this distinction really that the Court is making between an indigent gaining a place on the ballot through this means devised by the Court as opposed to a hard-working employed man who perhaps really has political ambitions and skill and ability, but because he’s put aside a minimal amount of money to send his children to college or to care for the necessities of life, and he wants to run for office, he is going to have to pay this $425.00 filling fee."
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1222.594,1246.573,"And all that concern goes through all of the American society, hospitalization and everything else, but am I wrong and thinking that the precise holding of this Court in this case was not that the filing fees violate the Equal Protection Clause, but simply that it would violate the Equal Protection Clause to require an indigent to pay them, am I mistaken about that?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1246.573,1252.034,I guess I the terminologies the court would use if they would declare the statute unconstitutional as applied to the --
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1252.034,1254.871,To somebody who filed an affidavit that he could not pay them?
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1254.871,1258.363,That he did not have personally the money or property to pay the candidate filing fees.
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1258.363,1259.347,Right.
1972.71-1583,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1259.347,1272.895,"But even as so limited, that doesn’t meet the problem that you raise that there might be 66 candidates for Congress on the ballot that doesn’t meet that problem, doesn’t it?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1272.895,1278.425,It certainly does not and let me give another example as to where the decision below leads us.
1972.71-1583,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1313.973,1328.75,"Mr. Attorney General, does California use for any office the system that’s prevalent in many states of requiring petitions signed by specified percentage of the vote in the last election?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1328.75,1333.13,California does not at this time have such a system.
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1583.625,1585.705,"You think there maybe as many as three tests, do you?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1585.705,1587.681,That’s what I’m really suggesting that the --
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1587.681,1591.003,How about the -- do you think there might be more than that?
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1591.003,1591.668,A standard --
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1591.668,1596.084,"There could be an infinite number of tests, I suppose couldn't there?"
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1596.084,1596.873,That’s true.
1972.71-1583,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1596.873,1610.853,"Depending upon which test -- if the majority of the Court was -- and decided to invalidate a state law, they would annunciate the test that was required to do so."
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1610.853,1613.732,Very -- Just one quick point.
1972.71-1583,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1662.595,1666.677,God didn’t wait for us on capital punishment?
1972.71-1583,0,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,1666.677,1670.48,I really don’t mean the second guess that Court.
1972.71-1583,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1715.12,1717.753,Mr. Elman?
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,1717.753,1723.721,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1583,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1805.217,1827.647,"Mr. Elman, I’m sure you’ve read the Bullock case more recently than I have in connection with this argument, but wasn’t the vice in the Bullock case that Texas was making the candidates in a primary bear the entire cost of the election as distinguished from any filing process?"
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,1829.819,1831.248,"Well, Your Honor, --"
1972.71-1583,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1831.248,1837.466,And it was delegated to political parties and not to state officials?
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,1837.466,1848.49,"I wouldn’t presume to tell the Court what the essence of the case so recently decided was, even though I have read it in the last few days --"
1972.71-1583,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1848.49,1850.204,Aren’t those the facts?
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,1850.204,1871.637,"It was certainly a -- the Bullock case, the Bullock case like this case embodies a number of facts highly favorable to the candidate in attacking the constitutionality of the filing fee system."
1972.71-1583,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1884.043,1885.913,"$8000 or 9,000 for some offices?"
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,1885.913,1907.709,"County judge, county judge, the fee could be fixed as high as $8,900.00 and the two offices that were particularly involved in the Bullock case, County Commissioner fee was $1,400.00 and the county judge, another office and another county was $6,300.00."
1972.71-1583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2068.674,2071.926,"In that case Mr. Elman, am I not --"
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2071.926,2072.399,I beg pardon sir?
1972.71-1583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2072.399,2081.062,"Am I correct in recalling that in the Bullock case, the Court invalidated the whole system of so-called filing fees."
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2103.41,2107.64,I’m not sure that the Bullock case can be distinguished on that ground Your Honor.
1972.71-1583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2107.64,2108.896,But what is the holding in the Bullock case?
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2108.896,2109.455,As I recall it --
1972.71-1583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2109.455,2112.084,What was the ultimate holding in the Bullock case?
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2112.084,2114.6,The ultimate holding in the Bullock case was it was a --
1972.71-1583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2114.6,2116.515,"That scheme was invalid, wouldn’t it?"
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2116.515,2119.904,-- was a declaration by this Court that the scheme was invalid.
1972.71-1583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2119.904,2121.385,"Here, there’s not such holding?"
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2124.664,2132.546,The District Court dealt with this case on the basis of an application for preliminary injunction and the state is here appealing --
1972.71-1583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2132.546,2133.022,Right.
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2133.022,2135.111,-- from the preliminary injunction.
1972.71-1583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2141.264,2141.801,And the injunction --
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2141.801,2142.591,And --
1972.71-1583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2142.591,2146.722,"Is matter only to those who file affidavits of -- they actually pay, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2146.722,2149.229,But the injunction was also so limited in the Bullock case.
1972.71-1583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2149.229,2149.902,Was it?
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2149.902,2151.147,"Yes sir, as I recall."
1972.71-1583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2151.815,2152.143,I didn’t know --
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2152.143,2166.963,"-- unless my memory fails me very badly, but the difference in the posture of the case is, this that here we are -- here the Court has before an appeal by the state from a preliminary injunction."
1972.71-1583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2207.107,2221.344,"Well, may be I quite misunderstood the terms of that preliminary injunction, but I had understood that the way I indicated it, that would -- if I’m correct in that, then it would be equally applicable if the favor just $1.00 a candidate across the board."
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2235.706,2241.947,"Mr. Justice Stewart, let me hasten to say that you’re right in your reading of the preliminary injunction in this case."
1972.71-1583,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2244.985,2245.475,And why do I --
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2245.475,2248.408,"By indigent candidate, and I agree with you."
1972.71-1583,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.316,2283.504,"Mr. Elman, could we treat it even more narrowly than Justice Stewart has indicated and say simply that simply this was a preliminary injunction that Bullock afforded a reasonable argument for the trial court to grant preliminary relief and not even pass on the constitutionality in the final sense of the California system, even as applied to indigents here?"
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2283.504,2285.791,I can’t disagree with you Your Honor.
1972.71-1583,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2343.67,2348.437,"And that the political committee, not a public official fixed the amount of the fee?"
1972.71-1583,1,37874,phillip_elman,,2348.437,2350.345,"Yes, that’s right sir."
1972.71-1583,2,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,3607.442,3623.91,"Only on the question of Boddie versus Connecticut which came up and as I recall, that was the case where the fundamental relationship of divorce, certain people would not have to pay the court filing fees in order to get access to the court."
1972.71-1583,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3655.479,3660.203,"Also that case was decided under a different provision of the constitution, other than one that's here."
1972.71-1583,2,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,3660.203,3661.362,That’s right Your Honor.
1972.71-1583,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3662.275,3682.48,"But, it maybe that the -- maybe that you can say the State has a legitimate interest in doing what it is doing, for a legitimate interest in limiting the ballot, but don’t you also have to demonstrate that what you are doing contributes to that end, substantially contributes to that end."
1972.71-1583,2,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,3698.741,3704.018,"Well, I think that would be true if you talk about the $10.00 or $15.00 fee, Your Honor."
1972.71-1583,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3708.481,3714.676,"Well, that was so easy, if it's so easy, the state interest isn’t served anyway?"
1972.71-1583,2,28278,henry_g_ullerich,,3714.676,3730.328,"Well, what I was saying is if we are going to talking about four or $500.00, I think the strip teaser or the car salesman for instance, are going to think twice before they use that as a mode of advertisement or public relationship, even if they have the money to pay."
1972.71-1583,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3736.722,3737.305,Thank you gentlemen.
1972.71-1583,3,37874,phillip_elman,,3749.743,3753.728,Thank you very much.
