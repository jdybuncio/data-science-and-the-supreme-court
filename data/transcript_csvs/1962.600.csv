1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,16.232,20.747,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.600,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,206.847,211.426,[Inaudible] were there any objections [Inaudible]
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,211.426,232.273,"During the course of the trial at criminal court, no sir, but I think that is answered quite clearly by the Court of Appeals that any objection even if it had been made wouldn't have made any difference, because the Maryland has recognized the rule that if you plead guilty before a magistrate they can introduce this plea in evidence against you."
1962.600,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,232.913,244.812,They may have [Inaudible] held back but your instance is that in this case it wasn't [Inaudible].
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,244.812,247.511,"Yes, I am insisting that but you held --"
1962.600,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,247.511,254.458,When is the --- When was there meaningful waiver of the right to the jury trail?
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,258.476,259.297,"No, sir."
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,259.297,261.084,Under the --
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,261.084,268.69,"Well, actually he had everything that happen to him happened before it took place at his appearance before the magistrate."
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,268.69,273.049,"Well, when was the jury trial waived?"
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,273.049,275.766,"Well actually, that was waived by his attorney."
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,279.056,281.417,"Alright, you may think so."
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,281.417,282.253,"No, I am not trying to --"
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.253,283.892,I was just trying to find whether it does it or not?
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,283.892,284.525,"I am sorry, sir."
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,285.828,288.761,"Well, this was the jury trial or not?"
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,288.761,289.137,"No, sir."
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,290.196,291.959,When was it first waived?
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,291.959,297.882,"When was it first waived, at his arraignment; at his re-arraignment on November 25th."
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,297.882,300.832,"Well, when he was represented by counsel?"
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,300.832,302.734,When he was represented by counsel.
1962.600,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,307.414,309.299,When was the preliminary hearing?
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,309.299,318.743,"The preliminary hearing was, one was on May 31 and then the – at which time it postponed who was asked for by the state."
1962.600,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,327.841,328.86,August the 9?
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,328.86,329.588,August the 9.
1962.600,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,329.588,331.648,And the arraignment was when though?
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,331.648,341.518,"November the -- the arraignment, the meaningful arraignment, it was November 25, 1960, but let me make this point clear."
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,342.918,351.379,"[Inaudible] May 31, I take it he was brought before the magistrate."
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,351.379,352.508,That's correct.
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.508,364.202,And it says the accused when before me and on being informed on by me his right to trail by jury freely elected to try [Inaudible] and same thing occurs the next time in this matter –-
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,364.202,365.177,That's correct sir.
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,367.54,368.333,"Well, I know."
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,374.615,377.434,No sir.
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,377.434,378.331,Why is that?
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,378.331,380.737,"Because, you are talking about a waiver for a jury trial?"
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,380.737,381.004,Yeah.
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,381.004,388.244,Because the preliminary hearing is just to determine in Maryland whether or not the state can make out a prime facie case against the –-
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.244,391.278,What does the waiver of a jury trail relate hereto.
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,391.278,397.895,There is -- the question of waiver of a jury trail was never discussed in any of these cases sir or any of the arguments.
1962.600,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,397.895,404.527,Then we shouldn't pay no attention whatsoever to the fact that he waived a trial by jury at his preliminary hearing.
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,404.527,405.213,That's correct.
1962.600,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,417.281,419.486,"What is this, a printed form or something, what --"
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,419.486,421.109,"Yes sir, this is --"
1962.600,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,421.109,423.668,Why are those words in the form?
1962.600,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,423.668,426.237,Might to create I suppose as power to try on –-
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,426.237,427.268,"Certain, certain types of cases --"
1962.600,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,427.268,428.156,That's the case --
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,428.156,429.671,He has jurisdiction.
1962.600,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,450.71,453.118,Well perhaps you can take out.
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,458.42,458.777,Exactly –-
1962.600,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,458.777,461.283,-- where some other offence was involved but not where a capital --
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,461.283,467.726,Not where a capital offence or where a burglary offence or any other things over which a magistrate does not have jurisdiction.
1962.600,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,467.726,473.23,"Well then, then what you told Justice White right at the case we may forget it having any bearing on --"
1962.600,0,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,473.23,478.416,"Oh! Please, in fact do me a favor and ignore this because this is not the issue before this Court."
1962.600,1,40561,robert_f_sweeney,,1270.592,1271.753,Mr. Chief Justice –-
1962.600,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1271.753,1272.869,Mr. Sweeney?
1962.600,1,40561,robert_f_sweeney,,1272.869,1277.372,-- members of the Court.
1962.600,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1398.3,1400.972,Was this voluntarily made here?
1962.600,1,40561,robert_f_sweeney,,1400.972,1401.991,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.600,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1401.991,1405.951,"You mean that he was asked to plead, how do you plead?"
1962.600,1,40561,robert_f_sweeney,,1405.951,1411.937,Voluntary in the sense that -- that there was no coercion other than the question itself.
1962.600,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1421.86,1430.724,Well the very fact that he didn't [Inaudible]
1962.600,1,40561,robert_f_sweeney,,1430.724,1431.957,Yes Your Honor but the --
1962.600,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1431.957,1437.214,It is therefore [Inaudible]
1962.600,1,40561,robert_f_sweeney,,1437.214,1466.402,"Well Your Honor in the question of counsel at preliminary hearing, it is our position as the court -- the Maryland Court held in this case and in other cases as the Federal Court, the lower Federal Courts have held that a plea entered at a preliminary hearing, be it either before the magistrate in Baltimore city or before a commissioner in the federal system is in the nature of an extra judicial confession and is therefore admissible at trial."
1962.600,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1469.502,1477.843,"Well, I know but that is the very fact [Inaudible]"
1962.600,1,40561,robert_f_sweeney,,1477.843,1482.254,"Well they certainly might be helpful to him, but so would --"
1962.600,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1482.254,1489.09,[Inaudible]
1962.600,1,40561,robert_f_sweeney,,1489.09,1495.313,"In the same sense that if he had counsel with him in an interrogation-room, few confessions if any whatever."
1962.600,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1495.313,1497.343,[Inaudible]
1962.600,1,40561,robert_f_sweeney,,1497.343,1499.271,[Attempt to Laughter]
1962.600,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1499.271,1502.519,Could counsel cross examine these witnesses?
1962.600,1,40561,robert_f_sweeney,,1502.519,1504.463,Yes Your Honor counsel could have.
1962.600,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1504.463,1517.587,"Well let's assume that he did cross examine them and that he fairly discredited them in the eyes of the magistrate, would the magistrate would have held this man over or discharged him?"
1962.600,1,40561,robert_f_sweeney,,1517.587,1525.764,"If the cross examination brought out the fact that there was no basis for holding this man, the man would have been released."
1962.600,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1525.764,1533.37,Well now isn't the man somewhat in need of counsel at a time like that?
1962.600,1,40561,robert_f_sweeney,,1533.37,1551.183,"You Honor assuming that the purpose of this hearing is only to test the legality of the arrest of the detention at that point, we say that it has no bearing whatsoever on the later trial aside from the question of the introduction of plea into the evidence."
1962.600,2,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,3521.245,3528.56,"Yes sir, but we are only -- you only limited in the cert to this one question, the right the counsel and my argument is if he had counsel he never would have --"
1962.600,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3528.56,3529.246,But what if he had?
1962.600,2,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,3534.015,3546.976,"Well it be that had counsel pleaded guilty at the preliminary hearing, I might be here I don't know but I might be here on the question of competency of counsel because there is no reason to enter a plea at a preliminary hearing, none whatsoever."
1962.600,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3546.976,3555.339,Right from the beginning his counsel is going to plead in not guilty by reason of insanity and so then -- so you -- this defense starts right at the preliminary hearing.
1962.600,2,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,3555.339,3555.505,Yes sir --
1962.600,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3555.505,3560.805,[Inaudible] This is the beginning of his evidence that the man is insane.
1962.600,2,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,3560.805,3576.902,"If he had – if he had the competent counsel at a preliminary hearing, the counsel will just stand up there, the judge will say do you plead guilty or not guilty, the counsel will say well we don't have to enter any plea, but for the purposes of this hearing we will enter -- he cannot refuse or enter a plea of not guilty."
1962.600,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3645.772,3647.81,Did we limit the grant of certiorari?
1962.600,2,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,3647.81,3647.992,Sir?
1962.600,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3647.992,3648.998,Did we limit --
1962.600,2,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,3648.998,3650.743,"Yes, you limited I think to --"
1962.600,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3650.743,3652.087,The right to counsel at the preliminary hearing.
1962.600,2,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,3652.087,3652.85,yes sir.
1962.600,3,40561,robert_f_sweeney,,3903.635,3904.742,Thank you very much.
1962.600,4,24808,fred_e_weisgal,,3904.742,3958.856,Thank Your Honor.
