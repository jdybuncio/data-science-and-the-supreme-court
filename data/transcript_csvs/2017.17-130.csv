2017.17-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.0,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-130, Lucia versus the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Perry."
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,8.0,18.2,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: SEC ALJs have been invested with the sovereign power to preside over formal adjudications."
2017.17-130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,29.92,39.08,Inferior officers -- you're not contesting that -- that they are more than inferior officers?
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,39.08,65.24,"Justice Ginsburg, we are contesting they are inferior officers, not principal officers, correct, in part because their work is supervised by principal officers, the commissioners of the SEC, and that relationship of director and then supervision is what marks them as inferior but not as employees. And that's important to note that, in exercising those duties under the direction of the SEC, they have independence in their decisional functions, their hearing functions, and their evidentiary functions."
2017.17-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,91.32,102.32,"Well, of course, the decisions of the ALJs in every case aren't operative until the Commission issues an order of finality, right?"
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,102.32,105.88,"Well, Your Honor, the Commission by regulation does issue a finality order."
2017.17-130,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,166.32,170.16,"I'm sorry, that -- that figure is somewhat misleading."
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,209.92,215.72,"Two answers, Justice Sotomayor: First, those defaults it -- itself recognize an exercise of sovereign power."
2017.17-130,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,225.04,231.84,"Now, most of the time, I don't know of many judges -- well, judges sign order to show causes."
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,254.24,290.32,"Well, first, Your Honor, the -- the hearing -- the note -- the hearing notice, which is different than an order to show cause, is issued in the name of the ALJ and goes out under the name of the ALJ, if that matters, as does the subpoena, as does all the document requirements, as does everything related to the hearing. After the order instituting proceedings is issued and it is delegated to an ALJ, the ALJ issues every order in the case. It -- it -- it oversees -- he oversees or she oversees the gathering of the evidence, the admission or exclusion of the evidence, the hearing -- the taking of the depositions, the hearing of the testimony, the convening of the hearing, compulsory settlement, if the settlement conference -- if the ALJ chooses, and the preparation of a decision."
2017.17-130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,290.56,304.24,"If -- if the provision had been that the bottom line is the ALJ recommends -- everything else is the same, they conduct the hearing, decide what evidence will be admitted, all that."
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,312.68,313.68,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.68,317.4,"If -- if that were -- if that were so, then -- then they would be employees?"
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,317.4,317.88,"No, Your Honor."
2017.17-130,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,369.28,382.4,"If -- if we follow your theory of the case and -- and you prevail, what effect, if any, will that have on ALJs in other agencies, Social Security ALJs?"
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,382.4,391.48,"Justice Kennedy, our submission is limited to ALJs who decide adversarial proceedings subject to Sections 556 and 557 of the APA."
2017.17-130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,464.4,464.6,Who --
2017.17-130,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,464.6,464.88,Other --
2017.17-130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,464.88,470.0,Who is left out? You said 150 ALJs.
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,473.8,478.88,"Our understanding, Your Honor, is Social Security ALJs do not conduct adversarial hearings."
2017.17-130,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,493.32,496.16,"I'm sorry, could you define adversarial for me?"
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,496.16,496.68,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-130,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,496.68,499.2,And let's go through the various agencies.
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,509.0,509.8,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-130,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,509.8,528.52,"So why isn't Social Security and the Veterans Administration, the Veterans' Board, and some of the others are all investigations by the government or benefits that the government's going to give -- but they are investigating. Social Security can issue subpoenas for -- for documents."
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,540.52,563.76,"Justice Sotomayor, the way we are using the term is adversarial -- by adversarial, I mean those cases -- enforcement cases are a good example -- where a private citizen is brought against his or her will before a government body to have his or her fate decided. The Social Security Administration -- the vast majority of ALJ determinations are when a citizen voluntarily goes to the agency and seeks benefits from the government. They are applicants and --"
2017.17-130,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,563.76,580.6,"So, Mr. Perry, if I asked you why is it important for purposes of deciding who's an officer that the person conduct an adversarial hearing, is that what you would say, that the stakes are very high, that a person has liberty on the line?"
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,580.6,584.76,"I think the stakes, Justice Kagan, are important, but I would go to the statute actually as the definition."
2017.17-130,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,610.2,618.28,"See, there's something that strikes me as -- as a little bit odd about this argument because, if you -- if you -- we just take a step back a little bit."
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,658.24,673.96,"Justice Kagan, there's a difference between decisional independence, which is guaranteed by 554(b) of the APA and the Due Process Clause, and structural independence, which the Appointments Clause is designed to ensure responsibility, accountability, transparency, and ultimately liberty, freedom."
2017.17-130,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,674.96,686.56,"So then you're saying assume, as Justice Kagan's question indicates, that it's important to the perception of justice that the adjudicator be independent."
2017.17-130,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,689.2,715.64,"Your Honor, as to structural independence, it's important for regulated entities, the Commission, the judges, and the courts that review their decisions to know that they are not structurally independent, that they are structurally dependent even if they have statutory decisional independence. So that we believe tying them together as the Appointments Clause requires shows the lines of authority so that reviewing courts and all those stakeholders in the process can participate. If I may reserve the remainder of my time, Your Honor."
2017.17-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,715.64,727.08,"Thank you, counsel. General Wall."
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,727.08,754.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I could just start with the government's test, the one that we hope the Court will adopt. Under Buckley and Freytag, a constitutional officer occupies a continuing position that's been vested by law with significant discretion to do one of two things: Either to bind to the government or third-parties on important matters or to undertake other important sovereign functions. Here, the Commission's ALJs have been vested by statute with both powers."
2017.17-130,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,765.84,766.28,How many --
2017.17-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,766.28,771.72,There are a lot of -- a lot of civil servants who have -- fit within that definition.
2017.17-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,852.56,855.36,And I'm looking to you for advice.
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,855.36,858.12,"I -- so two -- I -- two things, Justice Breyer."
2017.17-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,862.4,866.12,"I know that, but I was taking the SG's test and I was going back to --"
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,866.12,866.44,Yes.
2017.17-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,866.44,868.0,-- the -- the Freytag and -- and --
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,868.0,868.32,Right.
2017.17-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,868.32,879.04,"-- and it was not in front of us, and I was looking for the horribles and listed about, you know, 4,000 horribles as a result of a decision that I disagreed with. (Laughter.)"
2017.17-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,879.04,884.56,So I -- I don't feel that those words are absolutely written in stone.
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,895.8,898.8,"Well, I -- here's why I don't think it's a horrible."
2017.17-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,908.8,935.72,"Yes, the way to read the statute that you think is that you can dismiss the ALJ for failing to follow policy that may not be written into a rule that they're legally applied, required, or -- and once -- once there is a basis in the record, facts, the MS -- the -- the Systems Protection Board can't even look at it. Well, they're looking -- now that to me is not the kind of protection that the people who wrote the APA intended."
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,935.72,936.12,Justice Breyer --
2017.17-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,936.12,941.12,That's why I say I need to know about that before I can decide this.
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,941.12,953.72,"With all respect, we -- I think the Court has got to distinguish what the -- what the -- the drafters of the APA were worried about, and Mr. Perry got at this a little bit, was decisional independence in Section 554 of the APA."
2017.17-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,966.28,966.52,All right.
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,967.28,968.04,-- limit it beyond the department head.
2017.17-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,968.04,992.6,"Maybe that's -- but what it says is you can remove an ALJ for failure to follow agency policies -- and I take it that that isn't something embodied in a rule, it's no problem if it's embodied in a rule, but it could be beyond the rule -- and to confine the Board's role to -- the Board, that's the MSPB -- to determining whether a factful basis exists for the agency's preferred grounds."
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1009.68,1033.36,"Well, Justice Breyer, I think the way to decide this case, if you wanted to do it without getting to removal, and we've urged the Court not to do that because, unlike the appointments side, what we're dealing with is largely executive practice, the restrictions on removal are statutory, we're limited in our ability to get our own house in order there. But if you wanted to sever the two, I think what you'd say is Freytag sets up a two-part test for when you're an officer of the United States."
2017.17-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1038.64,1039.32,We can do that.
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1039.32,1039.88,And then --
2017.17-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1039.88,1042.44,"But -- but, again, last point."
2017.17-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1047.84,1074.96,"-- that the Constitution does not inhibit the creation of a merit-based civil service and an adjudicatorily merit -- merit-based system of hearing examiners, ALJs. If I start with that premise and then don't know quite what that sentence on page 17 means and don't know how PCAOB applies, you see?"
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1074.96,1076.32,"I do, Justice Breyer."
2017.17-130,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1097.96,1098.56,"Mr. Wall, may I --"
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1098.56,1101.56,That should be the department head under the Appointments Clause. And then --
2017.17-130,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1101.56,1102.0,May I break --
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1102.0,1102.84,-- the removal should follow on that.
2017.17-130,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1102.84,1111.36,"May I break down your answer, because there -- there's -- or -- or following up on what Justice Breyer said, significant authority."
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1167.6,1168.4,No.
2017.17-130,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1172.92,1173.2,Do you --
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1173.2,1176.36,"-- it is, on the one hand, under-inclusive and it is, on the other, manipulable."
2017.17-130,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1178.36,1180.76,Everything is manipulable.
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1222.6,1222.72,Right.
2017.17-130,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1234.36,1235.36,But every office is continuous.
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1235.36,1235.92,Exactly.
2017.17-130,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1236.52,1240.4,Almost anybody who works for the government works for the government under some statute.
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1240.4,1240.84,That's right.
2017.17-130,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1266.76,1267.96,But when -- when you say --
2017.17-130,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1267.96,1286.64,Can I ask you about thorough examination of this subject by the Office of Legal Counsel? What is the government's current position about the line that's drawn between employees and officers in that OLC study?
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1286.64,1294.6,"Oh, we understand our current line here to be a refinement of what OLC said in its 2007 OLC opinion."
2017.17-130,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1323.52,1330.92,Does power to bind mean power to bind that can't be reversed by somebody who's your boss?
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1330.92,1331.2,No.
2017.17-130,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1348.36,1349.12,"I mean, I don't -- I --"
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1349.12,1350.12,"There's one instance in which it didn't, but --"
2017.17-130,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1350.12,1352.72,-- don't understand this -- how this test applies.
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1354.68,1355.04,I --
2017.17-130,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1355.04,1356.0,-- or an employee?
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1356.0,1359.28,The Court said in Steele that deputy marshals are not.
2017.17-130,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1376.96,1381.48,But they can all make decisions that -- that bind the United States.
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1381.48,1381.96,I --
2017.17-130,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1381.96,1382.84,Can they -- right?
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1382.84,1385.68,"But that's why you have to focus on the vesting, I think, Justice Alito --"
2017.17-130,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1385.68,1386.48,"Well, vesting how?"
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1386.48,1387.64,-- and that's about the office.
2017.17-130,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1387.64,1394.04,"Vesting by statute, by regulation, by -- by some internal rules, by practice?"
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1394.04,1395.68,So that's a very hard question.
2017.17-130,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1420.24,1421.0,"Mr. Wall, let --"
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1421.0,1422.6,"-- but, again, here it's all statutory."
2017.17-130,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1422.6,1428.04,"Well, our deputy clerks can grant certain extensions of time. Are they officers?"
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1428.04,1442.36,"I think it's unlikely that they are, because I think they are really just exercising power on behalf of the Clerk, who is vested with that power by the -- by the Court. And, certainly, at least in the executive branch, that is typically the way it works."
2017.17-130,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1476.32,1476.76,Mr. Wall --
2017.17-130,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1476.76,1488.84,Could you address the question that Justice Kagan and I asked Mr. Perry? Assume that the perception and fact of fairness and -- and impartiality are enhanced by independence.
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1496.72,1498.84,We -- I do think it's a proper consideration.
2017.17-130,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1522.28,1523.0,But all of these things -- MR. WALL.
2017.17-130,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1524.16,1526.72,"Mr. Wall, all of these things go to the same thing."
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1582.6,1603.08,"I -- Justice Kagan, what I want to do is I want to take the foundational compromise that is the APA and square it with the foundational compromise that is the Appointments Clause, which says, look, if you exercise important functions on behalf of the United States, you have to be appointed by the department head, because it's not sufficient for the Commission to say: Well, look, the ALJ's decision went out the door."
2017.17-130,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1614.8,1628.12,"So, I'm sorry, doesn't the SEC have full power to overturn anything the ALJ does? This is not where, by statute or regulation, the ALJ's findings are given conclusive effect."
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1636.4,1655.8,"It is certainly the -- the fact, Justice Sotomayor, that the Commission can review everything the ALJ does and agree with it or disagree with it. But when you appear before the ALJ -- and -- and the ALJ shapes the record of that proceeding -- and that's not a recommendatory process, you can waive arguments, you are bound, and that is the record that goes up to the Commission."
2017.17-130,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1667.8,1670.52,I think Justice Gorsuch has been trying to get a question in.
2017.17-130,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1670.52,1677.6,"Thank you, Chief. Mr. Wall, suppose for the moment we accept your position."
2017.17-130,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1697.28,1700.36,Petitioners think it repeats the problem.
2017.17-130,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1737.08,1737.48,Thank you.
2017.17-130,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1737.48,1744.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Metlitsky."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,1744.08,1770.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Other than a narrow historically-grounded exception concerning diplomatic offices, an officer of the United States is someone with power to bind the government or private parties in the name of his own office. In contrast, someone whose acts have no binding effect without the sanction of an officer is not himself an officer of the United States."
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1770.32,1774.88,"If I were trying to figure out who an officer is, I think I might have started with Freytag."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,1791.68,1793.76,"Well, the contempt power, I think, is crucial."
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1859.56,1859.88,It's hard --
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,1859.88,1860.28,-- even though they have the same --
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1860.28,1864.44,"It's hard to think, Mr. Metlitsky, that Freytag really thought that that was all important."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,1889.72,1898.32,"So, as we acknowledged in our brief, you could read Freytag broadly, obviously, much more broadly than the rule we're proposing, but you don't have to read it that way."
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1916.08,1917.08,I guess what strikes me --
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,1917.08,1917.76,-- and that was --
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1917.76,1941.44,"-- Mr. Metlitsky, is that if you had a list and you said top 10 attributes of the judges that were involved in Freytag and the judges that are involved here, you'd pretty much say that nine of them are the same and maybe one is different. And -- but it's just so hard to get around this -- the commonalities of these judges and the judges in Freytag."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,1941.44,1947.36,It's true that ALJs and the judges in Freytag share a lot of the same functions.
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1985.84,1986.56,Does that make --
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,1986.56,1987.04,And the --
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1987.04,1991.04,Does that make Chief Justice Warren an executive officer in that situation?
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,1991.04,1991.48,No.
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2015.68,2016.28,But why isn't it --
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2016.28,2017.28,-- and what's important for officer --
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2017.28,2032.28,"-- different for that exact reason, that these are essentially investigatory bodies who are supposed to report the findings of an investigation to somebody else who's actually supposed to do something with them. But the adjudicators here are not investigators."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2036.04,2036.84,"Well, so --"
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2036.84,2043.4,-- seems to separate the Warren Commission type bodies from both the judges here and the judges in Freytag.
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2043.4,2062.68,"I -- I completely agree with that, but that would exclude, I think, the second -- the second part of the government's test, which is somebody can be an officer even if they don't have the power to bind. So the question in this case, I think, really is whether ALJs have the power to bind and whether that power is vested in their office."
2017.17-130,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.36,2064.8,The problem I have --
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2064.8,2065.84,-- of the -- in your own name.
2017.17-130,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2065.84,2080.96,"The problem I have with this, the whole thing, is I have no idea of what the nature of jobs are throughout the civil service, I mean, in terms of importance. There are probably people in the civil service who can order inspections of nuclear power plants."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2130.68,2131.08,I -- I --
2017.17-130,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.08,2134.68,"That's my concern, and I do not know what to do next."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2134.68,2142.6,"I -- I completely agree with you, Justice Breyer, that that is a concern, which is why our test doesn't turn on importance. I think theirs does."
2017.17-130,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2156.6,2176.28,"But I -- I think -- it seems to me your test, maybe I don't understand it, but it -- it seems to me potentially very broad and also quite vague. Now, the power to bind, an enormous number of executive branch officials have the power to bind the government in one way or another."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2178.52,2186.96,"I don't disagree with the de facto power to bind, but I agree with Mr. Wall that the relevant question is whether the -- where the power has been vested, which is the import of our second precondition."
2017.17-130,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2186.96,2187.32,Okay.
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2213.16,2237.52,"Well, it's whether the person -- so take your example, an AUSA at a trial makes a binding concession or an Assistant to the Solicitor General makes a binding concession in this Court. The reason that person doesn't have to be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate is because he is exercising the authority of the Office of the Solicitor General or of the U.S. Attorney. He's acting in the name of that office."
2017.17-130,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2237.52,2237.72,Okay.
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2242.76,2244.08,"An Assistant Attorney General, yes."
2017.17-130,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2244.08,2259.44,"Yeah, and so, if the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division or the Antitrust Division does something, is -- is that person exercising the authority of the Civil Division or the Antitrust Division or the authority of the Department of Justice?"
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2259.44,2265.92,"It's the -- well, if he's exercising authority that has been delegating -- delegated to him, he's exercising the power of his own office."
2017.17-130,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2282.04,2292.44,"But is that what it turns on, whether -- who's listed at the top of the brief? Do -- do we look at a statute to find out whether it's vested in the office? Do we look at a regulation? Do we look at practice?"
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2292.44,2316.24,"So it -- it doesn't turn on who's at the top of the brief, but who's at the top of the brief derives from the existing legal authority. In the Justice Department, I think it's entirely -- almost all of the authority is delegated from the Attorney General. So one statute vests all of the powers in the Justice Department to the Attorney General, another statute allows the Attorney General to delegate those powers, and so he'll delegate --"
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2316.24,2330.04,"Does it strike you as a little bit odd that, essentially, that would mean that the executive branch gets to decide who's an officer and who's not an officer? Right? Take the Attorney General, most of the statutes just vest this in the Attorney General."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2346.24,2346.56,No.
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2397.68,2404.28,"I feel -- I feel as though I'm missing something, because what you just said to me seems to make everything dependent on whether Congress has created an office."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2408.76,2408.88,No.
2017.17-130,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2421.4,2430.44,But if it's -- if it's a question of -- so the -- an Assistant Attorney General is an officer because that -- certain powers are delegated by the Attorney General?
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2430.44,2430.96,Right.
2017.17-130,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2430.96,2433.0,"And the U.S. Attorney, the same thing, right?"
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2433.0,2435.72,"I think the U.S. Attorney might have statutory authorities too, but --"
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2435.72,2436.92,But -- but that's what I was suggesting.
2017.17-130,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2436.92,2437.12,Well --
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2437.12,2442.36,But then everything depends on whether the Attorney General in fact makes a delegation or does not make delegation.
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2442.36,2444.4,"Well, that's true. That's how Congress set up the scheme."
2017.17-130,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2449.2,2462.92,"Well, suppose then the -- the U.S. attorney or -- or the head of one of the litigating divisions delegates certain authorities to somebody within that office. Does that make that person a -- a -- an officer?"
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2462.92,2464.0,"No, because the --"
2017.17-130,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2464.0,2464.48,Why?
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2464.48,2467.2,Because the authority rests with the -- the U.S. Attorney.
2017.17-130,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2504.76,2505.4,"I'm sorry, I --"
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2505.4,2518.48,"Counsel, you said on -- your -- your friend, Mr. Perry, said in his reply brief, ""This Court has never held that an adjudicatory official is not an officer."" Do you agree with that?"
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2518.48,2525.04,"Yes, but an adjudicatory official is somebody that gets to decide a case, to -- to bind the parties at the end of the day."
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2537.8,2538.24,So -- so --
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2538.24,2539.16,That's what Justice Alito's --
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2539.16,2539.8,"I'm sorry, go ahead."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2539.8,2550.4,"Justice Alito's concurrence -- your concurrence in the -- in the Amtrak case identified a -- an Appointments Clause problem with binding arbitration, binding."
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2550.4,2561.32,"So if -- if the statute said the ALJ decision -- there you can seek review within 90 days; if after 90 days review hasn't been granted, that decision is final."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2570.84,2572.84,So I think that's a harder case than this case.
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2579.6,2582.32,"But your friend says that's really just a notice, that we're not going to review it."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2582.32,2595.52,"Well, it's -- they say that, but what -- what the finality orders all actually say is that the orders contained in the initial decision are hereby declared effective. It's -- it's affirmative sanction granted to the decision."
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2660.64,2670.32,One of the principles that caused the drafters to give the authority to appoint officers to the president was the important one of accountability.
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2670.32,2670.96,Exactly.
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2670.96,2687.6,"And in this case, if -- if the individual were an officer, he would have to be appointed by the Commission, and people would know who was responsible for whatever conduct or misconduct or decisions he would -- he would take. But in this case, you don't have that accountability."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2705.2,2705.4,Right.
2017.17-130,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2791.56,2819.84,"So what's the line that makes somebody an agent or not? Can we speak about ALJs in this context being agents of the SEC commissioners when the SEC commissioners didn't pick them, don't supervise them, essentially don't have anything to do with their work other than reviewing it? So what defines someone acting as an agent of an office?"
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2819.84,2859.92,"So I don't think common law agency is exactly the right frame. I think I agree, again, with Mr. Wall, the -- the initial question is where the authority, the legal authority, to act is -- is vested. I think that's -- the first example of that is the deputy marshals that were mentioned before, right? So -- so the Congress establishes in Section 27 of the first Judiciary Act the office of a marshal, who's an inferior officer, and allows the marshal to appoint deputies, who are non-officers because they're not appointed by somebody who's allowed to make an appointment under the Appointments Clause. They have all the same duties as the marshal, but they're understood to be acting in the name of the marshal's office."
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2898.04,2903.24,So are you saying that anybody whose decisions are subject to review can never be an officer?
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2903.24,2905.2,"No, no, not at all. But --"
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2905.2,2914.6,"Well, I thought you were suggesting that the reason that the ALJs are not officers is that the Commission has the discretionary power to review their decisions?"
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2914.6,2914.84,No.
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2915.08,2917.16,"And you -- and you seem to be putting a lot of -- I'm sorry, go ahead."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2917.16,2917.52,No.
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2937.16,2937.6,And -- and --
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2937.6,2938.32,-- not the decisions of the --
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2938.32,2941.16,-- they don't have authority to make binding decisions because?
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2941.16,2966.76,"Because the -- the question -- so the statute applicable here, 78d-1, is an authorization of delegation. Right? The Commission is allowed to delegate authority to the ALJ. And so the question is, what authority did the Commission delegate to the ALJ? So first you can look at 17 CFR 201.111(i), which is on 16A of our green brief."
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2994.76,2997.28,So everything in the end depends on that?
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,2997.28,2997.64,No.
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3004.2,3004.64,Right.
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,3005.8,3006.04,Yes.
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3006.04,3011.48,"-- as to whether they have binding authority, it all comes down to this finality order?"
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,3011.48,3012.36,Yes.
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3016.04,3016.32,Even --
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3016.32,3020.08,"And it seems to me, I mean, we've heard about the independence of the adjudicator."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,3030.48,3030.64,"Well, no."
2017.17-130,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3056.0,3069.16,If you -- did you come across in your research anywhere anything like this that -- because it does say an officer of the United States whose appointment shall be established by law.
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,3120.2,3120.6,"Well, so I --"
2017.17-130,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3120.6,3122.56,Did anything -- have you come across anything like that?
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,3122.56,3127.2,There -- there are lots of statutes dealing with how people are appointed in various agencies.
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3186.68,3186.92,You said --
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3186.92,3205.96,"Mr. Metlitsky, as -- as I listen to you, and especially as I compare your test to some of the others on offer, you know, there seems to be a good deal to be said for yours, except I don't know where it's coming from, honestly. So you spent a lot of time in your brief talking like this is a historical test, this is a traditional test."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,3205.96,3206.36,Right.
2017.17-130,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3206.36,3213.8,"And I guess it seems to me like the test actually, it's sort of the opposite, the test you would make up if you were doing everything on a blank slate."
2017.17-130,2,62976,anton_metlitsky,,3218.64,3335.76,"So -- so the source for the first part of the test that you need to have binding authority, I really -- I think is -- has been accepted at least since 1822 when the main supreme judicial court explained that an officer of the United States is somebody who has been delegated a portion of the sovereign authority of the United States, meaning the authority to bind, and that somebody whose acts don't take effect without the sanction of an officer is not an officer. That's what that opinion held and it's been understood to be authoritative since then. That -- that's essentially the Office of Legal Counsel test from 2007. The second part of the test is really I think exactly what Mr. -- Mr. Wall said. There's always going to be a question of where the legal authority to act is, because otherwise every person with discretion like every AUSA is going to be considered an officer, even though the U.S. Attorney is going to be held 100 percent accountable for every decision in his or her office. I think the -- the first place where you can see that -- that relationship of, you know, basically agent to officer is Section 27 and 28 of the First Judiciary Act with the marshal and the deputy marshal. One of the things that under Section 28 the deputy marshal was authorized to do was, when the marshal died, to execute writs in the name of the deceased marshal until a new marshal was chosen. So the -- sort of the second part of our test, which asks whether somebody's authorized to act in the name of their own office or only in the name of somebody else's office, just reflects that principle, which I think is, as we've talked about, ubiquitous in actual government practice. It's why Assistants to the Solicitor General don't need to be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate since I don't think there's a statute that actually authorizes the Attorney General to appoint them himself. If the Court has no further questions."
2017.17-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3335.76,3338.28,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Perry."

Three brief points, if I may: First, every official who satisfied my friend Mr. Metlitsky's test would be a principal officer of the United States. If you can bind the government or private parties in your own name with no supervision, that's a principal officer."
