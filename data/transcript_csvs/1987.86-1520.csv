1987.86-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.637,"We will hear argument first today in Number 86-1520, Ann McLaughlin, Secretary of Labor, versus the Richland Shoe Company."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,12.011,13.245,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1987.86-1520,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,203.762,211.947,"Mr. Ayer, do you think that the government's proof could have met that reckless disregard standard in this case?"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,211.947,231.564,"I think that there... the answer to that question turns upon the precise application given, the precise interpretation given to the reckless disregard test, and our concern with the reckless disregard test is essentially... it is not with the part that talks about disregard."
1987.86-1520,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,257.694,263.285,"Well, in your position is the evidence sufficient to meet that standard?"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,263.285,269.314,"I think our... the answer to that, I think, is yes, in two aspects."
1987.86-1520,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,296.225,303.785,"Now, under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, liquidated damages can be sought for a violation, can't they?"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,303.785,304.723,"--Yes, they can."
1987.86-1520,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,306.895,308.877,And could they have been sought here?
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,308.877,313.313,They could have been sought had the action been brought under 216 rather than 217.
1987.86-1520,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,313.313,318.859,And what standard should be applied for a violation if liquidated damages are sought under this Act?
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,318.859,332.104,"Well, we think that in the context of the Fair Labor Standards Act, there is strong authority that liquidated damages are themselves not punitive, as this Court found in Thurston in the Age Discrimination Act, but rather are compensatory."
1987.86-1520,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.702,411.823,"Well, I wonder if there aren't some advantages to having a more uniform test of what is meant by wilfull, whether it appears in this statute or another one."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,411.823,440.108,"Well, I think there are indeed some advantages, but I think the approach that needs to be taken is not one that simply says there are some advantages, therefore the language must mean the same thing, but is rather an approach much like the one this Court took in Thurston of looking at the particular statute, looking at the particular context in which the words appear, and deciding whether or not... what the precise meaning should be."
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,519.749,534.32,"Well, with that word ""reliable advice"" in there, how can he ever win if it turns out the Court decides the advice was not reliable, was just wrong?"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,534.32,539.834,"--Well, reliable in the sense that when he got it it was reasonable to rely on it."
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,541.395,544.317,Even though it is wrong.
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,544.317,558.203,"Well, he can't... no, if he goes to a lawyer and the lawyer gives an opinion which on its face appears to be a reasonably reliable statement of what the law is and gives him basis on which he can fairly conclude that he is--"
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,558.203,561.327,And yet you say you can't always rely on a lawyer's advice.
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,561.327,562.858,--I think you can't always rely on it.
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.56,566.764,"I mean, the client is supposed to second guess the lawyer?"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,566.764,578.182,"--Well, if the lawyer, for example, assumes hypothetical facts that are incorrect, and he sends you a letter that says, assuming Situation X, then the law, I believe, is as follows."
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.838,582.586,"Well, he hasn't got any advice at all about his case, then."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,582.586,583.977,"--Well, that's right."
1987.86-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,587.007,588.817,He has got a poor opinion.
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,596.861,605.296,"Okay, well, I think there is a question as to how far... as to how reliable it has to be, but I think considering this you have got to bear in mind what is at stake."
1987.86-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.419,617.008,"No, but you are saving that the word ""wilfull"" in the statute means unreasonable, right?"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,617.008,619.024,I am saying... No.
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.024,619.852,Sort of a negligence standard.
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,620.414,621.258,"No, we are not."
1987.86-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,631.848,637.471,"You can always phrase the wilfull, wilfully going forward and doing a negligent act."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,647.357,655.839,"Well, the ""wilfull"" here I think focuses on proceeding aware of the risk, and the reason--"
1987.86-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.839,660.024,"That is just an ordinary negligence standard, being aware of the risk, isn't it?"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,662.632,671.004,"--Well, I think it is a reasonable approach to take here, because you have to look at the consequence."
1987.86-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,685.39,695.886,"Yes, but Congress obviously wanted to distinguish in some way between the duty to pay for two years and the duty to add on a third year."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,697.48,719.8,"I think it did, and I think it is useful to look at the context in which it put those words into the statute in 1966 and to compare it to the context in which the Congress acted in 1967 in the Age Act, as this Court found in the Age Act, it was a substitution for the criminal provision of the FLSA of a liquidated damages provision which was to be punitive."
1987.86-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.997,827.366,"Mr. Ayer, it is not at all unusual that Congress, although it has a particular problem in mind, adopts language that entirely solves that problem but also solves some other problems as well or extends to some situations other than that problem."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,853.248,860.339,"Well, we don't think that this is at all a strange concept of the word ""wilfull"" in the context of this Court's interpretation of the word ""wilfull""."
1987.86-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,860.339,861.932,It took you a long time to come up with it.
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,869.227,876.553,The government's position has been up until the filing of this petition that the Jiffy June so-called appreciable possibility test is the law.
1987.86-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,876.553,879.973,Has anybody ever thought of this meaning of wilfull before?
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,879.973,880.864,"Well, yes, I think so."
1987.86-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.144,882.707,"Where does it exist, and what is--"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,882.707,901.747,"--Well, I think the D.C. Circuit decision in the Laffey case in 1976 enunciated something very close to it, talking about where an employer cognizant of an appreciable possibility that he may be subject to the statutory requirements fails to take steps reasonably calculated to resolve the doubt."
1987.86-1520,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,901.747,905.637,--Isn't your position here essentially that of the D.C. Circuit?
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,905.637,906.728,It is very close.
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,911.29,918.646,"Well, of course, the Jiffy June standard is even an odder interpretation of the word ""wilfull""."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,918.646,919.818,"--Well, we agree with that."
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,932.563,934.688,And the Secretary.
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,934.688,936.53,"Well, it has two problems."
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,936.53,939.528,Suppose the Secretary was responsible for urging it on the Fifth Circuit.
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,939.528,940.919,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,987.807,988.338,"Well, he is."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,993.179,997.037,--That is true in any event.
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,997.037,997.896,"Well, all right."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,997.896,999.005,That is true in any event.
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,999.005,1000.973,He is not off the hook just because he gets advice.
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1005.784,1011.954,"That's right, but that is an incentive to... that is some incentive, depending on how much money is at stake, to get him to comply with the law, and that is good."
1987.86-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1011.954,1016.656,"And so long as he is not neligent in accepting the advice, in which case if he is negligent he is wilfull."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1016.656,1026.792,"Well, I would... we think that the concept of negligence is really a concept that is inappropriately applied here."
1987.86-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1087.456,1089.831,Isn't that essentially a question for Congress?
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1105.653,1114.432,"We are not at all advocating disregarding the word ""wilfull"", nor are we advocating disregarding much of what is in the Thurston test."
1987.86-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1126.303,1126.537,--You are not going to punish him?
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1126.537,1127.662,"--No, we are not going to punish him."
1987.86-1520,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1131.505,1133.942,Plus maybe double damages or whatever it is.
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1133.942,1147.625,"--Plus maybe double damages, but double damages in the context of this Act are not punitive, they are compensatory, and this Court's number of cases, the Overnight Transport case, other cases have said specifically that, that they are not punitive."
1987.86-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.625,1160.182,"Mr. Ayer, under your test of a significant risk of a violation when you take action, I suppose everybody who files an income tax return is at significant risk that he has made an error."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1160.182,1161.822,"I think that is right, and so to follow--"
1987.86-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1161.822,1164.961,And so is every error a wilfull failure to pay?
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1164.961,1167.835,"--Well, but there you are mixing two different statutory schemes."
1987.86-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.94,1190.0,"Yes, but if he does... if he files an incorrect return wilfully, he has a more serious consequence."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1190.0,1207.354,"--This Court has addressed that in a number of cases as to what wilfull means in the context of the tax laws, criminal sections, the ones I am thinking of, and that is a different context than the notion that the word ""wilfull"" has to mean the same thing throughout federal law is one that is contradicted in almost every single case this Court has written dealing with that word."
1987.86-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1207.354,1219.334,"Isn't it true that even under the wage and hour laws there are some rather complicated regulatory provisions where a person can take a significant risk even, you know, unless he gets a pretty skilled lawyer on the proposition?"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1225.112,1225.909,"Well, that's true."
1987.86-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1241.387,1249.291,"--This man paid a weekly wage based on 48 hours of work, didn't he, and then he paid time and a half, he averaged that out and paid time and a half on the--"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1249.291,1250.354,He was supposed to.
1987.86-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.649,1265.692,"--But if the average wages for the 48 hours had been the proper regular wage, then it was time and a half over that, wasn't it?"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1265.692,1267.739,That he should have paid.
1987.86-1520,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1273.971,1274.315,Right.
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1274.315,1285.827,"And as to a number of them we discuss there the fact that the employer was paying an hourly rate as you calculate it that was not only not time and a half, it was not even the minimum wage of $3.35."
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1325.482,1333.745,"If we agree with you on this standard that you propose, what do we do, send it all the way back to the District Court?"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1333.745,1337.431,I think you remand to the District Court.
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1364.126,1364.798,And all those cases are wrong?
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1364.798,1375.935,"Well, we think that the first nine, that the four that have applied Thurston and the five that have applied Jiffy June are poles, and we are in the middle."
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.935,1376.764,But nevertheless all wrong?
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1376.764,1377.795,They are incorrect.
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1380.854,1386.212,"Are there a lot of cases out there that will have to be done over, that are not final?"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1386.212,1397.223,"There are, I think, a fairly large number of enforcement actions at various stages along the way, and I think a change in the law would allow them to be corrected at various stages."
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.826,1460.231,How long had the Secretary been applying the Jiffy standard?
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1460.231,1465.463,"Well, it was, I think, in 1973 is when Jiffy June was decided."
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.463,1465.806,That was the case.
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1465.806,1466.666,That was the case.
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.666,1468.555,"Yes, but he must have been--"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1468.555,1470.04,I don't know the answer to that.
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.04,1474.867,"--Of course, it was a construction by the agency charged with enforcing this statute."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1477.256,1485.817,"I don't know precisely what the Secretary was urging between 1966, when this was enacted, and 1973, when Jiffy June was decided."
1987.86-1520,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.262,1523.756,"So I suppose you have to say, though, there just isn't any... if you are going to differ with the Sectetary's or reject the Secretary's original position, you are really having to say there is just no room for the Jiffy June standard under the words of this Act."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1523.756,1525.522,"Well, that's correct."
1987.86-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1543.624,1557.087,"Mr. Ayer, I understand that wilfull leaves some problems, and that the cases you cite on Page 16 of your brief, but those problems always relate to what has to be willed."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1586.295,1588.153,"Well, we certainly don't mean to suggest that."
1987.86-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.153,1590.106,What is it that must be willed--
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1590.106,1591.106,What must be willed--
1987.86-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1591.106,1592.325,"--and therefore must be wilfull, in a sense?"
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1592.325,1596.056,--What must be willed is conduct in the face of a known risk.
1987.86-1520,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.908,1620.704,I don't see how you get there.
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1631.732,1644.134,"--Well, we get it out of the word ""wilfull"", and the only thing I would like to add before I sit down and try to reserve the rest of my time is, our reading of the word ""wilfull"" is well within the mainstream of words... of readings of that word as this Court has used it."
1987.86-1520,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1666.313,1674.137,"Mr. Ayer, I take it no Court of Appeals has applied the Laffey standard since the Thurston case came down."
1987.86-1520,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1674.137,1679.511,"Well, it is hard to say, I think, precisely whether that is right or not."
1987.86-1520,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.299,1703.595,"Thank you, Mr. Ayer."
1987.86-1520,1,34384,leon_ehrlich,,1705.486,1728.851,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I believe that the petitioner has stated something that is not entirely correct when he stated that the Jiffy June case was uniform."
1987.86-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.457,1776.191,Those cases that rejected it were after Thurston?
1987.86-1520,1,34384,leon_ehrlich,,1776.191,1779.878,--After Jiffy June?
1987.86-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.735,1789.358,When were the Court of Appeals opinions that rejected the Jiffy standard?

1987.86-1520,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.821,1803.477,Okay.
1987.86-1520,1,34384,leon_ehrlich,,1803.477,1817.722,I believe that the petitioner's case rests upon the allegation that the conduct would be wilfull if done in the face of a known risk.
1987.86-1520,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1951.044,1951.747,Mr. Ehrlich--
1987.86-1520,1,34384,leon_ehrlich,,1951.747,1953.542,"Approximately $4,000."
1987.86-1520,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1953.542,1962.023,"--Mr. Ehrlich, I thought the Court of Appeals decision below has remanded it to the District Court to apply its standard."
1987.86-1520,1,34384,leon_ehrlich,,1963.476,1965.991,"That is a correct statement, Your Honor."
1987.86-1520,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1965.991,1966.944,And you think that shouldn't be done?
1987.86-1520,1,34384,leon_ehrlich,,1966.944,1968.646,I think that that should not be done.
1987.86-1520,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1968.646,1972.16,So you are not here supporting the judgment of the court below?
1987.86-1520,1,34384,leon_ehrlich,,1972.16,1980.313,I am here supporting the judgment of the court below insofar as it rejects the contention of liability.

1987.86-1520,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1983.375,1986.311,--Did you cross petition to this Court?
1987.86-1520,1,34384,leon_ehrlich,,1986.311,1997.181,"May it please the Court, considering the amount of money involved in this case, we felt that it just didn't justify additional costs, and we felt that if we came--"
1987.86-1520,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1997.181,2002.397,"Well, if you didn't cross petition I don't know how you can argue what you are arguing, if I may say so."
1987.86-1520,1,34384,leon_ehrlich,,2007.818,2022.998,--I believe that I can rightly argue it for the same reason that the petitioner is arguing a theory not advanced in either the District Court nor in the Circuit Court of Appeals.
1987.86-1520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2165.832,2182.964,"--Would you say that if a corporation paid three mechanics excess of what they were expected to pay and paid all the rest of them less, then that wouldn't be wilfull?"
1987.86-1520,1,34384,leon_ehrlich,,2182.964,2184.886,It would be wilfull--
1987.86-1520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2184.886,2189.681,"Well, what good is it to show that one or two got the just amount?"
1987.86-1520,1,34384,leon_ehrlich,,2189.681,2190.993,--Beg pardon?
1987.86-1520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2190.993,2198.412,What good does it do in this case to show that one or two were paid what they were entitled to receive?

1987.86-1520,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2211.625,2215.185,Were they all given this extra money you were just talking about?

1987.86-1520,1,34384,leon_ehrlich,,2276.256,2291.093,"Can I not argue, then, that this case still resolves a request for an advisory opinion and then as a matter of law determined that under these facts there is nothing to go back?"
1987.86-1520,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2291.093,2293.608,"Well, I can only speak for myself."
