1989.88-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.978,"We'll hear argument first this afternoon on No. 88-1476, C. T. Carden v. Arkoma Associates."
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,13.14,18.065,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,226.512,230.774,Did the Fifth Circuit opinion treat the Great Southern case at all?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,230.774,232.867,"No, sir, it did not."
1989.88-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,246.544,250.608,Did you cite the Great Southern in your case... in your brief to the Fifth Circuit?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,250.608,251.977,"Yes, we did, Your Honor."
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.08,457.915,Is it clear that that business organization under the Puerto Rican law was a... was a legal person?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,457.915,459.588,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.594,520.767,Do you mean you think it should have... that this decision would have been correct if the court had been sitting in Louisiana?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,520.767,522.99,"No, sir, I do not."
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.544,549.006,So what you're saying is the case would be different if you were dealing with a Louisiana partnership?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,549.006,550.006,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,550.006,555.432,Or if Arizona chose to denominate its partnerships' legal entities?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,555.432,556.53,Yes.
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.902,567.109,"Although even in that case, I suppose, you wouldn't look to the citizenship then of he unlimited partners."
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,569.851,570.171,Right.
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.892,571.341,--the partnership.
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,571.341,574.423,"--as an entity, as you would with a corporation."
1989.88-1476,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,574.423,584.701,Is it consistent with the Uniform Limited Partnership Act that a limited partnership can be a juridical person?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,593.176,596.679,"I should think so, Your Honor."
1989.88-1476,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,606.025,611.077,There's nothing in the Uniform Limited Partnership Act that speaks--
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,611.077,613.319,It does not do that.
1989.88-1476,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,613.319,615.372,--to that issue one way or the other?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,615.372,627.01,"I assume that the Uniform Limited Partnership Act follows the class of common law and treats partnerships as if they were collections of individuals, as if they were contracts, as in fact they are."
1989.88-1476,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,627.01,636.874,"Do many states in the United States, or any other than perhaps Louisiana, xx a limited partnership as a juridical person?"
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,636.874,638.656,"Not that I know of, Your Honor."
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,718.76,743.934,Suppose a bank has loaned some money to a partnership that was organized and operating in the same state as the bank and the bank then wants to collect a debt from the partnership and in that state a partnership is not a juridical entity.
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,746.466,749.889,"Well, first, you'd have to determine--"
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.889,755.032,It wants to... who do you sue?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,755.032,764.518,"--Well, you'd sue the partnership and the partners if you expect it to execute a judgment against the partners personally."
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.518,779.408,"Well, suppose the partnership is in... suppose the bank loaned the money to a partnership in another state and the partnership defaulted and you brought a suit in the federal court."
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,782.15,794.949,"Well, I think if you were in a state where the local law permitted naming simply the partnership, you would name just the partnership."
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.949,795.48,Yeah.
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,800.742,801.931,"Well, then you'd have to name them all."
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.602,804.933,All right.
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,809.448,814.741,"--Well, if you want to execute a judgment against them you certainly do."
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,814.741,817.502,Are they liable for the debts of the partnership?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,817.502,822.695,Not unless they assume personal liability.
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,822.695,830.803,"Well, that's... so, let's just assume it's an ordinary limited partnership; they haven't assumed any personal liability."
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,830.803,839.008,"Well, I think then the bank would be limited to recovery out of the assets of the partnership."
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,839.008,843.408,"But they can't sue the limited partners as persons, as individuals?"
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,843.408,843.759,"No, but that's--"
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,843.759,849.803,Would that... would that destroy... could you bring a diversity action then--
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,849.803,851.866,"--Well, you'd have--"
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.866,852.154,--against them?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,853.946,857.1,--It would depend on the citizenship of all of the partners.
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.442,864.262,Even though... even though the limited partners... you cannot get a judgment against the limited partners?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,864.262,876.061,"--Yes, I think so, because we're dealing with two different things, standing to sue and... and how do you determine the citizenship of this entity before the court."
1989.88-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.393,959.006,"You say, then, a plaintiff suing a limited partnership, even though the plaintiff asserts no claim against the limited partners... even though he could not recover against any of the limited partners still has to name them all as defendants and they must all be treated as separate defendants for diversity purposes?"
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,959.006,962.999,"He may not have to name them all, depending on the local law."
1989.88-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,974.997,981.97,"But why does that make sense, really, if there is no possibility of any judgment against the limited partners?"
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,981.97,994.9,"Well, that makes sense because it fits into the scheme of jurisprudence that this court has developed over the years."
1989.88-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,994.9,998.172,That may be a reflection on the scheme of jurisprudence.
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1008.821,1010.43,No.
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1038.64,1043.414,I don't understand that.
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1047.528,1061.237,"I don't think it would have made a difference because, as this Court held in Navarro, you test diversity jurisdiction based on the citizenship of all of the members of an unincorporated entity."
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.237,1063.17,--Uh-huh.
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1063.17,1073.706,"There is no basis in the law for treating a partnership as if it were a juridical person, absent a provision in the law of its creation."
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1073.706,1076.728,What does it mean to be a juridical person?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1078.43,1080.341,"Oh, a corporation is a juridical person."
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1080.341,1081.463,"--Well, I understand, but--"
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1081.463,1085.256,--recognized as an entity separate and apart from its members.
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1085.256,1088.606,"--Well, this is in a way, too, isn't it?"
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1109.71,1111.222,Well--
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1111.222,1113.172,How would judgment be rendered?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1113.172,1124.249,"--I don't think it would be... in the sense that it was sitting in Louisiana, and by the law of Louisiana a partnership can sue in its own name and the judgment would be rendered against Arkoma."
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1130.544,1137.158,"Well, let's assume suit isn't brought in Louisiana, it's brought somewhere else."
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1142.451,1145.874,"Well, you'd get... you'd get your judgment, of course, against the partnership."
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1145.874,1148.195,Against... in its name?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1148.195,1153.599,Yes.
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.129,1158.163,How do you execute that against the general partners?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1158.163,1160.153,--I'm sorry?
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1160.153,1163.095,How do you execute that judgment against the general partners?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1175.884,1177.033,I would think so.
1989.88-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1177.033,1181.017,--But only after a marshalling of assets?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1181.017,1182.319,Yes.
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.75,1226.347,"Well, I suppose if you get a judgment against the partnership, you'd first exhaust the partnership assets I take it."
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1226.347,1229.709,"Yes, sir, I think you do."
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.709,1241.996,"And then you can... if that isn't sufficient, you can get a judgment against the... levy against the general partner?"
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1241.996,1243.148,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.338,1260.54,So they're... they're more than a little parties in interest?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1260.54,1263.61,--Certainly.
1989.88-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.712,1267.523,And they have a property interest in those partnership assets?
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1267.523,1268.435,"Oh, yes, sir."
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1287.565,1289.618,If the partnership--
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1289.618,1290.318,--in the partnership.
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.318,1297.974,"--suddenly dissolved and they didn't owe any debts or anything, the limited partners would get 99 percent of the assets?"
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1297.974,1299.044,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1299.044,1300.526,"Of course, you could say the same about a corporation."
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1320.688,1321.569,"Yes, Justice--"
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1321.569,1322.52,It doesn't seem to me that's very persuasive.
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1332.877,1334.469,--That's quite true.
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.007,1372.414,"I understand that when you're talking about a normal partnership because, you see... I guess maybe I don't know what we mean by a juridical person."
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1399.662,1405.456,"Well, it would have to... juridical persons are creatures of legislation."
1989.88-1476,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1449.604,1467.278,"But maybe the only... you're right that those choices have consequences, but maybe the only consequence that is relevant for purposes of the decision we have before us today... that is, whether diversity exists or not... perhaps the only consequence relevant is whether you can be sued in your own name or not."
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1467.278,1470.04,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.683,1599.024,"Judge Friendly certainly didn't agree with you, did he?"
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1599.024,1599.715,"No, sir, he didn't."
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1599.715,1603.738,And he... he didn't pass over Great Southern.
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1603.738,1605.979,No.
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1609.041,1610.553,He thought that--
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1610.553,1611.681,But until--
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1611.681,1613.892,--He thought that because under New York law the partnership--
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1613.892,1615.355,"--Yes, sir."
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1615.355,1622.919,--the general partners couldn't be sued... couldn't sue or be sued unless... except under some--
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1622.919,1624.16,Section 26.
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1627.363,1631.665,"--Do you think that would be enough, if Section 26 did?"
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1631.665,1633.217,"No, sir, Your Honor."
1989.88-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.556,1635.377,I wouldn't think so.
1989.88-1476,0,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1635.377,1653.319,--I think that the controlling decision is Navarro where this Court made the distinction between the citizenship of a labor union and the question of whether or not being able to sue in a name changed that.
1989.88-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1673.503,1676.785,"Thank you, Mr. Ingolia."
1989.88-1476,1,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,1679.386,1687.37,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1738.775,1740.756,"Yes, but may I just ask you."
1989.88-1476,1,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,1743.948,1744.859,--Well--
1989.88-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1744.859,1749.712,The law has apparently been settled for 89 years until this Mesa case came along.
1989.88-1476,1,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,1749.712,1753.655,"--Well, it was settled for the limited partnership association that the court had before it."
1989.88-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.655,1766.624,"Well, does the opinion in the Great Southern case say anything about the particular characteristics of the limited partnership or does it say, as I read it, corporations are an exception from the general rule that everything else you look at the individual citizenship?"
1989.88-1476,1,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,1766.624,1770.124,"As I recall the case, it didn't say that--"
1989.88-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1770.124,1770.925,It doesn't even mention--
1989.88-1476,1,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,1770.925,1771.406,--we're only talking about--
1989.88-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1771.406,1773.857,--It doesn't even mention the single class of citizenship.
1989.88-1476,1,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,1773.857,1776.529,"--Well, it doesn't, but then that was the only thing before it at the time."
1989.88-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1780.392,1787.168,"Well, it talked about a number of other limited partnership cases that it cited and seemed to think they were all... you know, limited partnerships are limited partnerships."
1989.88-1476,1,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,1791.858,1793.64,"--No, the court did not, sir."
1989.88-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1798.934,1807.96,"Well, is it not true that people generally... lawyers generally for... ever since 1900 have assumed that in a limited partnership you look at the citizenship of the whole... of all partners?"
1989.88-1476,1,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,1807.96,1810.08,"--Well, I don't think that that's entirely true, Your Honor."
1989.88-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1810.08,1811.192,At least three circuits have so held.
1989.88-1476,1,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,1811.192,1814.444,"Well, we have two on one side and a couple on the other side."
1989.88-1476,2,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,1937.608,1941.731,"Your Honor, I can't recall all the... you know, all these facts of that case other than--"
1989.88-1476,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1941.731,1952.147,The opinion says it's authorized pursuant to an act authorizing the formation of a partnership and so forth in which the capital subscribed shall alone be responsible for the debts of the association except under certain limited circumstances.
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,1962.174,1963.484,"Well, with one distinction."
1989.88-1476,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1976.453,1978.995,"No, but the liability which is the main--"
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,1982.738,1984.328,"By contract, yes."
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.699,2063.379,Is that the crucial power?
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2083.703,2099.783,"I would in... I would say that based on the real party to the controversy analysis, if you're looking... if you want an answer to that question based on that type of analysis, the most important power is the power to control the business of the association, of the partnership."
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.22,2116.557,But you can have varying state laws that say he can... the general partners can do everything except and then make a whole... you can have all sorts of different exceptions from state to state.
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2116.557,2118.395,"Yes, you can."
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.917,2123.329,"What about any contract more than $200,000?"
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2124.32,2127.432,"--Your Honor, I suppose you could the state legislature could do that."
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.963,2142.483,"But if they should, we would have to go through each individual state partnership law and decide whether somehow or other the powers conferred only upon the general partner are significant enough to come within the principle that you're urging."
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2142.483,2156.231,"That's a possibility, although I think that the type of legislation that exists in the Uniform Limited Partnership Act speaks against that and will not cause that to be a concern, although I will... I will admit that any state legislature could do that."
1989.88-1476,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.231,2161.203,"Well, in Great Southern the president had rights to conduct business, did he not?"
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2161.203,2161.934,Yes.
1989.88-1476,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2161.934,2166.726,So how do you... you say it's... is the main distinction you see?
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2171.53,2181.158,"Well, it is and it isn't because if you look at... if you get into this analysis of juridical person that Mr. Ingolia did, then it becomes important whether it's statute or contract."
1989.88-1476,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.114,2227.338,Supposing Louisiana... this suit had been against Arkoma... is it Arkoma?
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2227.338,2227.959,"Yes, Arkoma."
1989.88-1476,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.959,2243.426,"Arkoma Associates and the complaint named the limited partners as well as Arkoma and all the general partners, could you get the suit dismissed against the general partners under... without... against the limited partners?"
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2243.426,2244.908,I think you could.
1989.88-1476,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2247.67,2258.526,"Would it be kind of... you know, in New York Friendly said that under the law the limited partners couldn't be sued in a case like this."
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2258.526,2259.568,"Well, Louisiana--"
1989.88-1476,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.568,2260.359,Is that true in Louisiana?
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2260.359,2263.251,"--Well, essentially yes."
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.436,2318.337,Excuse me.
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2322.79,2325.332,--I was responding to Justice White's question as to--
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.332,2326.023,"--Well, but this is an Arizona--"
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2326.023,2327.014,--what would happen--
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.014,2328.036,--partnership we're talking about here.
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2328.915,2329.446,--Right.
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.836,2346.986,--Capacity... capacity to sue include... is that right?
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2346.986,2348.689,"--Well, yes, sir."
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2349.538,2353.812,If Louisiana said that the individual shareholders of a corporation could be sued individually?
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2353.812,2359.686,"--Well, that's a different story because that 1332(c) directly addresses corporations."
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.175,2383.101,"But you say in theory it doesn't matter what kind of a partnership law Arizona enacts, Louisiana can override it and allow partners to be held liable?"
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2383.101,2384.043,"Oh, no."
1989.88-1476,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2473.891,2477.023,"A real party in interest analysis won't help you much, will it?"
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2477.023,2477.945,"Well, I think it will, Justice White."
1989.88-1476,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.347,2483.549,"Well, the limited partners stand to lose their stake."
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2483.549,2487.081,"--Well, as did the trust beneficiaries in Navarro."
1989.88-1476,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.081,2488.183,"Well, that maybe so."
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2493.225,2494.216,"Yes, of course."
1989.88-1476,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2497.019,2500.659,"Well, they'd stand to lose the stake in which they have an ownership interest."
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2500.659,2512.266,"Well, not exactly because I think... if I can refer you back to your question a little while ago, you said... or you asked, do the limited partners have an ownership interest in the assets, and they do not."
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2623.11,2630.674,"Mr. Hoffman, unlike... unlike the Petitioner, you... you assert that the limited partnership is a juridical person?"
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2630.674,2632.136,I'd say it doesn't matter.
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2634.517,2635.849,"Well, just pretend that it matters."
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2637.489,2641.502,"--Well, I would like to see it as a... limited... as a juridical person."
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2641.502,2642.602,I don't care what you'd like to see it as.
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2645.353,2646.605,"Well, yes, I believe it is."
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2646.605,2647.376,It is?
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2647.376,2653.989,I believe it is and I believe it should be because it has so many characteristics similar to a corporation that there's no reason to treat it any differently?
1989.88-1476,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.989,2656.042,What's the test of juridical personhood?
1989.88-1476,3,36032,mitchell_j_hoffman,,2656.042,2684.89,"Well, that, again, is something in the sociedad case, the Puerto Rico v. Russell case back in 1933, the court looked at all the qualifications and characteristics of the sociedad and compared them to a corporation and found that it's so very very similar to a corporation and it also had this state with the Puerto Rican sanction as an entity, and it said I'm looking at all... we're looking at all of those factors and we say, yes, this will be treated as an entity just like corporations."
1989.88-1476,4,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,3453.196,3453.936,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.88-1476,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3497.316,3499.125,I agree that control is pretty bad.
1989.88-1476,4,39587,richard_k_ingolia,,3537.731,3542.322,"--Well, that's certainly an argument, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-1476,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3576.096,3577.919,"Thank you, Mr. Ingolia."
