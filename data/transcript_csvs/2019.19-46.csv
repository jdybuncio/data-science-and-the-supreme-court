2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.08,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 19-46, United States Patent and Trademark Office versus Booking.com. Ms. Ross."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,12.08,45.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is a fundamental principle of trademark law that no party can obtain a trademark for a generic term like ""wine,"" ""cotton,"" or ""grain."" As Judge Friendly explained and as the Lanham Act confirmed, a generic term is never entitled to trademark protection no matter how much money and effort the user has poured into promoting the sale of its merchandise and what success it has achieved in securing public identification. In other words, secondary meaning or acquired distinctiveness is simply irrelevant to generic terms."
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,151.56,153.32,Counsel --
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,153.32,154.4,-- thus resulting in --
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,154.4,163.6,"-- counsel, you mentioned the Goodyear case, but you did not quote the language from the trademark statute that is at issue here."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,196.6,203.56,"So, Mr. Chief Justice, two points on that."
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,267.64,268.64,It was enacted --
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,268.64,269.48,-- decision in Goodyear.
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,269.48,279.24,"-- it was enacted in 1984, but that's a lot closer to today than the Goodyear case, which was 130 years ago."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,321.12,325.04,"So, again, a few points on that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,358.96,359.52,Thank you --
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,359.52,360.56,The point here is --
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,360.56,360.92,-- thank you --
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,360.92,361.88,-- that the decision --
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,361.88,367.84,"-- thank you -- thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.19-46,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,367.84,369.68,"Yes, Ms. Ross."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,385.92,432.12,"So, Justice Thomas, under the Federal Circuit's decisions, yes, it could. Those decisions, I think, may -- are -- are sort of debatable under Goodyear and the principles that we think control here, but the Federal Circuit -- the PTO, rather, does follow those decisions because of the right of direct appeal to the Federal Circuit from PTO decisions. Now I think it's significant that those are distinguishable in the sense that the core problem with Booking.com is that it allows Respondent to monopolize booking on the Internet because of the fact that longer domain names of Respondent's competitors, like ebooking.com and hotelbooking.com, can include Booking.com."
2019.19-46,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,437.16,442.28,"Well, the -- that -- that -- that could be true, but the -- I'd like you to compare this to Goodyear."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,468.68,477.36,"So, Your Honor, you're completely correct that only one Internet entity at a time can hold the domain name rights to Booking.com."
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,591.48,594.52,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,594.52,595.36,-- but we don't allow the space for --
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,595.36,600.0,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg?"
2019.19-46,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,600.0,600.4,Two questions.
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,625.52,630.44,"So, Justice Ginsburg, I think Respondent suggests that there are far more than there actually are."
2019.19-46,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,678.52,682.64,I wanted you to focus on cancellation.
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,687.96,691.52,So I do believe --
2019.19-46,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,691.52,700.44,"If we -- if we rule in your favor, would the PTO itself endeavor to cancel these marks?"
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,700.44,702.12,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2019.19-46,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,748.56,769.28,"I'm sorry, I have another question I wanted to ask you, and it's a follow-up to Justice Thomas. Your answer to the telephone number question, 1-800-Booking, was, well, that's the Federal Circuit precedent."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,787.52,790.84,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,811.32,811.8,Thank you --
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,811.8,813.88,-- taking a step back --
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,813.88,816.52,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-46,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,818.0,820.04,The same question as Justice Thomas's question.
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,843.0,864.48,"So, again, Justice Breyer, and good morning, I -- I think that it is clear from Goodyear that Goodyear balanced these competing objectives that are always true in trademark law in this very similar context of ""Booking Company."" We think ""Booking Company"" and ""Booking.com"" are essentially equivalent. All ""Booking.com"" tells you is that there is a website on the Internet for booking."
2019.19-46,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,974.04,976.36,Thank you.
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,976.36,980.08,Justice Alito?
2019.19-46,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,980.08,1017.8,"What do you think I should do if I think that Goodyear is a case from a different era and doesn't control here but also think that the Lanham Act, similarly, was enacted in a different era, namely, in the pre-Internet era, and that the case law on which Ms. Blatt relies belongs to that era? How can a rule that makes sense in the Internet age be reconciled with the language of the Lanham Act?"
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1017.8,1023.2,"So I think, Justice Alito, it's pretty easily reconcilable with the Lanham Act."
2019.19-46,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1208.36,1209.44,Counsel --
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1209.44,1211.56,-- in Section --
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1211.56,1213.12,Justice Sotomayor? Justice Sotomayor?
2019.19-46,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1213.12,1235.04,"I'm sorry, Chief. Ms. Ross, picking up on where you were right now, is it your position that the primary significance test to the public is never to be used in determining what's generic and what's not, or is it -- and if we don't use that test at least in whole or in part, however much you want, what other things would a PTO examiner look to?"
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1235.04,1246.04,"Justice Sotomayor, it's not our position that the -- the courts and the PTO can never look to the primary significance test outside of cancellation."
2019.19-46,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1312.8,1314.56,"Ms. Ross, may I --"
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1314.56,1315.44,-- if we really did --
2019.19-46,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1315.44,1318.44,"Ms. Ross, may I? Let me stop you there for a moment."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1318.44,1319.68,Of course.
2019.19-46,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1319.68,1329.84,"I looked at your definitions of ""booking"" and, basically, one definition said booking a hotel, but this service is much broader than that."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1376.64,1386.4,"Justice Sotomayor, I think I -- I think this was not presented here and I disagree on the merits."
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1413.84,1414.16,Thank you --
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1414.16,1415.2,-- while maybe it --
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1415.2,1417.2,"-- thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan?"
2019.19-46,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1417.2,1420.56,"Good morning, Ms. Ross."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1438.24,1445.48,"I think it depends a little bit, Justice Kagan, on what you mean by ""trademarks of this kind."" We think that when you're simply appending .com --"
2019.19-46,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1445.48,1449.04,"Generic .com, Bookings.com, Booking.com."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1449.04,1449.28,Sure.
2019.19-46,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1477.28,1482.96,"And am I right -- is that why -- you know, the PTO takes a much less categorical position."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1507.2,1509.76,"So I don't think there actually is a difference, Justice Kagan."
2019.19-46,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1538.88,1562.68,"Ms. Ross, in -- in your brief, you say, you know, you're -- you're -- you're not making the argument that people go around talking about Booking.coms, but you're instead saying that Booking.com is generic -- and this is on page 44 of your brief -- because customers would understand the term to convey only that the -- the company provides on-line booking services and the term conveys no additional meaning that would distinguish Respondent's services from those of other providers. And I guess, when I think about that test, I think, well, maybe or maybe not."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1577.52,1619.88,"So I think, Justice Kagan, to the extent that you think it could convey to consumers some additional meaning, that additional meaning -- and really the only additional meaning that Respondent has ever pointed to -- is this idea that it points you to a particular website. So that, I think, both because it's a functional feature of the Internet to which we don't usually give trademark protection and for all of the competition-based reasons I was noting earlier, I think that can't be enough to get them over the line. They've never made an argument -- again, the -- the -- sort of the key distinction between generic and descriptive terms is that a generic term identifies the type of good or service, whereas the descriptive -- a descriptive term tells you something about a feature or a characteristic of the service. So, for example, apple pie, generic for pies, but descriptive for rooms, rooms --"
2019.19-46,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1619.88,1622.92,"But suppose, Ms. Ross -- sorry to interrupt."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1649.4,1652.36,"So a few points, Your Honor."
2019.19-46,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1667.2,1667.96,Right.
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1669.0,1671.36,"Brief -- briefly, Ms. Ross."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1671.36,1671.56,Sure.
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1686.2,1689.16,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch?"
2019.19-46,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1689.16,1700.44,"Counsel, I'd like to follow up on that and -- and just give you another minute to -- to continue answering that question. Suppose we -- the Court does not accept your bright-line rule."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1709.2,1709.52,Sure.
2019.19-46,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1726.64,1730.2,Let's -- let's put Goodyear aside for the moment.
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1737.16,1737.48,Certainly.
2019.19-46,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1781.68,1810.36,"I -- I guess that -- that leads to my -- my next question, and that is, why aren't existing doctrinal tools under the Lanham Act sufficient? Because we do -- always, in every case, not just this area, would take very seriously questions about consumer confusion. And it seems to me a lot of your argument on -- on competition law policy issues is concerned with consumer confusion."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1838.92,1843.2,"So, Justice Gorsuch, there's a lot in that question."
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1896.8,1900.12,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh?"
2019.19-46,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1900.12,1904.56,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Ms. Ross."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,1929.12,1932.2,"Thank you, Justice Kavanaugh."
2019.19-46,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2023.24,2032.92,"Respondent also points out that there have been registrations of ""Booking.com"" in other countries, the EU, the United Kingdom."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,2034.24,2039.44,"Sure, Justice Kavanaugh. You know, I think that may well be true."
2019.19-46,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2069.68,2071.76,Thank you.
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2071.76,2077.44,"Ms. Ross, why don't you take a minute to wrap up."
2019.19-46,0,62958,erica_l_ross,,2077.44,2077.64,Sure.
2019.19-46,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2110.28,2114.48,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2114.48,2138.72,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about how to tell the difference between descriptive names the Lanham Act protects and generic ones the Act does not. There are three reasons this Court should hold that the answer is the primary significance test, that is, whether consumers primarily think the name is a genus or a potential brand. First, the Act mandates this test."
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2254.36,2266.36,"Thank you -- thank you, counsel. You rely heavily on the primary significance test, but that is only in the provision of the statute dealing with cancellation of marks."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2278.48,2279.32,Sure.
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2325.04,2336.6,"Well, maybe one reason that Congress put this in the cancellation section and not in the registration section is because they appreciated the significance of Goodyear with respect to registration of marks."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2336.6,2344.24,"That -- that -- I don't think that can be right because, again, Goodyear is a -- Goodyear is a common law rule."
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2407.64,2409.52,"Counsel, there --"
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2409.52,2410.96,-- the Lanham Act --
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2410.96,2433.52,"-- there are a lot of companies that use booking in their -- the second-level domain, ebooking.com, hotelbooking.com, eurobookings.com, travelbooking.com. If you succeed in trademarking Booking.com, then these competitors will be impeded from using that term, which is an accurate description of the services and goods that they -- they provide."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2433.52,2434.76,So I -- I don't think that's correct.
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2434.76,2438.4,Isn't that something that we should take into consideration?
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2438.4,2438.64,Sure.
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2476.08,2478.76,Could you quickly note what your second and third reasons are?
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2478.76,2479.08,Yes.
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2494.36,2499.16,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.19-46,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2499.16,2509.84,"Thank -- thank you, Chief. The -- just getting back to the Chief's question, Ms. Blatt, you -- you seem to rely almost exclusively on the primary significance test."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2514.96,2545.88,"No, because, regardless of what you think of our test, the government can't be right because three statutory provisions that don't mention primary significance test overrule, repudiate, abrogate, and completely eradicate any notion that you could have a per se rule that would ignore what consumers think, which is why the Court in Qualitex didn't need some primary significance test; it just said you look at -- you don't have the common law per se bar against trademarking colors; it's just a factual question about what consumers think."
2019.19-46,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2598.28,2599.24,Yeah.
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2599.24,2612.04,"The PTO's manual says it. It's the test that was applied in this case. And if I could turn to something that I think is pretty devastating for the government, is their appendix. Their appendix of rejected marks is not based on Goodyear."
2019.19-46,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2668.92,2688.52,"So do you make a -- the government relies on Goodyear, and you say that, of course, there's been a sea change in trademark law since Goodyear, particularly with the Lanham Act. Would you just explain briefly how you think the Lanham Act has expanded the trademark law and what is protected and what is not protected?"
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2688.52,2690.32,"Sure, Justice Thomas."
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2730.92,2734.08,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Justice Ginsburg?"
2019.19-46,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2734.08,2764.88,"If you have the same name, Ms. Blatt, then the consumers will know that the word com, .com, will get you a particular thought, not all sellers of a given sort of commodity but one particular thought. And yet you don't argue that generic.com is always potentially trademarkable."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2770.6,2784.24,"So, in terms of when it flunks the primary significance test, in addition, I can talk -- I'll give you some examples, but the -- the cites that I gave you from the government appendix are good examples of how generic word .com marks flunk it."
2019.19-46,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2887.68,2901.32,"May I ask you another question? And that is, if passing off another service as your service is what you're really concerned about, why does an unfair competition law afford you adequate protection?"
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2901.32,2906.64,"So mainly the reason is because, you know, we're a business."
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2970.72,2972.32,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Breyer?"
2019.19-46,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2972.32,2972.8,Thank you.
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2999.76,3000.84,Mm-hmm.
2019.19-46,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3000.84,3011.6,"Here, the power of the trademark, your trademark, is exactly growing out of the fact that everybody knows there's one com with one name."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3109.36,3109.48,Sure.
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3199.36,3203.08,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3203.08,3204.12,Sure.
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3204.12,3205.76,Justice Alito?
2019.19-46,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3205.76,3216.0,What would your client's position be if companies that had -- that took Booking.com but made very slight variations sought trademark protection?
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3216.0,3221.76,"Yeah, that's -- that's fine."
2019.19-46,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3257.8,3270.56,You would not -- your client would not object to the registration of any trademark that simply made a slight variation in Booking.com? That would be fine? All of those companies could register their trademarks?
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3270.56,3273.72,"They are, because there's a million booking registrations already."
2019.19-46,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3273.72,3273.92,Yeah.
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3275.4,3276.28,Yes.
2019.19-46,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3276.68,3278.8,Would your client object to that?
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3278.8,3281.24,They don't and have not and would not.
2019.19-46,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3293.44,3298.48,My concern with your position is exactly what I think Justice Breyer just suggested.
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3333.76,3337.24,So if I could turn to the company situation.
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3415.76,3420.44,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor?"
2019.19-46,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3420.44,3442.04,"Ms. Blatt, I am troubled, as Justice Breyer and Justice Alito are, about the monopoly situation, but I'm also troubled by what's the rule that you want the PTO to follow? They can't trademark under law generic names."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3470.92,3473.28,So I -- I 100 percent agree with Justice Kagan.
2019.19-46,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3580.28,3619.8,"If this is a -- if this is a factual question, and a district court is not to give the PTO deference, then what we're going to have is every district court reweighing all of this evidence that the PTO looked at. And, frankly, I'm on the margin with respect to your mark, because I would have looked at ebooking and carbooking and hotelbooking and all of those other bookings and said this really booking standing alone is generic, even with .com. Now you point to the Teflon study, but you seem to be saying that a district court who ruled a different way would be wrong as a matter of law."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3620.48,3620.48,No.
2019.19-46,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3621.16,3623.56,Could any survey ever be dispositive?
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3623.56,3624.64,No.
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3643.0,3644.0,-- based on the survey.
2019.19-46,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3644.0,3647.0,"Maybe, maybe not. I didn't look at that entire record."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3647.0,3649.08,"No, but you could."
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3662.56,3664.2,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan?"
2019.19-46,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3664.2,3665.04,"Good morning, Ms. Blatt."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3693.08,3694.96,Correct.
2019.19-46,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3694.96,3704.52,"And it's true of the -- the survey, the Teflon surveys, but it's true of evidence generally, that it would seem as if you're going to get a bias in the results and more things will seem to be registrable than really ought to be."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3704.52,3714.12,"Yeah, so a great question, and I think I can clarify this for you. So, just like The Wig Company or wig.com, they can be generic for wig companies and wig producers."
2019.19-46,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3778.2,3779.6,Okay.
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3794.08,3795.64,I haven't seen any.
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3877.6,3881.48,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch?"
2019.19-46,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3881.48,3881.84,Good morning.
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3920.96,3922.8,Much better than I said.
2019.19-46,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3922.8,3925.24,"Will you expound on that, please?"
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3925.24,3925.56,Sure.
2019.19-46,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3993.76,3993.92,Do you --
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3993.92,3997.16,"And I'm not making it up, Justice Gorsuch."
2019.19-46,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4002.28,4028.2,"Can you address for me a little bit more on the record, I know we're not the trial judge here, but Justice Breyer's point, I think, 74 percent of consumers recognized Booking.com as your client, but 33 percent think that anything "".com"" is a -- is a real store. So only about -- as -- as I understand it, about 41 percent on a net basis recognize your mark."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,4032.16,4032.24,Well --
2019.19-46,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4032.24,4032.84,-- about the standard --
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,4032.84,4033.16,Yes.
2019.19-46,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4033.44,4035.8,-- if not the facts?
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,4035.8,4036.32,Okay.
2019.19-46,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4041.12,4042.2,"Well, now --"
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,4042.2,4042.84,-- that explains how --
2019.19-46,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4042.84,4046.6,-- that's not fair. Now come on.
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,4046.6,4047.08,Okay.
2019.19-46,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4081.24,4083.36,"Oh, I -- I understand that."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,4085.68,4086.44,Okay.
2019.19-46,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4088.2,4099.68,"-- and ask for your guidance as to what the Court should say with respect to these kind of survey methodologies, if anything."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,4099.68,4100.48,So I think --
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4100.48,4103.4,"Briefly, Ms. Blatt."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,4106.84,4108.64,"Oh, yeah, I'm sorry."
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4143.84,4145.2,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh?"
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,4145.2,4145.32,Sure.
2019.19-46,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4145.32,4147.56,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Ms. Blatt."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,4162.04,4176.8,"So I'll -- I'll fall back to certainly you shouldn't extend it to "".com"" because "".com"" is closer to the words ""store"" and ""shop"" -- and ""shop."" But, if you took Goodyear at its word, you're killing non-profits because of the association problem. Goodyear -- the terms of the opinion say it means association."
2019.19-46,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4222.24,4233.04,"Picking up on Justice Kagan's line of questioning, it seems that your rule invariably will lead to a situation where most every "".com"" business that sells good or -- goods or services will be able to obtain a trademark."
2019.19-46,1,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,4238.2,4278.56,"I think it's wrong, but I -- I hear that -- I hear at least six of you concerned about it, so I can try to help on -- on this. What you can do is make clear in your opinion that a district court, if there is evidence of -- from all kinds of sources that the PTO uses and all those examples I gave in the beginning, they cite all kinds of examples proving that generic word "".com"" marks flunk the primary significance test -- that the PTO can look past survey evidence and so can courts if you're really worried about a survey bias. Now we have a whole brief of survey experts saying this was a great survey."
2019.19-46,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4321.56,4338.8,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ross, you have three minutes for rebuttal."
2019.19-46,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,4342.0,4342.32,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.19-46,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4541.04,4543.68,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-46,2,62958,erica_l_ross,,4543.68,4544.6,-- gets the trademark --
2019.19-46,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4544.6,4548.72,"Thank you, counsel."
