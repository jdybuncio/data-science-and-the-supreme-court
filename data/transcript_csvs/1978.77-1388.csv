1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,88.676,We’ll hear arguments next in Massachusetts against White.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,92.198,95.128,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,438.901,442.495,Wasn't there some response on the defendant’s part at that time?
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,442.495,445.017,"At this particular this moment, yes Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,484.497,514.74,"In Massachusetts -- would be have been able to get a warrant, without reciting the statement made that there was more material in the car that he was simply showing, the man was found in dubious condition of – disoriented condition and that he had a marijuana cigarette on his purse, would that be enough to support one to --"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,514.74,515.65,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,515.65,516.597,The search of the car.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,516.597,533.49,"I don’t believe it, it would have and in fact in this case the Supreme Judicial Court and the Trail Judge himself found that the validity of the warrant was based on the statement that there was more in car, that they would not been enough without it."
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,533.49,545.725,"It’s not -- quite my question but is there no search, an inventory made at the car when it’s taken into possession off in the woods and brought into the --"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,545.725,546.575,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,576.552,585.887,"If an inventory search would be supportable and I say if, then how relevant is the warrant in all the other issues?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,585.887,590.256,Our Court found that quite relevant because the police never indicated that they would have --
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,590.256,611.78,"Well, I know it should be found and now I thought what you are presenting to this Court, do you or do you not argue, but that since an inventory search would have been permitted with other warrant, but it doesn’t make any difference whether this one was or was not supported, do you make that argument?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,611.78,617.554,I have not made that argument because I don’t think the record fairly supports that argument.
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,628.3,633.275,I thought you entered that the inventory search was the usual procedure but --
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,633.275,639.86,It was never established that it is the usual procedure in the State Police Barracks that we’re dealing with in this case.
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,644.471,650.187,Ms. Smith Isn’t it true that the common law did make the inventory search argument in the Supreme Judicial Court.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,656.908,657.556,That’s correct.
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,657.556,658.612,So it’s not before us.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,658.612,660.776,"Right Your Honor, that’s absolutely correct."
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,666.172,676.69,But they rule squarely on a contention that the search could be justified on an inventory theory and you lost on that theory in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,676.69,681.449,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,683.187,692.105,If you can make the argument -- [Inaudible]
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,692.105,709.39,"Following the motion to suppress the Trail Judge rule that the Commonwealth could not sustain or had not sustained its ""heavy burden"" of demonstrating that the defendant had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to self-incrimination right to counsel."
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,957.803,963.452,Even that’s how -- how its certainly true that not all police interrogation is inherently coercive.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,979.735,981.706,I believe that was the premise of the Miranda decision Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,981.706,983.377,Was this the premise of the whole?
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,983.377,984.653,"Yes, indeed I think it was."
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,984.653,985.718,The judgment and opinion?
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,985.718,1004.769,"However I do believe in my citation of some the recent cases indicates to me that this court has withdrawn from that presumption because otherwise if we are to assume that all police interrogation is necessarily and inherently coercive, and that it involves a Fifth Amendment."
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1004.769,1008.902,Not all police interrogation but all in police interrogation of a person in the custody.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1008.902,1010.263,"In custody, yes Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1039.983,1041.762,Well the Miranda opinion itself --
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1041.762,1042.469,Pardon me.
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1042.469,1059.029,"The Miranda opinion itself which of course covered five different cases as you know, conceded that some of the statements and at least some of those cases were not involuntary statements in the traditional meaning of that word."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1059.029,1061.115,That’s true.
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1061.115,1061.823,Isn’t that correct?
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1061.823,1087.825,"That’s correct Your Honor, but it seems to me that the recent cases in this court interpreting Miranda and the scope of the exclusionary rule in Miranda have indicated a willingness to examine the circumstances and distinguish between police conduct, which actually abridges a right, were this actually coercion, psychological or physical, were there are threats, inducements, cajolery, promises."
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1104.382,1110.182,"The statement is admissible if a person is given his Miranda, so called Miranda warnings."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1111.089,1114.98,That’s correct but it’s also been held admissible for certain purposes with --
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1114.98,1117.862,"If it’s involuntary, it’s inadmissible for any purpose."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1117.862,1121.944,That’s correct but the fact that the violation of Miranda Your Honor --
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1121.944,1124.313,That is admissible if the Miranda warnings were given.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1124.313,1125.522,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1125.522,1140.454,"You’re pointed, I taken is that the recent Miranda cases from this court would not have out the same way if we had been dealing with confessions that were found to be coerce by nonetheless trustworthy."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1140.454,1156.703,"In one sentence Your Honor, what I am saying is that recent decisions wouldn’t have come out the way they have which admitted statements for some purposes which have been taken in violation of Miranda because of the lack of a warning in some instance, like of a waiver."
1978.77-1388,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1156.703,1167.322,"You say that if those statements instead of having been taken in some violation of Miranda, had been found the court to be coerce, the input would have stopped there?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1167.322,1171.823,That’s right and they would not be admissible for any purpose if they were coerced.
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1178.98,1187.892,"Right, but the corollary of that if they are given voluntarily after Miranda warnings, they are admissible."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1187.892,1188.726,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1188.726,1194.939,And if the court should conclude that it would not have to decide any other issues in the cases.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1194.939,1197.676,That’s correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.676,1201.725,You are contending there was not a violation of the Miranda?
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1201.725,1206.319,The court ruled that there was an violation of the waiver requirement.
1978.77-1388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1206.319,1209.922,"Yes, do you challenge that?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1209.922,1211.984,"I challenge, I think that the court just review the challenge."
1978.77-1388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.984,1217.805,"Or do you just challenge that even if they –- are you arguing that, even if there was, the evidence should be admissible?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1217.805,1219.508,"Even if, yes, oh yes Your Honor, even if they --"
1978.77-1388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.508,1222.275,I know you are arguing that but are you also arguing the instructional question?
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1225.144,1235.688,"I don’t think that the finding was constitutionally required Your Honor, you’re absolutely correct that there was a lack of knowing an intelligent waiver on this part."
1978.77-1388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1235.688,1242.338,"So you can see there was as Miranda stated, there was a violation of the Miranda rules here?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1242.338,1244.035,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1247.048,1251.145,That was because of his indication that he wanted a lawyer.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1251.145,1252.552,That was on two basis.
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1278.407,1296.693,"What would be your position with respect to an arrested criminal defendant, who was under the influence of alcohol, who proceeded to recite a full confession of the acts which amounted to the commission of a crime?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1298.665,1299.849,Would I feel it’s inadmissible?
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1314.092,1318.621,Do you mean it will be a factor that would be taken into account on the voluntariness?
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1318.621,1319.973,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1320.749,1332.847,"Well it’s all from the thought at least that alcohol tends to loosen the tongues, which you don’t think there is anything unconstitutional about, a loose tongued alcoholic confession?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1332.847,1334.756,"No, Your Honor, I don’t."
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1371.148,1382.232,"Ms. Smith in addition to the violation of Miranda, which you say relies on both the evidence that approaches intoxication and the fact that he tried to contact his lawyer."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1387.28,1389.093,"No Your Honor, I would say not."
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1399.091,1405.967,But I think you indicated that they overheard his conversation and knew he was seeking the assistance of a lawyer and was dropping coins all over the floor?
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1405.967,1425.983,"Yes and that would appear to be for the purposes of making bail, since there was no interrogation conducted at all in relation to the original charge of driving under the influence, I don’t see why the police should have suspected that he wanted an attorney present in a non-existent interrogation."
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.983,1432.823,"Do you think the case would be different if he had said unambiguously, I’d rather not talk to you until I consult my lawyer?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1432.823,1435.497,Yes I do believe that that would make a difference Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1435.497,1436.502,I see.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1436.502,1440.594,"Here he only indicated he want to make a phone call, he never indicated --"
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1440.594,1451.803,"Well, if you think that would make a difference, is it – and I don’t think either the Trial Court or the Supreme Court made a determination of whether there had been an attempt to contact counsel kind of an Escobedo type point?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1451.803,1451.926,No.
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1451.926,1463.721,"Is that conceivable the proper disposition of the case would be to send it back to determine whether his telephone call was the equivalent, I suppose one could argue it was substantially the equivalent of an attempt as for counsel."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1463.721,1466.652,I don’t believe that the record would support that Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1470.13,1470.649,For a sense of our --
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1470.649,1484.366,"The situation here -- there the counsel was present at the police station, the defendant requested to speak with his counsel, the counsel requested to speak with him, and the police firmly denied those requests."
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1506.392,1516.558,"The thing that poses me about this case is why the officer – when the man mentioned he had some information about the biggies, why the office didn’t say, tell me about them?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1518.709,1524.659,"Well, he may have been interested but he may have felt that any interrogation of the defendant at that time would be improper."
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1524.659,1528.524,Why I wonder?
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1528.524,1530.042,"The defendant was drunk, isn’t that why?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1530.042,1537.361,"No, Your Honor, the defendant was not drunk, the defendant registered a 0.13 on the breathalyzer, which would show that he was under the influence of --"
1978.77-1388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1537.361,1550.215,"Well, in any event, the policeman apparently accurately predicted the later decisions of the courts of your state."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1550.215,1562.24,"Yes Your Honor, I think the police officer was attempting throughout in the number of warnings given and his whole demeanor to follow the dictates of this Court and the Courts of Massachusetts."
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1565.18,1567.83,I can just perceive it with one more question if I may.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1578.965,1581.294,"No, I don’t think he would be well advised to do that."
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1581.294,1582.169,Why not?
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1582.169,1585.177,"Why take the chance Your Honor, get right back in the situation here."
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.177,1588.303,"(Voice Overlap) is right, I mean --"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1588.303,1589.723,If my view of the law is that -
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1589.723,1600.927,"He would not be able to use the statement against the man himself, but he would be able to use the information for further investigative purposes and it might lead to the discovery of other evidence which would be entirely admissible."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1600.927,1605.126,Your Honor there -- I think the – again look at the circumstances.
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1633.397,1635.036,It is not exactly what this officer did.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1637.983,1647.073,"He did Your Honor and I suggest that that was in a response, quite natural response to a conversation initiated by the defendant."
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.073,1651.831,"I don’t know why it wouldn’t have been equally natural to say, when he said, I know a lot about the biggies, who are they?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1654.987,1662.477,"Well, even if he had done that, would that render the evidence more or less reliable for uses for establishing probable cause?"
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1662.477,1669.866,"No it wouldn’t, and it seems to me that if you win, that’s exactly what police officers ought to do, they ought to follow-up on these leads to get the evidence."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1669.866,1671.854,"Your Honor, if they can follow-up on the leads without --"
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.854,1680.568,"There is nothing wrong with it under your theory as I understand it because his constitutional rights are not violated unless his own statement is used at the trial, at his trial against him."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1680.568,1683.662,Unless there is some element of coercion or trickery.
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.662,1685.795,"Right, yeah."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1698.281,1699.624,"Yes, I am taking that position."
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1699.624,1704.543,"Well then if you are, you should say that they could ask him about the biggies then."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1704.543,1705.697,Possible they could ask him about the biggies.
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.697,1707.001,"Well, may not possibly, but definitely they can."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1707.001,1716.708,But as long as we don’t get into a situation where the police actually are abusive or coercive in a sense that the statement is derived in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1716.708,1721.015,"Right, but that wouldn’t be – that wouldn’t violate his Fifth Amendment rights."
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1721.015,1726.517,"In that sense, then I would argue that the derivative evidence could be used and to the point --"
1978.77-1388,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1726.517,1731.214,"So you do agree then that in the future if you win this case, they ought to be able to ask about the biggies?"
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1731.214,1731.622,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1731.622,1732.838,Alright.
1978.77-1388,0,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,1732.838,1734.389,I do.
1978.77-1388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1738.748,1745.683,Mr. Cohen?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1745.683,1748.485,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the court."
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1815.19,1819.431,Your fourth choice then is to affirm the Supreme Judicial Court?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1819.431,1820.158,My third choice Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1875.948,1882.509,Why do the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts not only cite Miranda but quote from it?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1882.509,1883.513,"Well Your Honor, please beside --"
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1883.513,1886.056,"Is that just, what?"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1886.056,1892.482,"I think Your Honor, please -- It is still unclear because in addition to besides citing Miranda, besides to Massachusetts."
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1892.482,1894.291,But do they cited and quoted it.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1894.291,1895.473,They cited Miranda Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1898.965,1902.028,"Well I didn't get you, you draw the conclusion that you relied on both."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1902.028,1904.822,"I am saying that it’s unclear, yes Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1904.822,1905.871,Can’t you say as both or --
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1905.871,1906.799,"It’s both, Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1909.063,1911.523,Then your opponent is gone if it is both.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1911.523,1917.012,"I would say not Your Honor if it is relied on both, my understanding of the law is that it would be in independent state ground."
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1917.012,1919.511,"Give me a citation, that way, they relied on both."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1919.511,1927.599,"I believe Your Honor California versus Acevedo, when this case was remanded back down to the California Courts, they said that they relied on both and that the latter."
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1927.599,1930.116,"And tell me what, this court said that?"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1930.116,1931.498,"No, the California court Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1931.498,1935.684,"Well, I may ask, when did this court say that?"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1935.684,1940.273,"It’s my understanding Your Honor, please that in --"
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1940.273,1942.418,We sent it back to the --
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1942.418,1948.682,"Back to the state court if that is a basis for upholding the decision, yes Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1948.682,1952.412,Why don’t you stick on it instead of the other one?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1955.458,1961.718,Well I say Your Honor please that the case is seem to indicate in independent state grounds that the court has taken two approaches.
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1979.418,1986.388,This court dismisses improvidently granted cases before 1920.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1986.388,1986.902,I am sorry Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1988.231,1992.234,"I thought, when did this court start the dismissal?"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,1992.234,2009.69,"I believe Your Honor that the change came in Herb v. Pitcairn in the Minnesota-Tea case where at least in Herb v. Pitcairn, Justice Jackson said that pursuant consistent with the, if I may quote Your Honor?"
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2009.69,2011.329,That was in 1940?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2011.329,2013.466,"No, the Herb v. Pitcairn case was late Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2017.064,2020.04,I don’t think that Judge Jackson was here in 1920.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2020.04,2023.144,"No, in Herb v. Pitcairn, he was Your Honor when he cited in that case --"
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2023.144,2027.126,I don’t be surprised then because it’s not important one way or the other.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2044.43,2046.95,"I thought that’s what I was saying Your Honor, apparently I wasn’t saying it too clearly."
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2046.95,2047.877,Then I am sorry.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2047.877,2050.712,I apologize for not expressing myself more clearly Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2050.712,2066.937,"But the point is if it’s not clear, whether or not the state court relied upon an adequate and independent state ground, then it’s encountered upon this court to remand it to determine whether or not it did."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2073.902,2074.723,That’s correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2078.201,2079.998,Nothing inconsistant between that.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2079.998,2081.739,I agree Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2081.739,2092.085,"And if it is clear from the opinion that it rested both on the Massachusetts constitution and the federal constitution, then it does rest on an adequate statement."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2092.085,2093.206,"That’s correct Your Honor, yes."
1978.77-1388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.206,2095.868,It must be dismissed.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2095.868,2097.551,Must be dismissed Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2097.551,2116.523,"The Supreme Judicial Court was quite well aware in its footnote deciding after a month that it was -- if had had available toward the Massachusetts constitution and didn’t have to decide whether there was a state federal question there, was it not?"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2116.523,2128.863,I believe so Your Honor but this case in my opinion does not an opulent inventory situation but only presents a situation of the use of illegally obtained statements.
1978.77-1388,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2128.863,2144.273,"All I am saying is that why when it was so clearly aware that it could rest the decision either on the federal or state constitutions in the Opperman footnote, did it lean so heavily on Miranda here?"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2144.273,2146.802,Well I don’t think that they did lean so heavily in Miranda Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2167.205,2168.658,Where are you reading it from?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2168.658,2180.202,"I am reading Your Honor please, appendix 78."
1978.77-1388,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2227.568,2232.282,But that wasn’t Hass decided on the basis of the federal constitution?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2232.282,2232.814,No Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2247.615,2248.249,I see.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2255.169,2256.096,I am sorry Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2266.536,2270.145,"I understand, but what did those cases in turn rely on?"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2272.864,2276.038,They were interpretations of constitutional rights Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2276.038,2278.309,Which federal constitutional rights?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2278.309,2283.76,"Well, the Commonwealth and Hall, that was search and seizure, that’s the Fourth Amendment case. Commonwealth versus Hass --"
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2283.76,2287.459,Was the federal -- did it deal with federal constitution?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2287.459,2291.176,"It’s unclear again from those decisions, which constitutional rights they were talking about?"
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2291.176,2294.002,You just said the fourth amendment issue?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2294.002,2303.981,"I agree with you that certainly the federal Fourth Amendment issue was involved and I would say Your Honor, I don’t know if council argued or if the emotion to suppress in that case alleged the state grounds."
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2308.343,2315.67,"May be, but just because the court here cited some previous Massachusetts cases doesn’t indicate to me that there was a state ground involved."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2315.67,2317.335,Well I would say Your Honor the further evidence of the states --
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2317.335,2320.534,Those states might just have been interpretations of the federal constitution.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2320.534,2330.338,"Well, I would say that further evidence of a state ground Your Honor whereas that this is not a case where the Supreme Judicial Court has reluctantly applied federal constitutional standards."
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2335.309,2337.793,I will ask you this.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2340.546,2341.742,That’s correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2341.742,2347.829,Was there any mention of the state constitution in the two state cases that this opinion cited?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2347.829,2350.498,There is no direct mention of it made Your Honor please.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2350.498,2357.189,"Well, was there any direct mention of the state constitution, any of the state cases that these two cases cited?"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2357.189,2358.725,"No, Your Honor please."
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2384.061,2386.605,"Well, that’s just an argument; they got it remanded under the Fifth Amendment."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2386.605,2387.919,Yes it was remanded.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2387.919,2407.441,"But am I right Mr. Cohen, I’ve been reading some recent opinions of your Supreme Judicial Court and I have been interested that it has often -- these opinions often wind up and we are resting this decision on our state constitution and not on the constitution of the United States."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2409.816,2419.698,"Well, I think Your Honor, we are just attempting now to be more clear because of the fact that the Supreme Court of United States may differ with them at certain policy issues."
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2446.875,2449.41,"But here they did say, I think it’s one I am checking out."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2449.41,2450.062,They did Your Honor please.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2450.062,2453.008,That they are resting it squarely on their constitution that they did not agree.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2453.008,2453.848,That’s right.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2458.403,2463.195,"Well, what you are saying at most then is that this ought to be cripped sent back to reconsideration?"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2463.195,2465.213,"That’s correct Your Honor, yes."
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2465.213,2469.511,"They rested on a statement, constitutional ground as well as the federal ground."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2469.511,2470.47,That’s correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.47,2485.839,"Mr. Cohen, I think there is another problem with your argument here, the Massachusetts law as I understand, had taken most favorably to you is that, if there is a constitutional violation, then the derivative use of the evidence obtained by means of the constitutional violation cannot be used to get a search warrant."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2485.839,2486.717,That’s correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2486.717,2491.126,However your opponent challenges the existence of the constitutional violation.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2502.442,2505.361,You make reference to the waive Your Honor?
1978.77-1388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2505.361,2510.993,The question whether the violation of the teaching of Miranda is a violation of the constitution.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2510.993,2511.866,I differ with that Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.715,2523.632,"Well, then on page 78, they are talking about assuming a violation of the constitution, may the evidence nevertheless be used to get a warrant."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2534.866,2545.048,"It says, Your Honor, from these cases it follows that neither may such statements be used for the purpose of considering whether there was probable cause to obtain a search warrant."
1978.77-1388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2546.54,2553.56,"In the first sentence of preceding paragraphs in the Hall case, we recognize that evidence obtained in violation of constitutional guarantees (Inaudible)."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2553.56,2559.278,"I am saying that, that could refer to the Massachusetts constitution, the United States constitution, or both."
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2563.736,2566.488,"Well, have you read -- [Inaudible]"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2566.488,2567.587,"Hall, I have Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2567.587,2573.916,"If it was a constitutional guarantee, is that state or federal."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2573.916,2575.664,I would say that it’s unclear Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2575.664,2577.548,"No, no, is it state or federal?"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2578.715,2579.213,It’s unclear.
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2603.868,2606.73,But Halls did talk about Miranda.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2606.73,2609.937,"No, Your Honor, Hall stands for the proposition that evidence --"
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2609.937,2617.707,(Inaudible) in Miranda v. Arizona.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2617.707,2621.144,That’s not in Hall Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2622.483,2623.732,I thought I said Hafas.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2623.732,2624.561,I am sorry Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2632.425,2634.291,So we would have to go back and read them off.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2634.291,2635.246,"Yes, that’s it Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2678.926,2692.017,"Is the testimony -- your argument then is that by having this statement you used as a basis for getting the warrant, that’s testimony being used against him?"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2692.017,2693.635,Yes Your Honor please.
1978.77-1388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2693.635,2697.981,What if the search had produced nothing?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2703.995,2720.119,"Well, the state would not be able to be used in court Your Honor and I am saying that besides the statement not being able to be used in court, the results of the search warrant should not be able to be used in court in the – at least in the prosecution’s case in chief."
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2720.119,2727.021,"Mr. Cohen, you very carefully stated twice that this evidence was obtained in violation of both Miranda and the constitution of guarantee."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2727.021,2727.501,That’s correct.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2727.501,2731.827,Apparently you have to accept the suggestion of your opponent that there is a distinction between --
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2731.827,2754.758,"Well, no I do not Your Honor, I say that the holding in Miranda must be based on the constitution that this Court has no power to regulate or supervise state court’s absent a constitutional basis, and that at least this concerns the waiver requirements of Miranda but that has to be constitutionally mandated."
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2754.758,2756.61,What you do with Michigan against Tucker?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2756.61,2759.893,Michigan versus Tucker can be distinguished on many points Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2762.441,2764.304,Rely on the fact that it was before the Miranda.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2764.304,2775.644,"Yes, Michigan versus Tucker, the wrong in Michigan versus Tucker was the police did not tell the defendant that he would be furnished free counsel."
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2797.276,2802.612,Just stopping you just for a moment on the counsel point. Do you arguing dependently there was a violation of the Sixth Amendment?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2802.612,2804.831,That’s correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2804.831,2810.232,Do you thing anything survives of Escobedo after Johnson versus New Jersey?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2810.232,2811.619,"I am sorry Your Honor, I didn’t hear the question."
1978.77-1388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2811.619,2821.141,Do you think there is anything left of Escobedo against Illinois after this court’s pro curium decision in Johnson versus New Jersey in 384 US?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2821.141,2827.063,I would say certainly Your Honor because Escobedo was cited with approval in Brewer versus Williams.
1978.77-1388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2940.535,2943.179,We’ll resume there at 1’o clock.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2943.179,2961.586,Thank you.
1978.77-1388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2961.586,2966.098,"Counsel, you may resume."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,2966.098,2968.292,Thank you.
1978.77-1388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3190.944,3207.806,"Counsel, what’s your reply to Mr. Justice White’s concurring opinion in Stone v. Powell that exclusion of evidence obtained in good faith will never have a deterrent effect because if people are acting in good faith and reasonably they will presumably do the same thing again."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3207.806,3212.389,"Well, I would say that number one, the police officer in this case did not act in good faith."
1978.77-1388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3255.489,3261.273,But if we get conflicts between Courts of Appeals and the State Supreme Courts on Miranda points.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3271.685,3281.859,"I think up to this time the law was clear Your Honor, namely without the waiver and without the warnings of Miranda, no evidence can be used, that’s what Miranda said and that basic issue, I don’t think a subject to attack."
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3281.859,3283.866,Then what is a waiver?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3283.866,3284.738,I am sorry.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3284.738,3288.06,There is quite a difference of opinion about what a waiver is?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3288.06,3289.193,"Well, that’s true Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3335.434,3350.153,I think you would say then that there would be no way that the police having illicitly heard that there was additional drugs in the car.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3352.759,3363.778,"Well, I would think Your Honor that in order to seize contraband, a limited exception could be created that would allow the police only to seize the contraband because of the nature of contraband --"
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3363.778,3377.35,"Are you suggesting then that if the police said, the officers said, well I know I shouldn’t have heard this, but I have heard it, I do know there is contraband in the car, so I will just enter the car and take the contraband."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3377.35,3383.166,"Well that he had overheard it on the telephone conversation, there would be no interrogation and Miranda would not be applicable Your Honor."
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3383.166,3389.258,"Well I know, but let’s just assume that he heard it from him, like he did."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3389.258,3392.271,"Yes, after interrogation."
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3392.271,3394.496,Could he use it at all to get into the car?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3394.496,3395.616,I would say Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3395.616,3397.136,Not even to seize contraband.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3397.136,3402.431,"The only limited exception would be because of the nature of contraband, to seize contraband, certainly it cannot be used --"
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3402.431,3404.963,Would there be an exception or not?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3404.963,3409.341,"I would argue that there shouldn’t be Your Honor but if there was going to an exception, then that should be the --"
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3409.341,3412.973,"So your answer is, no there would be no way they could get into the car."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3412.973,3417.136,"I would say that they should not be or on the alternative, if the Court did see (Inaudible) exception --"
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3417.136,3424.978,"Although the police know there is contraband in the car, there is nothing they can do about it because of this violation of Miranda."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3424.978,3430.605,"I am not saying that they couldn’t Your Honor, I am saying that I would argue that they should not be able to and if it was founded they should --"
1978.77-1388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3430.605,3434.325,"That said, your view is that constitutionally they are forbidden to get into the car?"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3434.325,3443.49,"Yes or in the alternative, if they were able to go into the car, it’d only be to seize the contraband, not to present that contraband in evidence in a criminal trial."
1978.77-1388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3443.49,3474.17,"Let me just add for the -- my hypothetical question, supposing the trial of those cases with that evidence excluded for the purposes on this record, and other words no question about the use of the information to get the warrant, and your client took that stand and testified and was asked, do you have any other -- possession of any other drugs except those found on your purse, and he said, no."
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3478.555,3479.716,Well I would say Your Honor that --
1978.77-1388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3479.716,3483.133,Not your view but what the view of Harris against New York.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3483.133,3488.447,"I would say that Harris was a pre-Miranda situation, so Harris would not be authority on point."
1978.77-1388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3488.447,3489.712,"Harris, pre-Miranda?"
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3489.712,3495.018,I believe that was a pre-Miranda interrogation Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3495.018,3496.486,-- pre-Miranda in terms of --
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3496.486,3499.733,"Oregon v. Hass, I believe Your Honor was a post-Miranda."
1978.77-1388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3499.733,3506.08,Miranda was on the books for three or four years before Harris was decided.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3506.08,3507.038,"I am sorry Your Honor, I didn’t understand."
1978.77-1388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3507.038,3510.094,Miranda was on the books three or four years before Harris was decided.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3510.094,3518.181,"Yes, but I think that it took that time for the litigation to reach this court, I believe that was a pre-Miranda case, but the Oregon v. Hass situation was a post-Miranda."
1978.77-1388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3549.123,3552.523,Even if you are voluntarily bouncing off the walls?
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3552.523,3560.58,"I would say Your Honor please that if a person was voluntarily bouncing off the walls, the previous case here this morning may have some applicability."
1978.77-1388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3577.581,3580.038,Conduct beyond his own control.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3580.038,3581.854,That’s correct.
1978.77-1388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3599.915,3600.89,You can finish your sentence.
1978.77-1388,1,39033,robert_s_cohen,,3600.89,3601.988,Thank you Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3627.383,3627.757,Thank you.
1978.77-1388,2,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,3629.442,3630.815,Yes very briefly Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3703.805,3711.831,"I suppose that you prevail that goes back and it could then rest it on the state constitution, couldn't they, and then reinstate their judgment."
1978.77-1388,2,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,3711.831,3718.615,"In the future, and in other case, they could rest it on state constitution but I think this case is before this court now on the basis of this decision --"
1978.77-1388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3718.615,3724.469,I don’t know I say if you prevail here and this reverse and it goes back.
1978.77-1388,2,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,3735.034,3736.618,There is a possibility Your Honor.
1978.77-1388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3736.618,3737.532,It’s not a possibility.
1978.77-1388,2,18074,barbara_a_h_smith,,3737.532,3744.663,"They could do that, they could do but they have given no indication that they are inclined to do so."
1978.77-1388,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3762.323,3763.028,Thank you counsel.
