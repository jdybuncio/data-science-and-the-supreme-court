1976.75-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,56.932,"We’ll hear arguments next in 75-1453, Wooley against Maynard."
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,67.719,72.238,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,246.662,254.365,"If you had kept it just seen at New Hampshire, you would have avoided this litigation, wouldn’t you?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,254.365,257.565,I’m not so sure Justice Rehnquist.
1976.75-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,271.14,278.474,You might also have some copyright problems with the words of Patrick Henry on Virginia on --
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,278.474,281.443,I’m not sure [Laughter].
1976.75-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,281.443,291.663,"General Johnson, why did it take the General Court 160 and some years to arrive at this conclusion?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,298.093,310.049,"[Laughter] We adapted in New Hampshire a State song, a State seal, a State flower and a State tree as well as a State motto in accordance with the format of most states."
1976.75-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,332.406,339.86,Does your case depend upon this having been declared the motto of the State officially by the legislature?
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,339.86,365.936,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that it does have some bearing because by the legislatures having so declared this to be the official State motto, the legislature has in effect said that the motto is of importance to the State of New Hampshire, which brings me to the interests of the State of New Hampshire in having the motto on its license plates."
1976.75-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.814,378.005,"General Johnson, could I interrupt before you get to the State interest?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,390.16,391.864,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1976.75-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,391.864,396.931,You challenge that it is clearly erroneous and you ask us to set this aside to you?
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,396.931,398.23,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1976.75-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,398.23,400.7,Did you write that in your brief?
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,400.7,426.201,"We, in our brief questioned the sincerity of the appellees and you will find in the transcript of the hearing evidence that Mr. Maynard, while he purports to be a Jehovah’s Witness has been dis-fellowshipped from the Jehovah ’s Witnesses And in fact, one of the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ churches had at one time one or more criminal prosecutions against him."
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,434.184,437.588,"On a sincerity, he went jailed, didn’t he?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,437.588,438.491,That is correct.
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,438.491,446.299,"Well, do you -- usually, non-sincere people, they go up to closing of the door but they usually change, don’t they?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,446.299,449.837,"Well, the matter of sincerity, I think is two-barreled."
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,474.402,477.985,That’s a different question.(Inaudible)
1976.75-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,477.985,478.858,I would think so.
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,495.853,497.498,There is evidence both ways.
1976.75-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,498.683,501.472,"Well, if you concede that, don’t we have to accept the finding?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,501.472,506.606,I do not concede the matter of sincerity.
1976.75-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,538.027,551.49,"As Justice Marshall suggested in one of his questions, do people ordinarily go along and spend five days at a time in jail just to pamper a whimsy?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,568.99,578.782,"No, I don’t believe and I don’t want to make this particular issue greater than it is necessary to the appellant’s case."
1976.75-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,601.422,625.556,"Do you think the State of New Hampshire could require citizens to carry signs, picket signs, to support the United Nations in a sincere belief by the legislature of the State that it was very important to support the efforts and work of the United Nations?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,625.556,628.214,My answer to that is no and for a variety of reasons.
1976.75-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,664.156,676.528,"Could the State just as well offer its citizens, its automobile owners, an option, but if they did not want that motto on the license, they could be omitted?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,676.528,690.628,"This matter was raised at the District Court and the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles testified in effect that it would raise havoc with the printing of the motor vehicle registration plates, which is one of the --"
1976.75-1453,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,690.628,693.288,"Where are these plates made, in the State prisons?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,693.288,695.21,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1976.75-1453,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,695.21,697.57,"Kind of an IRA, isn’t it?[Laughter]"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,697.57,701.427,It is.[Laughter]
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,721.797,727.704,"Do you mean that if we rule in favor of the appellees, then everybody would take it over and (Inaudible)?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,727.704,730.49,"This is another matter, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,730.49,733.797,"If everybody’s in favor of getting rid of it, you ought to get rid of it."
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,733.797,743.336,This is not a burning issue within the State of New Hampshire and this is one of the basis on which I would distinguish this case from the flag cases.
1976.75-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,757.093,758.599,I was speaking all alone there.
1976.75-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.401,768.988,"And it was burning enough for you to appeal, I think, wasn’t it?(Inaudible)"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,768.988,777.816,I believe that that was at the University of Pennsylvania in which you drew the distinction between the strong dissent of the 1960’s and the World Peace of Today.
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,797.296,803.235,Then I understand that the Attorney General’s offer doesn’t have anything else to do that’s why they brought it up here?
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,803.235,805.852,We have sufficient work in New Hampshire --
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,805.852,808.846,"Well, is it important in the State of New Hampshire or not?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,808.846,813.223,"It is very important, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,813.223,815.329,But it’s not a burning issue?
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,815.329,821.497,"It’s not a burning issue from the standpoint that when one goes to New Hampshire, one sees the motto taped over."
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,840.913,846.895,"Since you speak as an individual, the first time I noticed the motto was after this case was filed."
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,855.98,858.428,"Well, most people in New Hampshire don’t either."
1976.75-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,886.123,901.634,"Well, what if the legislature had required them to take a choice or to put on the license plate on van or bussing, do you regard that as somewhat controversial, wouldn’t you?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,901.634,902.191,Certainly.
1976.75-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,902.191,906.97,"Suppose on the other hand, it was -- bussing is beautiful."
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,909.354,914.416,There certainly would be people who would be here before this Court holding that it was controversial.
1976.75-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,914.83,928.683,What difference does it make if the particular person finds that obnoxious and objectionable or whether it’s approved by a majority and disapproved by only a small minority?
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,928.683,943.816,"Well, I think then, we get down to a balancing issue, balancing the interest of the State versus the eccentric feelings of a very small minority."
1976.75-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,943.816,953.71,Do you think it’s likely that either the hypotheticals put to you by the Chief Justice would be adopted by the New Hampshire legislature of the State motto or --
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,953.71,957.589,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,962.266,969.652,"Mr. Attorney General, a minute ago, you said that it would be very troublesome to issue license plates without the sign."
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,980.787,981.401,Our motor vehicle registration --
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,981.401,983.668,Doesn’t that stand special?
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,983.668,987.176,Each plate has its own numbers and each plate has its own letters.
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,987.176,999.13,"What I mean, they go from 1 to 9000, that’s a machine job, but the letters “ER” is not a machine job?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,999.13,999.207,I believe --
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,999.207,1001.704,And no computer runs on ER?
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1001.704,1012.198,"In a sense -- I believe that it does because the letters in New Hampshire stand generally for our nine counties, and so the counties do have significance."
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1012.198,1015.634,"Well, this didn't have any numbers behind it, it just had letters."
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1015.634,1019.438,"Well then, that is what is called in New Hampshire a Vanity Plate."
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1019.438,1019.759,Yes.
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1019.759,1020.388,And that --
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1020.388,1027.165,"Well, couldn't you make a vanity plate for this man, if he’d pay for it and leave --"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1027.165,1031.201,"Unfortunately, all vanity plates in New Hampshire have the State motto on it, but your question is, could we --"
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1031.201,1033.925,"Yes, but couldn’t you make a vanity plate without the motto?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1033.925,1044.363,"Well then, we come to the issue of whether the State of New Hampshire is obligated to do so, the legislature having authorized the motto to appear on all passenger vehicles."
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1044.363,1049.42,All I’m saying is it wouldn’t be any harder than just set the vanity plates.
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1053.129,1068.341,"The State has conceded, Mr. Justice Marshall, in its brief that the State of New Hampshire can undertake a workable system of motor vehicle registration without having the motto on its plates."
1976.75-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1120.978,1125.869,"General Johnson, just to give you a question somewhat like the one that the Chief Justice asked."
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1143.28,1150.762,I think that it would be a closer issue.
1976.75-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.781,1166.825,"Well, I suppose, if one was a Christian scientist and didn’t believe in death, it might have (Voice Overlap)."
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1166.825,1174.179,That is correct and I would point out that almost every State in the union has mottos or slogans on its license plates and --
1976.75-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.179,1180.876,Are there any other states that have mottos that profess the belief in death?
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1187.261,1190.763,"With respect to the first portion of your question, no."
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1210.48,1214.463,"Well, what if you do it like we do it in Virginia?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1221.112,1221.867,[Laughters]
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1221.867,1223.265,"But, they didn’t put it on the license plate?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1223.265,1224.733,"Well, this --"
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1224.733,1226.792,You could buy the sticker and say what you want.
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1226.792,1228.16,This is exactly another fundamental case.
1976.75-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1228.16,1231.872,"And in that case, the appellee here wouldn’t have any trouble, would he?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1231.872,1259.742,"Well, the appellate herein is a printer by trade and one of the arguments of the State of New Hampshire herein is that the statute under which he is being prosecuted does not penalize him for any disparagement of the motto of the State of New Hampshire other than a physical act upon a license plate which is in a sense still a property of the State of New Hampshire."
1976.75-1453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1312.52,1315.86,What about the New Jersey license “The Garden State”?
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1320.716,1327.049,I certainly would be hesitant having driven through New Jersey with all due respect to New Jersey.
1976.75-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1374.018,1378.57,"The flags and the flag burning cases were all the property of the person who burned them, were they not?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1378.57,1380.673,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1976.75-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1380.673,1384.938,"General Johnson, there are some New Hampshire plates that don’t carry the motto, aren’t there?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1384.938,1385.623,There are.
1976.75-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1385.623,1388.309,And what is the explanation for that?
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1388.309,1390.364,By supplementary statement in --
1976.75-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1390.364,1394.864,There are sets (Voice Overlap) exhibit eight on the page 66 of the record.
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1394.864,1395.417,That is correct.
1976.75-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1395.417,1400.867,Is it because they have to designate commercial or tractor or junk or whatever it is they want?
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1400.867,1416.08,"There are general rules, motor vehicle regulations relating to different types of vehicles, and that is one of the basic reasons why some plates are designated commercial or some plates are designated tractor."
1976.75-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1424.969,1428.412,"Yes, but a commercial vehicle, a big truck van might go to California?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1428.412,1435.32,"That is correct, but it’s designated as commercial and has to pay highway usage taxes and so forth which a passenger vehicle does not."
1976.75-1453,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1446.352,1452.298,"Mr. Johnson, you’ve devoted your argument up to this time to the constitutional issue."
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1457.573,1460.173,"Thank you, Mr. Justice Powell."
1976.75-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1580.896,1581.319,You would have to --
1976.75-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1581.319,1587.984,"Jurisdictional issue, are not the husband and the wife here in somewhat different positions?"
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1600.865,1602.417,The wife has never been prosecuted.
1976.75-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1603.876,1612.947,Would it not be reasonable for her to assume that she may be subject to the same kind of prosecution as her husband?
1976.75-1453,0,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,1612.947,1631.639,"I would submit that under Doran versus Salem Inn, Inc., and under Ellis versus Dyson that there is no controversy pending and that the parties are so closely related that they should be treated as one entity."
1976.75-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1636.858,1640.341,Very well.
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1641.876,1645.17,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.558,1683.662,"Although the latest proceeding hadn’t terminated yet, had it?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1683.662,1686.79,"That’s correct, Your Honor and I should say --"
1976.75-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.79,1689.919,Was the suit to aimed that latest proceeding or not?
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1689.919,1690.517,"No, sir."
1976.75-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.786,1706.08,And that still stands now?
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1706.08,1706.584,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.99,1720.768,So your assertion is that this suit was wholly prospective.
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1728.335,1730.576,"That’s absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1730.576,1735.367,It certainly didn’t purport to try to enjoin any State proceeding?
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1735.367,1738.88,"No, only we asked for prospect of injunctive relief."
1976.75-1453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.88,1740.412,"Yes, but is there’s a joint injunctive relief?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1740.412,1743.501,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1743.501,1755.195,Why was this a case of controversy in the Federal Court under the -- what was under companion case of Younger from the Seventh Circuit?
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1755.195,1756.431,"Samuels v. Mackell, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1756.431,1759.629,"Yes, Samuels against Mackell."
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1759.629,1771.686,"Well, Samuels v. Mackell, Your Honor, was a case where the Federal plaintiffs were seeking a declaratory judgment that the statute was unconstitutional at the same time that there was an ongoing State prosecution."
1976.75-1453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1771.686,1774.96,I’m thinking of the case where there was no prosecution ongoing?
1976.75-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1774.96,1776.05,Boyle against Landry.
1976.75-1453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1776.05,1778.651,"Boyle against Landry, was that it?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1778.651,1779.833,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1779.893,1780.412,(Voice Overlap)
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1780.412,1781.529,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1823.877,1825.423,"You alleged that in your complaint, didn’t you?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1825.423,1825.863,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1827.254,1835.95,"Mr. Kohn, in Dyson, there was an attempt in the prayer as I recall to expunge a prior conviction?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1835.95,1836.669,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1453,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1836.669,1838.121,You didn’t seek that relief in this case?
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1838.121,1839.569,"No, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1905.172,1908.366,"But, why didn’t you take the first case out?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1908.366,1912.144,"Well, Your Honor, I did not represent Mr. Maynard in the State Court proceedings since he had a lawyer."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1912.144,1915.893,But why didn’t Maynard take it out?
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1915.893,1919.404,"After his first conviction on December 6, the sentence was suspended."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1942.903,1944.693,"No, he did not intend to pay it."
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1944.693,1953.464,"That’s correct, Your Honor, and at that point, the Judge returned and sentenced him to 15 days in prison and he was immediately taken to jail, so even if --"
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1953.464,1955.338,Couldn’t he appeal that?
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1955.338,1966.897,"Your Honor, under New Hampshire law, notice of an appeal to the Superior Court for trial de novo must be filed at the time sentence is declared."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1978.415,1982.128,"Well, the answer is they could have gone through all of the Courts --"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1982.128,1983.948,"He didn’t have a lawyer -- he could’ve, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1985.779,1987.912,"Well, because he couldn’t afford a lawyer with two automobiles?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1987.912,1993.89,"Well, Mr. Maynard told the Judge that he wanted to represent himself."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1997.523,2007.324,"Well, he still had them all available to him and eventually, when he decided to abandon the New Hampshire Courts, he found a lawyer to get him into the Federal Court."
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2007.324,2009.258,"I don’t think that’s accurate at all, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2019.126,2022.579,What’s that got to do with this case?
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2026.584,2028.587,"Well, he had made attempts to contact the Civil Liberty Union (Voice Overlap)"
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2028.587,2031.745,"Well, I couldn’t see how we could take all of these into effect."
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2046.365,2051.19,"I think that I would agree with, Your Honor, that once I was retained, we chose the Federal Courts as our forum."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2051.19,2056.032,I don’t care on anything about you being retained.
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2058.199,2066.37,"Well, there’s nothing in the record that suggest that Mr. Maynard with his ninth grade education would’ve known how to take an appeal up through the New Hampshire State Court."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2066.37,2074.206,There is something in the record that the Judge did advise him and that statutes do provide for it.
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2074.206,2074.909,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2074.909,2081.606,"So, he had available to him a direct appeal in the machinery of the State."
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2081.606,2084.437,"Well, that may be true."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2084.474,2085.378,Maybe?
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2086.94,2090.132,The statutes that were on the books that there was an appeal mechanism.
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2090.132,2092.219,And the Judge advised it?
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2092.219,2092.873,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2092.873,2096.953,"Now, what else was the State require to do?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2096.953,2104.268,"Well, Your Honor, for one thing, taking his appeal up through the State Courts would not have solved Mr. Maynard’s problem."
1976.75-1453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2131.215,2132.943,Was there also a transfer proceeding in New Hampshire?
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2132.943,2133.306,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2134.113,2137.714,And the Supreme Court of New Hampshire said the statute was unconstitutional.
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2140.901,2144.507,"That’s correct, Your Honor, but that would’ve been after a substantial period of time."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2176.469,2179.085,"When you say nonsense, what were you talking about?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2179.085,2182.155,That these repeated arrests of Mr. Maynard for taping over his license plate.
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2182.155,2185.208,"Well, how about his repeated violation of the law?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2185.208,2186.267,"Yes, that’s correct."
1976.75-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2186.267,2188.061,"Well, that could be nonsense too, couldn’t it?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2188.061,2188.772,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2203.483,2205.195,To determine a constitutional issue?
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2205.195,2206.52,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2227.808,2228.481,Mr. Kohn.
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2228.481,2229.107,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1453,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2229.107,2247.715,"The Attorney General’s brief states that the constitutional issue was raised at the initial trial and was resolved in favor of the validity of the statute against this appellant, is that correct?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2247.715,2253.07,"I believe it’s incorrect, Your Honor, and the Three-judge Court said that it was incorrect."
1976.75-1453,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2253.07,2256.617,"If it were correct, would you be out in Court here?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2256.617,2258.036,"Not on Younger principles, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2258.514,2260.101,Then on res judicata --
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2260.101,2264.256,Res judicata which is what I think the State is really arguing in this case.
1976.75-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2277.458,2283.542,"What if the State doesn’t raise them, but the District Court nonetheless passes on it as the District Court did here?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2283.542,2288.505,"Well, the rules provide that -- first of all, Your Honor, the District Court did not pass on them."
1976.75-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2289.647,2291.986,I would have read its opinion to pass on it.
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2291.986,2304.799,"I read its opinion as being strictly over the dictum that if the State had raised that argument, they would’ve rejected it, but I think that the burden is on the State or the defending party to raise its affirmative defenses in conformity to the Federal rules."
1976.75-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2305.122,2320.984,"But we have lots of cases that under our rules, you must have raised a point, at the earliest possible point in State proceedings, but nonetheless, we’ve also held that if a State’s Supreme Court passes on the point even though it didn’t have to then the issue is open for --"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2320.984,2322.249,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.271,2350.877,I’m a little puzzled about the res judicata argument because I don’t understand you to be attacking the judgments or any of those judgments that have been entering?
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2350.877,2351.762,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.328,2358.041,They didn’t waive it.
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2359.511,2360.884,That’s correct.
1976.75-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2368.436,2371.1,"Well, does collateral estoppel apply to issues of law?"
1976.75-1453,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2371.1,2374.416,"Well, I have assumed that in my brief, Your Honor."
1976.75-1453,2,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,3344.239,3349.306,Very briefly Mr. Chief Justice and Justices.
1976.75-1453,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3450.623,3454.017,"Usually, we don’t put stamps on letter.[Laughter]"
1976.75-1453,2,39605,robert_v_johnson_ii,,3454.017,3471.21,"But if your secretary, Mr. Justice Marshall placed such a stamp on a letter, I don’t think that if I were to receive the letter, I would necessarily believe that you believed in that particular motto merely because it was upon your letter."
1976.75-1453,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3540.363,3541.072,Thank you gentlemen.
