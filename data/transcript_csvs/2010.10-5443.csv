2010.10-5443,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.987,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-5443, Fowler v. United States."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,9.356,13.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-5443,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,47.813,48.829,Are they all consistent?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,48.829,55.633,"--It would be our opinion they are all inconsistent, which is what we need from this Court, Your Honor."
2010.10-5443,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,68.81,71.06,"Mr. Crawford, what's your standard?"
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,77.333,89.89,"--Justice Kagan, we would offer the standard of realistic likelihood, which we cited in our brief on page 17 and page 41, as the appropriate standard in this particular case."
2010.10-5443,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,140.337,144.524,The statute speaks of the intent of the defendant.
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,174.126,191.588,--We believe that subsection (g) of the statute precludes the -- or takes the mens rea element of the defendant off the table with respect to whether or not the person is a law enforcement official or whether or not there's an ongoing Federal criminal investigation.
2010.10-5443,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,209.134,225.493,"Going -- going back to Justice Alito's question: Obviously, the statute's not written to say the intent to preclude a witness from talking to law enforcement officials."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,269.336,279.461,We believe that you define or would find -- determine the defendant's intent based on the circumstances and the totality of the circumstances of the case.
2010.10-5443,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,279.461,281.58,Articulate what the intent has to be.
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,281.58,289.234,The intent would have to be a realistic likelihood that there's going to be communication.
2010.10-5443,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,289.234,291.186,Does the defendant have to know that?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,305.861,306.378,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-5443,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,310.363,311.765,What do you say that is--
2010.10-5443,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.765,314.598,What does that have to do with reasonable likelihood that it would occur?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,318.269,319.035,The--
2010.10-5443,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,319.035,326.339,"--The reasonable likelihood that this person who was killed -- now, you say ""realistic likelihood""."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,326.339,326.941,--That is correct.
2010.10-5443,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,326.941,343.967,"--The realistic likelihood that this person who was killed might have gone to a Federal officer doesn't at all establish that the intent of the person who killed him was to prevent him from going to that officer, does it?"
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,343.967,346.236,We--
2010.10-5443,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,346.236,350.639,"I mean, it seems to me you have to stand on one stool or the other one."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,361.512,362.112,--Well--
2010.10-5443,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,362.112,362.53,Which is it?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,362.53,368.684,--It is our position that we are trying to determine or the jury has to determine a future act.
2010.10-5443,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.514,391.966,"No, no, that -- that's not what the statute says."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,404.274,406.107,"--Well, Your Honor, we believe--"
2010.10-5443,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.107,412.88,"If that's what it said, your -- your realistic likelihood test would be quite reasonable, but it doesn't say that."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,418.784,427.557,"--The intent to prevent the communication, the communication in the future is what is modified by the word ""prevent""."
2010.10-5443,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,433.626,442.232,"Mr. Crawford, do you think this is right, that the statute says that the person has to prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer?"
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,461.544,462.611,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.10-5443,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,462.611,471.234,"And -- and in doing that -- I mean, I guess my question to you is the same as my question to the Government, which is where any of these standards come from."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,485.576,499.069,"We would urge the Court to pick a particular standard, if you're going to, to help us interpret this statute that would strike the appropriate balance between State and Federal criminal jurisdiction."
2010.10-5443,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,499.069,502.438,"Well, why don't we pick the standard that is set out in the text of the statute?"
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,548.25,557.857,"We believe the jury would make that determination as to whether or not it was likely, realistically likely that mom would report him to Federal law enforcement officials."
2010.10-5443,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,563.178,567.547,"I don't -- I think Justice Alito can protect his own question, but I don't think you've answered it."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,581.557,585.342,--The result of the question of intent?
2010.10-5443,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,587.711,591.513,The reliability under the statute under Justice Alito's hypothetical.
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,591.513,599.851,"--Then we would say, yes, that the defendant could be found to have violated the statute under that particular hypothetical."
2010.10-5443,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,599.851,600.151,All right.
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,619.598,627.252,"Well, then, I would go with the beyond a reasonable doubt that the government must prove in any criminal matter."
2010.10-5443,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,627.252,628.871,That's what I wondered.
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,675.351,675.818,We would agree.
2010.10-5443,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,676.251,681.172,"You didn't argue it, so nobody's ever adopted this, so I feel I might be barking up the wrong tree."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,694.813,695.846,"--Well, we understand."
2010.10-5443,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.906,715.559,You think a realistic likelihood must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,715.559,716.859,We do.
2010.10-5443,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,716.859,721.98,You think a juror can grasp all of that in a juror's mind?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,723.496,723.763,"I do, Your Honor."
2010.10-5443,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,724.165,726.982,--that there is a realistic likelihood beyond a reasonable doubt?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,726.982,731.919,"--We believe that given the proper instructions and definitions of the word ""realistic likelihood""--"
2010.10-5443,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,731.919,737.306,Suppose the -- suppose the prosecutor argued a realistic prospect there.
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,770.544,773.496,"--Well, I would answer that two ways, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.10-5443,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,793.058,796.444,Was -- what was the time sequence?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,802.681,814.989,"Officer Horner was found dead on March of 1998, and he came forward to the local police in 2002 after he was sentenced to 20 years on an unrelated State robbery."
2010.10-5443,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,824.595,826.547,--Several years after 2002?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,826.547,831.166,2002 is when he came forward and began talking to law enforcement.
2010.10-5443,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,831.166,835.284,When did they go to the Federal authorities after 2002?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,835.284,835.901,I'm sorry?
2010.10-5443,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,835.901,840.104,When did they go to the Federal authorities after 2002?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,840.104,841.287,2003.
2010.10-5443,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,846.425,855.964,What is -- what is your position on the subsequent element or -- or feature about relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,865.053,866.087,"No, Your Honor, they do not."
2010.10-5443,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,871.974,872.909,Why is that?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,878.98,879.647,--Correct.
2010.10-5443,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,879.647,888.085,"I would have thought you'd say there's a negative implication that intent has to be shown with respect to everything else, including whether or not this is a possible Federal crime."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,888.085,896.441,"Well, we -- we are willing to concede that there was a possible Federal crime that was occurring at the time of Officer Horner's death."
2010.10-5443,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,896.441,898.774,Are you willing to concede that the defendant knew that?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,898.774,904.445,I'm willing to concede the defendant -- it need not be proved that the defendant knew that.
2010.10-5443,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,916.653,924.858,The issue -- the issue here is the sufficiency of the evidence.
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,972.106,994.938,"We believe, Your Honor, that if that is the reading of the statute, that that would basically federalize murder, that there is always going to be some overlapping Federal crime that is possible, or the possible commission of, and if that becomes the standard or the reading or the interpretation of 1512, then every case is going to be allowed to be prosecuted--"
2010.10-5443,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,994.938,1000.759,"I would think your answer would be that if that were the law, (a)(1)(C) would have omitted the word ""Federal""."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1000.759,1001.892,--I would agree.
2010.10-5443,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.892,1002.627,It would have said
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1015.018,1017.22,I -- I would agree with you.
2010.10-5443,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1022.672,1038.801,"No, because if there were -- if the only crimes that were being planned were State offenses, then there would be no chance that -- that the conveying of that information to a Federal law enforcement officer would send the person to jail."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1038.801,1040.451,"Well, the problem, Justice Alito--"
2010.10-5443,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1040.451,1042.836,They're planning -- they're planning to hold up a convenience store.
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1045.204,1046.739,--Well--
2010.10-5443,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1046.739,1049.941,"So, the person isn't going to go to jail on a Federal charge."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1049.941,1057.345,--I'm not so sure that holding up a convenience store would not qualify under the Hobbs Act or under some other Federal statute that a creative--
2010.10-5443,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1057.345,1061.916,"Well, are you saying that there is no possible offense that's only a violation of State law and Federal law?"
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1061.916,1062.432,--There are.
2010.10-5443,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1062.432,1063.365,All right.
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1063.365,1070.419,But there needs to be proof -- there needs to be proof more than just the mere presence of a potential Federal offense.
2010.10-5443,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1108.294,1118.602,"Mr. Crawford, what would happen if you were dealing with a Federal offense that was a distinctly Federal offense, that really didn't have a State counterpart, like hijacking an airplane?"
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1123.387,1141.765,"--It would be -- it would make the government's burden easier, because it is more likely than not, it is realistic likelihood that there's going to be Federal involvement, as Justice Scalia pointed out, on a case where it's a threat to kill the President or hijacking or income tax, Federal income tax."
2010.10-5443,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1141.765,1143.984,Is that actually similar to this case?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1150.538,1151.823,"Well, I would agree with that."
2010.10-5443,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1205.124,1208.426,"I have one last one, the plain error question."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1222.586,1230.423,"--Well, the trial lawyer did a poor job in articulating the reasons for the judgment of acquittal."
2010.10-5443,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1230.423,1232.775,I take it you were not the trial lawyer?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1232.775,1235.06,"Well, unfortunately, Judge, I was."
2010.10-5443,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1235.577,1235.994,"Oh, you were?"
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1239.446,1253.087,"--Did a poor job of articulating the judgment of -- the judgment at acquittal time, the reasons that the court should grant it and quite frankly did disservice to the district court judge, who we need to help out more."
2010.10-5443,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1254.456,1257.407,So we're really -- granted cert to give an advisory opinion?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1257.407,1257.957,--No.
2010.10-5443,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1257.957,1262.209,"Because if there's not plain error, how do we reverse this court below?"
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1262.209,1283.725,"Well, we believe that when the argument was made at the Eleventh Circuit, that whether the sufficiency of the evidence issue was raised there, and the Eleventh Circuit chose not to rule on that, but chose to rule on a statutory construction of 1512 -- that then, when this Court granted cert, that basically took that issue off the table."
2010.10-5443,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1283.725,1293.247,"So, what you're suggesting is that we announce the standard, hopefully different than the courts below for your sake, and then remand to then let the court apply the new standard?"
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1293.247,1294.381,That is one possibility.
2010.10-5443,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1294.897,1296.299,"And if it's not, what's the other?"
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1296.299,1303.786,"--The other is, is to overrule the Eleventh Circuit and with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal."
2010.10-5443,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1303.786,1307.84,How could we do that unless we found there was plain error?
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1313.577,1333.908,"I don't know at this particular point, but I do know that we have a problem in the circuits, that the standards being applied are across the board; and we need a bright line, hopefully a bright-line rule, that will help us in the courts below so we can do our job better."
2010.10-5443,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1333.908,1343.513,"I have to say to you that even if a bright-line rule is announced, the real work begins in deciding what evidence is sufficient to meet that burden."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1343.513,1360.058,"Understood, but it's our position that any of the rules that have been proposed, except maybe the mere possibility, which is overbroad, there still is nothing on this record that is going to show a Federal law enforcement involvement or communication to Federal law enforcement; and we're going to win at any point."
2010.10-5443,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1363.677,1367.795,"Anyway, you've made a fine argument here, even if you didn't make it--"
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1368.262,1368.612,"Thank you, sir."
2010.10-5443,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1370.331,1370.631,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-5443,0,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,1370.631,1371.264,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.10-5443,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1371.264,1372.699,Ms. Harrington.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1372.699,1379.853,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-5443,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1426.083,1429.802,"Well, where does that reasonable possibility standard come from, Ms. Harrington?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1429.802,1434.856,"Well, it comes from trying to construe all the different relevant provisions of the statute to make sense together."
2010.10-5443,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1460.555,1466.876,Let me give you a hypothetical similar to the one that I gave your -- your friend.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1509.871,1510.304,Yes.
2010.10-5443,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1550.314,1559.337,So a realistic probability relates only to the question of whether it would have been conveyed to a Federal officer as opposed to some other law enforcement officer?
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1559.337,1572.245,"Yes, that's right, and in section (g)(2) it's described as a circumstance that the Federal, that the officer in question is a Federal officer, and so that's -- that's a fact in the world that the jury needs to make a determination about."
2010.10-5443,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1573.514,1577.299,But suppose in Justice -- please continue.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1577.816,1578.182,--That's okay.
2010.10-5443,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1594.01,1594.41,What do you see--
2010.10-5443,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1594.41,1603.866,"Suppose in Justice Alito's hypothetical, two guys on the park bench, and they find out that the man with the gray coat behind them was listening."
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1609.687,1612.055,If they -- if they--
2010.10-5443,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1612.055,1613.722,It wasn't the man that was listening.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1614.924,1616.357,--But if -- if the same--
2010.10-5443,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1616.357,1617.793,The intent was there.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1617.793,1620.995,"--So they say, we have to shoot this guy to keep him from talking to the FBI?"
2010.10-5443,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1625.28,1633.735,But then your realistic possibility -- the realistic probability standard just falls out of your test.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1633.735,1641.055,"Well, just to be clear, the realistic possibility part only comes in where the defendant doesn't have a specific intent as to the Federal officer specifically."
2010.10-5443,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1667.372,1672.526,"Well, I think it's very difficult to instruct the jury, to say, now, sometimes there's realistic probability, sometimes there isn't."
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1675.228,1693.857,"Well, I think the jury instruction would say, you know, you need to make a determination about what could have happened if the murder hadn't occurred, and if you find that there is a reasonable possibility that there would have been a communication with the Federal officer -- and that can be proved in any number of different ways in any particular case -- then you find that there's a violation of the statute."
2010.10-5443,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1693.857,1695.257,Why do you -- why do you need that?
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1702.129,1702.812,Yes.
2010.10-5443,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1702.812,1711.901,So you're always talking about a murder that was intended to remove somebody who could incriminate the killer--
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1711.901,1712.401,Right.
2010.10-5443,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1712.401,1713.285,--for some other crime.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1754.395,1758.299,"Well, I think that's an interpretation of the statute the government could live with, but the effect of that--"
2010.10-5443,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.299,1760.232,"Oh, the government could more than live with it."
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1762.084,1763.87,--But that -- indeed.
2010.10-5443,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1776.51,1779.395,"No, but the statute reads it out of the statute."
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1790.437,1790.77,Right.
2010.10-5443,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.187,1795.322,Why isn't it enough that you -- you kill somebody to prevent the disclosure of a crime that's a Federal crime?
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1795.322,1803.995,"--I mean, Congress could have written the statute that way, but when Congress defined ""law enforcement officer"" to mean ""Federal law enforcement officer"", presumably, they meant that to mean something."
2010.10-5443,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1818.837,1827.026,"Isn't -- if you have a Federal -- underlying Federal offense, and I gather you don't think -- that just needs to be shown as a matter of fact, right?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1827.026,1827.393,Correct.
2010.10-5443,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1827.393,1828.376,No intent with respect to that.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1837.918,1838.351,I--
2010.10-5443,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1838.351,1839.034,It's a Federal offense.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1843.988,1848.457,--Except that not all crimes that could be prosecuted as Federal crimes are prosecuted as Federal crimes.
2010.10-5443,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1854.86,1855.962,"No, obviously not all of them."
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1855.962,1856.779,--Not all of them.
2010.10-5443,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1857.412,1868.27,"So you think that -- that it's not an element of the crime, but that feature of the prosecution depends upon what percentage of the crimes are prosecuted Federally as opposed to by State law?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1868.27,1868.887,"--No, it doesn't."
2010.10-5443,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1892.719,1903.36,Can you instruct the jury that the underlying crime here is a Federal crime and then say the only thing they have to determine under some standard is whether or not the communication would be to a Federal officer?
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1903.36,1915.434,"You could -- you could give that instruction, but I -- I think -- I took the hypothetical from Justice Scalia to be that you wouldn't need to show that there's any -- any chance that the communication would have gone to a Federal officer."
2010.10-5443,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1932.546,1939.383,Let's say the case -- that this case arises -- exactly this case arises in two different adjacent jurisdictions.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1984.495,1985.912,"--I think it would, Justice Alito."
2010.10-5443,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1996.652,1999.338,I don't see what that has to do with the defendant's intent.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1999.338,2001.354,It doesn't have anything to do with the defendant's intent.
2010.10-5443,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2024.787,2025.453,"Okay, where do we get this--"
2010.10-5443,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2025.453,2028.321,Then you have to change your answer -- right?
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2031.623,2040.879,"--But in your hypothetical, which I think you borrowed from Justice Alito, there was a specific intent to prevent a communication with the FBI, and so there they have the Federal officer specific intent."
2010.10-5443,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.879,2043.331,"Isn't it rather strange, trials?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2061.126,2071.565,"But the reason it's weird is because the design of the defendant in killing the victim is to prevent something from happening, and then the jury is asked to make a -- make a determination of whether that thing might have happened or not."
2010.10-5443,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2098.049,2098.918,--I'm a little bit confused.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2117.312,2127.735,"--Well, I guess what we see -- where we see the -- sort of the ballpark is, either the government needs to prove that it's more likely than not that it would have happened, or they just need to prove that it's a reasonable possibility."
2010.10-5443,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2130.154,2133.056,Tell me what the difference in proof would look like.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2133.056,2137.626,"--The difference in proof -- I mean, it depends on the particular case."
2010.10-5443,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2145.03,2146.316,"""Likely"" is proven?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2146.316,2147.382,"--Easy to prove, yes."
2010.10-5443,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2147.382,2147.682,Okay.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2147.682,2156.271,"So the cases that are at issue are cases like this, where the murder happens almost contemporaneously with the Federal criminal activity."
2010.10-5443,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2169.162,2180.62,"Well, but you still had to prove, didn't you, or wouldn't you have a measure of obligation to have a witness get up on the stand and say, the FBI always looks at bank robberies?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2197.581,2197.914,Right.
2010.10-5443,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.438,2259.922,"Miss Harrington, we -- we've gotten along for over 200 years without this particular Federal law, and I, therefore, am not inclined to give it a -- a sweeping broad interpretation, and I think it's so weird to submit to the jury, you know, how likely is it that this dead person would have gone to a Federal law enforcement officer rather than a State law enforcement officer."
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2319.359,2332.619,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think it would be insufficiently protective of the Federal interests to say that you could only -- that you would look at what the defendant had in mind about what the chain of communication might be if he didn't murder the person who was witnessing the crime."
2010.10-5443,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.036,2377.498,"I suspect that what this mainly addressed is -- is killing of witnesses, which has become very common in some jurisdictions, witnesses in criminal trials, and you know darn well what trial is involved."
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2426.396,2432.569,"I mean, many of these things are not -- in many of these cases, this is not an element that's difficult to prove."
2010.10-5443,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2465.54,2484.251,"Ms. Harrington, what would be -- what would happen if instead of Officer Horner, the custodian of the cemetery had come across these people and the exact same thing had happened, would you then say that there would be -- that there would be a prosecution -- there could be a prosecution under this statute?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2484.251,2488.838,Not unless the custodian of the cemetery was on his cell phone saying I'm calling 911.
2010.10-5443,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2490.971,2493.94,"So is that the difference, that Officer Horner was on his cell phone?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2493.94,2500.361,"--Well, in terms of whether the evidence that was presented in this case was sufficient, it was sufficient because the jury knew two things."
2010.10-5443,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2528.445,2530.897,--I do have a question I would like to ask at some point.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2532.499,2532.849,Yes.
2010.10-5443,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2533.465,2536.2,Because this is very interesting.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2549.191,2549.558,Yes.
2010.10-5443,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2549.558,2552.043,And it's how they're used in ordinary English.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2616.919,2620.37,I guess in our view it's less important which words you pick--
2010.10-5443,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2620.37,2620.72,All right.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2620.72,2622.089,--Than it is what they mean.
2010.10-5443,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2626.274,2649.874,"They use realistic likelihood and if someone were to tell me in my odd example there is no realistic likelihood he would go to a Lithuanian movie, that seems to describe perfectly whether I would or would not say in trying to prevent him from going to the movies, you try to prevent him from going to a Lithuanian movie."
2010.10-5443,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2657.646,2661.264,"Understand this, you mean it would have been okay if he went to a Lithuanian movie?"
2010.10-5443,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2663.899,2677.143,"No, it wouldn't have been okay, but you don't normally say of a person when a thing is really weird, but he wants it to happen that doesn't do it for that -- it's so unlikely."
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2689.284,2689.651,--Right.
2010.10-5443,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2702.441,2703.876,It's not awkwardly constructed.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2721.422,2723.222,"--I would agree with that, so what we would like--"
2010.10-5443,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2723.222,2724.055,Then let's take their words.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2724.055,2728.659,"--Well, we -- again, it depends what it -- what you mean by realistic possibility or likelihood."
2010.10-5443,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2735.48,2740.3,--I'm not sure I understand your answer to Justice Kagan's hypothetical.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2799.088,2807.444,"Well, I mean, we -- we attach the word reasonably to possible to sort of to wall off cases that are theoretically possible, right?"
2010.10-5443,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2816.384,2831.559,"So I guess then your burden is only to show that it's a Federal offense, because why you need to show anything else because ""reasonably possible"" encompasses every single Federal offense or anything that could be termed a Federal offense."
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2831.559,2834.761,"With respect, Your Honor, we don't -- we don't think that's correct."
2010.10-5443,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2842.534,2847.653,"But why isn't that -- maybe I asked this already, but why isn't that the case when you're dealing with the Federal offense?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2847.653,2856.025,"--Because, the reality is that not information -- that all local law enforcement officers share every piece of information about Federal offenses with--"
2010.10-5443,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2856.025,2857.127,"Oh, but there's a possibility."
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2857.127,2858.561,"--There's a possibility, but I think--"
2010.10-5443,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2858.561,2859.294,A realistic possibility.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2859.294,2862.947,"--And again that's -- if that's how the Court wanted to go, that's something the government could live with."
2010.10-5443,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2863.33,2882.909,"Did you say before that -- that presenting this to the jury; everybody's worried about what the jury will think; that when Gamble came and confessed, the local official went to -- to the Federal?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2892.884,2899.554,"--Well, there's a 10-month lapse between when Gamble went to the local law enforcement officers and when Gamble testified before the Federal grand jury."
2010.10-5443,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2905.924,2910.095,Do you know what the difference was between the State and the Federal penalties?
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2910.095,2913.047,I don't know the difference.
2010.10-5443,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2933.275,2943.316,"So Ms. Harrington, suppose Officer Horner had come to the scene and instead of seeing evidence that there was a robbery about to occur, had seen evidence only of drug use."
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2953.588,2956.79,"No, we would say it is satisfied if everything else was the same."
2010.10-5443,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2956.79,2957.24,Because?
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2957.24,2973.519,"Because it -- it's still information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense, we still know that Officer Horner definitely would have transmitted that information to local law enforcement officers, and we still know that when local law enforcement officers later got the information, they would -- they transmitted it to Federal--"
2010.10-5443,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2973.519,2975.038,"Oh, but that's 4 years later."
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,2977.721,2978.156,--It's true.
2010.10-5443,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2995.784,3008.175,"You're saying the fact that they got this information 4 years later, shared it with law enforcement officers after they knew that a murder had occurred as a result of an incident would be the same kind of inquiry that they would make at that time?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,3008.175,3009.342,"--Well, I think--"
2010.10-5443,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3009.342,3009.825,Before the murder?
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,3009.825,3024.435,"--Well, of course, we don't know what would have happened, because Officer Horner was murdered to prevent any of this from happening, but in fact, the evidence before the jury suggested that it wasn't the murder that motivated them to share the information with Federal officers; it was one of the underlying robberies."
2010.10-5443,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3045.682,3077.403,"Would -- would you not acknowledge that the statute is vague enough that the intent which it requires could be either the intent to prevent testimony from being given to a particular Federal proceeding or to a particular Federal officer or the specific intent to withhold it from a proceeding or an officer who happens to be or which happens to be Federal, but which the defendant is not aware is Federal?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,3078.855,3086.859,"It could, but Justice Scalia, I want to point out that subsections (A) and (B) of (a)(1), those are the provisions that talk about official proceedings."
2010.10-5443,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3108.04,3126.252,"Oh, I acknowledge that, but a particular judge or -- or the conduct of a Federal proceeding, it could -- it could require specific intent of a proceeding or a judge or an officer which happens to be a Federal officer."
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,3126.252,3132.323,"It could, yes, and again, I think if the defendant has a Federal officer specific intent in mind when he commits the murder, that's enough."
2010.10-5443,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3132.323,3151.384,"So if a defendant has in mind a particular officer, then there's a potential violation of the statute, but if the defendant just kills for the purpose of preventing this from going to any Federal -- any officer who might happen to be a Federal officer, then there's no violation under this -- under this reading of the statute?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,3151.384,3153.669,"No, there is -- there is violation, if there's a reasonable possibility--"
2010.10-5443,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3153.669,3157.538,"Under the interpretation that's been suggested to you, that would be the distinction?"
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,3157.538,3163.442,--I'm not -- I don't mean to give that -- this is a case where there's not a specific Federal officer intent.
2010.10-5443,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3173.067,3174.0,I think the question was.
2010.10-5443,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3174.0,3177.769,It's unfair for him to ask you what my -- what my hypothetical was.
2010.10-5443,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,3179.137,3181.387,--Thank you.
2010.10-5443,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3181.387,3181.756,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-5443,2,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,3185.291,3213.025,"Justice Kagan, if I could go to a question that you posed: If this Court were to find that the mere presence of a possible Federal offense was appropriate to give Federal jurisdiction under this particular statute, then I would ask the Court to consider the effect that that would have on criminal practice throughout this country."
2010.10-5443,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3237.223,3239.175,What's delicate about robbery?
2010.10-5443,2,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,3248.697,3252.583,"Justice Ginsburg, we would agree that bank robbery is a Federal crime."
2010.10-5443,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3284.47,3287.322,I'm slightly regretting bringing up that.
2010.10-5443,2,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,3287.322,3294.559,"There have been a number of cases cited at the Circuit Court level that give examples of how the government can meet their proof, and quite frankly, it's not difficult."
2010.10-5443,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3304.415,3308.836,You agree basically on the point?
2010.10-5443,2,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,3308.836,3309.419,--I do.
2010.10-5443,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3309.419,3323.578,"I think where you have -- where somebody tries to prevent a general thing, we normally say you also prevent -- tries to prevent those things that are specific that fall within the general term, but not every oddball example."
2010.10-5443,2,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,3323.578,3324.011,Exactly.
2010.10-5443,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3324.011,3327.713,And what you want is something that rules out the oddball examples.
2010.10-5443,2,41104,stephen_m_crawford,,3352.347,3358.334,We would argue that there is -- the record is insufficient to establish reasonable likelihood of Federal involvement.
2010.10-5443,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3364.572,3364.905,"Thank you, counsel."
