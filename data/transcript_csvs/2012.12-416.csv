2012.12-416,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.337,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 12-416, the Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis."
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,9.522,11.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,48.481,55.135,"Why -- why are payments not to compete different from, let's say, dividing a market?"
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,75.298,79.0,"--I mean, there are really two differences between that -- that scenario and the one presented here."
2012.12-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,87.956,89.372,That -- that doesn't impress me.
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,92.324,100.911,--The second thing is that an exclusive license doesn't give the -- the infringement defendant anything that it couldn't hope to achieve by prevailing in the lawsuit.
2012.12-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,112.236,113.07,In order to make money.
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,116.022,116.755,--But the point of--
2012.12-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.755,120.824,"So instead of giving them a license to compete -- you know, we'll short-circuit the whole thing, here's the money."
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,121.374,127.913,--But the point here is that the money is being given as a substitute for earning profits in a competitive marketplace.
2012.12-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.43,196.307,"Mr. Stewart, do you have a case in which the patentee acting within the scope of the patent has nonetheless been held liable under the antitrust laws--"
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,196.307,197.441,Yes.
2012.12-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,197.441,200.109,--for something that it's done acting within the scope of the patent?
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,200.109,204.211,"Yes, if you adopt Respondent's conception of what it means to act within the scope of the patent."
2012.12-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,326.609,330.828,"Mr. Stewart, does this represent a change in the government's position?"
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,345.154,348.106,"Well, the FTC has consistently taken this position."
2012.12-416,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,393.551,399.639,And one way is to assess the validity or the strength of the infringement case?
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,399.639,401.574,"We would say that that's not a way, that--"
2012.12-416,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,401.574,408.728,"That's my concern, is your test is the same for a very weak patent as a very strong patent."
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,410.096,426.939,"--Well, the test is whether there has been a payment that would tend to skew the parties' choice of an entry date, that would tend to provide an incentive for the parties to -- for the generic to agree to an entry date later than the one that it would otherwise insist on."
2012.12-416,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,434.962,444.334,Why wouldn't that determination itself reflect the strength or weakness of the patent so that the market forces take that into account?
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,444.334,457.493,"--Well, I think in the kind of settlement that we would regard as legitimate, where the parties simply agree to a compromise date of generic entry, then the parties would certainly take into account their own assessment of what would likely happen at the end of the suit."
2012.12-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.413,495.416,"This -- this was not a problem, I gather, until the Hatch-Waxman amendments?"
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,495.416,503.189,--These suits -- these types of payments appear to be essentially unknown in other lawsuits and other patent infringement cases.
2012.12-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.189,509.843,"Yes, and so -- and so do suits against this kind of payment."
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,554.741,558.359,Congress has tried to reduce the incentives for these payments to be made.
2012.12-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.359,568.649,"So, why should we overturn understood antitrust laws just to -- just to patch up a mistake that Hatch-Waxman made?"
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,568.649,569.851,"Well, a couple things I would say."
2012.12-416,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,658.641,662.193,Is that the 18 -- the 18-month rule primarily?
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,662.193,666.728,It's a 180-day period of exclusivity.
2012.12-416,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,666.728,667.18,Right.
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,669.43,677.469,"Yes, and the way it works is that the exclusivity period is not good in and of itself for consumers."
2012.12-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,720.213,722.415,"Well, that doesn't mean that -- that's rather thin."
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,806.921,820.078,"Well, the -- the Court has recognized such a thing as the quick look approach, but I think even though the case didn't use the term “ quick look ”, I don't believe it did, NCAA v. Regents of University of Oklahoma is probably the best example, where the--"
2012.12-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,820.078,820.846,And are there others?
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,820.846,822.913,"--Well, that's the -- that's the one I'm most familiar with."
2012.12-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,822.913,824.132,Is there any other?
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,829.619,831.752,I'll need to look back and see what--
2012.12-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,831.752,851.449,"Well, if there are few or none, then I would say why isn't the government satisfied with an opinion of this Court that says, yes, there can be serious anticompetitive effects; yes, sometimes there are business justifications; so, Judge, keep that in mind."
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,870.261,873.446,--I think that would leave courts without guidance as to--
2012.12-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,873.446,874.148,It's got guidance.
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,874.148,877.35,--without guidance as to what factors would be appropriate--
2012.12-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,877.35,882.052,The same thing is appropriate as is appropriate in any antitrust case.
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,912.004,916.325,"--Well, certainly our proposed approach accounts for that."
2012.12-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,979.916,980.716,And they mention at least two others.
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1049.662,1053.297,--Let me say a couple of things about the administrative nightmare.
2012.12-416,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1230.275,1235.345,"Mr. Stewart, can we go back to Justice Breyer's question, initial question."
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1258.027,1261.412,"Not -- not price fixing, but it's -- it's an agreement not to compete."
2012.12-416,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1269.002,1270.285,But why is the rule of reason so bad?
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1307.241,1331.842,"--Now, if you wanted to tweak the theory in that way and to say that in cases where there is not just a payment and an agreement on the date of market entry, but there is additional consideration exchanged beside, if you wanted to say that the Plaintiff would bear the burden of showing that this was not a fair exchange for value, that -- that's not something we would agree with, but that would be a fairly minor tweak to our theory."
2012.12-416,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1331.842,1336.044,So answer the more fundamental question: Why is the rule of reason so bad?
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1336.044,1341.848,"The rule -- I mean, it's bad for reasons both of administrability and it's bad conceptually."
2012.12-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1359.325,1360.46,No.
2012.12-416,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1429.006,1448.05,"--It's not atypical -- I mean -- and the Court did this in NCAA, for example, where it said that the agreement it was looking at, which dealt with the allocation of -- of -- allocation of rights to televised football games -- was essentially a limitation on output, and the Court said those are presumptively unlawful."
2012.12-416,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1517.88,1518.847,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1525.3,1528.235,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1580.854,1582.156,Why isn't this then?
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1592.845,1594.88,--That's correct.
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1594.88,1606.271,So what you're arguing is that in fact a settlement of an infringement action is now creating that presumption.
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1606.271,1609.056,"No, Justice Sotomayor, I'm not arguing that."
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1626.768,1643.545,"I don't know, but I don't know why we would be required to accept that there has or would be infringement by the product that has voluntarily decided not to pursue its rights."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1643.545,1645.912,I think you're not -- you're not accepting infringement.
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1667.678,1670.464,"But there, you'd know that they're not sharing the profits."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1670.464,1671.397,--Yes.
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1671.397,1676.784,Meaning there you know that a -- a product's been licensed and the -- that's normal.
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1681.903,1683.855,"But Justice Sotomayor, many other--"
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1683.855,1687.973,"A reverse payment suggests something different, that they're sharing profits."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1690.608,1705.535,"--Many license -- I don't think that's correct, and that's because many license disputes are in fact resolved by the -- the alleged infringer exiting the market for a period of time, or agreeing to stay off until a certain time."
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1706.47,1708.22,But not many for reverse payments.
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1708.22,1720.461,"--Yes, they are, because -- because, for example, it could be a license agreement where the infringer agrees to stay off the market for X number of years, and when it comes on it pays a certain royalty."
2012.12-416,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1753.118,1753.718,Yes.
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1782.035,1789.957,"I -- I've obviously given a lot of thought to whether there is any kind of an intermediary test that works, and I don't believe there is."
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1835.855,1855.983,"Would it -- would it help if you were -- were thinking about rules and caps, to consider not what the branding company would have -- would have made, but what the generic company would have lost, and -- and use the latter as the limit?"
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1855.983,1861.47,"Well, you really don't know unless you can assume when they could have entered--"
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1861.47,1863.855,"Well, you -- you have to make an extrapolation, yes."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1863.855,1867.957,"--Well, because it all depends on what would have happened in the patent litigation."
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1882.484,1887.455,"Well, if the generic wins, though, its -- everybody's profits are lower."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1893.108,1903.749,"--They're -- they're lower than they would be under some other situation, but -- but the patent gave the patentholder the legal right to exclude."
2012.12-416,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1912.605,1916.39,"Mr. Weinberger, can I just understand what you're saying, and maybe do it through a hypothetical."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1916.39,1917.307,Certainly.
2012.12-416,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1917.307,1929.131,"Suppose you had a -- a lawsuit and the generic sends the brand name manufacturer an e-mail and the e-mail says, we have this lawsuit, I think I have about a 50 percent chance of winning."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1956.967,1961.103,"Well, what I'm saying is that in -- in any given situation--"
2012.12-416,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1961.103,1962.955,Is that fine?
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1962.955,1983.868,"--I -- I think that if the -- if it's a single situation and the evidence is that there's a reasonable basis to assert that patent and in truth, the patent has, which you say, has a 50/50 chance of prevailing, then I think that there could be a settlement like that, if it's in good faith."
2012.12-416,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1983.868,1986.403,Even though -- but what if it isn't in good faith?
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,1993.39,2004.948,"Any -- any situation in which there's any -- in any patent dispute in which there's a tradeoff, like the examples I mentioned before, time for value, could -- that argument could be made."
2012.12-416,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2029.897,2045.775,"Well, Mr. Weinberger, I think if we give you the rule that you're suggesting we give you, that is going to be the outcome, because this is going to be the incentive of both the generic and the brand name manufacturer in every single case is to split monopoly profits in this way to the detriment of all consumers."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2045.775,2046.975,"--Let me address that, Your Honor."
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2108.199,2111.467,Is that in all cases or just Hatch-Waxman cases?
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2111.467,2112.467,--It's Hatch-Waxman cases.
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2113.117,2114.836,Because it does skew the dynamics a lot.
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2114.836,2115.403,--Yes.
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2115.403,2138.118,"You know, the Second Circuit recognized, even though it accepted your scope of the patent, that there was a troubling dynamic in what you're arguing, which is that the less sound the patent, the more you're going to hurt consumers, because those are the cases where the payoff, the sharing of profits is the greatest inducement for the patentholder."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2138.118,2146.824,"The Second Circuit recognized that, but then they said further -- upon further reflection, further consideration of this, we are not troubled by it."
2012.12-416,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2169.506,2170.523,Okay.
2012.12-416,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2171.056,2182.397,"Well, I don't think that that's true, Mr. Weinberger, and it's because of something that Justice Scalia suggested, that there's a kind of glitch in Hatch-Waxman, and the glitch is that the 180 days goes to the first filer."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2189.217,2194.471,--That's clearly not correct either by logic or by reference to actual experience.
2012.12-416,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2202.311,2207.596,But the -- the huge percentage of the profits is done in the exclusivity period.
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2216.118,2233.596,"Experience doesn't show that, because if you look at Hatch-Waxman litigation, we've cited in -- in the red brief and it's been discussed by the antitrust economists and the Generic Pharmaceutical Association in their amicus brief, that many of these Hatch-Waxman cases involve multiple filers."
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2253.76,2256.211,What -- what do we look at to verify what you say?
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2257.778,2261.015,"Yes, it's in the -- in the Solvay brief and other briefs."
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2261.015,2274.74,"Because I had thought, as Justice Kagan's question might indicate, that the 180 days is crucial, it allows you to go to the doctors, to give them the name of your generic equivalent, et cetera, and that that's a big advantage."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2274.74,2275.54,It's a big advantage--
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2275.54,2277.142,"And now, you're -- now, you're indicating that it isn't."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2277.142,2278.392,--It's a big advantage.
2012.12-416,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.863,2283.496,--Okay.
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2372.704,2377.474,"Well, I think the first problem with it is that it's -- it's very unpredictable."
2012.12-416,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2386.596,2392.9,"You can't -- you can't possibly figure it out, can you, without assessing the strength of the patent?"
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2392.9,2393.769,That's right.
2012.12-416,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.769,2396.336,Isn't that crucial to -- to the conclusion?
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2396.336,2398.904,I -- I believe that the only thing that brought--
2012.12-416,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.904,2406.177,And to say you can consider every other factor other than the strength of the patent is -- is to leave -- leave out the -- the elephant in the room.
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2406.177,2408.446,"--I agree with that, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2425.67,2426.555,For whom?
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2462.711,2466.097,Let's say -- I wouldn't concede that most cases settle like that.
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2509.426,2522.249,"Well, in the normal course, if the patent's really strong, if you get a year or two earlier entry, that has an inherent value, and that's what you'll pay for is what the government is saying."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2531.205,2533.241,"--Well, first of all--"
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2533.241,2535.176,--for the very strong patentholder.
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2535.176,2538.461,"--First of all, parties often don't agree on the merits."
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2548.067,2552.453,"Well, they pointed to most settlements and say that is the vast majority."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2552.453,2555.405,I don't know where the evidence would be for that.
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2556.173,2565.528,"Well, we do know that these reverse payments, except for recent times when people figured out they were so valuable, were the exception, not the rule."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2565.528,2575.318,"--Actually, we have ten years of experience since the circuit courts first began applying scope-of-the-patent tests to these settlements since 2003."
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2578.753,2581.122,"They have been increasing in number, not decreasing."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2581.122,2582.99,"No, I think they have been actually very steady."
2012.12-416,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2617.997,2622.215,What about the consideration that seems to be driving the government?
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2651.568,2659.324,"Justice Ginsburg, first of all, every settlement agreement involving one of these cases must be filed with the FTC."
2012.12-416,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2664.526,2665.561,But it's just an economic--
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2665.561,2668.363,"Well, suppose -- suppose that hypothetical is correct."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2688.759,2699.715,"Yes, and I want to make clear that I don't think that could happen, because if a brand name company adopted that as a strategy to protect its patent, it would -- it would be held up."
2012.12-416,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2743.144,2758.571,"I thought the government was telling us that that's this case, that the -- what the generic is being offered in the way of sharing the monopoly profits is more than it could ever make if it wanted to and sold its drug."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2758.571,2763.392,"Well, I don't see any examples of that cited in their brief."
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2770.045,2781.286,"Well, but it's not hypothetical that if the generic wins everybody -- the brand companies profits are going to go way, way down right away and generic profits are not going to be that great."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2781.286,2782.703,Of course.
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2785.821,2790.142,"Well, but so then the question still holds."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2802.267,2805.484,There is that hypothetical risk.
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2828.5,2836.523,"Okay, I will grant you that point that the 180 days is not that big a difference, and that there are many generics out there."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2843.427,2845.211,It is true and that's why it doesn't happen.
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2888.555,2903.632,I see that as an argument that there is an economic reality in Hatch-Waxman that would require us not to apply any rule we choose or accept here to other situations; only here.
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2913.44,2916.992,"Justice Sotomayor, I think the economic reality cuts the other way."
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2923.429,2938.905,"Oh, but it does, because in Hatch-Waxman Congress decided that there was a benefit for generics entering without suffering a potential loss to enter the market more quickly."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2938.905,2941.59,"--Justice Sotomayor, I don't think the legislation--"
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2941.59,2949.029,And any settlement in these cases deprives consumers of the potential of having the benefit of an earlier entry.
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2949.029,2959.569,--I don't think there is anything in Hatch-Waxman that supports the idea that the purpose was to provide for generic entry prior to patent expiration.
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2963.021,2973.661,"Exactly, and what you are doing with permitting settlements of this kind is not permitting the process to go to conclusion."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2973.661,2987.921,--I don't think there is anything in Hatch-Waxman that suggests in any way that settlements or -- should be discouraged or that cases should be mandated to proceed to judgment or that all have to be litigated.
2012.12-416,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2987.921,2990.873,It's encouraging infringement suits.
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,2990.873,2995.76,It's encouraging challenges and it has produced many challenges.
2012.12-416,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3014.137,3030.664,"So why does it help you to say, if the Court says or the FTC says when you get one of these suits you can settle it by letting them in, but you can't pay them money, that that will help to stop strike suits."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,3037.718,3054.197,"Well, I actually think that you raise a point that the generic -- in some of the amicus briefs, some of the generic parties have talked about, which is that their ability to challenge these cases depends on their not having to litigate every one of them to conclusion."
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3100.678,3108.515,"I think it's correct that to develop a new drug sometimes you need not just scientists and attorneys, you need investment bankers."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,3117.889,3121.524,"This particular drug, I don't know."
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3130.947,3131.73,It can be a billion.
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,3131.73,3132.816,Easily a billion dollars.
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3132.816,3133.816,Anything in this case?
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,3133.816,3135.351,This particular drug--
2012.12-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3135.351,3136.218,Anything in the record?
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,3136.218,3142.172,"--No, because we are on a 12(b)(6) motion on a motion to dismiss, so none of that was ever developed, but--"
2012.12-416,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3142.172,3144.374,"--I'm sorry, go ahead."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,3144.374,3162.085,"--But I was just going to say that the -- of course, any given drug development cost doesn't even begin to tell the picture, because for every drug that succeeds, there are at least 10 that fail, and all the costs that are involved in the drugs that fail have to be covered with the one drug that succeeds."
2012.12-416,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3162.085,3165.703,Could I just make sure I understand the way the 180-day period worked?
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,3196.739,3197.758,Not completely.
2012.12-416,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3203.578,3209.732,"But if it's not waived by the parties, in other words, it's just like I don't get it so my incentives go down."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,3219.755,3228.528,"This was the exact problem that Congress addressed in 2003, when it amended Hatch-Waxman and changed the exclusivity requirements."
2012.12-416,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3301.492,3303.528,"Well, what was the change that was made?"
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,3303.528,3317.585,"--The change that was made, Justice Ginsburg, is that -- there were a number of changes, but the one that's relevant here is that if a -- if a subsequent filer -- strike that."
2012.12-416,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3329.909,3330.761,"Yes, certainly."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,3330.761,3334.73,"--And they just didn't do anything, that would prevent other generics from coming to market."
2012.12-416,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3350.64,3351.073,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,3351.073,3351.44,Thank you.
2012.12-416,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3351.44,3353.592,"Mr. Stewart, you have five minutes remaining."
2012.12-416,1,33681,jeffrey_i_weinberger,,3353.592,3355.377,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.12-416,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3355.377,3358.579,Thank you.
2012.12-416,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3459.778,3469.984,"Well, I thought that Mr. Weinberger's point was that this is always going to happen, because it's very easy -- as he said, you put a sign on your neck saying, generics line up to get your payment."
2012.12-416,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3478.823,3484.327,"I mean, first, there certainly is no evidence suggesting that it has happened often, although there is evidence that it has happened."
2012.12-416,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3522.952,3528.256,And what's your understanding of why there would not be a long line in some cases or in many cases?
2012.12-416,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3528.256,3555.006,"--I think for the reasons that -- that your question suggested, that there is the 180-day exclusivity period and leaving aside the cases in which that is waived, subsequent manufacturers would realize not only that they wouldn't get that period of heightened profits themselves, but they would have to wait in line for others, and they might focus their attention on other patents that were perceived to be weak as to which they could hope to -- to get the 180-day exclusivity contract."
2012.12-416,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3555.006,3564.112,"And is there anything to show what I think Justice Kennedy asked -- you know, how much of one's profits comes from the 180-day period as opposed to what happens after that?"
2012.12-416,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3564.112,3567.398,"I know it is the great majority, I don't have a percentage figure."
2012.12-416,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3657.14,3658.89,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
