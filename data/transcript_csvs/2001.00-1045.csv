2001.00-1045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,11.227,28.977,Mr. Nager.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,28.977,48.118,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the statute of limitations on a claim of improper disclosure under the Fair Credit Reporting Act does not commence until the plaintiff discovers her injury, as opposed to the... the date of the improper disclosure."
2001.00-1045,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,68.088,72.216,When did the injury occur here to the respondent?
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,72.216,83.355,"The... the injury for each alleged improper disclosure would have occurred on the date of the alleged improper disclosure, Justice O'Connor, although some of the damages--"
2001.00-1045,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,83.355,84.762,Disclosure to who?
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,87.561,93.961,"--Well, there were four allegedly improper disclosures at issue in this case."
2001.00-1045,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.789,108.227,--Disclosure to some third party.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,108.227,108.905,--To the third party.
2001.00-1045,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.584,115.424,And... and the person injured may never know about it.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,115.424,129.34,"They... they might not know about it, although the... the way these reporting systems work, if they ever actually apply for credit themselves and they're denied, they will automatically know about it, which of course is what happened to the respondent in this case."
2001.00-1045,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.473,133.241,But it... it's a 2-year statute of limitations.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,133.241,142.971,"--That's correct, and the statute expressly states that the action must be filed within 2 years of the date upon which liability arises."
2001.00-1045,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,142.971,149.804,Is this the type of statute that... that depends largely on private enforcement to implement it?
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,149.804,153.612,It does have private causes of action.
2001.00-1045,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.141,167.43,"But in general, I think you would look at this as one that envisions private enforcement."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,167.43,168.852,"--Absolutely, Justice O'Connor."
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,212.056,216.664,What about the argument that the plaintiff isn't harmed... the plaintiff may not be harmed by the disclosure?
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,226.16,229.255,"I don't think that's what the statute says, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,233.239,236.366,"Liability for what, if you're not damaged?"
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,236.366,245.296,"Well, in this case, the plaintiff sought injunctive relief, punitive damages, and actual damages, as well as, if they prevailed at trial, for attorney's fees."
2001.00-1045,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,245.296,249.463,Can you get nominative... a... nominal damages and punitive damages?
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,249.463,253.095,"Well, it's unclear under statute whether you can get nominal damages."
2001.00-1045,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,335.765,344.694,"Just out of curiosity, what... what are the statute of limitations applicable to State actions for, let's say, trade liable I suppose?"
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,351.591,353.294,I don't know--
2001.00-1045,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,353.294,354.196,How do the statutes run?
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,354.698,355.016,--I don't--
2001.00-1045,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.016,359.832,--normally run from... from the date of the liable or from the date that... that the person finds out about it?
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,359.832,371.187,"--At the time of enactment of this statute, the... the statutes of limitations of which I'm aware of at State law, ran from the date of the... of the disclosure, not from the date of discovery."
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,393.16,403.074,"We would have been sure about that if the language in the initial bill, which was the date of the occurrence of the violation... if that language had been used."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,413.284,421.922,"Well, I understand the... the point, Justice Ginsburg, but let me make the case for why that's not a correct conclusion to draw from the premise."
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.394,435.945,How do we know it means the same thing?
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,435.945,446.972,"--We know it means the same thing because every time this Court has had a case that has used the term arise, it has said that means the date upon which the event happens, not the date upon which someone discovers it later."
2001.00-1045,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,481.844,485.483,"Well, our previous cases haven't looked at when liability arises."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,485.483,486.266,You're absolutely right.
2001.00-1045,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,486.266,488.065,There's some other noun before the arise.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,488.065,491.574,The... the other cases that the Court have said cause of action arises.
2001.00-1045,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,491.574,493.3,Do you think anything turns on that?
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,493.3,493.947,"No, I don't."
2001.00-1045,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,528.38,529.586,Let... let me ask you.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,559.77,560.657,Yes.
2001.00-1045,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,560.657,571.907,"So, we can, I guess, then consider the case based on a supposed cause of action where there is negligence and there is injury."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,571.907,573.306,"Yes, Justice--"
2001.00-1045,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,573.306,576.617,"Even though in this case, I'm... I'm sure you would contest it."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,577.92,579.238,--That is correct.
2001.00-1045,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,660.376,664.04,But you're saying in that respect it's just like common law defamation.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,673.042,673.592,For purposes--
2001.00-1045,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,673.592,674.246,That's your only point there.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,674.246,675.404,--That is correct.
2001.00-1045,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,788.427,789.209,I don't understand.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,794.849,801.73,"--The underlying credit information is preserved, as long as it's not negative, forever."
2001.00-1045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,854.923,859.267,"Well, but if we affirmed the Ninth Circuit, you might change your policies, might you not?"
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,860.193,860.511,No.
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,886.878,890.477,How many other States have changed the way California has?
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,890.477,893.844,"--I don't know the answer to that question, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,911.343,925.115,"But one of the arguments you make, if I remember correctly, was the Ninth Circuit is... is a large area, so we... whatever they say is going to govern for the Nation because we can't keep our books one way for California and another way for someplace else."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,936.603,949.694,"Well, we would go... in response to the Chief Justice's question, as long as the Federal law or State law doesn't require us to keep the records any longer than the present 1-year requirement, we're not going to keep the records for any longer--"
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,949.694,956.927,"So, then this... this... whether it's a discovery rule or whether from the date of the violation doesn't matter, as far as your record keeping is--"
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,956.927,958.206,--As far as the record keeping.
2001.00-1045,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1001.432,1004.456,--But that's an argument that you really save those records; you shouldn't throw them away.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1004.456,1011.184,"--No, I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because no one disputes in this case what Congress contemplated in the record keeping requirements."
2001.00-1045,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1013.183,1020.336,"No, but I'm talking about your exposure to State cause of action where they have a discovery rule that your exposure runs beyond the 2 years."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1020.336,1021.006,--The... the--
2001.00-1045,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.006,1025.39,And it seems to me you would have an interest in keeping records that would disprove unmeritorious claims.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1025.39,1030.574,"--Well, the... the... I think the answer to that is... is no."
2001.00-1045,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1030.574,1032.701,Except that they would also prove meritorious claims.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1032.701,1033.923,That's... that's true.
2001.00-1045,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.923,1037.635,"Well, that's right, and the question is which... which is the greater number."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1038.744,1052.46,"And I think the... the... I can't tell you that I have actual empirical information, and my client would tell you that the number of inaccurate disclosures is de minimis relative to the number of accurate, proper disclosures."
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1087.329,1088.847,But the statute of limitations I thought was 2 years.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1088.847,1091.062,--The statute... yes because the--
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1091.062,1093.349,"So, that's more than 7 months or a year."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1093.349,1097.693,--It understandably gives the plaintiff some time to commence their lawsuit.
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1097.693,1107.703,"Even though you can say, we don't have the records after whatever is... the... the time periods... the statute of limitations is longer than the required record keeping."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1107.703,1108.669,That's correct.
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1108.669,1111.772,But there's nothing that prevents you from keeping the records.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1111.772,1114.099,Nothing other than lots of expense.
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1114.099,1119.123,"Do we... we do have a Federal agency in this picture, the FTC."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1124.096,1136.748,I... I think the answer is you plainly do not owe them deference in the Chevron sense because they don't have rulemaking power and they're not the only agency charged with that administration of this statute.
2001.00-1045,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1211.333,1222.808,"And... and the... at common law, as I recall, I think under California statute in defamation actions, the statute began to arise from the date of the statement, from the date of the defamation."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1222.808,1223.39,--That's correct.
2001.00-1045,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1223.39,1235.608,"And I assume that one rationale for that was because if the injured party doesn't discover the statement for... for 2 or 3 years, it's necessarily diminished and any remediation is minor."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1254.938,1257.265,I think that in some--
2001.00-1045,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1257.265,1258.167,I'm not sure I can say that.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1259.262,1264.118,"--With respect to just a pure improper disclosure, it may."
2001.00-1045,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1315.674,1326.26,"--But I take it what's implicit in your argument is that if they are not given notice that they have been denied credit within 2 years, chances are not very great that they're going to get that notice after 2 years."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1326.866,1327.184,"No, no."
2001.00-1045,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1329.151,1329.789,"--Well, I know."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1333.093,1333.443,"No, no."
2001.00-1045,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1381.582,1382.196,"Well, I know."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1393.831,1406.193,"--And they'll have a claim about that specific injury if the specific injury is in year 3 I was denied credit, because in order for that credit to be denied, there's going to be a new credit report that's requested."
2001.00-1045,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1447.638,1464.931,"What happens to a person, if you're right, who finds out 3 years... 3 years later she's denied credit, and the reason was because 3 years ago the company Sears got a report that had all kinds of incorrect information in it or whatever?"
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1466.892,1469.737,I'm not sure I--
2001.00-1045,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1469.737,1470.703,"Well, happens is--"
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1470.703,1471.301,--She finds... she finds--
2001.00-1045,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1471.301,1471.86,--Let's suppose--
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1471.86,1472.466,--When does she apply for credit?
2001.00-1045,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1472.944,1475.527,--She... in year 1 you do a credit report.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1496.081,1502.914,"--If she applies in year 8, she'd have a... a remedy for the credit that she was denied in year 8."
2001.00-1045,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1503.536,1504.71,She can sue who?
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1505.709,1512.597,--She could sue the... the credit reporting agency for inaccurately disclosing.
2001.00-1045,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1514.278,1519.253,The... your... your client deals with Sears in year 1.
2001.00-1045,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1519.253,1520.123,He didn't say there was a new report.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1520.123,1521.113,"Oh, I'm... I misunderstood."
2001.00-1045,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1522.175,1524.085,In year 1 and they never see Sears again.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1530.468,1536.044,"--In the absence of a willful misrepresentation, not... not under this statute."
2001.00-1045,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1536.044,1544.053,"It's unlikely, of course, that Sears is going to be using an 8-year-old report without asking again, and you'd probably give the same information again."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1544.053,1557.385,"It's almost inconceivable that they wouldn't ask again, and it's also probably slightly less inconceivable but still relatively inconceivable they would still have the records because it's in their interest and I'm sure they have the record retention policies to abandon them as well."
2001.00-1045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1568.293,1571.804,What... precisely what presumption is it you're talking about?
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1571.804,1572.394,"--I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1652.736,1658.56,"So, you're not asking us to say, no, there's no discovery rule."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1668.186,1689.712,"Our primary position in this case is that this statute, when you look at the term, liability arise, when... when the Court looks at the misrepresentation exception, when it looks at the definitions of liability in sections 616 and 617, the only reasonable construction of this statute is that the basic statute of limitations rule is the traditional complete cause of action."
2001.00-1045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1689.712,1695.441,But... but all that the Court must do to hold in your favor is to say you've got an express misrepresentation exception.
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1696.847,1697.581,That's correct.
2001.00-1045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.224,1819.047,"Thank you, Mr. Nager."
2001.00-1045,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1819.047,1820.013,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.00-1045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1820.013,1823.18,"Mr. Henderson, we'll hear from you."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,1823.18,1832.398,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Looking at the statute at issue, there are two parts to it."
2001.00-1045,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1840.975,1846.319,"I... it is quite correct for you to begin with the statute, but just a carryover of the very last point."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,1856.991,1864.344,"That... that is the rule that's been adopted by many circuit courts of appeal around the country, in Cada and in the Connors case."
2001.00-1045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1864.344,1866.056,Including the D.C. Circuit.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,1866.056,1866.717,That's correct.
2001.00-1045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1866.717,1867.059,Yes.
2001.00-1045,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1867.059,1869.21,"But it's certainly not the rule of this Court, is it?"
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,1869.21,1871.241,I don't know that it's the rule of this Court.
2001.00-1045,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1872.879,1875.302,"Well, it's not what we said in Holmberg."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,1878.798,1879.62,Holmberg--
2001.00-1045,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1879.62,1881.803,--than the Ninth Circuit gave it credit for.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,1881.803,1887.123,"--That's correct, and I... and I'm not here to defend the articulation of the judgment by the Ninth Circuit."
2001.00-1045,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1892.043,1895.586,"But I sidetracked you on the statute, and I think that is the right place to begin."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,1895.586,1896.593,Thank you.
2001.00-1045,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1922.435,1925.234,That to me is one of the hard parts of this case.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,1951.046,1986.465,"Well, Justice kennedy, I believe that when you consider the misrepresentation exception, what... what it is is it is a very additive provision that says that if there is an intervening misrepresentation by a credit reporting agency, during the running of a... of a normal limitations period, then there is complete renewal upon discovery of that intervening misrepresentation, not merely suspension, which is the normal Federal rule, as this Court has recognized, at least members of this Court have recognized, for example, in Jordan Chardon v. Soto in 1983 in the dissent."
2001.00-1045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2004.589,2006.932,Where does this statute say this during thing?
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2018.724,2020.075,--No.
2001.00-1045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2026.459,2026.969,Why don't we take a look at it?
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2028.88,2032.664,"It's shown on page 1 of the blue brief, for example."
2001.00-1045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.343,2043.992,--It does but still is an exception from the basic prohibition.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2043.992,2061.545,"It... it uses the word except, but it is clearly an additive provision that... and the odd thing about this is that the four courts of appeals that have misconstrued the statute in my view have looked at this and have said, that which is clearly additive should be read so as to subtract from the main provision in... in a substantial way."
2001.00-1045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2076.208,2085.708,"Well, the reason that I think I'm having such difficulty with it is because on your theory, the statute doesn't begin to run till discovery anyway."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2111.247,2113.682,"Justice Breyer, they are discovery of two different things."
2001.00-1045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2142.329,2153.772,"That, of course, is true, but it's very hard to see how a... a deception could be a material deception where the person is fully aware of the underlying liability."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2153.772,2156.163,--Fully aware is correct.
2001.00-1045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.163,2163.211,"Well, and if he is not fully aware on your theory, the underlying statute didn't begin to run."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2163.211,2166.211,"That... I beg to differ, Justice Breyer."
2001.00-1045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2178.603,2180.258,Strike full aware.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2180.258,2181.144,--I'm sorry?
2001.00-1045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2181.144,2191.218,I'm looking for the example on your theory of the case and at the heart of the statute which has to do primarily with two things.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2223.445,2225.027,"Gladly, Justice Breyer."
2001.00-1045,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2248.839,2250.845,And had no cause of action before then.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2250.845,2260.359,"--She had no cause of action because she had not suffered any injury as a result of these completely latent privacy breaches, and in fact, she could have gone to her grave never knowing about them."
2001.00-1045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.519,2300.014,But what you just swallowed... the words you just swallowed are my problem.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2313.703,2325.682,"--Well, there may be... there may well be other misrepresentations that could be made by a credit reporting agency, however, that was... that went to the... their... that were material to their liability, and the fact that... that they might not--"
2001.00-1045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2325.682,2327.633,But those were the examples I was looking for.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2331.118,2341.352,"--Well, perhaps they could give a misrepresentation to the effect that the Federal Government requires us to use the procedures we use, and they've been deemed reasonable by the Federal Government or in some other way reasonable--"
2001.00-1045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2341.352,2358.261,"Mr. Henderson, you have, from I think your answer to Justice Breyer, pretty well indicated that there would be, even under your view, a large overlap where you'd never get to the misrepresentation exception because the claim never arose in your... in your view of the case."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2398.41,2407.554,"--As I sit here, I'm trying to come up with one, but I think that any misrepresentation by the credit reporting agency in response to a consumer demand--"
2001.00-1045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2407.554,2411.042,But you had time when you wrote your brief to think about this.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2411.042,2411.569,--yes.
2001.00-1045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2411.569,2422.754,"And if... if the misrepresentation exception is superfluous on your reading of the statute, that is a powerful reason for us not to agree with you."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2422.754,2429.867,"No, I don't believe it's at all superfluous any more than I believe equitable estoppel is superfluous from the injury discovery rule."
2001.00-1045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2429.867,2432.907,"Well, then give us a concrete example where it would have any work to do."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2432.907,2478.866,"Well, I... I believe that, for example, if a consumer were to inquire of a credit reporting agency saying give me everything in your file, which includes all the credit accounts, all the disclosures for up to 2 years for employment purposes and lesser amount of time for other reasons, and if there was any disclosure in there or any representation in there by the credit reporting agency that was intended to deceive the... the consumer about the... about the extant liability, then it could be, for example, as I said, a... a... some message from the credit reporting agency saying that we are... we are required by law to have the procedures we have or to do that which we did, which would be a falsehood and intended to deceive the consumer from bringing a claim for... for... to determine whether or not the procedures were, in fact, reasonable."
2001.00-1045,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2478.866,2487.083,"Yes, but if there were anything wrong in what it disclosed to her, presumably the consumer would know, and that would start the period running."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2491.17,2494.994,How would the consumer know that the misrepresentation is--
2001.00-1045,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2494.994,2497.713,"Well, I assume it's a misrepresentation about the consumer."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2497.713,2502.705,--It would be a misrepresentation about the behind-the-scenes activity of the credit reporting agency.
2001.00-1045,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2502.705,2515.948,"Well, if the... if the behind-the-scenes activity of the credit reporting doesn't, in fact, result in a misrepresentation about the consumer, where is there going to be any cause of action ever at any time?"
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2517.675,2521.618,Are you talking about a misrepresentation to a user of the credit report?
2001.00-1045,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2521.618,2527.65,A false... false statement about the consumer in a matter that would be material to a decision to extend credit to the consumer.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2527.65,2537.242,I think you're confusing a misrepresentation made to a user of a credit report from a misrepresentation made to the consumer who inquires of a credit reporting agency.
2001.00-1045,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2537.242,2559.953,"But doesn't... I guess what I was assuming was that when the consumer inquires, the consumer is told all those facts which are in the credit reporting company's file which bear on the consumer's credit worthiness which are the sorts of things that the... that the credit rating service discloses when a credit inquiry is made."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2560.96,2564.063,They should be the same given... except that there might be differences in time.
2001.00-1045,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2564.063,2568.702,"Well, is there any reason to... I mean, I... I'm not following you."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2573.206,2575.477,They... that's the problem.
2001.00-1045,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2589.341,2589.571,Okay.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2600.229,2601.203,--Exactly.
2001.00-1045,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2601.203,2602.392,Okay.
2001.00-1045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2602.392,2602.686,Why?
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2614.973,2616.219,To whom?
2001.00-1045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2616.219,2620.851,To the consumer and it's either material or it isn't.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2653.736,2657.087,And let me give you one.
2001.00-1045,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2710.48,2713.143,"Yes, but under your theory, the consumer is never put on notice."
2001.00-1045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2713.143,2714.878,Yes.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2730.569,2731.223,--I think under--
2001.00-1045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2731.223,2731.67,Which are you going to say?
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2731.67,2742.872,"--under the injury discovery rule or the actual injury occurrence rule, either one which we favor, the injury occurs when the credit is denied, and then immediately thereafter the consumer is put on notice."
2001.00-1045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2742.872,2743.494,All right.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2743.837,2744.275,"And so, yes."
2001.00-1045,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2744.275,2765.986,"It is true, though, that under what I think is the prevailing rule in most circuits at least, there would be an equitable estoppel there, and the statutory proviso need not have covered that unless it meant to indicate that there was a... an injury-based statute of limitations."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2765.986,2799.501,"Well, I think the... it's true that the equitable estoppel might apply even if they had not added the misrepresentation exception, but as members of this Court have recognized, for example, when... when this Court declined the opportunity to apply a Federal rule to class action in civil rights cases, that the general rule under Federal law is suspension not renewal, which means that normally you would just toll the running of the limitations period for such amount of time as there is... as there is a deception in place."
2001.00-1045,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2824.091,2832.164,"Mr. Henderson, your... your response to Justice Breyer's question leaves me with... with some confusion as to what you mean by injury discovery rule."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2850.142,2855.278,"Well, this Court in Kubrick seemed to settle upon an injury and causation accrual rule, but I believe that--"
2001.00-1045,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2855.278,2855.924,And causation.
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2864.894,2879.01,"--Based on my understanding of the law that has developed in the courts of appeals in Cada and Connors, that it is... injury alone is enough to set the... to set the plaintiff on a course of diligence towards the potential presentation of a claim."
2001.00-1045,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2888.288,2891.119,"It destroys... it destroys the exception, so you don't want to use it here."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2891.119,2898.792,"--But if I could, Your Honor, I want to just talk also about the actual injury occurrence rule."
2001.00-1045,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2931.574,2935.357,Why isn't the release of... of confidential information an injury?
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,2937.292,2938.771,I don't believe so.
2001.00-1045,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3012.153,3013.903,This is a district court decision?
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,3013.903,3018.951,"--It is, and it... and it analyzes what Congress did with respect to the odometer--"
2001.00-1045,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3018.951,3019.734,"Thank you, Mr. Henderson."
2001.00-1045,1,16240,andrew_r_henderson,,3019.734,3020.012,--Thank you.
2001.00-1045,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3020.012,3023.089,"Mr. Jones, we'll hear from you."
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3023.089,3034.796,"It's really the second question, of course, whether if the statute has an injury discovery rule, that would be negated by the misrepresentation exception."
2001.00-1045,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.799,3065.762,"Well, the difficulty... the difficulty I'm having with that, though I see that now, is basically what you've done there is you've taken a statute that doesn't discuss any of these things, and you take what would be a full discovery rule, and then you break it into bits."
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3071.314,3083.894,"The injury discovery rule starts the clock in the sense that once you become aware of the injury, you have a duty of inquiry to find out the cause of the injury, who caused it, whether it violated your... a standard of care that was owed to you."
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.041,3103.97,Suppose I find that a credit reporting agency has given incorrect information to... to somebody who's inquired.
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3112.701,3116.597,"Well, you're... you're mixing, I think, two points."
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3121.02,3121.627,"No, no."
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3121.627,3125.25,"If you think that they violated your rights and you ask them something, what they tell you."
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3126.641,3126.917,No.
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3138.048,3138.774,--Right.
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3138.774,3141.517,Have I had any injury?
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3141.517,3146.509,It's just erroneous information?
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3146.509,3147.523,It's erroneous information.
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3147.523,3148.066,I don't--
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3148.066,3149.008,And it's detrimental.
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3152.895,3153.366,--I don't--
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3153.366,3155.044,Have I suffered any injury under this statute?
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3155.044,3157.003,"--I don't see that you would have, but--"
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3157.003,3157.361,Wow.
2001.00-1045,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3157.361,3161.809,"You might, if there were a higher interest rate charged and you didn't know about that."

2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3190.02,3190.874,You mean they'd be liable.

2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3194.664,3195.11,For an injunction.
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3195.11,3197.293,"--Here's the way that would work, as I understand it."
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3216.416,3222.657,Do you think the word liability in the statute refers only to monetary recovery?
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3222.657,3235.65,"I think that... well, I think the word liability in this statute, like any statute that uses cause of action accrues, cause of action arises... these are ambiguous terms that the court has to interpret based on the purpose of the statute."
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3235.65,3240.394,"Don't they include injunction and refer not merely to monetary damages, but to an action for injunction?"
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3240.394,3243.161,There is not a statutory action for an injunction.
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3250.73,3252.841,Where does the action for injunction come from if not from the statute?
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3252.841,3256.672,--It comes from the invocation of the common law when--
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3256.672,3258.887,I don't believe in Federal common law.
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3262.054,3266.574,"--Well, it's... it's a cause of action that perfects the rights created by the statute."
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3276.696,3280.407,"Before there's any liability, but you can't get money damages before there's any liability."
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3280.407,3290.433,"That's doesn't strike me as a startling idea, that the... that an injunction can be given in a situation when you're not able to obtain money relief."
2001.00-1045,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3290.433,3294.649,But you do have to assume that there's a violation for the injunction to lie.
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3294.649,3295.561,That's correct.
2001.00-1045,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3355.31,3361.783,But it is odd in the context of a statute that has the other language in it where Congress spells it out.
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3370.139,3371.261,There... there is nothing odd.
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3380.919,3381.477,"No, that isn't odd."
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3399.312,3400.59,The... Justice--
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3400.59,3404.398,"--Of course, you would imply 2 years after discovery of the misrepresentation."
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3404.398,3408.949,"--Justice Scalia, the misrepresentation is... is of any fact material to the violation."
2001.00-1045,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3437.144,3439.349,But that's always true under equitable estoppel.
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3439.923,3439.349,I'm sorry.
2001.00-1045,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3440.682,3443.105,That's always true under equitable estoppel.
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3443.105,3444.127,That is... that is--
2001.00-1045,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3444.127,3449.063,"You have that... now, it's true that the whole... the statute doesn't run, but you don't have 2 years."
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3449.063,3449.765,--Right.
2001.00-1045,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3480.089,3480.895,"Well, I'm a little nervous."
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3525.737,3532.121,"Well, you have the... under the injury discovery rule, you have the requirement that the plaintiff act with some reasonable diligence."
2001.00-1045,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3532.121,3532.959,They... they don't know.
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3538.232,3544.456,"Well, if they don't... if they don't make any inquiry at all over 20 years, I think a court could conclude that they didn't act with reasonable diligence."
2001.00-1045,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3572.339,3578.635,"But you... you can discover the misrepresentation, that... that is, the... the erroneous credit information."
2001.00-1045,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3594.073,3597.928,The... there are two different aspects of this case.
2001.00-1045,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3626.795,3628.114,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
