1971.70-87,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,24.618,"70-87, Police Department of Chicago against Mosley and Grayned against Rockford."
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,960.699,964.871,Mr. Chief justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.272,1121.06,"Ms. Hal, as I read the opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois, it didn't treat any factual issue."
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1131.582,1138.366,"That is true, but the Supreme Court did mention the facts in the case that they thought were relevant and facts were set down in the brief."
1971.70-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1146.948,1152.934,Was any State point â€“ a state law point made to the Supreme Court of Illinois that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction?
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1152.934,1154.0,Not whatsoever.
1971.70-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1154.0,1156.291,And you are not making any such point --
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1156.291,1164.559,"Not at all, but the only reason I bring this record to this Court's attention is that there are facts stated in the appellee's brief which are not true."
1971.70-87,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1164.559,1166.996,"Ms. Hal, are you willing to leave that with the clerk?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1166.996,1174.88,"I certainly intend to do so, and I have mentioned this to Mr. Quinlan when I arrived at court."
1971.70-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.175,1197.578,"Is it your submission that this ordinance has said, all demonstrations of 40 or more people within a 150-feet of the school building are prohibited?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1203.436,1204.724,"Yes, Your Honor it would be."
1971.70-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.724,1206.798,You are not just arguing over breadth of --
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1206.798,1209.293,I am arguing over breadth.
1971.70-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1209.293,1210.586,Is that your fundamental position?
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1210.586,1219.67,That's the fundamental position with respect to Section 18.1 (i) and also we argue that 18.1 (i) violates the Equal Protection Clause.
1971.70-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1220.709,1233.016,"But you are also saying, I take it that even if this ordinance were limited to just covering demonstrations of 40 or more people, that it would be unconstitutional?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1233.016,1238.27,Are you saying that if the ordinance stated that 40 or more people could demonstrate on --
1971.70-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.27,1239.27,May not -- may not demonstrate.
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1239.27,1242.777,"May not demonstrate, I would say it was unconstitutional."
1971.70-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1242.777,1245.219,So your argument is not just over breadth.
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1251.122,1252.326,That's right.
1971.70-87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1252.326,1255.949,"What about a thousand or more, same argument?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1255.949,1264.879,"Your Honor, I think that to try and use numbers as a 150-feet and the number of people avoids the whole problem involved here."
1971.70-87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1273.752,1284.244,"Would you not agree that a thousand people moving around the entrances of the school, the access streets, would be more of a problem than one person?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1284.244,1303.336,"If an ordinance was passed which said that there could not be so many people picketing who obstructed the ingress and egress with respect to the school, who stopped traffic, who prevented people from using the public way, if that's what the ordinance says, if that's what the ordinance said then it would be constitutional, but there is not evidence of that here."
1971.70-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.793,1344.576,"But under 19.2, your clients would have to have been found guilty of willfully making or assisting in making any noise or diversion which disturbs or tends to disturb the peace or good order, would they not?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1344.576,1345.075,That's correct.
1971.70-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1364.984,1369.855,So your attack on that section of the ordinance is not based on the First Amendment but on grounds of vagueness?
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1369.855,1381.812,"Your Honor, it's also based on the First Amendment because via why its vagueness, which violates due process, it is subject to an over broad application to perfectly protected constitutional freedom."
1971.70-87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1381.812,1393.694,"You would -- what would be your view of the statute prohibiting picketing on the sidewalks adjacent to this building, unconstitutional?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1393.694,1400.253,"I will have to -- the people who drafted the statute, what would be their purpose in drafting it?"
1971.70-87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1430.677,1445.569,"Do you think it's unreasonable then for a legislature and law making body, to conclude that as many people as you have here, 200, has the tendency to disturb the educational process?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1445.569,1452.101,"I think, Justice Stewart made the appropriate statement when he wrote this Court's opinion in Tinker versus Des Moines."
1971.70-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1489.228,1492.336,"May I ask, what was the penalty imposed?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1492.336,1506.703,"Mr Grayned was fined $25 for violating 18.1(i) and $25 for violating 19.2 (a), a torts court fine."
1971.70-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1506.703,1509.708,That's different from the other case?
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1509.708,1511.868,The what case?
1971.70-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1511.868,1513.46,The other cases involved here?
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1513.46,1517.386,"In the most of the cases there was no arrest, there was no conviction, there was no fine."
1971.70-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.494,1523.957,But there at least the other action concerns only one ordinance?
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1523.957,1526.342,"The other action, that's right, mine concerns two."
1971.70-87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1526.342,1527.106,Two ordinances?
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1527.106,1529.452,"19.2 (a), second ordinance."
1971.70-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1529.452,1532.824,And 19.2 (a) has no exemption for labor union?
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1532.824,1536.248,"No, it does not, it applies to any person."
1971.70-87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1536.248,1551.863,"Do you think it's a denial of Equal Protection, if the law making body thought a labor dispute is entitled to a higher order of picketing rights than just any other people?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1551.863,1563.275,"Yes, I do and I also would say that it is significant in my particular case that the City of Rockford has eliminated the labor picketing distinction."
1971.70-87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1601.077,1609.585,"I don't suppose the city would agree with you, the change in the arguments has that meaning and only that meaning now would --"
1971.70-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1681.495,1689.398,"May I ask Ms. Hall, the record that you are going to leave with us, is there evidence in that that there was noise?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1689.398,1690.733,"Yes there is evidence, Your Honor."
1971.70-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1696.959,1704.354,"What I am really asking is, Is there any evidence that there was any noise by the group who you represent?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1706.799,1709.982,There were 200 demonstrators who were in front of the school.
1971.70-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1713.37,1719.584,"Well, is there any evidence that those 40 --"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1719.584,1721.596,"My client, Richard Grayned."
1971.70-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1733.694,1736.465,What's the evidence that he made a diversion?
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1736.465,1739.697,I have submitted the record to this Court to find it.
1971.70-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1739.697,1741.599,"You mean there is not any, is that your suggestion?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1741.599,1742.837,"As far as I concede, there is no --"
1971.70-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1742.837,1748.099,There's Thompson and Louisville (Inaudible) you suggest.
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1748.099,1750.969,"We had not raised that argument in our brief, Your Honor."
1971.70-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1759.285,1766.678,"Whatever that may be, but is there any affirmative evidence that your -- I guess, the only one we have here is Mr. Grayned?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1766.678,1767.941,"Mr. Grayned, that's right."
1971.70-87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1767.941,1773.823,"Any evidence that all in this record that he was noisy, he was making the diversion?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1773.823,1786.484,"There is no evidence that he was noisy and I am just -- I would say there was no evidence that he personally, personally himself was making a diversion."
1971.70-87,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1809.433,1814.249,"Ms. Hal, you didn't raise them in Thompson versus Louisville point in the Supreme Court of Illinois."
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1814.249,1817.207,"No, I did not Your Honor."
1971.70-87,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1817.207,1819.368,You said 40 were arrested?
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1819.368,1821.473,There were 40 demonstrators who were arrested.
1971.70-87,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1821.473,1823.936,"Well, were they all convicted?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1823.936,1825.93,The --
1971.70-87,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1825.93,1829.473,"I mean, is this a symbolic case or what because it's --"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1829.473,1830.222,Because the 40 cases.
1971.70-87,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1830.222,1835.561,"It's just that, when this case is brought in, the one that has no record as to what man did?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1835.561,1837.43,And that's the record I am bringing with now.
1971.70-87,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1837.43,1841.398,Which â€“ there is nothing in that to show that he did anything?
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1841.398,1846.863,"That he -- there is evidence in there, that he participated in the demonstration."
1971.70-87,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1854.34,1865.987,"Or is anything in the record that shows that Mr. Grayned opened his mouth, said anything?"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1865.987,1871.836,"I wouldn't be surprised if he said something Your Honor and I don't know what the record shows exactly, to his making comments with people around him."
1971.70-87,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1871.836,1874.651,"Well, how many --"
1971.70-87,1,26648,hal_m_brown,,1874.651,1896.444,"I submit that I am here for Richard Grayned and I am asking this Court to sustain the faith of the citizens Rockford that this Court would protect their rights to exercise their freedom, which are protected from state interference through the Fourteenth Amendment."
1971.70-87,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1896.735,1898.434,"Thank you, Ms. Hal."
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,1905.555,1909.263,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2113.424,2120.363,"Mr. Curry, you say that you try and do the same thing that you've done in Cox?"
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2120.363,2121.011,Yes sir.
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2121.011,2133.486,"And it appears from the decisions of the Court of Appeals that (Inaudible) decisions, you say that's just a point, you said what Cox said, it would be valid and nobody said?"
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2133.486,2144.192,"The court's found the ordinance of the City of Chicago to be overbroad and answered no further questions in issue, Justice Marshall, my recollection --"
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2144.192,2152.919,"He says that it was because it was narrowly drawn to protect the valid state interest, that's what he says in Cox."
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2152.919,2154.375,"You're reading from Cox, sir."
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2154.375,2157.599,"No, sir, I'm reading from Judge Hastings."
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2157.599,2163.33,"It's my recollection, I certainly don't quarrel with you reading of the order sir."
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.36,2174.364,"You've addressed the one like Cox, what about others, that's what I gather from this?"
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2174.364,2180.295,"We submit, Justice Marshall, that this is very narrow."
1971.70-87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2218.501,2223.511,"Well, why the exception then for labor picketing?"
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2223.511,2229.705,"Justice Brennan, the exemption for labor picketing has a derogation in these facts."
1971.70-87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2253.102,2259.474,"You mean, they'll suggest the labor picketing particularly when it involves school (Inaudible) it's not a matter of public issue picket?"
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2259.474,2277.864,"Yes, but public picketing, when in Illinois, when it involves school teachers or school employees, public employees generally, is determined by the rule of law in Illinois that, that picketing is contrary to public policy and can be enjoined by a state action."
1971.70-87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2277.864,2280.824,"Well, what kind of picketing you are going to have around the schools?"
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2280.824,2300.612,"You would have the kind that could be enjoined by appropriate state action, a remedy being available to meet this possibility, the city of Chicago felt in drawing a very narrow ordinance, we would only relate our ordinance to the experiences that were then prevalent in the streets."
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.398,2316.585,Suppose more people carrying the sign saying that the city of Chicago is unfair to organized labor?
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2316.585,2319.017,Within 150 feet of the school --
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2319.017,2320.116,Within one foot.
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2320.116,2329.579,"Within one foot, the city of Chicago -- well, that would be picketing -- that would not be labor picketing at a school."
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2336.862,2347.302,"Mosley's sign said I support, the labor dispute between union ABC and the city of Chicago."
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2350.041,2352.056,Right.
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.111,2372.902,But couldn't the state also prosecute him under this ordinance?
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2372.902,2377.302,The city of Chicago would prosecute him under this ordinance only --
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2377.302,2380.045,It couldn't.
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2380.045,2380.679,I'm sorry.
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2380.679,2382.107,"It couldn't, could it --"
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2382.107,2387.532,"If you're engaged in labor picketing, it could not prosecute him under this ordinance clearly."
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2387.532,2392.129,"This exact same man, with exact same stick with a different sign on it?"
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2392.129,2406.792,"A different sign, because there are an array, a plethora of remedies available to the law enforcement agencies under the NLRB Act, because he's a public employee, his activities can be enjoined under the public policy of the State of Illinois."
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2415.283,2418.371,Was that argument made in Court of Appeals?
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2418.371,2420.419,"I didn't make the argument there, sir."
1971.70-87,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2421.213,2427.043,"Well, was it mentioned in the opinion of Court of Appeals, this argument?"
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2427.043,2431.57,"The argument on invidious discrimination, to my recollection it was not."
1971.70-87,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.57,2438.086,"Mr. Curry, would the National Labor Relations Act cover a public employer such as the school?"
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2438.086,2455.292,"The National Labor Relations Act exempts the public employee, you're right, but that public employee then, if he is picketing would find that the state would be enacting the thrust of public policy and enjoining his conduct."
1971.70-87,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2455.292,2458.181,So a state preemption as against the city of (voice Overlap)
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2458.181,2486.144,"The state preemption for the public employees and it would be National Labor Relations Board, National Federal Preemption for those employees who were neither civil -- public issue oriented, public employee related, that would be a third category and we feel, we felt that the time this ordinance was drafted that there was adequate remedies for the other two eventualities around our schools."
1971.70-87,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2501.017,2505.295,I suppose there is no specific legislative history at stack which could show that?
1971.70-87,2,38983,richard_l_curry,,2505.295,2507.431,There is not.
1971.70-87,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2667.844,2671.601,Thank you Mr. Curry.
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,2672.545,2691.51,"If the Court please, as we now know this Rockford appeal is identical to the Chicago one in that the anti-picketing ordinances of both cities were identical."
1971.70-87,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2780.436,2792.636,"How would a particular school in Chicago has distinguished from Department of Education, have a labor dispute with someone, what would be the --"
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,2792.636,2794.399,In Rockford we could.
1971.70-87,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2805.677,2808.728,"Well, I mean Rockford, I'm really speaking myself to."
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,2813.118,2820.731,The only way I know -- yes I suppose the building traits during the construction of the school may have some dispute and possibly --
1971.70-87,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2820.731,2824.112,Was it for a particular school or with the contracting--?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,2824.112,2834.861,"Well if I were â€“ I were running the labor union, my pickets would be done at the Board of Education offices, but I think it's possible that there could be some labor dispute."
1971.70-87,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2887.401,2889.93,"Which ordinance came first, Chicago or Rockford?"
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,2889.93,2893.855,We copy the Chicago ordinance and that very often --
1971.70-87,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2893.855,2896.145,(Voice Overlap)
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,2896.145,2898.599,"Identical, identical."
1971.70-87,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2899.199,2901.869,(Inaudible) didn't pass that much attention.
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,2901.869,2906.552,"And I know that the time that this was going to happen, I brought up my own ordinance."
1971.70-87,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2906.552,2908.549,"You are referring now to 18.1, right?"
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,2908.549,2914.025,"Yes, 18.1."
1971.70-87,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.913,2969.222,"Well, you don't suggest that you should have judgment here because this case may have involved a lot of people or that --"
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,2969.222,2971.523,"No, no."
1971.70-87,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2986.388,2998.508,Would you suggest that you should lose this case if the ordinance is unconstitutional if applied to one person picketing?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,2998.508,3011.192,"I'm not sure and, of course, the opinion in Coates versus Cincinnati is what gives me pause on that whether this may develop and the ordinance is unconstitutional in its application."
1971.70-87,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3011.192,3015.301,The ordinance on its face would apply to one person picketing the school?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3015.301,3015.931,"Yes, it would."
1971.70-87,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3017.141,3027.823,"And if it were unconstitutional, if it did that, would you say the the ordinance is invalid on its face?"
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3027.823,3029.279,I frankly don't know.
1971.70-87,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3035.376,3039.187,"But I said that wasn't the speech case, I approached it as a non-speech case?"
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3039.187,3043.244,"That is right, and picketing, of course, is not strictly a speech case."
1971.70-87,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.244,3046.607,"Well not strictly, but it does have no relevance?"
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3046.607,3061.03,"I personally be willing to stand on the ordinance as right and although we had 200 people, we had four (Inaudible) disturbance and Mosley was just walking up and down all by himself."
1971.70-87,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3067.171,3080.331,So you are saying that that it would be fair to your side to consider this case though we had a one person picket and the ordinance would apply to that?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3080.331,3086.714,"I don't know if it would be fair, but I can see where this Court might take that attitude."
1971.70-87,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3103.059,3106.102,What does this man (Inaudible) do?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3106.102,3106.796,Grayned?
1971.70-87,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3106.796,3107.764,Grayned
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3107.764,3108.445,Well --
1971.70-87,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3108.445,3110.375,That's in the record?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3110.375,3113.888,"That's in the record before you is the transcript that we are submitting to you, sir."
1971.70-87,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3113.888,3115.367,Either or both?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3115.367,3121.097,"Well, what's in the record before you, nothing, absolutely nothing."
1971.70-87,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3136.102,3139.084,Did you make any notes?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3139.084,3145.452,There to my knowledge is no direct -- the testimony was everybody was chatting.
1971.70-87,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3161.756,3163.371,How was he convicted?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3163.371,3181.244,"Because the anti-noise, anti-picketing, not anti-demonstration ordinance says whosoever shall willfully make noise or demonstrate as to disrupt the classroom."
1971.70-87,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3193.729,3195.523,What did he do?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3195.523,3203.958,"There was testimony that Grayned, this one particular defendant was walking up and down."
1971.70-87,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3221.955,3240.163,"Well, what -- I assume that if testimony was that everybody was chanting, and a man who was in that group who was deaf and dumb could get convicted under this statue, ordinance I mean?"
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3240.163,3245.072,"Deaf and dumb, I doubt that he would be convicted if he showed that he --"
1971.70-87,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3245.072,3246.146,But he would be --
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3246.146,3248.272,He couldn't because he was dumb.
1971.70-87,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3248.272,3256.751,It's in the fact that the way this statute was administrated in this particular occasion was that anybody in that group was subject to arrest?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3256.751,3258.39,I think not.
1971.70-87,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3264.311,3268.475,We have one man before us --
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3268.475,3271.925,You have one man and you have a ordinance.
1971.70-87,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3271.925,3286.088,"(Inaudible) myself I don't see what he has been proved to have done to violate the ordinance even if it's constitutional, you see my problem?"
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3286.088,3287.453,"Yes sir, I understand."
1971.70-87,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3322.794,3326.217,How does Illinois define diversion?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3326.217,3334.208,The Supreme Court of Illinois -- this was brought up there.
1971.70-87,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3404.946,3407.381,I suppose the jury was instructed?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3407.381,3410.788,The jury was instructed and the words of the ordinance.
1971.70-87,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3437.921,3444.235,Did the defendant make any request for charge in the trial court on the meaning of diversion?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3444.235,3450.287,The colloquy concerning instructions are in this transcript --
1971.70-87,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3450.287,3450.901,No point whatsoever --
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3450.901,3453.102,-- and there is no point that I know of --
1971.70-87,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3453.102,3456.007,I didn't want to (Inaudible) the Supreme Court of Illinois.
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3456.007,3467.037,"Nor in the magistrate's court, however, I didn't try the case but it does not appear here and it does appear in this transcript the discussion concerning instructions to be submitted to the jury."
1971.70-87,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3543.948,3550.038,What is beyond noise and diversion?
1971.70-87,3,45935,william_r_quinlan,,3559.167,3559.949,None.
