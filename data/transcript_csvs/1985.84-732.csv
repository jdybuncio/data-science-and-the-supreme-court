1985.84-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.49,Cleavinger and others against Saxner.
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,30.128,33.877,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.575,292.993,"Did the jury itself make the determination that due process had been denied because of finding their guilt on the charge that hadn't been made, or was that determination made by the judge?"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,292.993,296.803,The jury found... there was a special verdict.
1985.84-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,308.284,309.861,"So, it was a jury finding?"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,309.861,311.922,Under special verdict.
1985.84-732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,311.922,314.047,And it's all procedural default?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,314.047,316.187,"Procedural due process, yes."
1985.84-732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,332.243,337.022,"Was that the only ground on which they appealed, just the--"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,337.022,341.909,The petitioners also challenged the amount of damages.
1985.84-732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,348.767,356.467,"--So, we don't have anything to do, then, with the damages, whether under our cases the instructions on damages were--"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,356.467,358.592,That is not an issue here.
1985.84-732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,374.912,380.191,--Is there a provision for the government paying the damages?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,380.191,380.878,--There is not.
1985.84-732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,380.878,381.253,There is not?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,381.253,389.813,"The framework, we think, for analyzing the absolute immunity issue in this case is rather clear in light of this Court's prior decisions."
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,550.951,557.291,In some prisons don't they have disciplinary boards composed of prisoners?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,557.291,560.509,"Not for imposing discipline, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,563.039,569.1,Don't some jails have disciplinary boards composed solely of prisoners?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,569.1,571.147,"Not to my knowledge, certainly not the federal system."
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,571.147,573.348,Do they have any where they have it half and half?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,573.348,575.488,"No, not--"
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,575.488,576.816,It's only guards?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,576.816,577.8,--It's not guards.
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,583.937,584.312,Guards--
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,584.312,586.577,--Guards do not sit on these committees.
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,586.577,587.904,--Glorified guards?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,587.904,588.81,They're not glorified guards.
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,605.617,608.271,"Well, two of the them are in charge of the very facility you're talking about."
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,608.271,611.129,They are part of the correctional staff.
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,616.471,624.061,I just have a little difficulty in getting demoted to the level of a prison guard.
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,624.061,627.216,"I am not suggesting you are, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.216,634.62,"Mr. Geller, if I understand you, the immunity would attach even if the warden decided to assign a guard to hear one of these cases, wouldn't it?"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,634.62,661.077,"I think if what the guard was doing is what these IDC members do, that the immunity would attach just the same, but that would relate more to the final part of the Butz test, I think, which is whether the system is procedurally fair, and when I get to that I will explain that one of the facts of this system that makes it procedurally fair is that the members of this discipline committee are high-level officials of the prison who do not have day to day contact with the inmates."
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.044,667.856,"Mr. Geller, I understand."
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,683.911,687.521,I don't think I can answer that categorically.
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,708.152,712.275,I think in your brief you rely on both 1983 cases and federal cases--
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,712.275,720.96,"Well, the courts in the immunity cases have never distinguished between them, and the Court of Appeals decisions that have decided this particular issue have not really drawn distinctions."
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,737.032,745.902,"--The reason I asked, of course, is as Justice Marshall suggests, supposing a state system as a routine matter used guards at the trial level but had an appellate review system, you would still say the immunity--"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,745.902,756.008,"I would make the same... I would make the same argument, but that's not the case in the federal system, and of course whatever system the State set up would have to satisfy the due process clause as construed in cases like Wolff."
1985.84-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.008,765.88,"--Mr. Geller, does the record show what portion of their work time these particular petitioners spend in sitting on the IDC?"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,765.88,771.002,"I don't believe the record shows it, but I think I have information that would answer your question."
1985.84-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,796.772,803.708,To that extent they are somewhat different than administrative law judges who presumably spend just about all their time adjudicating?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,803.708,803.942,--Yes.
1985.84-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,820.622,833.929,"Would they be more like, Mr. Geller, the temporary and part-time judges in Virginia and other states who are appointed from members of the bar and just sit for two weeks, or two months?"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,833.929,834.632,--Yes.
1985.84-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,842.817,847.487,Can you come up with one of these part-time judges in the state of Virginia that has absolute immunity?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,847.487,851.986,"--I don't think there's any question that he would, and we think the same should apply here."
1985.84-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,979.511,987.96,"Excuse me for the interruption, but are there any written, specified qualifications for service on these committees?"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,987.96,989.241,"Yes, there are."
1985.84-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1016.497,1019.245,Any requirement with respect to education?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1019.245,1022.26,"Well, there is, as I was about to say, not in the last few years."
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1049.904,1053.465,What is the educational requirement for a guard?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1053.465,1064.929,"Well, Justice Marshall, again a guard does not sit on these committees, but if a guard did wish to take the test there is an extensive program of testing, learning the rules of--"
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1064.929,1066.288,My question is very simple.
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1068.506,1071.129,--To become a prison guard?
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1071.129,1072.176,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1072.176,1075.488,"I am not aware of what the educational requirements for guard are, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1078.143,1083.064,"Well, what is the educational requirement before one can sit on one of these committees?"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1083.064,1101.369,"If a prison employee wishes to sit on an IDC, he has to go through a periodic testing program and certification, has to pass a written test, has to learn the rules of this Court in cases like Wolff against McDonald, and he has to learn the regulations that the Bureau of Prisons have promulgated for the operation of these IDC's."
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1101.369,1107.319,"I still want to know the educational requirement, one year, two year or no year."
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1107.319,1112.349,"Justice Marshall, you are talking about how much formal education they have to have in terms of high school or college."
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1120.095,1121.486,"So, you don't know of any?"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1121.486,1123.516,I don't know of any formal educational requirements.
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1132.919,1135.152,Or Supreme Court Justice.
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1135.152,1138.479,Or a Supreme Court Justice.
1985.84-732,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1138.479,1140.133,"Notice I left out, Solicitor General."
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1142.242,1146.226,"Actually, by statute, the Solicitor General must be learned in the law, Justice."
1985.84-732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.226,1147.615,But it doesn't say anything about his assistants?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1147.615,1153.753,"It doesn't say anything about his assistants, that's true, or his deputies, although they all are."
1985.84-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1153.753,1155.737,Congress would take care of that.
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1155.737,1158.298,"Congress, I think so."
1985.84-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1232.846,1246.465,Do you think your case would be stronger if the prison were to hire some full-time adjudicators to sit and serve in this function?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1246.465,1246.934,"Like ALJ's, or--"
1985.84-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1246.934,1247.402,Yes.
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1247.402,1250.963,--That is the solution that the respondents offer.
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.259,1297.352,"Mr. Geller, you mentioned that there are some 30,000 of these hearings--"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1297.352,1297.587,--Yes.
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1297.587,1298.368,--in the federal system every year.
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1303.24,1313.923,"Well, I asked... there's nothing in the record, obviously, but I asked the Bureau of Prisons recently and they told me there are approximately 75 pending Bivens suits by prisoners."
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1476.468,1478.436,"Mr. Geller, how can you say they got all the relief they asked for?"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1480.965,1488.541,"--No, there's nothing, obviously, that... even the judge who sends someone to jail pending charges--"
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1488.541,1491.68,"I understand, but isn't that the risk that this remedy is supposed to take care of?"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1498.989,1502.848,"--I agree, but I think the same thing could be said for many judicial-type decisions."
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1509.188,1514.218,"Well, suppose the appellate tribunal felt the same way, let's just keep them there another couple of weeks and then... what if they just delayed?"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1516.107,1516.888,"No, I understand, Justice."
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1521.653,1524.777,"--But you're saying, even if the regulation is violated there should be no remedy?"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1524.777,1526.525,"--Well, there should be no Bivens remedy."
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.539,1530.274,In the meantime he sits in solitary.
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1530.274,1531.413,"Well, he wasn't in solitary."
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.413,1535.459,"But, that's the possibility, and you can't come in... I really don't know--"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1535.459,1540.284,"I think that's a possibility, but it's a possibility with judicial proceedings as well."
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.855,1565.432,"--So, then, 20 percent of the cases, somebody has suffered some temporary harm for which there will be no recourse?"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1565.432,1568.102,"Well, but the harm may have been very, very minor."
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.883,1570.303,It may be minor to us but--
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1570.303,1581.003,"--No, Justice, in this case for example, if there had been no segregation order but simply the forfeiture of good time, it seems to me that if six weeks later the good time had been restored, there would have been absolutely no damage."
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1581.003,1584.001,--But isn't segregation a typical remedy in discipline cases--
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1584.001,1591.264,"In the more serious ones, but many of these IDC hearings don't involve such serious charges."
1985.84-732,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1661.501,1668.609,"--The respondents' contention isn't that due process requires it, but that if you're going to give absolute immunity--"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1668.609,1668.874,I understand that.
1985.84-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1716.214,1726.335,"--I guess there is a middle ground, decision makers that are a little more independent from the working processes of the prisons, with maybe all the other trappings."
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1726.335,1736.112,"--Perhaps, Justice O'Connor, although I think there is a degree of impartiality and the due process clause obviously doesn't require any more, this Court held in Wolff against McDonald."
1985.84-732,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1761.868,1772.442,Do you think that the qualified immunity standards in the Harlow versus Fitzgerald summary judgment procedures are just wholly inadequate to--
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1772.442,1786.31,"They're not wholly, and obviously what the Court has done in the area of qualified immunity is useful, but it's not at all a complete answer because all qualified immunity really does is prevent an adverse judgment from being entered against the defendant, perhaps."
1985.84-732,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.744,1804.334,"--Furthermore, he may be stuck from time to time because under qualified immunity standards he deserves to be stuck."
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1804.334,1805.397,Or because an error was made.
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1819.219,1821.922,Does the government pay the cost of defense?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1823.25,1826.78,"Well, a case by case determination is made by the Justice Department."
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.78,1827.248,"In this case, who--"
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1827.248,1836.838,"The Justice Department was representing these people, but they had no right to representation and of course the Justice Department or the government does not pay any final judgment."
1985.84-732,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1836.838,1838.494,"--Oh, I understand that."
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1838.494,1838.743,Thank you.
1985.84-732,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1838.743,1840.726,But they do represent it?
1985.84-732,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1840.726,1845.287,In these cases the Justice Department generally represents the defendant.
1985.84-732,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1845.287,1850.019,Mr. Taylor.
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,1850.019,1853.815,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1879.054,1894.689,"What do you say about the standard that was set down in Imbler against Pachtman, that the standard is the functional comparability of the two activities, that is, how does it compare in function with that of a judge?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,1894.689,1897.938,We don't have any disagreement with that.
1985.84-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1898.485,1906.107,"What I'm asking you is, how do you think that standard should be applied?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,1906.107,1909.324,"--Well, I think it's applied very clearly through the Butz test."
1985.84-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1918.524,1923.02,An administrative law judge can't enter a judgment or make a final determination?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,1923.02,1925.535,"That's right, he--"
1985.84-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1925.535,1926.77,He makes recommendations.
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,1926.77,1937.5,"--That's true, but he... if you compare him to these supposed senior administrators that made the decisions in this case, the 1975, you find the differences are paramount."
1985.84-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1952.072,1955.93,What would you say about a justice of the peace or a lay judge in some of the states?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,1958.147,1960.708,"Well, you mean like a magistrate, that kind of thing?"
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2040.472,2044.144,"I would think your argument, then, should be there shouldn't be any immunity at all?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2044.144,2050.251,"Well, we are bound by the dictates in Butz versus Economou and Wood versus Strickland."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.42,2056.67,What about prosecutors?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2056.67,2066.947,"Prosecutors get their immunity from another branch of the quasi-judicial doctrine, and that is because they are integrally involved in the judicial process."
1985.84-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2071.149,2072.117,But aren't they adversaries?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2072.117,2083.44,"They're adversaries, that's true, but they got their immunity not because of their adversarial position but their position in a judicial process that's supervised by a judge."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.517,2087.422,Isn't there a charging party?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2094.56,2095.123,That's right.
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.123,2098.591,Who gives them... who charges them?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2098.591,2111.617,"A guard... it depends on the factual situation, but a guard will bring an incident report, which will then be served on the prisoner, who will then come to the hearing after getting notice, although that was one of the major problems in this case."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2111.617,2114.115,And was the guard sued in this case?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2114.115,2117.786,"The guard was sued, yes, the charging guard was also sued."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.786,2118.942,And is he at issue here?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2118.942,2119.925,"No, he's not."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2119.925,2121.113,What happened to him?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2121.113,2122.457,He was acquitted by the jury.
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.457,2126.516,"I see, and what was... was there an argument about his immunity?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2126.516,2129.671,"No, in terms of absolute immunity, no, no."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.732,2133.998,But qualified immunity?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2133.998,2137.075,--Qualified immunity?
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2137.075,2137.575,"Yes, was it?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2137.575,2140.543,There was... that wasn't the finding of the jury.
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.864,2156.817,How about the warden?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2156.817,2160.113,"The warden was sued also, and he was also acquitted by the jury."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.113,2166.532,"So, the immunity issue... was it on that basis, or do you know?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2166.532,2168.015,I'm sorry.
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2168.015,2169.843,"Was there immunity for him, or not?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2169.843,2170.435,"No, no."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.841,2178.371,Was there an argument for his absolute immunity?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2178.371,2180.792,"No, there was none made."
1985.84-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2337.761,2342.571,An administrative law judge can't convict anyone of anything.
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2347.021,2358.844,"Well, that's true, but he makes a recommendation based on a plenary hearing and that recommendation then goes to the agency and then that is either affirmed or denied or whatever."
1985.84-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2358.844,2362.641,"Or reviewed de novo by the judge, by the body."
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2362.641,2367.358,"That's true, and there's an absolute right to judicial review, which of course there isn't here either."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.934,2493.073,What immunity do parole and probation officers have?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2493.073,2496.539,--I don't think that's been decided by either this Court.
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.349,2504.381,What about parole?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2504.381,2516.189,"Parole officers, there are some circuit cases, I think the Ninth Circuit and one other circuit, who have decided... have afforded them absolute immunity, the other circuit being the Seventh Circuit, I believe."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.755,2558.532,"Do you know where the senior prison people who serve on these boards come from, or have they been guards before or been promoted, or do they have special qualifications, an elite corps that are brought in from outside?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2558.532,2561.481,I can't speak in general as the Government has.
1985.84-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2764.071,2771.881,One gets the impression from Judge Woods' opinion that perhaps even the Seventh Circuit may be lined up to reconsider the whole point.
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2771.881,2780.628,"Well, he has what Judge Cudahy characterized as an ambiguous footnote, that at some time we ought to reconsider this, perhaps."
1985.84-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2794.325,2795.388,From five to four?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2795.388,2804.977,"Right, right, and I think that there's no justification for the radical extension and unwarranted extension of Butz that we would be dealing with here."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.274,2849.444,"Is it rather... you have tried a lot of these cases, apparently."
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2856.44,2860.924,"To me, in terms of money or--"
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2860.924,2861.986,In terms of result.
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2861.986,2865.546,--I think there would be--
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.546,2875.308,"You are going to have to prove some... you are going to have to prove that these people acted unreasonably, if judged on an objective basis."
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2875.308,2876.918,"--That's true, and--"
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2876.918,2878.588,And how often can you do that?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2878.588,2886.334,"--Well, I only do it... I only bring those cases to trial when I think I can do it, and I've had 100 percent success on the cases I've done."
1985.84-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2912.855,2917.573,Did I understand you to say the parole officer is entitled to absolute immunity?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2917.573,2919.82,"No, I didn't say that."
1985.84-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2943.781,2947.044,Are they required to be law trained?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,2947.044,2951.496,"They are required to either be law trained, medically trained, they take psychologically trained."
1985.84-732,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2987.638,3000.899,"Is there any statutory requirement for federal parole officers in terms of education, or can any person who is appointed serve?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3000.899,3002.443,That I don't know.
1985.84-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3035.15,3037.774,Of course you can be neutral and detached if you've only been to--
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3037.774,3040.162,"--Well, that's true."
1985.84-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3042.49,3043.676,--There are two separate things.
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3054.844,3056.187,"--No, I'm not trying to make that suggestion."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3093.078,3101.67,"Prosecutors, you say, have sort of a derivative immunity; they're part of the judicial process?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3101.67,3103.95,That's the major--
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.95,3113.398,"And you don't ask them how detached the prosecutor is, do you?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3113.398,3113.805,"--No, you don't."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.805,3119.349,And you don't ask... in Butz was there also a charging party involved there?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3119.349,3120.318,"Yes, there was."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3120.318,3121.302,Absolute immunity?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3121.302,3122.644,"Yes, there was."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3122.644,3123.441,Employed by the agency?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3123.441,3125.284,"Yes, because it was linked--"
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3125.284,3126.659,"Not very independent, or not?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3126.659,3128.877,--He wasn't a judge.
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.844,3137.67,"So, there are other things, other than immunity; other things other than independence?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3137.67,3144.606,"Yes, the procedural safeguards, the availability of review... oh, another important one is the use of precedent in the decision."
1985.84-732,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3162.52,3174.843,"Does the historical immunity and practice enter into the calculation, if at common law the prosecutor was absolutely immune?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3178.357,3179.919,It's definitely an important factor.
1985.84-732,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3191.227,3197.444,Have you found any historical immunity in the context of this case in the prison--
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3197.444,3198.864,None.
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3218.481,3224.979,--Would you say that guards who testify at one of these hearings are... just have qualified immunity?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3224.979,3225.479,"Yes, I--"
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3225.479,3228.649,And they wouldn't enjoy witnesses' immunity?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3228.649,3229.024,--No.
1985.84-732,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3331.763,3343.65,"I understood the Government's point to be not so much the flood of litigation, but the impact on the decision making process in the prison, that the close calls would go for the inmate because of fear of suit."
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3343.65,3359.486,"--Yes, I think that's an untenable position, Your Honor, in the sense that if you're starting out with someone who's independent, who's in the middle, if you've got three forces, you've got a prosecutor, you've got a defendant, you've got a judge and you can see that in all the kinds of situations that get the immunity."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.916,3388.615,"Your answer is, yes, that would be the result and it's the result that should take place, namely that more cases would be decided for the prisoner?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3388.615,3390.302,"--Well, I--"
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3390.302,3392.614,That's the result and that's exactly what you intend?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3392.614,3397.159,--The result that I intend is that it be deterrence from unconstitutional conduct.
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.159,3399.986,That just puts it another way.
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3399.986,3411.856,"Yes, and I think that what I'm saying is that in this circumstance, yes, when you look at the other side, the flip side of the coin of deterrence, I suppose is the Government's argument of harassment."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3460.93,3467.334,What was the grounds in the administrative appeal for setting aside this--
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3467.334,3470.613,"--Well, that was a debate in the--"
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3470.613,3472.082,--Or did they write something?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3472.754,3478.08,"--Well, at the trial Warden Benson testified."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3478.08,3478.658,--The administrative--
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3478.658,3481.484,The administrative paper itself.
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3481.484,3481.922,--Yes.
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3483.093,3486.857,"The reason, I think, that they gave was that due process was violated."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3486.857,3488.308,"In what respect, did they say?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3488.308,3494.291,I can't swear to whether they said because they brought those new charges in the middle of the hearing.
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3494.291,3496.416,How did he testify at the--
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3496.416,3506.864,"At trial, what I was trying to establish through the regulations was that he... that they expunged because he was innocent, because the regulations said that's the only way you can do it."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3521.765,3525.17,"--So, what did you claim in that trial, what the due process violation was?"
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3525.17,3539.554,"The due process violations that we claimed were the fact that during the hearing itself they brought two new charges which did not conform to the evidence, did not give him any notice of them, and proceeded to try him on it and convict him of it right there on the spot."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3539.554,3540.695,And is that what the jury found?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3540.695,3541.085,Yes.
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3553.783,3556.656,They just said due process?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3556.656,3563.826,"--They said due process, period, but they were instructed on the Wolff standards that were clearly established as of the time of this trial."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3577.132,3582.926,But there has never been a determination that what he was charged with he didn't do?
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3582.926,3586.644,"No, that would be the Carey versus Piphus question."
1985.84-732,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3591.673,3593.595,"I wouldn't think they would have, yes."
1985.84-732,1,26174,g_flint_taylor_jr,,3593.595,3604.903,"And it was... the evidence was so clear, Your Honor, that in fact what he was doing, and if you read the record of the proceeding, that's all they're concerned about is his First Amendment rights."
