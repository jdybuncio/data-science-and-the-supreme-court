1967.49,0,37058,norton_j_come,,46.492,50.294,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.49,1,32880,justice_stewart:,,297.088,299.457,No questions that this is an economic strike?
1967.49,2,37058,norton_j_come,,299.457,303.325,"There is no question that it was an economic strike, not an unfair labor --"
1967.49,3,32880,justice_stewart:,,303.325,304.48,Not on unfair labor practice?
1967.49,4,37058,norton_j_come,,304.48,306.541,That is right Your Honor.
1967.49,5,32880,justice_stewart:,,388.05,397.709,"Isn't that -- Mr. Come, am I wrong in thinking that maybe the basis you view here is one of fact."
1967.49,6,37058,norton_j_come,,438.224,440.178,"No, Your Honor."
1967.49,7,32880,justice_stewart:,,479.043,504.254,"Well, you would not say would you that if the jobs had been abolished or -- and more predominantly if the -- if there had been permanent replacement hired, you wouldn't -- you would have -- you would not say that the refusal -- if they hire these applicants, it would have been an unfair labor practice, wasn't it?"
1967.49,8,37058,norton_j_come,,506.705,517.381,"Now, the -- under the Board decision, the Board was not have found that the refusal to take them back when they first applied in August would be an unfair labor practice."
1967.49,9,32880,justice_stewart:,,526.468,527.133,Permanent replacement --
1967.49,10,37058,norton_j_come,,527.133,528.341,A permanent replacement --
1967.49,11,32880,justice_stewart:,,528.341,529.453,And economic strike --
1967.49,12,37058,norton_j_come,,529.453,532.813,Or a permanent job abolition --
1967.49,12,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.813,533.678,Right.
1967.49,12,37058,norton_j_come,,533.678,535.678,The Board would not have found a violation --
1967.49,13,32880,justice_stewart:,,535.678,538.162,They tell you to hire these people was not a fair labor practice.
1967.49,14,37058,norton_j_come,,538.162,555.522,"Now, what you had here was nothing like that and it is so substantially different on those two situations and we submit that it does present a very basic legal question."
1967.49,14,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,864.208,901.031,"Oh, are you -- are you suggesting that this was a thought (Inauidble) the aftermath of most strikes at least its production doesn't start automatically as descending take -- that they ask the striker and that the -- for that reason, there has been no room for the strikers for the turn of the -- takings (Inaudible) and they were entitled to have those positions, Is that the kind of situation (Inaudible)?"
1967.49,14,37058,norton_j_come,,901.031,925.834,"That is the kind of situation they think Your Honor because what I'm getting through now and the last analysis, what we have here is a problem of balancing the action of the employer against its effects upon the rights to strike."
1967.49,15,32880,justice_stewart:,,1245.636,1246.084,(Inaudible)
1967.49,16,37058,norton_j_come,,1246.088,1254.974,I understand Your Honor.
1967.49,16,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1254.974,1263.181,(Inaudible)
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1263.181,1267.645,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1967.49,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.809,1335.678,What was the page (Inaudible) for your second quotation.
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1335.678,1343.056,The second quotation appears at page 101 of the record Your Honor.
1967.49,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1343.056,1358.631,(Inaudible) the fact that there were 71 jobs that the -- when the strike was settled and only 68 when these people applied for reinstatement?
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1358.631,1361.331,"Well, we take two positions on that sir."
1967.49,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1430.134,1439.692,So three replacements -- there had been -- three openings had been created out of the 71 jobs that were in existence at the end of the strike.
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1439.692,1440.14,That's right.
1967.49,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1440.14,1448.325,"Now, did the Labor Board or the deal with -- what you -- what that would mean is a difference between three of these people and three others?"
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1448.325,1450.084,"That's right, the Labor Board --"
1967.49,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1450.084,1451.256,Did they deal with that at all?
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1451.256,1453.593,The Labor Board did not deal with it.
1967.49,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.432,1472.909,"But what do you do with the fact that five months later, you were back to prestrike levels, just like you at all -- like you're plan -- said the -- that he is intended to be --"
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1472.909,1473.241,Well --
1967.49,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1473.241,1475.422,-- as soon as possible.
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1475.422,1482.262,Five months is a long time Your Honor in the industrial market.
1967.49,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1509.222,1518.233,"Well there's evidence, is that -- there's evidence that the -- that your client intended to get back to prestrike level as soon as possible."
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1518.233,1519.359,That's right Your Honor.
1967.49,17,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1550.07,1562.772,"Mr. Scallon, do I gather that if these were in fact a situation of temporary unavailability, you would concede that the Board order should have been enforced?"
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1562.772,1563.336,"Oh, yes sir."
1967.49,17,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1563.982,1568.483,"Well, now -- except for three people?"
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1568.483,1569.669,That is right Your Honor --
1967.49,17,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1569.669,1570.003,Well now --
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1570.003,1571.766,That stipulation appears in the record in this brief.
1967.49,17,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1571.766,1584.295,"Well, I would have take the Board finding in that respect as a finding that this was a temporary unavailability situation."
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1584.295,1585.812,I feel that -- that was their finding of the fact.
1967.49,17,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1585.812,1595.22,"Well then -- then I gather the -- on the Universal Camera, the only issue for the Court of Appeals are that whether there was substantial evidence to support that finding?"
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1595.22,1596.268,That's right sir.
1967.49,17,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1596.268,1597.932,Is that what this case contend to?
1967.49,17,28082,hugh_j_scallon,,1597.932,1598.709,Yes sir.
1967.49,18,37058,norton_j_come,,2560.821,2560.892,Well --
1967.49,18,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2560.892,2570.183,"-- Mr. Scallon had suggested, nothing except a question whether the Court of Appeals correctly applied Universal Camera."
1967.49,18,37058,norton_j_come,,2574.062,2577.01,I intended to answer that question first Your Honor.
1967.49,18,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2688.543,2710.473,"Well, I gather Mr. Come that -- these were on the -- the Universal Camera problem, perhaps I shouldn't say again, do you or do you not agree -- if only Universal Camera then -- right or wrong is -- does Universal Camera contemplates with you (Inaudible) into your case?"
1967.49,18,37058,norton_j_come,,2710.473,2711.444,I think that's right.
1967.49,18,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2726.003,2728.34,Have we done that often?
1967.49,18,37058,norton_j_come,,2728.34,2729.98,"No, you have not done it often."
1967.49,18,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2729.98,2746.445,"I thought that the issue was not what you read or I think a hundred (Inaudible) would compensate a 101 in the mind of the Court of Appeals, I mean, if the record demonstrates that the jobs has been abolished and absorbed in an indefinite time?"
1967.49,18,37058,norton_j_come,,2746.445,2762.852,"Well, I submit to Your Honor that the reason they made that finding is because they were operating under the erroneous legal principle that they set forth on page a 100 before they get to that conclusion."
1967.49,18,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2762.852,2769.15,"But if that was true, that the jobs had been abolished, as soon as it is -- as a fact then there would be no issue here (Inaudible)?"
1967.49,18,37058,norton_j_come,,2769.15,2773.77,"That is correct, there would be no violation either."
1967.49,18,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2802.515,2802.56,"Well, what about the --"
1967.49,18,37058,norton_j_come,,2802.56,2802.662,-- three --
1967.49,18,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2802.662,2809.409,-- when they hired the -- they were pretty short with what they had when the strikers --
1967.49,18,37058,norton_j_come,,2809.409,2811.722,"Well, with respect to that Your Honor --"
1967.49,18,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2811.722,2813.168,Don't you have to deal with that?
1967.49,18,37058,norton_j_come,,2813.168,2834.186,"Well, I think that the Court has dealt with it by finding that none of the people that were hired during the strike were replacements for any of the strikers because the company did not indicate that they had replaced any particular striker and who was in the process of expanding its workforce."
1967.49,18,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2842.06,2858.202,"Yes, but you'll have to admit, it is -- you have to say that none of the strikers could have gotten the company to replace any of the 71 people that they had on the payroll in the strike whether they were replacements or whether they were returning -- strikers who had returned."
1967.49,18,37058,norton_j_come,,2858.202,2858.892,"No, but the point is --"
1967.49,18,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2858.892,2863.197,"Isn't that raised, isn't that right?"
1967.49,18,37058,norton_j_come,,2863.197,2865.026,"Well, that is correct but the --"
1967.49,18,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.026,2876.352,"Well, then the company does the way of either three people lie -- die or leave or something, three of those 71 jobs, there are some strikers have first (Inaudible)."
1967.49,18,37058,norton_j_come,,2876.352,2889.128,Because the strikers' jobs were not filled because the company had a work compliment of a 108 before the strike and they were going to a 108 at all times and they ultimately reached that.
1967.49,19,32880,justice_stewart:,,2916.237,2918.198,"I'd say, last in, first out."
1967.49,20,37058,norton_j_come,,2918.198,2918.787,That is correct.
1967.49,21,32880,justice_stewart:,,2971.518,2979.442,As I understand there is no disagreement between counsel on that legal question at all?
1967.49,22,37058,norton_j_come,,2979.442,2980.656,On what --
1967.49,23,32880,justice_stewart:,,2980.656,2985.085,"It's a -- if strikers have been permanently replaced -- an economic strike, and there's a"
1967.49,24,37058,norton_j_come,,2985.085,2985.516,-- That is correct.
1967.49,25,32880,justice_stewart:,,2985.516,2986.312,-- to rehire --
1967.49,26,37058,norton_j_come,,2986.312,2986.698,That is correct.
1967.49,27,32880,justice_stewart:,,2986.698,2990.565,"If they have not been -- and it's an economic strike, and they apply, then there is a duty to rehire."
1967.49,28,37058,norton_j_come,,2993.459,2995.547,On that issue the --
1967.49,29,32880,justice_stewart:,,2999.635,3001.324,"Yes, but you're not espousing that position are you?"
1967.49,30,37058,norton_j_come,,3001.324,3003.785,"No, we are not espousing that position."
