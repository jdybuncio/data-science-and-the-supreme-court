1965.67,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.231,"Paul Theodore Cheff, Petitioner, versus Elmer J. Schnackenberg et al."
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,10.666,14.385,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.67,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,99.273,108.614,"We'll inquire of the Solicitor General on -- when he makes his argument as to the propriety of it, Mr. Casey."
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,108.614,123.647,This case arose out of a Federal Trade Commission cease and desist order against Holland Furnace Company.
1965.67,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,488.103,491.916,"Mr. Casey, I'm a little confused about the dates."
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,500.38,525.06,"No, the Holland Furnace Company was taken over in May 1962 and on July 27th, 1962, the Holland Furnace Company did all of these things, discharged the salesmen, the branch -- the branch officers and so forth, on July 27th, 1962."
1965.67,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,525.06,533.176,And when did -- did the petitioner continued with the new company for any period of time on new management?
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,533.176,550.559,"Well, the business continued under the new management and the Holland Furnace Company the petition for certiorari, which was denied, but stated that it had some furnaces on hand and some bills to collect, and so forth."
1965.67,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,562.772,569.742,"I'm sorry to take your time but when did the petitioner's connection with the company terminated, if it did?"
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,569.742,571.628,May 1962.
1965.67,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,571.628,578.377,"May 1962 and did he then cease to be an officer, director -- or director?"
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,578.377,579.316,That is correct Justice Fortas.
1965.67,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,579.316,582.162,Did he -- was he a stockholder?
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,582.162,583.8,I think he may have been a stockholder.
1965.67,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,583.8,586.614,Was he a large stockholder?
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,588.026,590.098,I don't think the record show he was a large stockholder.
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,906.354,912.777,"Mr. Casey, am I looking at the right paragraph four at page 2?"
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,912.777,914.945,That's Your Honor the transcript of the record?
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,914.945,916.963,Yes.
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,925.272,926.671,That is right.
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,938.001,940.01,May I ask [Inaudible]
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,940.01,940.802,Yes Your Honor.
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,940.802,945.962,"I thought you said earlier, the order was addressed -- coming to the company by mail?"
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,968.287,970.242,That's the Commission's --
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,970.242,970.994,Go on.
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,970.994,972.478,-- cease and desist order.
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,972.478,974.472,Or the -- are you making a distinction --
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,974.472,975.575,That the Court of Appeals' --
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,975.575,976.004,[Inaudible]
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,976.004,982.216,-- cease and desist order did not represent anything but the company.
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,982.216,983.041,With -- where is that?
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,987.758,992.603,"That's the August 5th, 1959 on page --"
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,992.603,993.049,Page 3 and 4 --
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,993.049,994.928,-- three.
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,994.928,995.056,Yes.
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,995.216,997.328,"Versus Holland Furnace Company, yes."
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,998.49,1007.657,"[Inaudible] that's an order and your point is that the Commission sought enforcement, sought enforcement only as respect to the company, is that it?"
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1007.657,1016.129,Yes Justice Brennan that's exactly my position.
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1116.69,1122.83,What kind of a hearing was held in [Inaudible]
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1122.83,1130.907,"This hearing with respect to the petitioner and the 11 respondents, there was a hearing and --"
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1130.907,1134.346,I understand that you -- you demanded a jury trial but was denied?
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1134.346,1144.228,"There was a hearing and -- but previous to that hearing, I would like to state --"
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1144.228,1145.075,[Inaudible]
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1145.075,1149.843,-- state --
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1149.843,1159.987,"No, don't interrupt your course of argument, [Inaudible]"
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1159.987,1212.432,"That there was a -- that the petitioner filed a general denial and the attorneys for the Federal Trade Commission appointed by the Court to prosecute who initiated this proceeding were apparently disturbed by the fact that it was a general denial, because on page 12 of the report, the prosecution's reply to answer says, ""Come now the attorneys appointed to prosecute on behalf of the court"" and by way of reply to the answer filed herein on August 26th, 1963 by respondent Paul Theodore Cheff, respectfully advised the court that said respondent has by said answer, denied each and all allegations in the petition filed herein by court appointed counsel on April 19th, 1963."
1965.67,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1512.129,1515.765,What about the -- at page 18 of the record where it says --
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1515.765,1520.931,"That's -- in the record, page 18 Justice Clark?"
1965.67,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1520.931,1521.532,Where --
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1521.532,1523.098,"At 19, at page 19."
1965.67,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1523.098,1541.145,"It's not on the page, his answer to the petition Holland Furnace admits the conduct of its employees in 15 transactions, violating 25 different violations involving the following [Inaudible] violated the order of -- 1959 order."
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1544.19,1546.043,"Justice Clark, what page were you reading from?"
1965.67,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1546.043,1548.057,Page 18 of the record.
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1578.335,1581.776,That is -- the Holland Furnace Company admits.
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1628.879,1640.493,"Well, obviously the company could not have -- the company has not [Inaudible] and I see at page 20, this conclusion of the Court of Appeals."
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1669.573,1672.948,"Oh, there's no question about what they -- they needn't be abundant evidence."
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1677.437,1685.499,"I just wonder, who could have made these admissions on behalf of Holland?"
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1685.499,1686.92,I don't think that was an admission.
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1691.419,1698.657,"Well, if this is -- as Justice Clark has referred to you, Holland Furnace Company admits the violation."
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1702.439,1705.693,"Well, I have no idea who made those in behalf of Holland?"
1965.67,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1705.693,1721.04,"And the point is, you have Holland, according to the record, admitted 15 violations, but only have [Inaudible] about the board and the top [Inaudible] about the violations?"
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1740.712,1751.625,I think that petition by the Federal Trade Commission attorneys was instituted at a much later date.
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1766.726,1782.074,"Is there anything in this Mr. Casey, I noticed at the top of page 17, the Court of Appeals said -- Commission's order was directed, was it not, aid as well as [Inaudible]"
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1782.074,1783.259,That's right Justice Brennan.
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1783.259,1800.439,"The Court of Appeals says, the Commission's order is enforced by this Court's August 5, 1959 order, remained in full force and effect and was made permanent by this Court's affirmance of the Commission order of November 7, 1961."
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1821.6,1824.27,That's -- that is correct Justice Brennan.
1965.67,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1824.949,1827.861,Your point is that's not enough of a ground of criminal contempt.
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1827.861,1843.066,"The August 5th has not enough ground for criminal contempt and my point is that in all these administrative agency proceedings in National Labor Relation Board, it should be wholly civil."
1965.67,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1843.694,1846.451,"Mr. Casey, may I detain you a moment."
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1856.462,1857.457,"That is correct, Justice Fortas."
1965.67,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1857.457,1863.741,So that the admissions on behalf of the company may have been authorized by the new management.
1965.67,0,29373,joseph_e_casey,,1863.741,1866.025,That is correct.
1965.67,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1877.536,1883.486,Mr. Lewin.
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1883.486,1887.325,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1955.332,1967.682,"Mr. Lewin, does that go so far as to suggest that the order should not give one notice to the fact that the -- this conduct may come within its scope?"
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1967.682,1969.214,"No Mr. Justice Brennan, we think that --"
1965.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1969.214,1970.873,Then it has to go up [Inaudible]
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1970.873,1975.472,The order certainly has to go that far and we think the order in this case certainly did go that far.
1965.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1975.629,1977.923,The order the court [Inaudible]
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1977.923,1978.704,Yes.
1965.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1978.704,1986.605,"And that is the sentence -- Mr. Casey is right about it, that that is at least in turn, that that's only to the company, is that right?"
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,1986.605,1992.016,The company was the only party at the -- before the Court.
1965.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2004.967,2020.599,"Well, for whatever its worth, the order that the petitioner is charged with having violated, therefore guilty of contempt, does not in turn -- does not it turn [Inaudible]"
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2020.599,2022.708,The Court of Appeals' order is not Mr. Justice Brennan.
1965.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2022.708,2027.08,That's the one to which -- with the contempt [Inaudible]
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2027.08,2041.748,"Well, we think though that there's one distinction that should be borne in mind in this regard, and that is that the petitioner was convicted not of directly violating this order, but of aiding and abetting the corporation and of causing the corporation to violate the order."
1965.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2041.748,2044.032,Now where is aiding and abetting acts?
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2044.032,2047.959,"Well, not aiding and abetting in the sense necessarily --"
1965.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2047.959,2049.737,It's not a crime [Inaudible] --
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2049.737,2057.984,"Well, we think those who assist or who cause to violate -- a violation of a court order are -- have themselves committed contempt."
1965.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2094.562,2096.275,Is that a criminal contempt case?
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2096.275,2098.31,"I don't think it was a criminal contempt case, no."
1965.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2098.31,2099.627,[Inaudible]
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2099.627,2100.537,"Yes, it was a criminal --"
1965.67,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2100.537,2103.004,A crime [Inaudible]
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2103.004,2109.297,"Well, but -- that the -- that's true Mr. Justice Brennan but we think that the Court did say that they may be punished contempt in that case."
1965.67,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2133.068,2133.788,"Mr. Lewin, there is a (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2133.788,2135.26,"Mr. Lewin, (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.67,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2135.26,2136.076,I beg your pardon sir.
1965.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2136.076,2137.236,Go right ahead.
1965.67,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2137.236,2146.751,"There's been a reference here to an order of the court, I take it of November, I guess November of 1959."
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2152.106,2162.802,"The order of which petitioner was convicted of having violated was a pendente lite order Mr. Justice Fortas, that was entered in April of 1959."
1965.67,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2178.225,2183.904,"Well, I understand that but there is a claim --"
1965.67,1,37177,nathan_lewin,,2183.904,2184.878,"I'm sorry, August 1959."
