1978.78-5414,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,94.553,We'll hear arguments next in Wolston against Reader's Digest.
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,112.721,114.643,Thank you.
1978.78-5414,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,295.578,303.576,"Mr. Dickstein, could I ask you the same question I asked counsel in the case preceding, then the source of law is District of Columbia law?"
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,303.576,309.359,The source of law in so far as federal issues are not concerned and is of course the District of Columbia.
1978.78-5414,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,309.359,312.677,The basic right rise out of the District of Columbia law.
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,312.677,317.695,"That is correct, it does."
1978.78-5414,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,494.576,512.61,Isn't it the rule on summary judgment that where a party defendant makes an affidavit that he's not only got -- you have right to depose him but that the District Court has to resolve issues against him if they are triable issues of fact?
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,512.61,519.511,"That is the normal rule of course, but that is not the rule that was followed by the courts below."
1978.78-5414,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,528.86,529.824,Then what's the basis for --
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,529.824,531.43,-- than matters involving libel.
1978.78-5414,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,531.43,535.679,What's the basis for any different rule on a libel case?
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,535.679,558.592,"It seems to have been suggested that the very existence, persistence if you would of a lawsuit which can otherwise be nipped in the bud at an early stage, has a chilling and inhibiting effect upon the press which is force to continue to defend that case from the normal processes of trial."
1978.78-5414,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.385,636.77,Did you seek to the fullest ground?
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,636.77,639.329,"We did in fact oppose him, Your Honor."
1978.78-5414,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,639.329,644.868,And they nonetheless chose to believe his statement without a trial of fact?
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,644.868,649.496,That is correct precisely.
1978.78-5414,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,671.514,689.612,"In your view, is the issue of whether or not a person is a public figure invariably a fact issue for a jury?"
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,700.184,712.973,"Your Honor, we argued in the courts below that the question of whether one is or is not a public figure in a close case would be a question for a jury."
1978.78-5414,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,861.197,869.988,"Counsel, your argument now centers on 1958 as well as on 1974, does it not?"
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,869.988,870.416,"Yes, it does."
1978.78-5414,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,870.416,879.928,"If you lose on the form or if he were a public figure in 1958, have you abandoned the argument that he ceased to be one in 1974?"
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,879.928,881.376,"Yes, we have."
1978.78-5414,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,881.376,885.231,Could I ask why?
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,887.617,893.323,"Yes, we did, Your Honor."
1978.78-5414,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,960.053,974.75,Would it -- would the passage of time also serve to impose on the defendants a greater measure of operation in the recklessness concept?
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,974.75,977.37,"We think so and certainly so, in fact --"
1978.78-5414,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,977.37,980.643,"Well, haven't you lost that by abandoning your argument?"
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,980.643,995.684,"No, we don't -- as a matter of fact, it's raised in our reply brief, Your Honor, because in determining what is reasonable care if that is to be the standard if negligence is applicable here."
1978.78-5414,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1078.576,1080.391,You say you filed a reply brief?
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1080.391,1081.16,"Yes, we did, Your Honor."
1978.78-5414,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1081.16,1082.547,I don't seem to have it.
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1082.547,1085.156,This is being in form of porous case.
1978.78-5414,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1171.114,1178.602,Well doesn't that approach really restrict the public figure to those who indulge in political speech?
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1178.602,1180.753,Not at all.
1978.78-5414,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1270.178,1273.019,We'll resume there at 1 o'clock Mr. Dickstein.
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1273.019,1291.249,Thank you.
1978.78-5414,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1291.249,1299.306,Mr. Dickstein you are going to rest at this point and reserve?
1978.78-5414,0,41207,sidney_dickstein,,1299.306,1300.855,And reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
1978.78-5414,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1300.855,1301.824,Very well.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1306.754,1311.316,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1321.969,1326.085,That isn't the only thing -- the only definition or was it?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1326.085,1328.019,That's correct Your Honor there are other definitions.
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1366.699,1368.194,In what year was that?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1368.194,1371.243,In 1958.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1395.439,1407.302,I think that is generally the case that a person who engages in criminal conduct will result in being a public figure at least for a limited range of issues relating to his conviction.
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1408.332,1410.271,Well what if he's acquitted?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1410.271,1414.066,"Your Honor, if he's acquitted then it poses a more difficult question."
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.74,1435.949,Well Mr. Buckley you said he remains -- he's a public figure for a narrow range of issues.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1457.703,1463.082,"Well I would say, Your Honor, that he would not be a public figure for the purposes of comment for example --"
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1463.082,1466.363,But although he might be with respect to his -- the 1958 episode.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1466.363,1466.871,That's right.
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1480.838,1486.82,You mean he remains a public figure if he were accused of being a Soviet agent today?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1488.258,1491.577,"Well I think in this case, of course, one need not reach that result."
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.577,1496.672,I know but your statement awhile ago indicated that yes he would be a public figure.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1496.672,1508.424,"If the statement was to the effect that he was in the 50's and remains today, I would submit that he would be a public figure for those purposes because the controversy is an ongoing one."
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.884,1512.775,Well he's never been heard of since.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1512.775,1519.835,"Well, of course again in this case were limited to his -- it's limited to historical comments on what he was in the 1950's."
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1519.835,1520.939,Alright.
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1520.939,1526.725,How many people are usually arrested in New York City in any one day?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1526.725,1527.704,"Your Honor, I have no idea."
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1529.918,1531.622,Would they all be public figures?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1531.622,1533.229,I think they would all be public figures for the purposes --
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1533.229,1537.369,"Well for the record, I can't remember the name of one of them."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1537.369,1539.323,Well if one looks at the rationale --
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1539.323,1542.959,How do they become a public figure nobody ever heard of them?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1542.959,1552.158,"Well certainly after their conviction they are, I would submit, a public figure for the purposes of comments on their criminal conduct in which they engaged."
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1552.158,1554.965,If they never reached the newspapers?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1554.965,1555.896,No because of the nature of criminal conduct --
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1555.896,1560.034,If they've never -- yes if they never reached the newspapers?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1560.034,1560.824,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1560.824,1560.931,They've been --
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1560.931,1562.587,Even if they never reach the newspaper.
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1563.09,1566.143,What do you mean by public?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1566.143,1566.531,Pardon me?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1566.531,1568.408,What do you mean by public?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1568.408,1569.005,Well first of all --
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1569.005,1570.636,"Public, what do you mean by that?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1570.636,1571.017,That's right.
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1577.849,1582.85,You mean a public controversy is that when a man is charged with a crime?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1582.85,1583.665,That's right.
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1587.375,1591.928,"Well this -- my case, my hypothetical is no controversy if he pleaded guilty."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1591.928,1592.963,"He pleaded guilty, correct."
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1592.963,1595.355,So there's no -- it takes controversy out doesn't it?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1595.355,1598.925,Well by the guilty plea he has confessed that he engaged in voluntary conduct that was criminal.
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1598.925,1600.923,So he becomes a public figure?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1600.923,1602.293,Yes.
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1602.293,1604.816,And nobody ever heard of him.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1604.816,1607.761,I don't think it makes any difference for the following reasons that --
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1607.761,1610.83,"That -- I mean Firestone didn't even go that far, did it?"
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1610.83,1616.0,Well if you mean if no one ever heard about a person they are still a public figure?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1616.0,1617.761,Of course we say to begin with --
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1617.761,1618.793,"Well, I mean why --"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1618.793,1619.684,-- in this case --
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1619.684,1622.066,-- his mother and father know about him.
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1622.71,1623.19,Doesn't say it.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1623.19,1629.912,But he say the police were aware of his actions because that resulted in his arrest and eventually in his conviction.
1978.78-5414,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1666.732,1671.681,Do you say that was an instance of his injecting himself into a controversy intentionally?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1671.681,1673.357,"Yes, I would say so."
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1712.399,1719.302,"But if he complied with the subpoena, he might get a lot more publicity than if he refused to comply, isn't that a possibility?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1719.302,1738.691,But his conduct could not be said to be as it can fairly be here to have been on such a nature as to have invited defamatory comments as to have opened the door to speculation on the basis for his refusal to comply with the subpoena.
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1738.691,1742.697,Now you use the phrase invite defamatory comments.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1745.402,1767.697,"I think when one engages in conduct which inevitably attracts by its very nature, public comment and attention, and especially when that conduct is criminal conduct that it invites people to discuss his actions particularly where that conduct is committed in the midst of a federal investigation into Soviet espionage."
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1789.499,1796.018,"You merely mean he invites discussion, not defamation."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1796.018,1796.168,"Well, I did say that no --"
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1796.168,1798.332,It does invite somebody to tell a lie --
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1798.332,1799.281,I would say your observation --
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1799.281,1801.892,It does invite somebody to tell a lie?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1801.892,1807.995,I would say Your Honor's observation is true in every case of a public figure including someone who runs for office.
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1854.148,1857.531,"Now, he is an American citizen, is he not?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1857.531,1859.357,"Yes, Your Honor, he is."
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.357,1887.218,"Now if you were to say that it's an American citizen who is asked to help in an inquiry into foreign espionage refuses to assist the United States Government, then I can understand your argument that he has at least, if invited is not the right word, he has -- he must take into account that that will attract a lot of attention."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1889.614,1897.571,"Certainly a person who engages in criminal conduct to refuse to bear a subpoena, invites comment on his actions."
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1917.741,1920.997,"Well, certainly that wasn't public."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1920.997,1924.182,"It was at the time of the arrest, the culmination --"
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1924.182,1928.52,The FBI's probing was public?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1928.52,1931.575,It became public in January 1957 when --
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1931.575,1932.933,And it's after the fact?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1932.933,1934.384,"No, it's before the fact."
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1935.189,1936.0,Before the fact?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1936.0,1937.456,"Before the fact, because --"
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1937.456,1943.369,"When the CIA too, I read it, I mean I didn't -- I thought these were secret outfits."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1943.369,1945.711,Well the investigation had been going on for ten years.
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1948.25,1950.607,"The Soble's were secret, but you said it was public."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,1950.607,1955.019,It was a controversy that was going on because there was an investigation.
1978.78-5414,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2004.343,2011.262,"Well it sounds like that's the metro media plurality test, if it whatever attracts public attention, make somebody a public figure."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2011.262,2027.375,"Now, for this reason that we're not relying here only on the fact that this conduct attained publicity, but on the fact that the conduct by its nature invariably attracted, invited and compelled comment and attention."
1978.78-5414,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2035.499,2039.837,"But I would've meant a voluntary, I mean that they deliberately invite them."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2039.837,2041.092,"Well, let's examine that."
1978.78-5414,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.815,2098.84,"It's a dicey task to determine actual malice under the New York Times standard too, isn't it?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2098.84,2099.292,That's right.
1978.78-5414,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2214.778,2223.758,Precisely that same dichotomy is involved in his libel defendants with 20 newspapers who all published the same story.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2238.336,2253.931,"Well here in both instances by the same degree, the conduct engaged in by the public actor, either in mounting a rostrum or in engaging in conduct which criminal conduct which attracts publicity is the same."
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2324.272,2329.678,"Mr. Buckley, your analogy to mounting a rostrum prompts me to ask this question."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2356.343,2356.516,The public --
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2356.516,2359.51,Is it something that could be resolved by the public?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2359.51,2364.991,The public controversy was the controversy over Soviet espionage and the actions --
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2364.991,2366.087,What was the controversy?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2370.23,2377.802,I don't think that the term necessarily means that it's limited to some matter that is about to be put to a referendum.
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2377.802,2383.922,Well isn't it supposedly a controversy over a debatable issue on which people in the public might disagree.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2386.201,2405.486,"Well I think that under that statement it qualifies as well, because in all instances, particularly in this instance where we had a ten-year investigation by the FBI into Soviet espionage, actions by the grand jury spanning well over a year and a half."
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2409.217,2411.172,What was the public controversy?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2411.172,2422.785,"The controversy was over the propriety of the actions by the public officials running the investigation, by the grand jury conducting it."
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2425.8,2430.269,The matters of public controversy over whether the investigation was being conducted properly?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2430.269,2430.72,That's right.
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2430.72,2433.184,And what did he had to do with that controversy?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2433.184,2448.138,Because he became an activist for the purpose of ensuring that the grand jury did not obtain his testimony regarding Soviet espionage and did so by his own voluntary conduct.
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2448.138,2467.826,"Going back a bit, I don't have the timeframe in mind but in the middle 50's, was there a great deal of controversy, public controversy over the methods being used to investigate Soviet espionage --"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2467.826,2467.946,Yes.
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2467.946,2469.46,-- and borderline conduct?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2469.46,2469.985,Certainly so.
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2469.985,2472.444,Is that the kind of controversy you're talking about?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2472.444,2473.146,Let me say to begin with.
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2473.146,2476.684,"Criticism of the FBI for example, under the CIA?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2476.684,2499.619,"That certainly could be that let me say to begin with though that anytime the government takes actions particularly in the context of an investigation of Soviet espionage, there is a matter pertaining to the affairs of governance about which the public a right to be informed."
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2515.342,2519.092,"Well, it wasn't that broad, in the setting of that case."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2519.092,2519.343,Right.
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2522.309,2524.298,That particular case was not a public controversy.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2524.298,2526.939,"Right, that's correct."
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2569.814,2570.949,How public was he?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2572.669,2575.484,Well there were 15 newspapers that were published at the time.
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2575.484,2578.154,"When did you first hear about Mr. Wolston, you?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2578.154,2579.149,"Me, personally?"
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2579.149,2580.853,Yes.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2585.062,2586.207,He never came into my office though.
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2586.207,2589.845,But did you take deposition?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2589.845,2592.922,"I was not in the case at the time that the deposition was taken, so I came to this case --"
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2592.922,2594.56,"Well, was that the first time you heard of him?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2594.56,2595.009,Pardon me?
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2595.009,2596.545,Was that the first time you ever heard of him?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2596.545,2604.226,"I suppose if I had been a better student and had read more widely in the area, I'd be able to give Your Honor a response that I did know about him."
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2604.226,2608.257,Because my next question would be to name one other one that was involved.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2608.257,2611.334,Well let me put it in this way.
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2628.042,2634.762,"It's ironic, you know, to think of someone trying to conceal his activities as a spy being a public figure."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2634.762,2635.503,Well I don't think it's --
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2635.503,2636.152,And that's why I did not --
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2636.152,2645.339,"-- I don't think it's ironic at all, it's because espionage inevitably invites and attracts publicity that it must be done covertly."
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2663.727,2669.223,Mr. Buckley -- if you really know all about this person then you'd know he really belonged in the public domain.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2669.223,2670.595,"That's right, that's right."
1978.78-5414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2670.595,2672.805,"Have you read the petitioner's reply brief, Mr. Buckley?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2672.805,2673.289,"Yes, I have."
1978.78-5414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2673.289,2678.211,"I asked you because I'd not read it until the lunch hour, I had not seen it."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2725.18,2733.493,I don't think in each and every case someone who is a public figure under privacy law is so the purposes of libel law as well.
1978.78-5414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2764.837,2788.849,"Well that's -- and to be sure, when the petitioner resisted the subpoena and didn't appear, there could've been legitimate reporting of that fact, and he would've had no right to hold anybody liable for reporting it because he'd lost his privacy pro tanto."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2795.13,2796.916,I don't think it follows in each and every case.
1978.78-5414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2808.739,2825.773,"And one can understand if a person becomes a candidate for governor or mayor or president or indeed if he's elected to any one of those offices he is a public figure and he does invite adverse criticism, some of which will be false probably."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2851.908,2858.003,"I think he has, because the conduct by its very nature attracts attention and notoriety, criminal conduct, I think always --"
1978.78-5414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2858.003,2860.296,When you're reporting a fact.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2860.296,2863.092,"Well, but these are the earmarks of public figure status under Gertz."
1978.78-5414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2863.092,2867.173,"No, running for office is quite a different thing, isn't it or holding public office?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2867.173,2875.699,Well he creates the enhanced possibility by criminal conduct of the very types of comments about which he now complains.
1978.78-5414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2889.454,2897.922,"Do you think they're basically equivalent as so far as the law and the Constitution goes, resisting a subpoena and running for the presidency?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2897.922,2907.03,I wouldn't say that in order to qualify for a public figure one has to almost be a public official.
1978.78-5414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2910.569,2914.789,"Well Mr. Ralph Nader is a public figure but doesn't hold any public office, I suppose."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2914.789,2915.802,That's right.
1978.78-5414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2915.802,2927.669,"What if it's just an ordinary citizen, secretary, clerk and the government is accosted on the street by a policeman who wants to arrest him and has no reason."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2944.53,2947.714,"Well, it would depend on whether he in fact engaged in criminal conduct."
1978.78-5414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2947.714,2947.986,But why?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2947.986,2949.884,"That's what's this case is all about, the commission of criminal conduct."
1978.78-5414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2949.884,2951.989,I know but just what I've said to you.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2951.989,2953.768,And later on --
1978.78-5414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2953.768,2957.525,No court has yet decided whether he is engaged in criminal conduct here.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2957.525,2963.422,"Well, I think that might well depend on an examination of the -- of what happened thereafter."
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2965.134,2972.038,"Mr. Buckley, trying to bring you back to my brother Stewart's point, a very simple question."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,2995.816,2998.087,"If the public controversy was still alive, I think he would still be a --"
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2998.087,3002.458,"No, would that be determined in fact to whether the controversy was still alive?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3002.458,3004.636,Or if the comment pertained to with a --
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3004.636,3008.85,No the comment pertains solely to what he did in 1950.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3008.85,3010.822,"Then he's a public figure for those purposes, yes."
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3010.822,3017.73,And then he went to publish in 1970 as protected even though in 1970 he's in a monastery.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3017.73,3026.115,I think it's impossible to write a book such as KGB without referring to the history of the activities of that agency.
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3038.451,3044.082,Yes but you -- you're injuring a man who is a private figure.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3044.082,3045.238,He's a public figure as I --
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3045.238,3045.918,"No, no."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3049.953,3053.547,He's still a public figure for the limited range of issues relating to his earlier conduct.
1978.78-5414,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3053.547,3054.635,That's your position?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3054.635,3055.214,That is.
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3055.214,3061.265,"Mr. Buckley, would you say he is a public figure if he hadn't been convicted for contempt?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3061.265,3072.506,"I think that would create a much more difficult question, because I'm not saying he would necessarily would not be because the criminal law imposes standards that are different from those and posed for trimming whether someone is a public figure."
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3081.043,3092.703,"Well, if I'm accused of a crime and for some kind of pretrial or during trial conduct, I am convicted of contempt, criminal contempt."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3112.325,3113.837,Well if you're acquitted of the charge --
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.837,3118.023,"Well I know, but I'm -- is it just because I'm convicted for contempt is that enough to --"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3118.023,3119.562,"In this case, it certainly is because the --"
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3119.562,3122.804,"Well in my case, in my case."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3122.804,3127.178,"In your case, the lawyer eventually was not convicted for contempt."
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.178,3133.9,"No, he is convicted of contempt, but he's acquitted of the crime for which he was on trial."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3147.011,3147.733,You are --
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.733,3152.403,Do I -- right then and there become a public figure or was I already just because I was accused?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3152.403,3156.27,"No, after you are convicted to be sure, you --"
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3156.27,3157.224,Of criminal contempt that is.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3157.224,3158.039,Right.
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.039,3163.159,And anything they might say about my guilt for safe cracking is subject to the public figure standard?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3163.159,3165.874,I'm not arguing that here.
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3166.227,3166.976,But you were.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3166.976,3180.125,"But I'm saying that if there was any -- if you became a public figure as result of your conviction for contempt then for purposes of a limited range of comments relating to that contempt, you will be a public figure, not necessarily --"
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3180.125,3181.788,Just about the contempt?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3181.788,3182.9,That's right.
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.9,3192.13,Well then why in this case are you a public figure for anything else except just commenting about your defying a grand jury subpoena?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3192.13,3195.489,"That's what the comment was in effect about, because the failure to comply with the subpoena --"
1978.78-5414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3195.489,3198.157,In the -- about accusing of being a spy?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3198.157,3206.657,"It opened the door to speculation, I would submit for a range of issues relating to possible reasons why he did not comply with the subpoena."
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3235.965,3251.207,Now what if having been convicted either by government employee going home from work and resist arrest or Mr. Justice White's hypothetical case and first there's a conviction for a contempt or whatever.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3254.095,3256.442,"If one engages in criminal conduct, I think it does."
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3256.442,3261.567,"Well now on appeal it's reversed, that is he is a nonpublic figure?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3261.567,3262.671,Not necessarily.
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3263.523,3265.862,You mean you're going to penalize him for taking an appeal?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3265.862,3270.68,Well one can engage in conduct that is not criminal and yet be a public figure.
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3270.68,3278.693,Well but we were dealing with something near to your case what criminal conduct you've described.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3278.693,3279.474,I think that --
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3279.474,3283.504,He certainly can't be in and out as a public figure.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3283.504,3286.987,Always the question is what was the underlying voluntary conduct?
1978.78-5414,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3297.005,3304.414,"Mr. Buckley, it seems to me that you spent a good deal of your time defending an issue that's not before us, as I understand it."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3312.075,3312.638,"No, Your Honor, I don't."
1978.78-5414,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3312.638,3335.402,"As I understand your brief and as I understood the opinion of the District Court and the Court of Appeals, this man became a public figure in the opinion of those courts only because he was convicted of contempt in the context of the great furor in this country that existed at that time with respect to communist espionage."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3338.835,3346.545,"Your Honor, I certainly am just trying to be helpful to the Court -- members of the Court who wanted to broaden the question under examination."
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3367.9,3369.731,Mr. Buckley let me just ask one question.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3386.147,3387.864,I think so especially with respect to --
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3387.864,3396.465,"In other words, the historian should equally have the same latitude to be really be on direct notice of falsehood before he has to be careful about what he says about someone."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3396.465,3397.979,I think for two reasons.
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3401.104,3407.756,"Well would that serve the public's need to know or would it serve the public's need to know to say “Well if you're going to write a history, be careful.”"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3407.756,3410.975,Well in -- nothing in a few are pure history.
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3433.933,3435.972,"But he had four years to write this book, didn't he?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3435.972,3448.894,"He did, indeed explained about four years in writing the book and his reliance was placed upon an official report of the FBI, the accuracy of which had never been called into question until --"
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3448.894,3451.011,"Well, maybe he wasn't -- I'm not suggesting that."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3473.997,3477.2,"Well in the present context, there were more recent activities in the KGB itself."
1978.78-5414,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3477.2,3479.474,"Yes, but this wasn't a recent activity."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3479.474,3488.976,"No this wasn't, but in order to illuminate, give meaning, give context to the discussion of the more recent activities it's necessary to get history."
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3503.933,3517.724,"Well, what might be under Gertz, what might be negligence for a news magazine a weekly news magazine might not be negligence, culpable negligence for a reporter of a daily newspaper --"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3517.724,3518.809,That's certainly true.
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3518.809,3521.008,-- none of you writing a history it strings out.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3521.008,3522.76,Like the where the standard --
1978.78-5414,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3522.76,3528.503,"Well, Mr. Buckley this is why I asked your opponent why he abandoned the passage of time argument."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3528.503,3532.7,"Well, that I think is not relevant as to the standard of liability."
1978.78-5414,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3533.903,3535.599,But that has to be your position.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3535.599,3536.328,I don't -- that's right.
1978.78-5414,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3553.274,3557.788,So long there's recklessness in it there is a difference.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3557.788,3568.406,I don't really think so because the policy underlying the actual malice standard is getting at the calculated falsehood.
1978.78-5414,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3569.088,3587.972,"Mr. Buckley, am I right in understanding Mr. Dickstein and is he right in saying, if I am right in understanding him to say so, that the District Court simply accepted at its face value the affidavit of an interested defendant that he intended no malice and granted judgment on that basis?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3587.972,3589.569,No that's not so.
1978.78-5414,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3625.07,3630.046,But there's no reason why the District Court has to -- should believe that on a motion for summary judgment.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3630.046,3635.244,On a motion for summary judgments if the court can grant summary judgment.
1978.78-5414,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3640.002,3645.158,But an interested party's testimony can always be disbelieved by a jury.
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3645.158,3647.377,"If it stood alone, but it didn't stand alone here."
1978.78-5414,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3673.208,3673.336,Why I would have thought --
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3673.336,3674.812,But much more was involved --
1978.78-5414,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3674.812,3685.139,"Was the burden of proof -- the burden is on the party moving for summary judgment and the credibility of a -- interested witnesses for the jury, do you dispute either of those propositions?"
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3685.139,3685.757,No.
1978.78-5414,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3685.757,3688.16,Well then why should your party grant on summary judgment here?
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3688.16,3694.984,Because there were no contrary inferences which could be fairly drawn from the evidence involved in this case.
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3730.745,3733.826,"I think we've detained you unduly long, Mr. Buckley."
1978.78-5414,1,29267,john_j_buckley_jr,,3733.826,3734.611,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.78-5414,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3734.611,3738.351,"Mr. Dickstein, do you have something further?"
1978.78-5414,2,41207,sidney_dickstein,,3738.351,3745.462,"Yes I do, Your Honor."
1978.78-5414,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3838.848,3839.328,Suppose Mr. Dickstein --
1978.78-5414,2,41207,sidney_dickstein,,3839.328,3840.282,We are not --
1978.78-5414,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3840.282,3867.903,"-- suppose that a witness subpoenaed in these same circumstances instead of just refusing to appear and taking all the consequences of a contempt citation and so forth, decided to go to one of the Caribbean islands or South American countries and then there would be a good many newspaper accounts, assumed on newspaper accounts that he had fled the country."
1978.78-5414,2,41207,sidney_dickstein,,3886.136,3893.233,"Not as I understand the teaching of this Court's opinions in Gertz and Firestone, Your Honor."
1978.78-5414,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4281.493,4287.914,"But Mr. Dickstein, he's a confirmed liar as a -- as in all agents are confirmed liars are they, all spies?"
1978.78-5414,2,41207,sidney_dickstein,,4299.284,4313.26,"Your Honor, there is so much in that book which is just completely inconsistent that is in which Slava as described is completely inconsistent with Wolston, the man as he live."
1978.78-5414,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4334.953,4339.89,But none of those things would put the author unnoticed that maybe this statement was false?
1978.78-5414,2,41207,sidney_dickstein,,4339.89,4342.81,"There are other circumstances, Your Honor."
1978.78-5414,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4403.972,4414.094,"But even if you would considered he was totally impeached and he just remove all his testimony from the record, you still have some affirmative burden of showing the knowledge of falsity."
1978.78-5414,2,41207,sidney_dickstein,,4423.037,4432.104,"Given the facts that we have, if a jury believed that Barron was lying, we think that that alone would've been sufficient."
1978.78-5414,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4432.104,4434.355,But maybe they won't put him on the witness stand.
1978.78-5414,2,41207,sidney_dickstein,,4434.355,4435.595,"Oh, but I would, Your Honor."
1978.78-5414,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4435.595,4436.999,Oh I see.
1978.78-5414,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4436.999,4448.364,Oh what they might believe he was lying that doesn't necessarily follow that anything was untrue does it or is it?
1978.78-5414,2,41207,sidney_dickstein,,4448.364,4451.819,If there is -- if there are facts and circumstances because there are here --
1978.78-5414,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4451.819,4464.854,Just because the jury can disbelieve and disregard his affidavit doesn't mean they have to conclude or that he absolutely knew or suspected that something was false?
1978.78-5414,2,41207,sidney_dickstein,,4464.854,4469.29,"Standing by itself, if that were the -- if those were the facts here, that might be the case."
1978.78-5414,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4470.875,4471.452,Well say the man says you --
1978.78-5414,2,41207,sidney_dickstein,,4471.452,4472.361,Because there are.
1978.78-5414,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4472.361,4483.793,Say the man says the mental element could be satisfied if there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant or the accuracy of his report.
1978.78-5414,2,41207,sidney_dickstein,,4496.255,4497.795,Objectively.
1978.78-5414,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4551.161,4553.642,So you say at least there was jury question about that?
1978.78-5414,2,41207,sidney_dickstein,,4553.642,4554.583,Exactly.
1978.78-5414,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4557.805,4558.61,Thank you gentlemen.
