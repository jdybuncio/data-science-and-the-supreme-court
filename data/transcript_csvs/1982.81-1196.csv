1982.81-1196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.729,We will hear arguments next in Smith against Wade.
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,83.2,85.965,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.515,225.548,"Mr. Presson, what have you been able to discover in the way of legislative history at the time of the enactment of Section 1983 that would indicate Congress was concerned about, if it so indicated, about damages, and if you didn't find anything specifically in the legislative history, what was the law generally at that time as far as punitive damages were concerned?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,225.548,243.072,"I'm not aware of anything in particular in the legislative history about punitive damages, and in fact I believe this Court stated, I believe, in the Carey case that Congress in enacting 1983 had never really discussed the issue of damages much at all."
1982.81-1196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.072,254.49,Would you agree that punitive damages were generally awarded in tort cases at that time?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,254.49,260.316,"I believe they were available, yes, as early as 1851."
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,260.316,261.751,In all tort cases?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,261.751,262.516,Pardon?
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,262.516,265.751,In all tort cases were they available at common law?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,265.751,267.998,"Not in all tort cases, no, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,269.093,270.84,"Well, a minority or a majority or what?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,270.84,280.464,"--Well, I think again it becomes the standard to be applied, whether the facts of any particular case--"
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,280.464,288.131,"Was there any burden to show intent, for example, as a predicate for punitive damages?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,288.131,291.441,--In some jurisdictions there may have been.
1982.81-1196,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,308.965,324.006,"Didn't the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad case, which had been decided by this Court in 1858, talk about punitive damages in terms that the injury complained of has been inflicted maliciously or wantonly?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,324.006,328.381,I'm not specifically familiar with that particular case.
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,384.235,387.809,"What do you mean by ""fluid concept""?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,387.809,414.565,"--Well, in the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway case this Court rejected what had evidently earlier been the appropriate standard of gross negligence as the standard, and said attempts to adequately define gross negligence have been ineffective, that is no longer the proper standard, and redefined the standard in terms of reckless conduct, which this Court said is of such a degree that it is the equivalent of a malicious intent."
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,422.797,424.404,For 1983 purposes?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,424.404,427.823,"That was not specifically a 1983 case, no, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,427.823,436.023,"Well, do you think the standard should be any stricter in 1983 cases than in other types, tort cases for example?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,436.023,437.758,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,437.758,438.585,It should be?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,438.585,439.396,I believe so.
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,439.396,440.071,Why?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,440.071,441.413,Well--
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,441.413,456.095,"For example, an ordinary tort suit against a drunken driver who strikes you in the street."
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,459.889,463.515,"--It would be a possibility, depending again upon--"
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,463.515,464.872,By what standard?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,464.872,466.936,--whatever the state standards for punitive damages were.
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,466.936,468.776,"I know, but what do you think it ought to be?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,468.776,469.434,Pardon me?
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,469.434,471.478,What do you think it ought to be?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,471.478,473.509,For state cases?
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,473.509,477.475,"For the kind of case I've given you, the hypothetical I've given you."
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,482.319,485.27,In state personal injury cases?
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,491.128,494.252,That it has to be malicious intent?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,494.252,495.39,Yes.
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,495.39,500.498,"And so you would apply that standard to 1983 and to torts generally, would you?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,500.498,501.875,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,501.875,511.994,"Are there Missouri cases allowing punitive damages in garden variety tort cases, and if so on the basis of what standard?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,511.994,515.367,"The basic standard is one of recklessness, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,533.812,535.75,In ordinary tort cases?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,535.75,536.795,Right.
1982.81-1196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,536.795,548.728,I'm still waiting for your answer... maybe I missed it... to Justice Brennan's question of why there should be a different standard for officers.
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,548.728,571.204,"Well, I think particularly in this situation, the role of the correctional officer or any state official, who are the ones that are being subject to 1983... the qualified immunity which this Court has recognized I think would be undermined by application of any lesser standard."
1982.81-1196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,571.204,575.466,"Well, doesn't that in itself afford a substantial protection?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,575.466,578.89,It affords a substantial protection.
1982.81-1196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,612.625,623.59,Doesn't the trial judge normally have jurisdiction to reduce the amount of punitive damages if the judge determines it's appropriate?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,623.59,625.181,That is a possibility.
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,701.354,703.37,"Actual malice, define that."
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,703.37,704.4,--Pardon?
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,704.4,708.494,Actual malice; how do you define actual malice?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,708.494,718.223,In terms of what this Court has said in Carey and Newport: a malicious intent to deprive one of one's civil rights or to do specific injury to that individual.
1982.81-1196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,718.223,719.986,It requires an intent?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,719.986,723.705,"As I read what this Court said in those cases, yes, it would, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,723.705,726.357,It isn't just a passive factor?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,726.357,728.483,I don't believe it could be passive.
1982.81-1196,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.483,732.406,"Not even recklessness would satisfy that, would it?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,732.406,751.974,"No, not as the standard, because recklessness... this Court has indicated in the sense of qualified immunity that one knew or should have known that your actions were going to deprive someone of his constitutional rights."
1982.81-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.825,884.857,"Mr. Presson, may I interrupt you for just a second."
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,896.649,898.334,"To the punitive damage, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,898.334,898.849,"Yes, there was."
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,900.054,919.888,"I believe that as far as furthering what this Court has indicated was the primary purpose of 1983 apart from compensation, and that being deterrence, it is best served by an explicit standard, as explicit as is humanly possible."
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,961.623,971.539,"I thought, Mr. Presson, that the old notion of punitive damages was that punitive damages were smart money."
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,990.297,991.564,That's correct.
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,991.564,1005.979,"Well, if one has been guilty of denying someone his constitutional rights, wouldn't it deter future constitutional violations if he had to pay some smart money?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1005.979,1014.82,It can deter only if you can come up with a common principle such that you know what--
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1014.82,1021.317,"Well, the common principle I'm suggesting is, he violated the Plaintiff's constitutional rights."
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1021.317,1026.266,"--That is not always in practice that easy a determination to make, particularly--"
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1026.266,1036.545,"Whether it's easy or not, we start with the premise that there's been the violation, he's had a verdict in a 1983 suit because he's been denied his constitutional rights."
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1036.545,1037.216,--True.
1982.81-1196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1037.216,1038.405,All right.
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1047.244,1054.443,"Well, again I get back to the reason for punitive damages, and that is in my mind primarily deterrence."
1982.81-1196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1208.286,1224.045,"Mr. Presson, do you have any statistics gathered as to how many 1983 actions which have resulted in plaintiff's verdicts have also included punitive damages?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1224.045,1227.515,"No, I did not do such a compilation."
1982.81-1196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1228.061,1230.124,Do you know how often it's happened in your state?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1230.124,1245.444,"As far as 1983, I'm not aware of any until this one, although I suppose there could have been some actions against municipalities or other governmental units that I might not be aware of."
1982.81-1196,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1488.623,1493.294,"Mr. Attorney General, if you lose this case who will pay the judgment?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1493.294,1496.558,"Well, that's a good question, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1505.055,1506.101,Under what?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1506.101,1511.381,Missouri has established what it calls the tort defense fund for certain state officers and officials.
1982.81-1196,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1511.381,1517.05,The individual man was sued in his individual and official capacities.
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1517.05,1519.316,"Well, it wouldn't make any difference."
1982.81-1196,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1519.316,1523.157,It wouldn't make any difference if he was sued only in the individual capacity?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1523.157,1532.324,"If he was one of the named parties covered by the tort defense fund, even named individually, I think he would be covered."
1982.81-1196,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1533.857,1543.586,The existence of that fund... to what extent would the state be deterred by a punitive judgment?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1547.802,1550.426,"--Well, that's what I said was a good question."
1982.81-1196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1565.938,1568.64,"Well, the judgment wasn't against the state, was it?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1568.64,1570.964,"Not in this instance, no, no."
1982.81-1196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1583.775,1585.304,Are these people bonded?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1585.304,1592.018,"In some instances yes, but it's my opinion not specifically for these."
1982.81-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.472,1633.44,Who will decide whether it does?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1639.249,1640.751,"Well, it could go to the Supreme Court."
1982.81-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1650.542,1652.636,"In other words, your office has a voice in it."
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1652.636,1654.23,We are involved in it.
1982.81-1196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1670.582,1679.032,"But if the state attorney general should construe the statute as requiring the reimbursement in this situation, at least that opinion would have some weight, I suppose?"
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1679.032,1686.729,"It would have some weight, although state officers are not specifically required to follow opinions issued by our office."
1982.81-1196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1686.729,1691.229,Who provides the legal defense in the lawsuit?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1693.635,1696.056,"Yes, and it was in this instance as well."
1982.81-1196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1696.056,1698.65,Generally is that the case?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1703.116,1708.52,"Well, I suppose it arose primarily to begin with as a matter of practice and policy."
1982.81-1196,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1717.329,1720.703,Is that the attorney general's office or is it in the county?
1982.81-1196,0,40136,robert_l_presson,,1722.091,1724.372,It's the state attorney general's office.
1982.81-1196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1746.489,1748.096,Very well.
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,1755.454,1759.03,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1774.616,1780.287,"Are you asserting that, representing that to be a universal doctrine of law?"
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,1780.287,1783.519,"I'm asserting that, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1854.962,1855.929,Excuse me.
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,1869.39,1870.143,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1870.143,1870.939,I see.
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,1870.939,1875.107,But I am saying that the standard that was given to the jury--
1982.81-1196,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1875.107,1880.929,"I mean, that falls short, does it, of actual intent, malicious intent?"
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,1880.929,1883.32,--As far as--
1982.81-1196,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1883.32,1889.551,How does callous disregard... how different is that from malicious intent?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,1889.551,1902.953,"--I believe malicious intent can be implied by a callous disregard of known threats to health and safety, as this Court said in Estelle."
1982.81-1196,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1947.232,1954.809,"Well, I'm not quite clear how much of an issue we have, in light of your concession."
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,1954.809,1958.354,"It is my position, Your Honor, that--"
1982.81-1196,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1958.354,1961.056,"Well, how do you differ from the state?"
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,1961.056,1964.819,--I believe we have shown the reckless--
1982.81-1196,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1964.819,1972.595,What do you think is the standard that you have to satisfy in order to get a punitive damage award?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,1972.595,1975.581,"--Egregious conduct, reckless disregard."
1982.81-1196,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1975.581,1979.5,"Well, now I'm asking you, how does that differ from what the state's insisted?"
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,1979.5,1984.153,I believe the state is asking for us to bear an impossible burden.
1982.81-1196,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.213,1994.838,You're not objecting to the judgment below.
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,1994.838,1996.495,That's right.
1982.81-1196,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.495,1997.93,You think the standard was quite proper.
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2006.833,2008.989,Yes.
1982.81-1196,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.989,2011.505,They're the one that wants a different standard from what was applied below.
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2011.505,2013.018,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.764,2032.932,"Whether it's the same, whether the standard the state suggests is the same or different, you don't really care."
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2045.894,2050.425,"I say it is authorized, and perhaps I'm not making myself clear."
1982.81-1196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2085.49,2095.641,"How many people would you say are confined in Missouri under the reckless disregard, that is not an affirmative intent?"
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2095.641,2097.672,For manslaughter?
1982.81-1196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2097.672,2098.983,For anything.
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2098.983,2103.466,"It would be difficult for me to say, Your Honor, but the number is substantial."
1982.81-1196,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2103.466,2116.085,How many judgments have you with additional damages on 1983 actions in Missouri?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2116.085,2118.725,"To my knowledge, this is the only one."
1982.81-1196,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2144.543,2155.505,"Mr. Lockenvitz, you may not have had occasion to look at our case of Sandstrom versus Montana, where... which is of course in a quite different field."
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2182.435,2206.129,"Well, Your Honor, I just go back to the common law cases where this Court and others have said that you must show malice or reckless disregard, and there are instances where reckless disregard leads the court to believe that there was malice and to find malice."
1982.81-1196,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2206.129,2218.685,Do you think the common law cases from this Court or elsewhere generally require a higher standard for recovery of punitive damages than they do for the recovery for the tort itself?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2218.685,2219.761,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2242.16,2263.119,"But if you have to reach a higher standard to impose liability at all and the common law cases suggest that there should be a difference in standards for actual and punitive damages, wouldn't it make sense here to say that you should have had to prove a still higher standard to get punitive?"
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2263.119,2267.931,"I see the gist of your statement, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2348.335,2354.894,"Could I ask you a question, counsel, due to the remark you just dropped."
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2372.025,2377.32,"Yes, for ordinary tort liability in cases of this nature, is the way I read that."
1982.81-1196,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2377.32,2385.053,And I thought in one of your responses to Justice Rehnquist you rather conceded that maybe there is a higher standard here.
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2385.053,2394.159,There's a higher standard for finding the basic liability to get compensatory damages.
1982.81-1196,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2414.276,2418.584,So you are in agreement with Chief Judge Lay's remark?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2418.584,2425.315,"Yes, insofar as it applies to cases of this nature, where you have to find this higher standard."
1982.81-1196,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2425.315,2458.632,"Well, if you're correct, counsel, then the imposition of a higher standard in some torts, such as the one you are involved in here, some constitutional tort, offers somewhat minimal protection to the Defendants, because if that higher standard is once met you can recover, a plaintiff can recover, not only actual damages but punitive damages against them, whereas if a lower standard is required presumably under your reasoning actual damages could be recovered, but not punitive damages."
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2458.632,2474.313,"Your Honor, I believe the protection given to public officials and in this case prison officials with the qualified immunity is adequate with the standard for actual damages."
1982.81-1196,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2481.605,2484.745,"Of course, I wonder why you make this concession."
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2492.305,2499.975,"Yes, Your Honor, And again, perhaps I'm not being... perhaps my use of the word ""malice"" is not appropriate here."
1982.81-1196,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2507.735,2509.47,"Well, your concession--"
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2526.855,2528.15,Yes.
1982.81-1196,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2528.15,2533.133,And that automatically gets you punitive damages.
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2535.196,2535.961,Okay.
1982.81-1196,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2549.737,2551.141,Do you know any other instance under the sun?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2551.141,2553.001,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1982.81-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2553.001,2559.03,"But isn't it true, you only make that concession in Eighth Amendment cases?"
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2565.042,2566.259,"Yes, Your Honor, exactly."
1982.81-1196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.259,2572.257,You wouldn't necessarily make the same claim if it was an improperly executed search warrant or something like that?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2572.257,2573.318,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2823.342,2830.903,Don't you think as a practical matter all of these officials expect the state to pay any judgment against them anyway?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2830.903,2834.463,I suppose these individuals expect that.
1982.81-1196,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2842.399,2847.847,"You wouldn't expect to collect punitive damages in any substantial amount from a prison guard, would you really?"
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2847.847,2848.942,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2876.43,2879.382,Would the court have permitted you to bring that fact out?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2879.382,2880.383,The court would have.
1982.81-1196,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2885.769,2886.834,"Prior to that, would the court--"
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,2886.834,2890.051,"Prior to that, no, the court would not have."
1982.81-1196,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3095.84,3097.7,"--Well, where do you suppose this tort defense fund comes from?"
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,3099.716,3106.384,"--The tort defense fund is here, Mr. Justice, because the state chose to impose that burden on itself."
1982.81-1196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3106.384,3108.181,Where did the state get the money?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,3108.181,3114.459,"Practically speaking, Mr. Chief Justice, that fund is a nullity."
1982.81-1196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3118.706,3121.705,"Well, that means what Justice Rehnquist and I were both striving to--"
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,3121.705,3122.707,From the taxpayers.
1982.81-1196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3122.707,3123.83,--The taxpayers pay it.
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,3123.83,3128.798,"But again, I must point out that the state imposed this burden on itself."
1982.81-1196,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.339,3141.62,Who was the trial judge?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,3141.62,3143.387,The Honorable Scott Wright.
1982.81-1196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3193.021,3201.05,"The instruction of the trial judge on this subject, were they instructions given at your request?"
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,3201.05,3205.439,"In part, Your Honor."
1982.81-1196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3215.403,3216.714,Missouri state court?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,3216.714,3217.622,The Missouri state court.
1982.81-1196,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.622,3219.775,For punitive damages?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,3219.775,3224.072,"Both for the verdict direct... well, he modified them, obviously."
1982.81-1196,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3224.072,3226.759,Is that instruction 5 in Missouri Forms?
1982.81-1196,1,17836,bradley_h_lockenvitz,,3226.759,3247.984,"Instruction 5 is... not verbatim, obviously, but he turned to the MAI, the Missouri Approved Instructions, for his guide and modified it according to federal law, rather than using the federal law form books that counsel had been accustomed to using."
1982.81-1196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3282.861,3286.171,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Presson?"
1982.81-1196,2,40136,robert_l_presson,,3286.171,3287.731,"Just a couple of comments, sir."
1982.81-1196,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3287.731,3290.683,You have three minutes remaining.
1982.81-1196,2,40136,robert_l_presson,,3461.255,3290.683,Thank you.
1982.81-1196,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3461.957,3462.834,"Thank you, gentlemen."
