1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,69.746,70.074,Thank you.
1974.73-1004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,70.074,73.425,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,220.268,231.378,"In any of these other cases that you've mentioned involving this production, were the proceedings brought after there had been one or more performances?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,231.378,233.166,All before Your Honor.
1974.73-1004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,233.166,235.37,All of them were excluded then?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,235.37,242.442,They're all exclusion cases and we went to the appropriate U.S. District Courts and obtained orders.
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,357.595,364.162,But wasn't the reasoning -- wasn't the reasoning of Judge -- it was Frank Wilson one of the District Judge --
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,364.162,365.631,Uh-huh.
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,365.631,392.985,"-- that criminal conduct was being performed on the stage, i.e., indecent exposure or whatever it's called in Tennessee that there is an ordinance or statute making indecent exposure a criminal act and that act was being performed?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,392.985,393.641,That's right Your Honor.
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.025,396.494,"I mean that didn't -- really isn't obscenity, is it?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,405.695,406.326,Actual murder --
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,406.326,411.691,-- a play of Othello and Othello actually did strangled Desdemona --
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,411.691,412.881,That's exactly right.
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,412.881,413.705,-- and killed her?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,413.705,413.713,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,420.74,421.11,Yes.
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,421.11,425.17,That's the position he took and that's obviously the position which I intend to address myself too.
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,426.94,432.559,"And that concept is different from an obscenity concept, isn't it?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,432.559,437.419,"Well, the reason that the Judge refers to obscenity, his opinion is in fact quite confused on the point."
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,483.764,496.074,"Well, you see -- and I gather on the -- viewed as a whole element of the obscenity test, is I gather too survive."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,496.074,497.627,It doesn't survive in his opinion.
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,498.77,500.363,It survives Miller.
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,504.698,504.719,That's right.
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,504.719,508.088,If it is to be reviewed as a whole than it has to be viewed as a whole?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,508.088,508.783,That's right Your Honor.
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,508.955,510.985,I got -- and everything else that maybe.
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,510.985,513.644,I'm going to address myself essentially to two points.
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,517.966,518.76,"Well, I know, but --"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,518.76,519.105,And secondly --
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,519.105,523.023,"-- (Voice Overlap) as to the obscenity, but what about the public nudity aspect of it?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,523.023,537.179,"Well, and with respect to public nudity, the -- I'm going to argue that that's -- that criterion standing alone would be constitutionally insufficient under four decisions of this Court, squarely holding it, unless I seriously misread them."
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.179,552.273,"Mr. Monaghan, is this case the same for you as if the Chattanooga City ordinance that it tried to enforce against your showing in private theater which had agreed to lease it to you?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,552.273,552.494,No.
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,554.01,555.629,"Well, let me ask you this then."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,568.062,568.846,No.
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,600.883,605.279,But Butler was not a state -- it was not a municipally owned bookstore?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,605.279,616.7,"That's exactly, it was not municipally owned bookstore, but it's certainly very indicative in this case and it seems to me when you use a standard like something which is suitable for -- I'd make three responses."
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,627.927,630.797,"Your answer is in effect, “No, the city couldn't do it.”"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,630.797,634.565,"It could not, if that were the criteria used."
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.017,649.939,Do you think the city that had an ordinance forbidding minors or forbidding the producer to permit the minors to enter the showing of “Hair”?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,649.939,655.204,"The showing of “Hair,” no, I do not, because I think that even with respect to minors --"
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,655.204,656.904,Let's say under 16.
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,656.904,658.452,Under 16?
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.652,663.118,No.
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,667.164,669.071,It wouldn't impair the -- it wouldn't impair the strength of this case.
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.071,685.556,"Then why wouldn't if the city said, “Well, we almost just relentless,” as the city said that, “Well, we just reserve our municipal facilities for events to which all the people may come and all attend it?”"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,685.556,689.439,"Because the standard -- because that's -- first of all, I'd make several responses."
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.449,703.116,But that --
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,703.116,704.238,And it seems -- excuse me.
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.238,711.276,"Well, I know -- that answer then goes back to saying that the city could keep minors out of this -- out of the production “Hair?”"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,711.276,712.067,"In my judgment, there is --"
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,712.067,714.717,"And then, I said that let's assume that it could."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,714.717,717.406,"Let's assume -- I'm sorry, let's assume that it could."
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.432,734.554,"Well, that just goes -- it goes to saying that the city cannot reserve its auditorium for events to which all the people may go?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,734.554,735.751,I think so Your Honor.
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.293,739.334,"And if you're wrong on that, then you may be in trouble?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,739.334,742.902,"I don't think I'm in trouble in this case, because that's not -- those are the facts of this case."
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,790.518,801.473,"What if -- what if the City of New York owns the -- owned the Museum of Modern Art and they say “We'll open it to private showings, but it's limited to modern art."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,805.477,805.717,Valid.
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.717,806.829,Is that a permissible?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,806.829,808.159,I think it is.
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.159,810.257,Why because it doesn't involve content --
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,810.257,810.283,Because --
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,810.283,811.713,Assume it does involve content discrimination?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,811.713,825.695,"Well, but it doesn't involve -- it's a question of how much it involves -- it involves a line being drawn, which one cannot say a priori will result in a lot of suppression of different views, it seems to me."
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,832.878,839.807,"But you're suppressing a tremendous amount there, a priori, you're suppressing all art, but modern art?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,839.807,842.557,"Well, I don't think that -- I think that the point is not suppression."
1974.73-1004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,867.974,883.834,"What if an art gallery, to pursue Mr. Justice Rehnquist's thesis a moment, what if an art gallery -- public gallery had a fixed rule that no living artist could be exhibited?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,883.834,885.275,"I think the rule is valid, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,892.989,899.011,"Well, it certainly suppresses a modern contemporary expression, does it not?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,899.796,904.678,But those ideas may be reflected in older -- in older proceedings also.
1974.73-1004,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,949.37,954.273,"Mr. Monaghan, maybe you mentioned, were children allowed under your plan?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,955.025,962.814,"It's -- I would take the position that children have to be allowed to see “Hair,” but it's unclear from this record what the situation was with respect to children."
1974.73-1004,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,962.814,966.923,"Why do children have to see “Hair,” be permitted to see “Hair”?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,966.923,975.126,"Why should they -- why should they be permitted because it's not obscene, with respect to children under the definitions that were sustained in Ginsberg against New York."
1974.73-1004,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,978.519,978.894,Oh!
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,982.801,987.139,"No, I think that there are some plays upon which adults could see, but children could not."
1974.73-1004,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,987.139,988.375,"Right, that's what I wanted to hear."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,988.375,989.531,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,991.955,994.107,"(Voice Overlap) If you prevail here, are you going to show “Hair” on Chattanooga?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,994.107,995.689,We certainly are going to show it Your Honor.
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,995.689,996.33,Are you (Inaudible)
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,996.33,1001.142,We're certainly going to show it at Chattanooga.
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1173.381,1195.728,"Do you -- do you Mr. -- the question attack the constitutional validity of the criminal law or the Chattanooga City Code, Section 25-28 which makes it criminal for any person in the city to appear in a public place in a state of nudity?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1195.728,1200.557,"Do we attack it -- we attack it -- we attack it as applied, yes we do."
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1220.46,1222.427,In a public place -- in a public place?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1222.427,1236.154,"If we're in a public place then the statute that as applied, if it purports to dispense with any showing of -- any showing of obscenity and the decisions of this Court already make that clear."
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1247.078,1258.967,"Well, what if -- what if -- one of the actors stole money from the other -- from another actor on the stage."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1263.15,1264.348,Actually stole it?
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1264.348,1265.525,"Yes, actually stole it."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1265.525,1269.668,"No and I think we can distinguish that case, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1311.276,1325.615,"In other words, the same people who might be nude for purposes of the play and when the play is shown, if they went out on the streets nude, could be --"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1325.615,1326.381,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1326.381,1330.356,"-- prosecuted under this ordinance, but not for the nudity on the stage play?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1330.356,1330.911,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1330.911,1340.216,"Well, why would a person's choice to walk around without any clothes on also the First Amendment right, in your view?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1340.216,1341.816,Because it's never been thought Your Honor.
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1342.517,1350.909,"Just like it -- the kind of clothes, the kind of necktie a person might wear if he were -- if he chose to wear clothes."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1350.909,1351.799,That's the right the difference --
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1351.799,1357.445,"Or if his hair long or short, why isn't that protected by the First Amendment under your view on the public streets?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1357.445,1369.312,"Because -- because there's no difference between the clothes case and the non-clothes case, as Your Honor points out, because it's never been treated to be expressive conduct under definition."
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1369.312,1373.146,Hair styles have been treated by many courts to be expressive conduct?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1373.146,1376.16,"Well, to be -- the circuit courts are evenly divided on that."
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1376.16,1379.381,"Yes, it's been treated many, many times repeatedly in many lawsuits."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1379.381,1389.686,By -- by several -- by several Courts of Appeal but sometimes the case gets put on invasions of privacy as the First Circuit case did by Judge Coffin.
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1427.144,1428.237,Can or cannot?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1428.237,1428.901,"Can be,"
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1428.901,1429.231,Can be.
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1429.231,1435.675,it can be because the rehearing petition en banc was denied.
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1435.675,1437.514,After our decision in Miller?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1437.514,1446.206,"After your decision in Miller, a petition for rehearing was filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and it was -- and the petition was denied."
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.206,1446.697,In this case?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1446.697,1448.241,"Yes, in this case, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1448.241,1450.851,What was the presentation on that petition?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1450.851,1452.786,We argued Miller.
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.126,1473.099,What about the members of the audience that's roaming the theater?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1473.099,1478.61,"Not protected, it has no dramatic relevance and it's not expressive conduct."
1974.73-1004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1478.61,1487.975,Aren't there some -- aren't there some place in which part of the play or performance is audience participation?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1487.975,1488.815,I've never seen any at that level.
1974.73-1004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1488.815,1491.065,"Well, aren't there?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1491.065,1494.066,Maybe and if there are--
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1494.066,1494.896,Hell's a' poppin'
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1494.896,1496.568,"Hell's a' poppin', yeah."
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1496.568,1497.501,"Hell's a' poppin', and --"
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1497.501,1501.614,That was before your time. (Laughter)
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1501.614,1501.647,Maybe --
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1501.647,1504.463,And before Justice Rehnquist's time too.
1974.73-1004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1504.463,1509.001,"Well, that's not a very common thing in the drama and quite common in the world of drama?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1509.001,1512.584,"Well, it's beyond me, I must say I haven't seen it."
1974.73-1004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1515.399,1517.453,"Well, what about -- what about it then?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1517.453,1524.644,I'd like to try to address that issue which I think is -- which is at the core of Mr. Justice Stewart's questioning.
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.089,1602.53,"But of course, a more direct approach to the case, whether the argument -- what you argue to say which I assume to say it's a conduct itself isn't obscene?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1602.53,1609.424,"That's right, Your Honor, that's the evidentiary point we take the position that the conduct itself was not obscene and in the last point of the brief we argue that there's --"
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1609.424,1618.96,"I know your time is running, may I just ask, do you think it can be a determination of obscenity except in your basic proposition, unless you see the play?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1618.96,1619.754,Do I think you can?
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1623.274,1625.234,None of these judges have ever saw it?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1625.234,1627.454,None of the judges except Judge McRae.
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1627.454,1628.509,Who wrote a dissent?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1628.509,1629.029,Who voted --
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.029,1638.952,"Does any of the counsel called conduct in the play that falls within that, in the area of obscenity described in the Miller and the Paris Adult cases?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1638.952,1639.899,I do not.
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.899,1640.868,It is not hardcore?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1640.868,1642.994,"It is not hardcore pornography, I think--"
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1642.994,1645.751,Do you think the courts were just wrong on that part?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1645.751,1652.535,I think that the basic error made was that the judge simply misunderstood the appropriate criteria and it led him into all sorts of errors.
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.058,1686.546,There shouldn't be -- there shouldn't be -- can any theater presentation be obscene?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1686.546,1687.649,"Yes it can, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.649,1689.14,How -- how could if the --
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1689.14,1693.249,If it doesn't satisfy the criteria set down in the Miller case.
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1707.377,1709.809,Any difference between motion pictures and play?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1709.809,1711.025,I don't think there's a great deal.
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.998,1795.161,Doesn't Miller said that simulated sex maybe deemed --
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1795.161,1799.993,Some -- some simulated sex maybe put down if it gets to the stage are being hardcore pornography.
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1799.993,1803.168,"Well, but doesn't it -- it doesn't really say it quite in the way you said it."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1809.637,1811.355,"No, it does not Your Honor, because --"
1974.73-1004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1811.355,1814.144,I think that's a precise quotation from Miller?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1814.144,1828.729,"It -- what that does is to say that this kind of material can be denominated patently offensive erotic material, but you're still left with the serious redeeming social value test."
1974.73-1004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1829.391,1831.292,Where is that test now?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1831.292,1834.706,"That test, I think, is alive and well."
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1849.336,1852.547,"Of course, it's we phrased as serious artistic, etcetera?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1852.547,1854.856,It's serious -- it satisfies all those requirements.
1974.73-1004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1854.856,1858.401,"No, it is not the socially redeeming value test?"
1974.73-1004,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1858.401,1859.746,It's not utterly without?
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1859.746,1861.55,"No, no, it's not utterly."
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1874.057,1892.644,"As you correctly say, the theater is one of the very first forms of expression, but the common quality of the plays and/or the moving pictures is basically that it is all simulated, isn't it?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1892.644,1893.113,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1893.113,1900.467,"I mean, when Othello strangles Desdemona, you don't actually, that isn't a murder, in fact that's a simulated murder."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1900.467,1902.263,"That's right, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1902.263,1909.262,"That's the --that's the characteristic of plays and the movies, but this was not simulated nudity."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1910.621,1911.378,"Actual nudity, but I explained --"
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1911.378,1934.657,"Actual nudity, and did run afoul you say it perhaps didn't because the theater wasn't a public place by putting that to one side and assuming the theater -- this theater was a public place, it directly violated an ordinance of the city of Chattanooga, not having to do with obscenity as such, but having to do with indecent exposure as it's called."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1934.657,1937.561,"Well, it seems to me that the response I would make is twofold."
1974.73-1004,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1946.678,1950.616,"You mean -- well, then are you saying that this ordinance is constitutionally invalid?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1950.616,1961.085,"I'm saying it is constitutionally invalid in the context of a dramatic performance and I would cite to Your Honor the cases that are cited on page 30 of our brief, four decisions of this Court."
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1961.085,1967.13,"Well, why doesn't an individual walking in the streets have as much right to make a dramatic expression as somebody on the stage?"
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1967.13,1968.629,Because it's never been understood.
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1979.27,1980.176,"Well, I agree with you (Voice Overlap)."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,1980.176,1991.35,And I would suggest to you that it seems to me that the fact is we have never treated expressive conduct -- we have never treated walking around nude.
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2005.091,2010.96,"I think it was Mrs. Campbell, wasn't it who said perform in the street, might scare the horses."
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,2010.96,2014.324,"In a different -- there different state interest, yes."
1974.73-1004,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.324,2016.964,Maybe it could die?
1974.73-1004,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2016.964,2018.194,It didn't scare any horses.
1974.73-1004,0,27722,henry_p_monaghan,,2018.194,2023.078,"I don't know that anybody understand what she was doing, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.[Attempt to Laughter]"
1974.73-1004,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2023.078,2026.877,"Mr. Nelson, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2026.877,2030.805,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2080.848,2084.388,Did the petitioner refuse to sign this contract?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2086.684,2088.13,No sir.
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2100.555,2110.367,"Not if he -- not if he signed the contract I suppose, you never gave him the opportunity to do it, did you?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2110.367,2120.455,"He was denied -- his application was denied at the time that it was made, because it's public knowledge that nudity would take place which was never denied by the petitioner, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2120.455,2124.677,"Well, the show never took place in this auditorium?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2124.677,2125.426,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2125.426,2128.255,"So you don't know, but you never gave him an opportunity."
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2131.635,2134.797,"Your Honor, it was stipulated in the proceedings."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2134.797,2137.628,"In later lawsuit, wasn't it?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2137.628,2139.256,"Yes, Your Honor, now--"
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2139.256,2143.436,"It was stipulated that had he signed this agreement, he would not have -- he would have violated it."
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2143.436,2151.764,It was stipulated that when -- that the same conduct would occur in this play as has occurred in all the other plays.
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2158.607,2160.4,But did it take place in Chattanooga?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2160.4,2162.768,"No sir, but it would, they had agreed with that."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2167.4,2177.673,"Well, you never -- so, I don't see how you can rely on this contractual language when you never gave him an opportunity to sign the contract?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2177.673,2178.648,Well --
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2178.648,2182.989,"Had he signed it and then violated the contract, you would have maybe a different kind of an action or conflict?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2182.989,2189.9,"Well, then -- then we get into, as you say, a different kind of action."
1974.73-1004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2189.9,2206.478,"I thought Mr. Monaghan seem to say today that, yes, if the Court decided in his favor the play would be put on in Chattanooga and he made no reservation with respect to it being put on in any different way from what the stipulations suggested?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2206.478,2207.438,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2299.959,2308.867,It's your view that the -- that line -- that opening line of the play that you just quoted --
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2308.867,2309.874,"No Your Honor, that is --"
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2309.874,2311.519,-- violates any statute or ordinance?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2311.519,2314.356,"No Your Honor, that is -- that is not our view."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2324.935,2325.933,I see.
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2325.933,2350.423,"Now, the Court in it's finding of the facts, found on page 41 of the petition for certiorari, specifically found that the overwhelming evidence reflects that simulated acts of anal intercourse, frontal intercourse, heterosexual intercourse, homosexual intercourse and group intercourse are committed throughout the play."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2454.067,2454.223,Oh!
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2465.544,2465.687,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2465.687,2470.877,-- but the conduct is generally simulated conduct.
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2478.407,2479.134,That is true and --
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2479.134,2479.931,-- quality of drama?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2479.931,2497.908,"-- but I think the difference here is when you look at the nature of the crime, we know that a murder when simulated on stage accomplishes no evil, but when an obscene act occurs on stage that act does accomplish the evil at which prohibition is aimed."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2497.908,2510.766,"But why -- now, why is a simulated act of that kind any worse than any simulated murder which is a very serious offense in every state in the union?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2510.766,2513.914,I would go to the concurring --
1974.73-1004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2513.914,2516.203,"Much more serious, much heavier penalties for murder than (Voice Overlap)."
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2516.203,2540.464,"Well, there's no doubt about that, Your Honor, but I would refer, Your Honor to the opinion -- concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan in the original Roth case, wherein he says that the state has a very real interest in preventing repeated acts of sexual obscenity from occurring and that over a period of time this can erode the moral fabric of the society."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2550.222,2566.513,"Why isn't that any more true of a simulated fornication or adultery which are in most states offenses, but not nearly as such serious offenses as murder."
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2575.076,2586.122,"I think if we had a simulated, a fully simulated act of adultery on the stage that it would embody the same sexual conduct that we're talking about and it should be forbidden, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2586.122,2586.734,"Well, does not Miller --"
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2586.734,2589.407,"Well, then Othello should be forbidden shouldn't it, because that shows a first degree murder?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2589.407,2595.925,"Well, it would -- no, Your Honor because the murder is not actually accomplished."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2595.925,2598.201,"Nor is this sexual, it's simulated?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2598.201,2623.883,"A sexual act is not accomplished, but a -- in the terms of -- as Judge Wilson put it as the pregnancy being consummated or something in that nature, but a sexual act is actually done on stage where two actors or actresses embrace each other in a copulation position making all of the thrusting movements that are generally associated there with, that is a sexual act."
1974.73-1004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2623.883,2627.106,"Well, didn't the Miller case say actual or simulated --"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2627.106,2627.37,"Yes, Your Honor --"
1974.73-1004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2627.37,2631.697,-- and you take it out the Othello strangulation?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2631.697,2637.79,"Yes, Your Honor, it did and our new Tennessee statute which has been enacted and appended to our brief --"
1974.73-1004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2637.79,2639.996,But you weren't applying Miller in this case?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2639.996,2641.045,That's correct.
1974.73-1004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2658.663,2675.824,"You mean even assuming -- even assuming, is it your argument, even assuming the case might have to be reversed under pre-Miller and related cases, it doesn't have to be remanded because of the intervening decisions?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2675.824,2678.199,That would be a secondary position.
1974.73-1004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2698.755,2707.223,"In other words, you're standing first on the violation of the public nudity that the Justice Stewart alluded to earlier?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2707.223,2708.752,"Yes, Your Honor, that's true."
1974.73-1004,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2708.752,2726.095,"Mr. Nelson, do you think your case is any better by the virtue of the fact that the petitioners sought a lease from a municipally-owned theater then if it were simply a question of him having obtained a lease in a private theater and the city seeking to ban the production?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2726.095,2730.607,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1974.73-1004,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2789.68,2792.456,"Mr. Nelson, are there any other theaters in Chattanooga?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2792.456,2811.653,"Yes, Your Honor, there -- in the preliminary hearing, one of the questions which I addressed to Commissioner Conrad who is the Commissioner of Public Utilities, Grounds and Buildings within the city was directed specifically at that and there he testified that there were several other places where this could have played on the private market."
1974.73-1004,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2818.987,2821.154,"But that wouldn't be private, would it?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2821.154,2827.546,"No, Your, Honor but there were private institutions, which could have been rented."
1974.73-1004,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2827.546,2828.807,You mean private theaters?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2828.807,2829.501,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2829.501,2832.993,Would a local license have been required to show that?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2832.993,2835.988,"No, Your Honor, we have no licensing whatsoever."
1974.73-1004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2839.189,2849.261,"In Tennessee -- under Tennessee law, would these so-called private theaters be considered public places for the purposes of the statute?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2849.261,2856.448,"I believe so, Your Honor, although I cannot cite you to Supreme Court decision or to anything of that nature, but it would be in my understanding that would be the case."
1974.73-1004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2856.448,2863.54,"Do you think that public in a sense that anyone can get in whose got three or six or seven dollars, whatever the price is?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2863.54,2872.316,"That's correct, Your Honor and it is open to the general public, it is not a private type of club."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2896.363,2898.446,He didn't see the play?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2898.446,2898.993,Excuse me?
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2898.993,2899.995,He didn't see the play?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2899.995,2902.495,"No Your Honor, he did not see the play."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2902.495,2906.299,"Well, how could he find it to be purely obscene and not obscene without having ever seen it?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2906.299,2924.301,"Through the -- the method by which the case was brought before the Court was that the libretto was introduced, witnesses were introduced to, who read the libretto, described the action which occurred during the various scenes of the libretto."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2963.974,2966.295,"That's pretty much after the playwright, isn't it?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2966.295,2969.329,"Well, yes and no, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2972.619,2975.87,Or the director or the actors?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,2975.87,2979.855,But in this case the playwright didn't even write the nude scene in.
1974.73-1004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3009.537,3021.445,"Somewhere in one of the briefs, there was a -- reference to or an effort to describe the theme of the play as you recall, was that in your brief or in Mr. Monaghan's?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3021.445,3028.796,"I believe it's on Mr. Monaghan's brief where he was attempting to categorize it, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3220.917,3239.21,"So, you're -- essentially you're arguing now that a city or a state may prevent any performances in a private theater if nudity is part of its performance?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3239.21,3243.699,I think they may enact laws against public nudity which we have and --
1974.73-1004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3243.699,3251.778,"Well, alright, you say that they might apply it to a performance in any private theater?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3251.778,3252.913,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3254.807,3279.01,"And so you're saying -- what you're saying is that -- what you're saying is that that wouldn't be obscene under any definition of obscenity, just nudity, but you're saying public nudity is a -- gives the -- gives the state or the city another shot at prohibition."
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3284.808,3285.22,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.322,3293.445,That's right and so wouldn't you have the same rule in a private theater?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3293.445,3294.899,"Yes, Your Honor, definitely."
1974.73-1004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3294.899,3300.388,So that nudity on the stage is -- nudity on a stage in a private theater is not obscene?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3300.388,3301.546,That as we have --
1974.73-1004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3301.546,3304.284,"Well, is it or not?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3304.284,3306.781,"No, -- I mean yes it is, excuse me--"
1974.73-1004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.781,3307.453,"Well, why not (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3307.453,3318.18,"-- because as we move -- because as we move from the screen to the stage, we move from the depiction of conduct to the actual conduct itself."
1974.73-1004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.18,3327.752,"So, you're saying nudity on a stage in a private theater can be held -- is obscene and maybe forbidden by state law?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3327.752,3330.017,I didn't say it that it is obscene.
1974.73-1004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3335.736,3338.087,But the state may prohibit it?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3338.087,3338.848,The state can prohibit it.
1974.73-1004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3338.848,3340.191,Because it's just nudity?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3340.191,3342.471,Because it is public nudity and --
1974.73-1004,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3342.471,3349.579,"And so it may not be obscene, it might not be preventable as obscenity, but it is preventable as public nudity?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3349.579,3355.351,"That's correct, just as you can regulate a rape or something like this (Voice Overlap) on stage."
1974.73-1004,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3355.351,3365.68,"Are you saying Jenkins and Georgia might have been differently decided that at Georgia or that, I forgot the city involved, had an ordinance such as you have in Chattanooga?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3365.68,3374.926,"I think as we move from the stage to the screen that the powers of the state are correspondingly increased, because --"
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3374.926,3382.396,"So the act didn't take place in Jenkins against Georgia, it didn't take place in Georgia, the act took place in Hollywood, California?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3382.396,3383.956,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3383.956,3391.641,"And there wasn't an offense assuming Georgia had the same law or ordinance, it wasn't if -- it doesn't take place within that jurisdiction?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3391.641,3392.298,That's correct.
1974.73-1004,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3392.298,3396.514,"So that, but if your ordinance in Chattanooga read actual or simulated then what?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3396.514,3399.413,"Well, the state law in Tennessee now does read actual or simulation."
1974.73-1004,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3399.413,3401.483,"Well that, [Attempt to Laughter] that in Jenkins and Georgia?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3401.483,3405.124,"Well, how do you simulate nudity?"
1974.73-1004,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3414.819,3420.491,"Mr. Nelson, does Tennessee law proscribed lewdness as well as nudity?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3420.491,3426.432,"Yes Your Honor, I would refer to the case of Riyal versus State of Tennessee in our brief."
1974.73-1004,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3426.432,3431.338,Does the statute use the term lewdness in addition to nudity?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3431.338,3435.59,No.
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3435.59,3436.56,It's the word lewd.
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3436.56,3438.31,"That's the city ordinance, I think --"
1974.73-1004,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3438.31,3440.866,It has to be a lewd act in a public place?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3440.866,3446.505,The city ordinance uses -- obscene indecent or lewd act in a public place.
1974.73-1004,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3447.116,3458.724,You consider lewdness to be the precises equivalent of nudity and vice versa?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3458.724,3471.538,"No Your Honor, particularly when you're dealing with the screen, I think that lewdness has a broader category than would be nudity."
1974.73-1004,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3471.538,3478.561,Is exception made in the law for the exhibition of nudes in your public museums?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3478.561,3482.375,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3485.626,3488.501,How about a portrayal of person?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3488.501,3490.67,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3490.67,3496.842,But you think there maybe a distinction between lewdness and just plain and simple nudity?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3496.842,3499.204,I think lewdness is much broader category.
1974.73-1004,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3499.204,3501.668,Is there any Tennessee law in that point?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3501.668,3503.634,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3507.664,3508.695,In your brief?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3508.695,3549.6,"Which I didn't go into facts in that case, but the case involved a situation where a man called a woman on the street and found her turning and looking he exposed himself without -- just standing there and without making any indecent expressions to her, much has occurred on the stage in this play and the Tennessee Supreme Court in that case said that upon exposure of one's genitals, all that is necessary is the intent to expose, not the intent to do so for an immoral purpose and they affirmed the conviction of the man based on gross indecency and lewdness."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3549.6,3552.867,"You have -- some of the criminal laws in Tennessee is common law, isn't it?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3552.867,3553.344,Yes sir.
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3553.344,3553.404,Not a statutory?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3553.404,3555.866,This is a common law offense that I'm speaking of right now.
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3555.866,3557.737,Yes.
1974.73-1004,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3557.737,3563.864,"Will this case have been the same if “Hair” was not produced on the stage, but shown in the movie?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3563.864,3565.936,No Your Honor.
1974.73-1004,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3566.802,3568.833,How does Tennessee law govern?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3568.833,3579.088,"Well, it might be now under the post-Miller decision."
1974.73-1004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3596.554,3609.115,"At the outset of your argument, you referred I think to an opening scene or at least an early scene on the play where the man or some actor leaped off the stage and performed certain acts."
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3618.356,3661.58,"I would believe so, Your Honor, although once again I cannot cite you to a definitive decision on that, but coming down and off the stage and wearing only briefs with some beads hanging down in front of him as this man did and standing or sitting himself on a seat facing a young lady and saying “I bet your scared shitless!” and then proceeding back towards the stage using these beads to simulate his genitals and going through what would amount to a masturbation, I think that under the post-Miller law that has been adopted, that that could constitute lewdness under Tennessee law."
1974.73-1004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3661.933,3676.336,"But it would -- I take it that it would follow up from that if the same actor performed out in a local park, in front of the theater across the street that your answer would be that that would be clearly subject for prosecution?"
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3676.336,3682.332,It would be a simulated masturbation which would be clearly subject to prosecution as indecent or obscene acts.
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3682.332,3684.862,"What, with beads?[Attempt to Laughter]"
1974.73-1004,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3684.862,3694.823,"Now, the early act you've just described is what you're referring to, you were describing the act that occurred when he came off of the stage."
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3702.776,3706.581,"The case has never been decided, but it would be my opinion."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3706.581,3708.857,What act are we talking about?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3708.857,3715.514,I would think it would be as he was saying come down off the stage and --
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3715.514,3719.748,He was coming down off the stage when you're on the public sidewalk. (Voice Overlap)
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3719.748,3733.819,"Yes, you can but going up and confronting a young lady out in the public and spreading your legs and wearing only a brief pair of shorts and looking down at her and saying “I think -- I'll bet you're scared shitless!”"
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3733.819,3735.647,And what would that violate?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3735.647,3737.16,"I think that would constitute lewd act, Your Honor."
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3737.16,3739.782,Accept the cannon of (Inaudible) taste.
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3739.782,3741.533,A lead act Your Honor.
1974.73-1004,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3741.533,3742.268,It would be what?
1974.73-1004,1,40090,randall_l_nelson,,3742.268,3746.964,"A lewd act, an act of gross indecency."
