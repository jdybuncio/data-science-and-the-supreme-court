1957.72,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,16.409,"Number 72 and 73, Stanislaw Nowak versus United States of America and Rebecca Maisenberg verus United States of America."
1957.72,0,22322,ernest_goodman,,20.98,22.499,May it please the Court.
1957.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,981.786,1001.865,"May I ask you Mr. Goodman whether affidavits by persons whose statements were in the Department of Justice, filed on the basis of which the officer made the affidavit would have satisfied your criteria, your demands."
1957.72,0,22322,ernest_goodman,,1001.865,1003.55,If Your Honor means that --
1957.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1003.55,1004.697,I mean in this very case.
1957.72,0,22322,ernest_goodman,,1004.697,1014.491,If Your Honor means that if the affidavits filed with the Department of Justice had been attached -- copies had been attached to Mr. Spicer's affidavit.
1957.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1014.491,1015.214,Yes.
1957.72,0,22322,ernest_goodman,,1015.214,1020.203,"Yes, I think that would have been sufficient because I think the criterion then would be."
1957.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1085.186,1096.795,It ought not to be necessary to assign from time to time it is to say that questions don't imply any -- any argument or agreement or conclusion so I'd like to put to you these questions.
1957.72,0,22322,ernest_goodman,,1136.631,1137.655,No I --
1957.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1137.655,1138.159,Is that true?
1957.72,0,22322,ernest_goodman,,1138.781,1142.022,I think that is true except I break -- break it down to two points.
1957.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1160.51,1160.728,No.
1957.72,0,22322,ernest_goodman,,1176.425,1177.255,Have that --
1957.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1177.255,1178.768,"That -- that is there, isn't it?"
1957.72,0,22322,ernest_goodman,,1215.949,1224.997,His subs -- his conclusions are substituted for the conclusions that the court would otherwise have to make himself from the fact.
1957.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1225.285,1227.057,On the question of whether he has a good cause.
1957.72,0,22322,ernest_goodman,,1227.057,1233.802,"Yes, sir."
1957.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1298.717,1303.964,"Well, let me ask you this in light of that that you've already done."
1957.72,0,22322,ernest_goodman,,1333.534,1334.266,"No, no."
1957.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1334.266,1336.101,It will have to take the face value --
1957.72,0,22322,ernest_goodman,,1336.101,1336.287,Yes.
1957.72,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1336.287,1339.196,-- however improbable the allegations maybe.
1957.72,0,22322,ernest_goodman,,1339.196,1340.943,I think the Brinegar case answers that.
1957.72,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,2105.457,2108.869,May it please the Court.
1957.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2265.462,2274.349,Now isn't that stated more broadly than the issue raised by the defendant could not be an eyewitness?
1957.72,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,2284.636,2286.422,Well first of all I --
1957.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2286.422,2304.297,I thought he said it was -- it was something like an affidavit for a search warrant or some other proceedings of that kind which do not require a man to be an eyewitness to on this thing but it does require them to show proper cause.
1957.72,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,2304.297,2314.76,If I were clear that the Court agreed by then I could dispense with that part of the argument but I'm afraid that the case was cited upon reviewing the brief if I may take a little time --
1957.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2314.76,2315.439,Oh yes.
1957.72,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,2315.439,2315.57,-- to go through those --
1957.72,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2315.57,2316.537,Take all the time you want.
1957.72,1,28966,j_f_bishop,,2316.846,2326.265,"-- unless there be a lingering doubt and also because it will differentiate the questions of how much more, why wasn't this enough, how much should he tell?"
