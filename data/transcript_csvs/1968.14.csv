1968.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,28.499,"Number 14, Commonwealth Coatings Corporation, petitioner, versus Continental Casualty Company, et al."
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,30.546,34.768,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,240.993,243.449,He never asked the arbitrator.
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,243.449,246.585,The affidavit doesn't disclose that he asked --
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,246.585,249.529,Just suppose that he asked --
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,249.529,254.431,"No, it doesn't say that -- it does say that none of the arbitrators informed him."
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,259.151,263.179,Do you think the arbitrator justified that nobody asked him.
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,263.179,264.268,He did.
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,303.159,308.967,"Well, why gather that your position that it's other misbehavior under the statute?"
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,308.967,321.127,"No, our position is that the arbitrator and the respondent with whom he had present relations were under a duty to disclose these previous relationships --"
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,321.127,329.566,"Yes, but the statute which you just quoted to us speaks in terms of certain misbehavior of the arbitrator, doesn't it?"
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,329.566,330.515,That's right.
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,332.331,339.338,Apart -- apart from the position of the contractor and any duty he may have had.
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,349.403,356.61,"No, our position is that the very failure to make disclosure constitutes misbehavior to the prejudice of the petitioner."
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,356.61,361.414,"Well, that's what I've asked you and this on the part of the -- on the part of the arbitrator."
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,361.414,362.293,On the arbitrator.
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,362.293,364.514,Independently of the other party for the proceeding.
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,364.514,370.921,"And also on the part of the respondent, because the statute refers to corruption and fraud."
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,372.328,373.713,"Well, let me put it to you again."
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,373.713,374.298,Yes.
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,374.298,388.36,"Are you submitting to us that without regard to the conduct or the failure of the other party of the arbitration to disclose, it is misbehavior under the statute for the arbitrator not to disclose."
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,388.36,388.921,Yes.
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.921,389.374,Alright.
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,389.374,399.866,And we also and we go further and we say that not only was it misbehavior on the part of the arbitrator but that there was a duty on the part of the respondent to disclose these prior relations.
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,399.866,401.155,Where did that duty come from?
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,401.155,401.707,Pardon?
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,401.707,402.666,Where is that duty come from?
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,402.666,422.488,"As a matter of law, that when parties submit their controversy to an arbitration board and particularly to a tripartite board that certainly is the duty of the respondent to disclose that the third arbitrator who's suppose to be a neutral arbitrator is in fact not a neutral arbitrator."
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,422.488,426.081,But at least -- at least your other argument is based on the statute.
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,426.081,427.189,"That's true, but --"
1968.14,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,427.189,428.212,Is this one?
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,428.212,429.059,"Oh, yes."
1968.14,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,447.429,466.532,"Well, the First Circuit does not, Mr. Harris, the -- Mr. Harris, the First Circuit does not deny that in some circumstances, there may be a duty on the part of the arbitrator to make voluntary disclosure."
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,485.022,487.75,That's what the Court of Appeals held --
1968.14,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,487.75,496.387,"In other words, the Court of Appeals affirmed the factual determination by the District Court."
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,496.387,510.78,"That's true but the Court also held that the circumstances Mr. Justice Fortas could also held that under the circumstances and facts in this case, it will far better if there had been disclosure."
1968.14,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,545.632,558.708,"Mr. Harris, what would happen if the arbitrator in good faith forgot and later on remembered, would you upset the whole award?"
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,558.708,563.192,"Mr. Justice Marshall, it will be impossible for this arbitrator to forget that."
1968.14,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,563.192,564.386,I'm not talking about this case.
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,566.255,577.453,"In a hypothetical case, if the circumstances were such as to justify our forgetfulness, there might be some excuse or justifications (Voice Overlap) but not in this case."
1968.14,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,577.453,598.244,"I'm just saying that maybe you're going too far in making just a flat rule that if a neutral arbitrator has at anytime under any circumstances in the past, and any deal as with one of them that in and of itself, is sufficient to offset in the rule."
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,598.244,602.471,I think that you would have to go to the facts in the particular case.
1968.14,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,611.709,614.075,I'm not asking for pro se rule?
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,614.075,614.547,Pardon?
1968.14,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,614.547,618.79,"You're not asking for automatic pro say rule, are you?"
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,618.79,623.301,Not automatic except under the facts of this case.
1968.14,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,731.092,736.506,Did you say Mr. Harris now many years back it was that these relationships --
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,736.506,739.161,They terminated about a year before the arbitration.
1968.14,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1019.739,1021.867,Were these a unanimous award?
1968.14,0,22460,emanuel_harris,,1021.867,1037.901,Those are not unanimous award and this arbitrator who testified that he depended on Capacete was one of the lawyers whose names on -- who was on the list given by Capacete to Mr. Romero as an attorney who knew something about engineering services.
1968.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1339.635,1361.469,Mr. Currie.
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,1361.469,1365.847,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.14,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1841.48,1892.191,"Well, Mr. Currie, if there is a question of law here, I suppose it is -- it has to me a contention that in these circumstances an arbitrator has a duty to come forward and make disclosure whether or not he is asked questions or appropriate questions that they have assigned and then even where you have a unanimous award, there is a per se whatever phrase of Latin or otherwise one wants to use in affirmative duty on the part of an arbitrator to come forward with statements that circumstances that may affect his qualification."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,1894.881,1900.284,"Yes sir, that is correct Mr. Justice Fortas."
1968.14,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1951.342,1955.0,"Who suggested Mr. Capacete for the -- for this, the arbitrator's job?"
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,1955.0,1958.182,"The other two arbitrators, Your Honor."
1968.14,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1958.182,1962.932,"The other two, was there -- one must have suggested for the other, I take it."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,1962.932,1964.667,I -- I do not know which.
1968.14,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1964.667,1965.484,Is there anything?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,1974.453,1974.795,"No, sir."
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2148.758,2150.186,May I ask you Mr. Currie?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2150.186,2152.65,"Yes, Mr. Justice Black."
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2152.65,2176.288,"Do you think that if a man is called on to act as a judge in a court and he knew, the other side didn't know that he had had close business connections such as was alleged here, whether there is a statute or not that it will be his duty to report to that connection, what would you think?"
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2176.288,2188.392,I think Your Honor when you indicate close that the present law dealing with a direct interest that is more than insubstantial and present certainly there should be a duty.
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2190.402,2192.235,But they alleged that it was closed.
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2192.235,2194.515,"Your Honor, in this instance, I would just come into that."
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2196.291,2213.897,"There's a difference to me in arguing a defense of what was done if you put it on the basis that a claim, that he was, had been associated but it was not substantial and one which seeks to defend it without saying it was not substantial."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2213.897,2217.278,"Yes, I was getting ready Your Honor to deal with that bare question."
1968.14,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2255.374,2262.924,"Well, apart from that, the question for us really is whether the courts below find that, I think that's the question."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2288.365,2290.17,"Yes sir, that is absolutely correct."
1968.14,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2290.17,2292.381,Did the District Court found that?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2292.381,2310.126,"The District Court found that there was in fact, not only that the District Court find that there was not imputation even of partiality, much less fraud but the District Court reviewed all the evidence."
1968.14,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2313.855,2328.985,"Next question is, did the District Court find that the relationship was not sufficiently close to require the arbitrator to come forward with a disclosure?"
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2328.985,2341.588,"Your Honor, the District Court held that there was no imputation thus expressed -- disclaim of any impartiality or fraud and then held this."
1968.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2441.522,2458.517,Mr. Currie would the connections which the arbitrator in question had with your client been such that they would have had to have been disclosed under the commercial rules of the Arbitration Association under Rule 11?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2458.517,2473.699,"Your Honor, we believe under the Ilios case and the authority of the Gimbel's case, both which are cited that they would be held to be insubstantial."
1968.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.003,2482.535,"Well, I thought it would have been substantial for purposes of whether he was even qualified but how about the rule on disclosure."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2482.535,2494.143,"Well, given the Gimbel case, Your Honor, there is one of the arbitrators was a realtor and Gimbel was a party to arbitration and there was a duty to make such disclosure."
1968.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.041,2528.863,But it's the kind that would normally be disclosed.
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2528.863,2538.662,"I would think under the regulation that it certainly would be better practice if our client had been asked, or we had been asked, “Has it been past business relations?”"
1968.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.685,2547.177,"Oh, I know but the rule puts on affirmative -- suggest an affirmative duty on the arbitrator."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2547.177,2548.005,That is correct.
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2590.77,2607.062,Did I understand counsel who say that this arbitrator had some employment in connection with this total project that is here under consideration?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2607.062,2609.088,"This arbitrator's firm, Your Honor."
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2609.088,2612.92,"Well, let's say, he owned the firm, didn't he?"
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2612.92,2617.396,"He own 60% something of it, majority stockholder and they did --"
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2617.396,2618.665,"But in post-owning, isn't it?"
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2618.665,2619.385,"Yes, sir."
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2628.277,2630.388,In connection with this same project?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2630.388,2632.368,"Not all, only two of them."
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2673.07,2680.667,Is the burden on them to prove this or is the burden on your people --
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2680.667,2681.245,Uniform --
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2681.245,2684.144,-- to show that the arbitrator was not bias?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2684.144,2687.714,The burden is completely upon them Your Honor by Universal decision.
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2687.714,2688.351,I beg your pardon?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2688.351,2693.361,The burden is placed by law and all decisions that we know of upon them.
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2696.896,2705.57,"No matter what the secret relationship might be between the arbitrator and the others, your side?"
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2705.57,2713.52,It will burden would be upon them to show that they had -- there had been some disqualifying relationship that they had no knowledge of.
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2751.722,2756.215,What you mean by that that it is legally not here?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2756.215,2763.02,I'm saying Your Honor that I believe that it is (Voice Overlap) legally been surrendered so that there are no grounds to object here.
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2763.02,2765.326,"So, it's not properly here, you say."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2765.326,2766.606,"No, sir."
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2795.282,2797.103,As I understand here.
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2797.103,2797.911,I beg your pardon?
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2797.911,2816.19,"As I understand it, the court below considered that it was not a sufficient case and he called on to announce his interest because it was a small part of his income and you have been -- you have argued that here."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2816.19,2816.515,"Yes, sir."
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2830.389,2835.921,Are you familiar with Tumey against Ohio?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2835.921,2836.415,"I am not, Your Honor."
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2836.415,2840.265,That's a case where a judge in this arbitrator is a judge.
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2858.963,2859.797,In that instance --
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2859.797,2865.613,"Now, why should those arbitrators be up to as high a standard as a judge, he is a judge?"
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2865.613,2880.306,"Your Honor, in that connection, Professor Sturges who was a dean of arbitration for many, many years analogized in a case in our -- cited in our brief that an arbitrator is more appropriately analogized to a juryman than a judge."
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2880.306,2882.528,"Alright, well, I suppose he said juryman."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2882.528,2884.004,And under juryman --
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2884.004,2887.276,"He will -- he was a wise juryman, he knew about lawsuits."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2887.276,2900.169,"Under the law, the universal, fundamental law, as we understand it Your Honor a party must ask that this qualifying questions on voir dire in allowing a juryman --"
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2900.169,2904.43,Suppose he was a brother of a party in the case.
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2904.43,2910.459,"In most states, I think as a matter -- that's a close relation."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2923.251,2945.241,"This arbitrator was his closest to me if not closer and they -- we held, this Court held that the smallness, no matter how small a trial would be, we refuse those words, the slightest interest was enough and it should be revealed and it should not ask?"
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2953.101,2954.068,How remote was it?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2954.068,2955.835,Your Honor the party -- pardon?
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2955.835,2957.896,How remote was it?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2959.101,2961.684,"By more than a year, in some six and seven years."
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2962.495,2965.79,How many years had he been handling cases?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2965.79,2966.435,He had --
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2966.435,2968.891,The firm for this.
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,2968.891,2979.606,He had been making concrete borings on a casual and irregular basis from time to time over a four or five-year period while this contractor was getting started.
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3013.133,3017.349,I am sure they have been called to your attention by the other side.
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3029.47,3033.719,"Your Honor, if they had objected, we didn't --"
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3033.719,3037.71,"Well, I understand that, it's not your fault."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3037.71,3053.522,"With reference to that and the qualifications of the judge because certainly this a proper question, the authorities indicate and Professor Sturges that the parties have no choice."
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3089.936,3091.505,"Well, that might be true."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3091.505,3094.489,But -- so the parties have set their standard.
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3098.034,3099.352,"Well, may I ask."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3107.622,3108.303,"No, sir."
1968.14,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3113.873,3115.326,I see.
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3115.326,3117.16,Thirty years as Corps of Engineer.
1968.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3158.749,3165.635,"Your suggestion is that the petitioner's choice for the board, Mr. Romero."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3170.043,3172.547,"Well, as to the contrary of the evidence Your Honor."
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3209.981,3241.027,"So, Mr. Currie without regard to the other merits of the case that it's little difficult for me to see how you can say that after five years of occasional employment of this arbitrator, he was finally employed on this particular job and still you say it's remote, that's difficult for me to see the remoteness of it."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3241.027,3246.611,"Your Honor, it was remote in time and it was past like the federal judge --"
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3246.611,3255.743,"But on the same job, how do you come that this person is remote if it's on the same job that is to be arbitrated?"
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3255.743,3257.35,"Alright, I see Your Honor."
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3271.291,3286.774,"No, I wasn't asking about whether it was painting or soil test but it's -- I was talking about the remoteness and they did work for you on this particular job after having worked for you for five years on other jobs."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3293.057,3318.845,"The only answer I can give Your Honor is that his work was that of an independent contractor, irregular, casual, routine testing for which they charge a routine of professional fee of breaking concrete blocks, testing sand materials and his work had occurred before this dispute arose and the arbitration occurred."
1968.14,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3337.723,3390.629,"Mr. Currie, I wonder if you would agree that it comes down to something like this, particularly in view of the knowledge that counsel for the petitioner had Romero had of Mr. Capacete's activities generally that it's reasonable to assume that petitioner deliberately chose not to make inquiry but to rely presumably on Mr. Capacete's general reputation as a skilled man and as a fair man and that in those circumstances, there was no duty on Capacete's part to come forward with a disclosure unless in addition to the standards of the Federal Arbitration Act there is some per se duty."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3392.031,3393.917,That's a fair summary.
1968.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3393.917,3404.729,"Well, except I thought you just answered me Mr. Currie that on this record, Romero disclaims any knowledge or whatever of any activity of Capacete for the respondent."
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3404.729,3442.743,"He disclaims knowledge about these particular past relationships but in answer to Mr. Justice Fortas' question, I believe that is correct that Mr. Romero knew Mr. Capacete so well that he accepted him, he and his client as arbitrator because of their confidence in his professional skill, his integrity, his honesty and his ability and they were not interested in whether or not he may or may not have had some relations."
1968.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.931,3464.394,"And Mr. Currie, do you feel if there's any difference in the standards it ought to apply to any of the arbitrator, any of these three arbitrators?"
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3464.394,3470.988,"Your Honor, the majority rule is that all three are --"
1968.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3470.988,3471.704,Stand on the same footing?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3471.704,3473.27,-- have stand on the same footing.
1968.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3486.533,3497.069,You let it be known in this case that you weren't interested in -- your side wasn't interested in the other side replacing its arbitrator with anyone who had any business relationships.
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3497.069,3502.11,"No, sir, that was anyone who had an interest in the litigation."
1968.14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3502.11,3504.745,What does that mean?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3507.582,3512.981,"That that incidentally Your Honor, it was part of the --"
1968.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3512.981,3517.066,"Well, what would you say if -- would you say that --"
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3517.066,3524.817,"We didn't want them to appoint for example, since an arbitrator may be someone employed."
1968.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3555.861,3558.4,But what about in this kind of a contract?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3558.4,3570.254,"In this instance, there was no -- the contractor did not speak so who was qualified or disqualified."
1968.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3583.84,3591.969,Your view was of the same standards applies to all three arbitrators when they are appointed as they were or here under this contract?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3591.969,3592.492,"Yes, sir."
1968.14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3633.657,3635.496,"That's fine, thank you very much."
1968.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3635.496,3648.33,Am I correct in recalling that Mr. Romero was asked at some point in this hearing what he would have done had he known of Capacete's connection with the subcontractor?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3648.33,3648.615,"Yes, sir."
1968.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3649.674,3650.993,What does he answer?
1968.14,1,37415,overton_a_currie,,3650.993,3665.277,His answer was that he would not have objected but would have given or probably it wouldn't have forgotten whether it was (Inaudible) or conditional but it was given his client the information for them to decide.
1968.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3665.446,3667.9,"Thank you, Mr. Currie."
1968.14,2,22460,emanuel_harris,,3668.803,3672.421,May I have a few minutes.
1968.14,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3776.875,3781.898,"Are you suggesting, you should have disqualified himself because he was a good friend of your counsel?"
1968.14,2,22460,emanuel_harris,,3781.898,3782.575,"Oh, No."
