1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,17.364,21.267,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1962.201,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,93.403,94.925,"Well, would you --"
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,94.925,97.217,"-- in fact, they've taken the whole thing."
1962.201,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,97.217,101.399,"Well, would the marshal -- where are the marshals?"
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,105.448,107.066,You have the record early as well --
1962.201,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,107.066,111.138,Yes.
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,111.138,119.027,I assume there was no complicity on part of the State on what happened.
1962.201,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,388.83,398.186,Would you mind indicating (Inaudible) in arguing which of these elements do you think that should mean (Inaudible)
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,398.186,402.062,"Yes, I will do that, sir."
1962.201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,565.122,592.448,(Inaudible)
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,592.448,595.121,"To defend, Mr. Justice White, on what the point was."
1962.201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.121,601.598,"(Inaudible) had the evidence, and the Court said it's a frivolous point."
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,601.598,608.613,"Yes, my contention would be this, and I think it's consistent with the decision of this Court."
1962.201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.819,628.178,(Inaudible) failure to comply with the rule of Washington (Inaudible)
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,628.178,635.591,"Yes, that -- well -- but I understood your question to be whether I would contend that in such a case, the man would be entitled to a transcript."
1962.201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.591,644.101,But in that case (Inaudible)
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,644.101,645.195,"Oh, that's correct."
1962.201,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,740.411,750.457,(Inaudible)
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,750.457,751.287,That's correct.
1962.201,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,759.748,768.457,"In other words, do you say that the relevance is a one way to (Inaudible) the generality of the charge that a denial was (Inaudible)"
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,768.457,769.052,That is correct.
1962.201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,968.805,986.575,"Now he -- it certainly gives the indigent a lot more than the federal statute gives in Section 1915 of Title 28 of United States Code, doesn't it?"
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,986.575,987.905,I don't have that performing --
1962.201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,987.905,988.396,"Well, I'd read it to you."
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,988.396,990.592,-- Mr. Justice Stewart.
1962.201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,990.592,1010.907,"It simply says with the statutory language, “An appeal --” this is part of 1915 (a) -- only a part of -- “An appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that it has not taken in good faith and there's no requirement for a hearing or finding or for representation by counsel before the trial court.”"
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,1010.907,1013.465,"Well, yes, but this Court has construed that statute --"
1962.201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1013.465,1013.774,I know that.
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,1013.774,1033.952,"-- in Coppedge case in such a way that I don't know how, how the statute could be complied with unless a district -- Federal District Court gave a transcript to the indigents who have filed his motion for an appeal in forma pauperis."
1962.201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1049.245,1054.234,And of course there is (Inaudible) in the other cases but I -- the statutory language is all I was referring to.
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,1054.234,1062.673,"Yes, so far as the statutory language is concerned, I don't think that without the embroidery that this Court has placed on it goes quite as far as our rule."
1962.201,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1062.673,1066.014,And do you think that was constitutionally required embroidery?
1962.201,0,19420,charles_f_luce,,1067.83,1068.927,"Well, yes."
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1298.103,1307.345,"Mr. -- may it -- Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court."
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1405.71,1407.344,Of the hearing on the application --
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1407.344,1407.607,Of the hearing --
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1407.607,1408.299,-- for a defense.
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1408.299,1409.485,On the application.
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1409.485,1410.735,Not of the trial?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1410.735,1412.431,Not of the trial.
1962.201,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1505.585,1507.258,Where is that affidavit?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1507.258,1514.232,"That appears on page 9 -- (Inaudible) I believe its on page 19, it begins --"
1962.201,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1514.232,1515.833,(Inaudible)
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1515.833,1520.565,-- of the record before this Court.
1962.201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.774,1580.713,(Inaudible)
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1580.713,1592.584,That's right and I believe I can show Mr. Justice White in a moment that our Supreme Court from the record that was before us was able to answer every single contention that was raised.
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1592.584,1600.538,"But Mr. Lally, a litigant who could afford the transcript would not be in their position before your Supreme Court, would he?"
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1613.324,1614.155,That is correct.
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1614.155,1631.166,"How do we meet therefore the basic contention of this case that having afforded a right of appeal, then you must in connection with the appeal give equal consideration to every litigant, rich or poor, that does not increase under your premise, does it?"
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1631.166,1632.461,I think it can.
1962.201,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1669.283,1670.959,If -- that is if there was no objection made or --
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1670.959,1673.396,If there was no objection made and on the proper ground.
1962.201,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1673.396,1673.524,Right.
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1673.524,1675.174,Our Supreme Court will not reverse.
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1675.174,1679.695,How do we know that in this case since there is no stenographic record?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1679.695,1699.169,"Because if -- what happened in this case, and it shows up on -- beginning on page 77 of this trial record is the opinion of our Supreme Court that this matter it was decided by our Supreme Court under the title of State versus Law."
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1724.515,1726.414,Where is number six of it?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1726.414,1736.082,"That appears, Mr. Justice Black, on page 12 of the record."
1962.201,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1776.521,1779.1,"It's found on page 80, I think, of the record."
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1779.1,1792.163,"The judge denies this allegation, under our rules of pleading, practice and procedure of the right to disqualify a trial judge because of prejudice must be by affidavit, made prior to the judges entering upon the trial of the matters, citing the statute."
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1792.163,1802.514,"Now, let's just -- assuming that (Inaudible)"
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1802.514,1803.706,The seventh assignment?
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1803.706,1804.006,Yes.
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1804.006,1804.359,Very well.
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1804.844,1805.94,(Inaudible)
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1805.94,1814.292,The seventh assignment alleged where that the trial judge should have dismissed the case as the defendants are not guilty as charged.
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1880.976,1885.536,Now this is the evidence outlined by the files as it said.
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1885.536,1896.094,By -- in the findings of fact of the trial judge and the uncontradicted affidavit of Johnson which summarized the evidence given with reference to the robbery.
1962.201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1896.094,1907.197,"So, Mr. Lally isn't that -- I think what you're really saying is that the Supreme Court of Washington gave full appellate review on the merits to this assignment error."
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1907.197,1909.048,In this particular case Mr. Justice White --
1962.201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1909.048,1915.357,And did not hold that -- that it was a frivolous ground at all.
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1915.357,1917.243,"They found, Mr. Justice White, that the --"
1962.201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.243,1943.632,"Well, I thought in the Rhay case, in your Woods against Rhay case, that the Supreme Court of Washington said that the Supreme Court of the United States had held that an appeal could not be denied on the grounds that the point was frivolous, whether the defendants contention was that the evidence was insufficiently sustained the conviction."
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,1967.838,1980.025,"In this case it is our position, Mr. Justice White that the Supreme Court of Washington was able to review this in the same manner as if they have had a statement of stenographic report of the trial."
1962.201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1980.025,1992.188,"So, you say this -- that this whole appellate procedure that was going through in this particular case really is equivalent to a full appellate review in a fair way."
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2000.425,2002.97,I think we can state that the result would --
1962.201,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2002.97,2003.216,Aren't you --
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2003.216,2004.171,(Inaudible) be either way.
1962.201,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2004.171,2009.24,Aren't you in difficulty on that when you come to errors number eight and nine?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2009.24,2011.31,Number eight?
1962.201,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2011.31,2024.269,"Numbers eight and nine of what the Court which discusses on page 81, because without the presence of a transcript, they were unable to specify what those errors were with --"
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2024.269,2024.278,Well --
1962.201,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2024.278,2027.482,-- sufficient precision to satisfy the Court?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2027.482,2028.006,With reference --
1962.201,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2028.006,2037.482,Isn't that -- aren't those errors eight and nine illustrative of the utility and the need for a transcript in preparing an appeal?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2037.482,2042.544,"Well, here is how our Supreme Court handled number eight, Mr. Justice."
1962.201,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2090.655,2094.014,"And how could you without a transcript, unless you have a remarkable memory?"
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2094.014,2105.605,"Well, in this particular case -- in the first place, the lawyer who handled all of it was selected by the indigents and then paid compensated by the State."
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2119.906,2160.516,But isn't there a (Inaudible) there is no requirement that you can buy a transcript in order to raise the point that you insist (Inaudible)
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2160.516,2161.081,That is correct.
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2161.081,2161.711,Isn't that correct?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2161.711,2162.537,That is certainly correct.
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2162.787,2167.309,(Inaudible)
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2167.309,2168.15,"One is what, sir?"
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2168.15,2177.738,(Inaudible)
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2177.738,2177.953,I --
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2177.953,2180.142,(Inaudible)
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2180.142,2195.081,"I certainly would agree that this method of review in many instances, our Court could not review by this method in many cases but -- and if they applied the formula wrong and of course, that there would be difficulties."
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2225.387,2230.619,(Inaudible)
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2230.619,2231.073,Well --
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2231.073,2232.638,(Inaudible)
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2232.638,2234.615,"Not solely, not solely."
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2261.807,2280.118,(Inaudible)
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2280.118,2281.054,"No, sir."
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2281.054,2282.129,(Inaudible)
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2282.129,2283.546,"That's right, sir."
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2322.844,2342.404,"In fact, what you're saying inst it, that this attorney could've filed another affidavit and would've switched along with the affidavit with the State's attorney whether the man is a -- was in a -- equivalent of a bystander's bill of exception, is that the effect of what you're saying?"
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2342.404,2344.109,"I sort of think it is, Mr. Justice Black."
1962.201,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2355.671,2361.95,Then it would -- then it would very likely be error at least under the state law not to grant a free transcript.
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2361.95,2362.245,Yes.
1962.201,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2368.877,2374.864,Whether or not in the Constitution it would be error under state law not to grant a free transcript if there was dispute about as -- about what the record shows.
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2374.864,2379.213,I think our Court would have to grant a free transcript if the facts had been in dispute.
1962.201,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2379.213,2386.74,But if -- since they're not going to bystander's bill of exceptions or something equivalent thereto you say its sufficient under -- both under the state law and constitutionally.
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2386.74,2388.434,Yes sir.
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2388.434,2395.506,Do you have a bill of exceptions still in that State?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2395.506,2398.553,"Well, I'm not too sure, Mr. Justice Black."
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2402.123,2419.887,"Preparation of the proceed -- what took place at the trial including the -- either the stenographic transcript or summary of what took place, together with the precise objections that were made along in the trial, or how does the Court review --"
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2419.887,2419.946,Oh well --
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2419.946,2421.623,-- a case of this kind?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2421.623,2436.263,"In Wash -- in the State of Washington, a review by our appellate court had happened and occurred either in some instances without any statement of facts at all if it's a legal question applying to the pleadings."
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2464.902,2482.873,"And I supposed the party hadn't bought a transcript and carried it up with the way you say, brought it up to the Court, could the State then have brought in this affidavit by the District Attorney to refute what was in the transcript?"
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2482.873,2486.479,"Oh no -- oh -- no, Mr. Justice Black, no, (Inaudible)."
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2486.479,2491.084,How would it have been tried then by the court -- the appellate court?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2498.441,2501.145,If this had gone to our appellate court by a --
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2501.145,2502.111,By a full transcript.
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2502.111,2503.985,-- by a full transcript.
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2526.234,2528.13,With that argument?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2528.13,2531.043,"Oh no, there would be argument just as there was."
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2550.649,2554.33,How did that appear if it -- without a transcript?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2554.33,2562.49,That appears from the findings of fact that the trial judge made and it's not contested the factual correctness of the trial judge findings of fact.
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2566.042,2572.554,"Well, what was the occasion for his finding of facts that there were no objections?"
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2574.358,2574.486,Well --
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2574.486,2582.28,-- in defiance of guilty but what were the issues before the trial judge when he made this finding of fact?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2582.28,2590.273,"The issues were before him at that time was Mr. Draper, this petitioner and his codefendant, Mr. Lorentzen and their counsel."
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2602.157,2602.533,And in Court?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2602.533,2605.012,He said -- in Court at the time --
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2605.012,2607.102,And what was the issue at that moment?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2607.102,2620.742,The issue at that time was whether or not a free transcript of the robbery trial which had already occurred would be granted or if in fact the request was frivolous and should be denied.
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2620.742,2625.749,And under your rules the district -- trial judge passes on that first?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2625.749,2637.412,"He passes first and automatically this formula provides if the indigent is not satisfied, it must be reviewed by certiorari by our appellate court."
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2637.412,2644.603,And it was in this kind of a hearing that this -- finds it -- his findings were made to which you refer -- on which you rely?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2644.603,2646.823,"That is right, sir."
1962.201,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2646.823,2650.191,Both of them were entitled to offer evidence?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2650.191,2650.807,Yes.
1962.201,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2713.614,2724.629,Is there no appeal as of right from the decision of the trial court holding this to be frivolous and therefore denying a transcript?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2724.629,2726.843,"I'm sorry, I have a cold, and little hard of hearing."
1962.201,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2726.843,2740.695,Is there no appeal as of right from the decision of the trial court holding that the appeal would be frivolous and that therefore not entitled to an appeal?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2740.695,2741.24,There is.
1962.201,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2759.325,2760.208,Well --

1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2768.641,2772.127,"Yes, Mr. Justice White and (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.201,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2772.127,2774.312,It is a --
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2774.312,2780.608,"In fact in this case, the same counsel functioned throughout the entire proceeding and that's our general practice."
1962.201,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2780.608,2792.818,"Well is he -- is the Washington Supreme Court obliged to hear the appeal or may it, in his discretion as we do here on certiorari, it declines to hear it?"
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2792.818,2794.654,It is obliged to hear it because --
1962.201,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2794.654,2795.342,I beg your pardon?
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2795.342,2797.953,It is obliged to hear it.
1962.201,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2797.953,2798.817,"Obliged to hear it, well that's --"
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2798.817,2799.404,He is obliged to hear it.
1962.201,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2799.404,2800.189,That's all I wanted --
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2800.189,2800.603,Yes.
1962.201,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2800.603,2801.167,No -- yes.
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2801.167,2801.824,Yes.
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2801.824,2807.976,Is the issue (Inaudible)
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2807.976,2809.711,The issue is --
1962.201,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2809.711,2810.819,From that reference.
1962.201,1,31581,john_j_lally,,2810.819,2811.585,Yes.
1962.201,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2846.703,2847.925,Mr. Luce.
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,2847.925,2850.531,Mr. Chief Justice.
1962.201,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2916.366,2920.681,What kind of hearing is required at that time?
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,2920.681,2935.204,"At that time, Mr. Justice Black, the hearing which is required is a hearing to determine whether or not the alleged grounds of appeal set out by the applicant for a free transcript are frivolous or not."
1962.201,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2935.204,2940.328,What evidence is admissible on the part of each project on that issue?
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,2940.328,2961.069,"The rules are silent on that point, but the -- as a practical matter, what happened here in the evidence such as it was, was simply the recollection of the attorney who represented the defendants at the trial, the recollection of one of the defendants himself, the recollection of the deputy prosecutor who had tried the case, and the recollection of the trial judge."
1962.201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2969.63,2987.492,"There was apparently a full hearing at which the trial court gave the lawyer full opportunity to say whatever he wants to say apparently, and in addition to that, gave these -- the defendants themselves since they want to do -- dispensing the services of the lawyer gave them a full opportunity --"
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,2987.492,2987.825,One of them.
1962.201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2987.825,2988.555,-- to state what they want to say.
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,2990.168,3000.705,"That's correct, but none of the -- neither of the defendants nor their counsel had the benefit of a transcript with the testimony to refresh his recollection of what these errors were."
1962.201,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3101.988,3113.364,What about the (Inaudible)
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,3113.364,3114.541,"I'm sorry, I can't hear you."
1962.201,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3114.541,3137.167,"(Inaudible) number eleven, the judges findings on page 28 sets out, if I would think so of the assignments of error, I suppose you'd call them, that these people raised that were not presented to him at any stage of the trial or judgment and sentence, --"
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,3137.167,3137.663,"Yes, (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.201,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3137.663,3142.954,"-- he takes up each one of this seriatim, were those in -- within those numbers (Voice Overlap)?"
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,3142.954,3154.567,"No, the -- there is no question in this record that the two exhibits that I have referred to, the gun and the jacket, were not in these -- in these numbers."
1962.201,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3171.87,3189.997,"If you're -- if you are right in this, your position is adopted to this case, would this Court be faced with the problem of assigning counsel with indigents for the preparation of petitions for certiorari?"
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,3189.997,3193.115,Well this -- you mean in the state courts?
1962.201,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3193.115,3194.699,"In this Court, I said with this Court."
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,3194.699,3201.96,"Well, in this -- our case, of course, do not present that question because the Court did appoint the counsel."
1962.201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3221.811,3226.897,(Inaudible)
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,3226.897,3228.87,I didn't hear you sir.
1962.201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3228.87,3235.144,(Inaudible) that both counsel that turned the transcript are necessary to make the appeal meaningful?
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,3235.144,3241.097,"Well, I didn't come here to argue the right to counsel on appeal because it wasn't in this case."
1962.201,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3241.097,3243.157,"Well, you had it -- you had counsel on appeal, (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,3243.157,3247.552,"Yes that's right, though the issue just isn't in this case but I would certainly contend that --"
1962.201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3247.552,3252.16,"(Inaudible) the transcripts as well as the counsel, is that --"
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,3252.16,3254.872,"And so I argue that the transcript is necessary, yes."
1962.201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3261.068,3268.532,"Yes, but whether -- whether counsel was necessary or not a transcript -- whether a counsel is present or not, a transcript is necessary."
1962.201,2,19420,charles_f_luce,,3268.532,3276.053,"Yes, I certainly would argue that and it maybe noted in the California case that just proceeded this year that is approximately the procedure they used."
