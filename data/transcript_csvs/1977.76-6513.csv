1977.76-6513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,562.47,564.301,"That is a fact finding, is it not?"
1977.76-6513,0,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,564.301,567.272,"That is, it is strictly fact finding, yes sir."
1977.76-6513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,844.992,863.935,"Well, if you place very much rest on this domination of the one by the other, you must also -- we must also, I suppose consider that at the time he was arrested, he was engaged in the same kind of an enterprise again."
1977.76-6513,0,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,869.898,879.831,"That is correct Your Honor and we would point out to the Court in that connection that at the time of the second event the next day, Hall still had the shotgun."

1977.76-6513,2,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,3548.282,3549.702,"Yes Your Honor, thank you."
1977.76-6513,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3652.466,3662.523,You think the Ohio courts are warranted under the statue in taking age in consideration in determining person’s mentality?
1977.76-6513,2,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,3662.523,3669.444,Not under the definition of mental deficiency as they have given here Your Honor because --
1977.76-6513,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3669.444,3683.079,"If someone wants to argue that because the person is young, it is more likely that he is not mentally confident, is that kind of an argument that is out of bounds under the statute?"
1977.76-6513,2,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,3683.079,3691.295,"We argued here that because he was 16 he was per se mentally deficient under the statue and they said no, they said age can be considered."
1977.76-6513,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3691.295,3693.574,You agree with that age may be considered?
1977.76-6513,2,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,3693.574,3695.841,No I do not agree with that because I do not think age --
1977.76-6513,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3695.841,3697.741,But the court said it could be considered?
1977.76-6513,3,34711,leonard_kirschner,,3702.285,3703.451,Over age or underage.
1977.76-6513,4,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,3710.798,3723.464,"I see and that might correspondingly relate to IQ, but our point is that when we discuss youth that we should not execute children, we are taking about -- in mental deficiency, we are talking about two different things, you can be a genius --"
1977.76-6513,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3723.464,3725.467,I understand that.
1977.76-6513,4,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,3730.796,3732.607,I do not think that evidence itself.
1977.76-6513,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3732.607,3735.34,The court said they can consider it?
1977.76-6513,4,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,3735.34,3740.558,"So they did, but I do not see how you could meaningfully give a consideration in determining whether the man – the defendant --"
1977.76-6513,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3740.558,3745.39,"Well, in Ohio law it is not executable evidence, I mean, it is a kind of evidence they may consider?"
1977.76-6513,4,27274,h_fred_hoefle,,3745.39,3747.747,"Well, under the statute you can put in anything you want."
1977.76-6513,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3752.055,3754.183,Except the court said that they would consider it?

1977.76-6513,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3789.14,3789.796,Thank you gentleman.
