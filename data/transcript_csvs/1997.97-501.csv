1997.97-501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.206,"We'll hear argument now in Number 97-501, Randall Ricci v. The Village of Arlington Heights."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,12.308,15.426,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-501,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,49.197,54.149,"Mr. Flaxman, what do you mean by full custodial arrest?"
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,59.903,77.364,"--What I mean is what is what the Court said in Gustafson v. Florida, that a full custodial arrest is when you're taken into custody, when you can be subjected to an inventory search, when the area around you can be searched, when you're subject to up to 48 hours of post-arrest processing."
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,92.374,106.45,"Well, if an arrest is an arrest is an arrest, your proposition that the commonlaw traditionally has not allowed arrests for misdemeanors is patently false."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,112.02,112.753,In--
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,112.753,116.072,"I mean, arrest means to stop the person."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,116.072,118.007,"--Well, in the most recent case--"
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,118.007,120.726,"Isn't that a seizure, when they stop a car?"
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,120.726,122.776,"--Well, that's temporary questioning."
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.153,137.586,"Well, in your case do you think--"
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,151.079,151.496,Yes.
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.559,177.813,"So you say the nightwalker statute was not an exception, then, to the misdemeanor--"
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,177.813,179.665,It was not an arrest provision.
1997.97-501,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,183.884,199.994,"--Well, in your case, in the case we have before us, suppose the police officer did what you say he should do and told the man, now you're going to have to come down and I'm going to give you a citation, and the fellow said, I'm not interested, and started to walk away."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,205.38,207.38,"Oh, if... yes."
1997.97-501,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,208.049,209.799,"Well, then an arrest is an arrest is an arrest."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,209.799,210.265,"--Well, no."
1997.97-501,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,220.907,221.373,No.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,228.996,231.281,--That's not an arrest.
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.839,246.89,"Of course, the Fourth Amendment doesn't address arrest."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,250.259,259.531,"Well, the Court has differentiated between seizures which are arrests and seizures which are temporary detentions for investigation like of luggage, or of--"
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,259.531,260.432,Like a what?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,260.432,266.436,"--Like of luggage, or a stop of a person for questioning at the scene of a motor vehicle incident."
1997.97-501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,275.894,285.166,"Well, you... but I thought you replied to Justice Ginsburg's question a few minutes ago that the Court has never distinguished between kinds of arrests, and now you're distinguishing between them."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,285.166,288.117,"--Well, Whren was not an arrest, is what our point is."
1997.97-501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,291.069,291.536,Okay.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,301.525,304.811,--It talks about unreasonable seizures of people.
1997.97-501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.15,316.619,"Well, but how do you know that they're subject to all the post-arrest processing."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,320.523,327.26,"Well, when somebody's taken to the police station the Court has uniformly held that that's an arrest situation."
1997.97-501,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,346.656,357.279,"Well, the distinction you're making is the distinction between simply stopping and keeping someone basically in the vicinity of the stop, and on the other hand taking the person away, as to the police station."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,358.714,360.581,"--That's correct, and we don't have--"
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.581,362.683,"Taking them into custody, I suppose."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,362.683,363.033,"--Well, I--"
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,363.033,369.586,"I suppose that you'd say if the officer told the person, you are under arrest, you'd say that that was an arrest even if--"
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,369.586,372.973,"--That's true, but once you're under arrest you don't stay at the scene."
1997.97-501,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,375.759,377.642,--Suppose the door weren't locked.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,399.375,403.427,"Well, if Mr. Ricci was free to leave, then he would not have been under arrest."
1997.97-501,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,454.725,458.413,"If in this case the officer had gotten a warrant, then everything would have been fine."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,459.063,462.115,--We would not be challenging the municipality's policy.
1997.97-501,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,473.673,482.712,"--Is there a question about whether the police officer in a case like this, an infraction of an ordinance, could have gotten a warrant?"
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,482.712,490.782,"--There's no question there are Illinois cases approving the obtaining of warrants to make arrests for minor offenses, and--"
1997.97-501,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,490.782,494.502,So it's not the idea that this is such a minor thing that somebody shouldn't be in custody.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,498.038,511.548,"--Well, but in order to get a warrant in Illinois the officer, whoever applied for a warrant has to make a showing not only that there's a violation of the law but that the person will not obey a summons, or will not obey a citation."
1997.97-501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,524.706,532.377,"Well, what if Illinois law were otherwise and a warrant was obtainable on precisely the showing that the police had here."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,535.077,535.446,No.
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.0,554.041,But it doesn't make sense to say... I thought your objection was that there was no good reason for taking this person down to the station.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,561.045,561.512,Well--
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.512,564.331,"I would have thought your position would be, you need a good reason to get a warrant, too."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,564.331,573.352,"--Well, I think a judge looking at a warrant application in this case would say, why do you want to arrest this man, give him... issue a summons."
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.352,574.121,He doesn't have to say that.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,576.338,578.573,"Oh, he doesn't have to say that, but I think that--"
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.573,582.477,"So you're willing... so long as a warrant issues, it doesn't matter what the conditions for the warrant are."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,582.477,591.148,"--Well, I think the Court has traditionally respected the warrant as legitimizing a seizure."
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.148,595.885,"Oh, we've also traditionally required a probable cause for a warrant to be a proper warrant."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,595.885,602.706,"Well, there's no disagreement in this case that there was probable cause to believe that Mr. Ricci did not have a business license."
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.574,612.163,"Yes, but it was probable cause of an arrestable offense, is the probable cause that we'd normally have."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,612.163,625.987,"--That's exactly the position that we're advocating here, but that is not what the court of appeals said, and that's not what some of the State courts have said, that if there's any kind of violation then police officers without a warrant can go and arrest someone for littering."
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,625.987,628.173,What about... what's a misdemeanor?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,628.173,632.058,A misdemeanor is an offense punishable by incarceration.
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,632.058,634.093,It's not in Massachusetts.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,656.608,657.992,Every State has a different definition of--
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,657.992,662.696,"And Massachusetts is really complicated, so I just realized you can't tell me what it is in Massachusetts."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,663.629,669.85,--I think it's clear... it's easy to look at the statutes in any State and determine what's a fine-only infraction.
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,669.85,670.952,"Oh, it is?"
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,688.062,695.833,But then the question which has been addressed in a number of courts is whether a fine-only infraction is a crime or if it's a civil infraction.
1997.97-501,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,695.833,698.452,Do you take the position that this is a civil infraction?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,698.452,699.169,Absolutely.
1997.97-501,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,699.819,701.137,What's a civil infraction?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,701.137,704.356,"--It's something that's punishable by fine only, which is not even the level of--"
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,704.356,704.639,All right.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,731.574,736.91,"--Unless the infraction is... involves a breach of the peace, or there's some emergency."
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,736.91,737.51,"Yes, okay."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,755.022,758.974,If it's not fine only then our rule doesn't apply.
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,758.974,759.458,All right.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,768.632,770.249,"Oh, I think it will do it."
1997.97-501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,779.571,787.66,"Even fine-only offenses, you say, if they involve a breach of the peace are arrestable."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,787.66,788.527,That's correct.
1997.97-501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,788.527,793.981,That comes from the... the breach of the peace term comes from the common law?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,796.533,805.389,"It meant a disturbance to public order, that there was some... some need to... that the arrest was necessary to preserve order."
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,805.389,806.741,"Oh, I think it doesn't mean that."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,809.341,809.859,In--
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.859,810.876,That was--
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,810.876,811.659,--It mean--
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,811.659,816.512,--Any violation of the King's... any violation of the law was a violation of the King's peace.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,816.512,818.798,--It meant that in a different context.
1997.97-501,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,831.689,855.638,"Well, does it add anything to your position to say that one can arrest in a fine-only case if there is also a breach of the peace, because if there's a breach of the peace in the modern sense, that would be a separate offense in virtually all States, I assume, and it would be committed in the officer's presence and so this issue wouldn't come up."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,863.16,864.06,That's correct.
1997.97-501,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,864.06,865.862,So you don't need that qualification.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,867.662,868.095,It's--
1997.97-501,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,868.095,872.933,"--if all you've got is a fine-only situation, no arrest without a warrant."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,872.933,887.959,"--Well, I think it's hypothetically possible to envision, and maybe my opponent can, a fine-only ordinance which involves a breach of the peace for which the officer should be able to arrest where there is no misdemeanor or felony but it involves the same conduct."
1997.97-501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.959,889.478,How about reckless driving?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,889.478,893.78,Reckless driving involves a breach of the peace.
1997.97-501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,893.78,894.68,Why?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,894.68,897.481,Because it--
1997.97-501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.481,900.25,Is it an affray in that sense?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,904.237,909.872,"--Well, reckless driving is the kind of misconduct that can involve more than one person."
1997.97-501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,918.712,924.049,"Well, it seems to me that your criteria are very... they waver quite a bit."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,926.984,929.87,That... you should not be able to be arrested for--
1997.97-501,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.87,934.94,"What if you think, though, it's an out-of-State vehicle and the driver may not show up for the hearing?"
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,934.94,937.291,--I think it's still unreasonable to make an arrest.
1997.97-501,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.83,952.051,What if he happened to check in at headquarters and found out he had 400 parking tickets that he'd never paid?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,952.051,959.72,"--Well, parking... then the car can be seized and immobilized until he pays the parking ticket, which is the traditional way for dealing with that kind of infraction."
1997.97-501,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,959.72,967.31,"Mr. Flaxman, I guess it's clear that the line-drawing is not going to be simple, assuming we draw a line at all."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,980.251,992.859,"If there is no line drawn and police officers are free to make arrests for any violation that they observe, then we have gone back, I believe, to giving general warrants to police officers."
1997.97-501,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,992.859,994.544,Why are we giving general warrants?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1003.433,1009.903,"The general warrant would authorize the officer to make an arrest of anybody that he believed had violated a law, which is--"
1997.97-501,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1009.903,1010.903,"--Well, no, that's not so."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1042.79,1051.38,"--But I think the general warrant also involved the officers having some belief that somebody was involved with the wrongdoing, the subject of the warrant."
1997.97-501,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1051.38,1058.403,"Well, sometimes when they had a general warrant, they could arrest without probable cause, the general warrant was abused."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1081.666,1108.234,"Well, I disagree that a fine-only offense is a subtle line-drawing, but I think that the value of limiting the ability of the police to make arrests for fine-only infractions that do not involve a breach of the peace is that it promotes respect for the law, and it avoids the situations where police are using their powers in a unfair manner."
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1108.234,1132.451,"I agree that you shouldn't... I mean, what you've done is, you've picked examples where, I totally agree with you, where it seems silly to have the policeman arrest somebody, but the difficulty for me is, you're asking the Court to draw a line that, while it would win you your case and deal with what we might think of as silly examples, might extend into a lot of other things, and that's what I'm trying to find out."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1132.451,1133.151,Well--
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1133.151,1146.442,"Is there anywhere in any of these briefs that anyone has gone through and figured out really what crimes would, in the different States, be encompassed by your rule?"
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1161.452,1164.237,"--Well, even if your law clerk went to do that--"
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1164.237,1164.589,Yes.

1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1169.557,1173.093,"All right, then if we can't ascertain it, then I'd ask you a second question."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1189.705,1190.388,--No.
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1197.477,1197.861,All right.

1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1233.334,1233.667,--Well... no--
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1233.667,1234.884,--that six or eight part--
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1234.884,1266.871,"--What I really want the Court to say is that the policy that we have in this case of requiring arrests in all trivial cases is unreasonable, and that unless there is a regulation or a statute or an ordinance which limits the discretion and which says, this is how you may use your discretion to make arrests, that the police can't have the roving commission, the absolute freedom to make arrests in trivial cases."

1997.97-501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1278.646,1279.965,Would it make it any different?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1279.965,1281.031,--It depends on what the policy was.
1997.97-501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1293.455,1301.378,"Well, what case is authority for you to sue a municipality because of its policy, independent of what happened to your particular client?"

1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1365.535,1366.285,Well--

1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1373.288,1382.144,"--The policy is, there's an exception for parking violations, and I don't know if seat belts are a municipal ordinance violation or whether it's a State statute violation."
1997.97-501,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1385.782,1395.988,Is it the policy that any violation of a... an Arlington Heights ordinance requires a seizure?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1395.988,1416.634,"--Other than parking tickets and some other park violations Arlington Heights says, officers must make arrests, and I think that's why the officers did not treat Mr. Ricci to the full 48 hours of detention that's authorized for an arrest, because they realized that there was no need to do that, but they had to make the arrest and bring him down and lock him up."
1997.97-501,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1416.634,1417.836,Mr. Flaxman--
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1426.173,1426.942,That's correct.
1997.97-501,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1426.942,1428.109,--a unanimous jury and so--
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1428.109,1429.561,He gets a clear preponderance.
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1446.004,1464.548,"--Mr. Flaxman, when you responded to Justice Souter, Justice Souter's question about, you know, what's the harm, I thought you were going to say that the harm of allowing arrests for misdemeanors is that for the most minor of offenses somebody can be detained for 48 hours."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1464.548,1466.817,That is--

1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1488.498,1495.669,"--Well, I think the Framers rejected that and intended to put barriers between the people and the police."
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.669,1508.077,"Well, I mean, would it be unconstitutional for a State to impose 48 hours of detention for jaywalking?"
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1508.077,1514.731,"Well, if this Court upholds respondent's policy, it would not be, and it would be absolutely permissible."
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1514.731,1516.75,Never mind what the Court does in this case--
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1519.635,1520.769,That's correct.

1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.269,1563.148,"Well, I'm saying if the answer is that a State can do that if it wishes, then the asserted harm that you're coming forward with, well, somebody could be detained for as long as 48 hours, is a harm which in another fashion, at least, is fully achievable by the State."
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1563.148,1573.754,"--The distinction, though, is that when the State, when the legislature has said we're going to lock people up for 48 hours, then it's the elected people, the elected representatives of the people who are saying that."

1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1596.985,1604.405,"--This is a police department unwritten practice, which is the custom of the whole Village, but there's no ordinance saying to do this."
1997.97-501,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1605.405,1608.174,This is a police department practice only?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1608.174,1608.793,That's correct.
1997.97-501,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1608.793,1611.828,Not authorized by city ordinance.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1611.828,1612.461,That's correct.
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1612.461,1613.845,I thought you were suing the city.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1615.03,1615.913,That's correct.
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.897,1618.148,Even though the city didn't order any of it?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1618.148,1619.348,"--Well, the city's policy--"
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.348,1619.964,That doesn't seem right.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1619.964,1623.885,--The city admitted that its policy was as the police department--
1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1623.885,1625.285,"So it was the city's policy, then."

1997.97-501,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.618,1628.82,"All right, but it's the city's policy."

1997.97-501,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1630.637,1631.189,So--
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1643.93,1646.948,I think that's what finally is the same thing--
1997.97-501,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1646.948,1648.9,"Well, certainly there are criminal fines."

1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1725.382,1726.251,--Well--
1997.97-501,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1726.251,1730.202,Do we have authority which says that you can arrest for a civil offense?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1731.804,1733.537,"--Well, the common law rule--"
1997.97-501,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1733.537,1734.27,--a stable category.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1735.106,1741.91,"--The common law rule allowed arrests to begin civil prosecutions of this nature, but there was a warrant to do that."

1997.97-501,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1771.262,1774.731,You seem to be changing what's presented.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1774.731,1778.083,"--Well, the question was phrased in an a fortiori situation."
1997.97-501,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1786.955,1789.974,"Well, do we assume this is a misdemeanor offense--"
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1789.974,1790.491,--Oh--
1997.97-501,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1790.491,1790.574,--or not?
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1790.574,1791.074,--No.

1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1794.376,1803.315,"--Well, I raised that in an a fortiori way of doing it, that if it's not true for misdemeanor cases, certainly it shouldn't be true for anything less than misdemeanor cases."
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1803.315,1805.917,I'm still trying to figure out where it's likely to have bite.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1818.891,1819.691,No.
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1819.691,1820.291,You'd say no.

1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1821.041,1821.357,All right.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1835.167,1837.569,Because that's just a civil infraction.

1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1843.237,1845.337,Most States that have actually considered that--
1997.97-501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1845.337,1845.953,Mm-hmm.
1997.97-501,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1845.953,1852.093,"--and there's a recent decision from Hawaii who said you can detain someone and search them and talk to them, but you can't arrest them."

1997.97-501,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1860.513,1861.865,Would you please tell us what this is?
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1870.52,1873.756,--This is treated by Illinois law as a civil offense.
1997.97-501,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1885.58,1900.34,"I think you're right about that, but could you tell us, is there authority which allows an arrest for a so-called civil offense, I suppose just to start the proceeding?"
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1900.34,1904.376,"--In a sense, Justice Kennedy, the text of the Constitution is that authority."
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1925.205,1929.609,"That was the old arrest for debt, wasn't it, arrest on so-called mean process?"

1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1935.997,1937.347,It was a general civil process.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1937.347,1937.865,Right.
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1939.215,1942.501,"But those arrests always required warrants, didn't they?"
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1942.501,1943.184,--Well--
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1943.184,1947.637,"In other words, I didn't think there could ever be a warrantless arrest on a civil capias."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1954.041,1955.66,"--There was a writ, Justice Souter."
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1974.038,1994.968,"Well, it may be that there can be no line drawn between civil and criminal for purposes of arrest, but there may very well be a line drawn between civil and criminal for purposes of a warrant requirement, and if the reference is, as you said, to the capias process, that was by definition one in which there was a written warrant."

1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2048.77,2056.775,"--Justice Breyer, we've litigated the case throughout on your assumption that this is a crime, and that the civil nature of this offense has simply not been a part of the proceedings."
1997.97-501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2056.775,2063.612,"Well, Mr. Strauss, where did you say respondents first raised the contention that this was a civil offense?"
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2063.612,2069.016,"In their reply brief in this Court, after an amicus raised it in the opening round of briefing."
1997.97-501,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2072.801,2074.134,But surely the Village knew that it was dealing with.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2087.893,2089.744,"--Justice Ginsburg, absolutely."
1997.97-501,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2118.496,2127.186,"And we're going to have all sorts of different tests for duration, a 48-hour rule will not apply in some cases?"
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2127.186,2127.719,"Well, the--"
1997.97-501,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2127.719,2129.987,This person could have been held for 48 hours?
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2129.987,2155.019,"--The test in the County of Riverside... there's... the County of Riverside establishes a 48-hour--as I read it, Justice Scalia, establishes a 48-hour presumption, but it's quite clear that that doesn't give the authorities a free 48 hours, that it's still open to the arrestee to say, after an hour, in this case, you've done everything you needed to do, why didn't you release me, which is what would have happened and what he could have said in this case had we held him even for 2 hours."
1997.97-501,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2157.805,2166.077,"Mr. Strauss, could the police in this case have handcuffed him, put him in a holding cell with a lot of tough guys?"
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2166.077,2179.07,"Justice Ginsburg, I think at some point the conditions become so onerous as to be unreasonable, and this Court in another case... I think it was Bell v. Wolfish... used the example of putting someone in shackles."
1997.97-501,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2180.303,2182.938,Because it's unreasonable based on the type of offense?
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2182.938,2188.942,--The type of offense I think can enter the calculus of what is a reasonable manner of restraint.
1997.97-501,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2188.942,2190.709,What authority is there for that?
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2190.709,2200.4,"Well, I don't know that the Court has ever... has ever limited the manner of confinement based on the nature of the offense."
1997.97-501,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2200.4,2220.48,"Mr. Strauss, I have a different concern that I'd like you to comment on, not going to the burdensomeness of the arrest, but is it clear to you that in a... incident to this arrest the police could have searched this man and his vehicle and his luggage and everything else if they happened to stop him in a car for this kind of offense?"
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2222.13,2230.003,"Justice Stevens, as... well, as... if they'd... I should just say, as for a traffic offense under Illinois law they would have had to accept his license."
1997.97-501,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.788,2233.738,"Well, see, we don't have a traffic offense."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2233.738,2234.505,But... I understand.
1997.97-501,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.505,2236.257,If this... take this sort of financial crime.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2236.257,2236.873,I understand.
1997.97-501,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2236.873,2237.34,Yes.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2237.34,2242.494,"Justice Stevens, as I read Robinson and Gustafson they settled that question and the answer is yes."
1997.97-501,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.863,2252.266,"If this is a full arrest, then that's one of the consequences that follow, is that the... the total search power."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2255.134,2257.32,--That Robinson and Belton control the scope of search--
1997.97-501,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2257.32,2261.974,"So it seems to me that's really what we ought to be concerned about, rather than whether he has to spend 24 hours instead of 48 hours."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2261.974,2265.759,"--Well, this... in this case there's no evidence there was a search incident to the arrest, even a pat-down."
1997.97-501,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2265.759,2266.426,"No, I understand, but there could have been."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2267.392,2269.644,"So far as I read it, that's controlled by Robinson and Belton."
1997.97-501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2269.644,2270.261,Yes.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2273.532,2274.065,Of the person.
1997.97-501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2274.065,2274.565,--who was arrested.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2277.7,2278.25,No.
1997.97-501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2278.75,2279.266,Or the luggage.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2279.266,2279.533,If... and--
1997.97-501,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2279.533,2280.633,"It would be Belton, yes."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2280.633,2281.202,--And Chimel.
1997.97-501,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2281.202,2285.07,What is the policy with which we're dealing in this case?
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2286.52,2287.356,"Yes, Justice--"
1997.97-501,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2287.356,2290.308,It does not include minor traffic offenses?
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2290.308,2291.224,"--Justice O'Connor, yes."
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2350.061,2361.618,"As I understand it... this may not count in the decision of the case, but I thought the reason that Arlington Heights had for its policy was a... to be candid, a rather superficial one."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2390.971,2393.922,"Yes, Justice Souter, and there's testimony to that effect in the record."
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2401.278,2401.878,Okay.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2401.878,2404.48,"That's how the policy's enforced, but the reason for the policy is--"
1997.97-501,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2404.48,2406.932,"Mr. Strauss, isn't this unusual?"
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2437.218,2457.549,"--Justice Ginsburg, for purposes of the Fourth Amendment I think the choice about whether to proceed by citation, which I agree is often allowed by municipalities, or whether to proceed in this way I think has to be left to local circumstances."
1997.97-501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2483.064,2490.503,"Mr. Strauss, let me get back again to the point that you say was raised only for the first time in the reply brief."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2510.75,2515.136,"Justice Rehnquist, when I said it wasn't raised, what I meant is this."
1997.97-501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2525.943,2532.08,So you say a fine-only license ordinance doesn't suggest civil rather than criminal?
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2532.08,2550.725,"Violation of a fine-only license ordinance, it seems to me the natural reading of that is criminal, but my real point, Mr. Chief Justice, is not so much about what the question can be read to include, as the premise on which the case has been litigated throughout, and that premise has undoubtedly, I'm certain of this, been that this was--"
1997.97-501,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2550.725,2551.411,A criminal--
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2574.074,2576.192,"--Yes, I do take that position, Justice O'Connor."
1997.97-501,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2576.192,2580.744,And what do you rely on in terms of authority for that?
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2580.744,2608.93,"The... my... the basis for my position is that the Fourth Amendment cannot be read to draw a sharp line between criminal and civil arrests, and the authority for that is the Court's statement, Justice Brandeis' statement in Long v. Ansell that civil arrests were common at the time of the framing, and the inclusion in the Constitution of an immunity that applies only to civil arrests, confirming that, in fact, civil arrests are contemplated by the Constitution."
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2608.93,2614.067,"Yes, but if you're going to appeal the history, I think you've got the problem that was raised earlier."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2636.165,2643.67,"Well, Justice Souter, before I assent to or disagree with that proposition I think neither case that was litigated about civil rights--"
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2643.67,2648.824,Let's do it... I just want to work out the answer that you just gave to Justice O'Connor.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2648.824,2649.34,--Mm-hmm.
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2649.34,2664.334,"And I take it that you do not have any authority, know of any authority, traditionally, at common law, for arrest for a purely civil offense without some written process issued by a magistrate, i.e., like a capias."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2664.334,2678.343,"Well, Justice Souter, at common law the line between criminal and civil, especially when you're dealing with so-called public nuisances... that is, civil affronts to the Government as opposed to a private party... was a very indistinct line."
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2678.509,2695.786,"Maybe it was, but leaving aside the problem of indistinction, I take it you don't have any authority with respect to cases that were on the civil side of the line, in which the common law recognized a valid arrest without some written process issued by a third party like a magistrate."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2695.786,2701.089,"--I think our argument, Justice Souter, would be that a civil offense against the Government--"
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2701.089,2704.91,"I don't want to cut off your argument, but I don't want to lose my question."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2704.91,2705.693,--Whether there's--
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2705.693,2707.76,"Do you have any authority for that, or don't you have authority?"
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2707.76,2724.372,--We would have authority for the proposition that certain categories of offenses that we believe are the ancestors of civil offenses against the Government could be subject to... at common law to... on occasion to warrantless arrests.
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2725.355,2725.74,What are they?
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2725.74,2735.613,"Well, that's the night-walking category of offenses, where there were minor nuisances committed that by certain statutes under certain circumstances could be proceeded against--"
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2735.613,2737.882,"So like the Terry stop, in other words."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2737.882,2746.987,"--Well, it was like a Terry stop except it explicitly could last overnight, and in that sense it really resembles more what goes on with the rest of the minor offenses."
1997.97-501,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2746.987,2750.689,"But in order to prevail here, you've got to take the law beyond Terry."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2750.689,2752.389,This was an arrest.
1997.97-501,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2754.307,2762.347,And you don't quarrel that there is a distinction in the Fourth Amendment between a seizure that is not an arrest and a seizure that is an arrest?
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2762.347,2765.365,"I think Terry establishes that, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-501,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2765.365,2775.57,"Is there... can you give me an example, so I know what I'm talking about here... would you just give me an example of a fine-only criminal offense?"
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2791.682,2799.52,"In... in Illinois, any municipalities have the authority to make their fine-only offenses civil."
1997.97-501,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2801.622,2806.526,What I want to know is if anybody here has an example of what it is we're talking about?
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2840.68,2841.449,--I can't cite you to any in--
1997.97-501,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2841.449,2842.399,"--and I haven't found it in the brief, so I'm not--"
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2842.399,2844.165,--I can't cite you to any in Illinois.
1997.97-501,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2844.165,2853.07,"--But it certainly isn't the one before us, and I think you told us that most of the... in Arlington most of the offenses in this category are civil offenses."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2855.939,2860.16,Local ordinances that provide only for fines are treated as civil.
1997.97-501,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2872.134,2875.086,Does... I wanted to ask you about the booking and the record.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2890.529,2901.885,"I think the answer is no, Justice Ginsburg, to the extent that the record will reflect that this is a civil offense, and if he is asked, have you ever been convicted, he's not... he was not convicted."
1997.97-501,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2908.741,2910.641,"Suppose he was asked, was he ever arrested?"
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2910.641,2911.858,He would have to say yes.
1997.97-501,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2917.929,2927.468,"And that would be the same, so he would have to answer that question the same, and it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a misdemeanor with jail time, he has an arrest record."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2927.468,2928.768,He has an arrest record.
1997.97-501,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2928.768,2929.354,Yes.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2929.354,2932.189,"Now, he could go... explain the charges were dismissed."
1997.97-501,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2933.522,2952.318,"Mr. Flaxman said that this business about the bond requirement, on the face of it it looks like there could be several thousand dollars involved, and so it would be reasonable to require a bond before letting this person go, but Mr. Flaxman said that that was an afterthought."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2952.318,2965.577,"Justice Ginsburg, the reason... the subjective reason these officers arrested him was that we tell our officers, you don't make the decision whether to release the person on the basis of a citation or not, you bring them down."
1997.97-501,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2970.231,2970.914,Mr.--
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2970.914,2983.539,"Were I called upon to explain objectively why this was reasonable, one of the factors I would say if I needed to say it was the one you just mentioned, that in fact he'd been, by his own admission, operating for 6 months and did face a very substantial fine."
1997.97-501,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2990.443,3012.522,"--Mr. Strauss, Terry aside, do you know any basis in common law for the distinction between an arrest that enables you to be taken down to the station house and a traffic stop, or whatever you want to call it, that does not allow you to be taken down to the station house?"
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3012.522,3012.839,No.
1997.97-501,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3050.065,3063.205,"No, but even if there's no common law category such as Terry, we surely have recognized many, many situations in which police are authorized to stop and interrogate, even without probable cause, and those are all seizures."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3063.205,3063.639,Yes.
1997.97-501,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.639,3064.407,You would agree with that.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3064.407,3065.674,"If it's a stop, then it's a seizure."
1997.97-501,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3065.674,3066.141,Yes.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3066.141,3067.443,"But so far as I know, Terry--"
1997.97-501,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3067.443,3068.676,And it doesn't require probable cause.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3068.676,3073.763,"--It doesn't require probable cause, but if it's... if there's no probable cause the stop is very limited in duration and purpose."
1997.97-501,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3073.763,3077.631,But we have here... all we have here is taking him to the police station to book him.
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3084.969,3085.319,No.
1997.97-501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3093.975,3095.176,"Thank you, Mr. Strauss."
1997.97-501,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3095.176,3095.926,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3095.926,3097.259,Ms. Millett.
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3097.259,3110.019,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-501,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3146.025,3148.394,"What makes them criminal rather than civil, just saying so?"
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3148.394,3161.618,"Well, certainly a legislative decision, the community judgment to label behavior criminal, is a big factor in whether it's a crime or not, but certainly then whether traditional criminal processes attend the prosecution of the case."
1997.97-501,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3161.618,3162.652,"Well, that's a consequence of its being criminal--"
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3162.652,3162.952,Right.
1997.97-501,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.952,3164.254,--not a cause of its being criminal.
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3171.908,3187.852,"Oh, I think this Court has long recognized that it is primarily the job of States and Congress within its authority to define what is criminal or not, whether or not this Court or one particular jurisdiction thinks that's a wise thing to make criminal or not, and if--"
1997.97-501,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3187.852,3194.273,"--Well, if this is not a criminal offense, then what is the Government's position?"
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3194.273,3198.91,--I don't know if we have a position on what happens to ordinance in particular.
1997.97-501,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3201.945,3206.664,Does the Federal Government have some civil offenses that are not criminal?
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3206.664,3209.283,"--Plenty of civil offenses that are not criminal, and--"
1997.97-501,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3209.283,3212.551,What is your position with regard to those--
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3212.551,3213.336,--Our position--
1997.97-501,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3213.336,3214.786,--as to the Fourth Amendment requirements?
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3214.786,3230.846,"--Our position is the Fourth Amendment does not draw a bright line banning seizures, arrests, for civil offenses, such things as deportation, extradition, civil commitment, if a police officer finds someone who is a danger to himself."
1997.97-501,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3242.637,3243.689,"The issue, if--"
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3243.689,3244.572,--conveyances and traffic may be another one.
1997.97-501,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3244.572,3245.206,--May I interrupt you?
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3255.246,3268.054,"Right, and I think the analysis... the mode of analyzing whether proceeding without a warrant or whatever process would be appropriate may be different between criminal and civil cases under the Fourth Amendment."
1997.97-501,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3268.054,3273.725,"Well, didn't the Seventh Circuit rule that the petitioner had waived his argument under the Warrant Clause?"
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3273.725,3276.077,"Yes, they did, Justice... Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-501,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3298.423,3303.41,Every example that you gave involved the risk of absconding or fleeing.
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3310.916,3312.633,"--That's right, so that's why--"
1997.97-501,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3312.633,3319.856,"But here we're talking about, I didn't get a license for my business, that my wife got while I was in the police station."
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3337.733,3343.971,"--I guess I'm... if you're assuming that this is a criminal offense, then... I'm sorry, civil?"
1997.97-501,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3343.971,3347.589,I thought we asked you... you were giving examples of civil proceedings--
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3347.589,3348.239,Okay.
1997.97-501,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3348.239,3357.445,"--where an arrest would be recognized as reasonable, and they were all... fall in the ""exigent circumstance"" category."
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3357.445,3357.981,Right.
1997.97-501,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3371.122,3372.305,"Someone about to commit suicide, for example."
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3372.305,3376.692,"About to commit suicide or other civil... just to harm themselves, if not suicide, but there's going to be a balance--"
1997.97-501,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3376.692,3379.31,But this... what's in front of us doesn't seem to fit.
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3394.82,3411.616,"--I think it may be fair for a legislature to... for a legislature or a police department to conclude that as a class there is a... and the Fourth Amendment analysis may permit this, that there is as a class a risk of absconding or injury."
1997.97-501,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3438.516,3438.849,"Yes, well--"
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3451.157,3451.641,--Well--
1997.97-501,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3451.641,3452.443,--whether you can make an arrest?
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3453.826,3456.578,"--No, certainly not for crimes."
1997.97-501,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3464.75,3465.166,No.
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3465.166,3466.3,That dealt with a crime.
1997.97-501,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3519.335,3524.805,Is it fair to say that you briefed this case on the assumption that we were dealing with a criminal offense?
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3524.805,3529.357,"--Yes, we did, and I apologize if we don't have a completely thorough analysis of the issue."
1997.97-501,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3552.389,3555.241,"That's all irrelevant for this case, right?"
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3556.36,3561.228,--I guess it depends on whether this Court reads the second question presented differently from whether we did.
1997.97-501,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3569.768,3577.107,"--But now we know we are dealing with a civil infraction, so how can we pretend that it's criminal when it's... we're told that it's civil?"
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3577.107,3582.392,"Well, if this Court concludes that it is civil and it needs to address it, then we think it would be better to--"
1997.97-501,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3582.392,3583.26,We don't have to conclude that.
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3592.199,3615.899,"--We think that it may be preferable for this Court to remand to allow a case to come up, or else the courts below to address what either the common law or the practices are for civil arrests on these types of ordinances, which hasn't been briefed and addressed below, and we certainly would be very concerned about having a decision issued without the information provided to this Court that is necessary about civil offenses."
1997.97-501,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3615.899,3618.434,We should forgive the waiver?
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3628.956,3633.008,"Well, the Court could certainly dismiss cert as improvidently granted simply on the question that either--"
1997.97-501,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3633.008,3643.732,"Well, I thought you were saying we should read the second question, in light of the record, as saying is this particular criminal offense one for which you could arrest someone."
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3647.87,3651.655,"--Our position is, we read the second question presented in light of the first question presented."
1997.97-501,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3651.655,3652.022,Which is criminal.
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3653.388,3653.94,"Right, absolutely."
1997.97-501,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3654.524,3660.094,"--So I take it you're not... I thought... you think we should do the same, I take it, as you did."
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3660.094,3663.045,We--
1997.97-501,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3663.045,3668.347,It would be a hypothetical question when we know it is not criminal.
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3668.347,3670.499,--If... the Court--
1997.97-501,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3670.499,3678.403,"How can we then say, well, we'll assume that it's waived, that we'll treat something that the city says is civil as criminal?"
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3678.403,3685.259,--That is the danger that you're essentially issuing an advisory opinion in a case that just does not present the question.
1997.97-501,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3687.475,3692.328,It's not an advisory opinion in this case if that issue was not raised below.
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3720.682,3722.598,--I think you were not--
1997.97-501,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3722.598,3732.489,"I thought I heard you say that we should dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, because we thought we were dealing with a criminal offense and it turns out to be civil."
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3732.489,3734.455,"--Our only position... may I answer, Mr.--"
1997.97-501,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3734.455,3734.739,Yes.
1997.97-501,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3734.739,3753.569,"--Our only position is that if the Court wishes to address, or... wishes to address the issue and wishes not to address the criminal issue, that it may... it's certainly within this Court's prerogative to decide that the question it thought it was going to be deciding is not, in fact, now presented to the case in light of the respondent's admissions."
1997.97-501,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3753.569,3754.652,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
