2001.00-795,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,7.549,9.035,Mr. Clement.
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,9.035,20.693,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court: In 1996 Congress updated the child pornography laws to keep pace with technological developments.
2001.00-795,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,125.234,132.443,"Has any case, to your knowledge, been lost on that ground in which that was a substantial argument?"
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,132.443,141.98,"No case has been lost on that ground but that is largely a result of the 1996 Act, which has taken that argument away from criminal defendants."
2001.00-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,170.995,177.436,Was that because she couldn't tell whether the real child was over 18 or under 18 or because she couldn't tell whether it was a real person?
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,177.436,181.115,That case was because she couldn't tell it was a real person.
2001.00-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,181.115,185.795,Wouldn't she have the same difficulty on the distinction between an 18-year-old and a 19-year-old?
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,185.795,205.968,"In the cases where the line that the courts are concerned with is the line between 18 and 19, there's an additional aspect of the statute that clears up many of the problems and that's the affirmative defense which allows individuals to produce and distribute materials if they make clear they involve actual individuals who are over 18."
2001.00-795,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,205.968,214.441,"But in terms of what you outlined, in terms of the two dangers, you say just the same as if it were an actual child."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,228.508,247.217,"That's certainly true, but I think Congress in recognizing an affirmative defense for materials that were produced using people who had reached the age of majority struck a balance and recognized that this Court has provided additional protection to pornographic depictions involving actual adults."
2001.00-795,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,247.217,277.378,"Okay, well the question of the balance raises the question of tailoring, and what I wanted to ask you was if it's appropriate to have the affirmative defense that the children or that the people depicted were in fact over 18, why isn't it equally appropriate to have an affirmative defense to the effect that the depiction does not have anyone who is not a real child under 18."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,287.732,290.755,I think there are at least two reasons for that differential treatment.
2001.00-795,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,312.375,319.143,But in effect you're depending on the witness to say that the actors here were in fact over 18.
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,333.694,341.991,"Well, in most of the cases when you're talking about somebody who's going to make the claim that they actually generated the photographs themselves, there will be no witnesses."
2001.00-795,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,346.223,363.771,"But that's a question of proof and I suppose that if the only person who steps up to the stand and says, there were no live children here, is the person who was accused of the pornography, that person may have something to worry about in not having a very convincing affirmative defense."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,376.852,394.824,--And I do think that age rather than whether an image is computerally generated is something that is uniquely subject to verification and this Court in its Ferber decision confronted the argument that the New York statute was overbroad because it didn't limit its protections to photographs and images that were produced in the state of New York.
2001.00-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,410.392,416.704,Why is it... why is it that witnesses can explain the age but cannot explain whether it was computer generated?
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,416.704,428.754,"--Because, again, in sort of the stylized case that the person who's computer generated an image, that's not something that requires a film crew to be brought in so there aren't necessarily going to be witnesses."
2001.00-795,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,429.648,431.519,But that's not the government's problem.
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,459.702,465.262,"--Well, I'm not sure it's absolutely unique but I do think age is uniquely subject to verification."
2001.00-795,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,483.178,492.276,"Mr. Clement, may I ask you a question again relating to the affirmative defenses or youthful adult pornography."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,502.117,505.028,That's right as a matter of the statute.
2001.00-795,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,507.923,514.067,"Well, let's relate that to something that perhaps a number of people in this courtroom have seen."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,527.493,529.188,I believe that's true.
2001.00-795,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,529.188,529.626,Did you see it?
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,529.626,530.544,I did see it.
2001.00-795,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,531.223,531.597,Okay.
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,542.82,568.515,"There's no affirmative defense for possession but I think what the statute does is it effectively makes it so that in virtually, in the vast majority of cases where the producers and distributors of a film will be able to claim the affirmative defense, the individual possessor will be able to claim the affirmative defense because of a failure of the government's ability to prove scienter, because if you think about the affirmative defense it gives people the ability to distribute a movie if it involves actors."
2001.00-795,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,574.499,575.209,I don't understand.
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,601.418,602.44,There's two reasons.
2001.00-795,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,628.335,632.622,"There is the defense for the producer, but there isn't for the person who rents the film."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,633.741,634.667,Exactly.
2001.00-795,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,634.667,638.666,--I'm struck by what we're supposed to do with a statute like this.
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,638.666,655.19,"There is a requirement, though, that the government prove scienter with respect to age in any prosecution for possession and I don't see how the government could prove scienter as to age in the case of these films where they're marketed in a way where it's clear that they involve adult actors."
2001.00-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.127,704.128,Does it trouble you at all that the statute would prohibit a motion picture company from employing an 18-year-old actress to play the three roles that Justice Breyer identified?
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,704.128,708.775,"Well, it would trouble me if the statute had that effect but it doesn't have that effect."
2001.00-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,711.302,715.966,"Even though the actress is under the statutory age, 18?"
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,715.966,717.172,"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said 18."
2001.00-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,717.172,723.204,Would it trouble you that the statute would prohibit an 18-year-old who is a child under the statute from performing those three roles?
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,723.204,736.398,"Well, I think it's 17, but in any event it doesn't trouble me if it's a 17-year-old is prohibited because they wouldn't be prohibited from playing those roles if... the studio would have two options."
2001.00-795,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,753.456,764.594,"I take it your answer to the question if this afternoon I go out, go to the video store, buy the three films and bring them home is, yes, I am guilty of a federal crime."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,764.594,765.304,Not at all.
2001.00-795,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,770.479,771.334,What do you mean you can't prove scienter?
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,796.61,797.728,--And again--
2001.00-795,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,797.728,806.353,"I don't think it was real activity, I think it was simulated, and I think they did appear to me to be under the age of 18."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,808.704,815.592,--You are not guilty for the two reasons that I've said and let me just say that you would have the same problem with respect to the statute at issue in Ferber.
2001.00-795,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,815.592,820.456,"Mr. Clement, I'm not sure what simulated sexual activity consists of."
2001.00-795,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,822.892,825.435,They were pretty good actually.
2001.00-795,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,826.377,844.317,"One described in the briefs supposedly was the shot of a juvenile, whether played by a juvenile or not, from the waist up supposedly engaged in sexual activity."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,853.396,859.524,"Well, certainly if it was just the hand and certainly... I think there would be certainly a number of ways--"
2001.00-795,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,859.524,885.65,"Don't you think, I mean the definition of sexually explicit conduct is and what the statute prohibits is this conduct by minors under 17 or younger, sexual intercourse, engaging in sexual intercourse, bestiality, masturbation, sadistic or masochistic abuse or lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,904.614,910.382,"--To the contrary, the government has argued throughout this case that it's all unprotected speech because it's child pornography."
2001.00-795,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,911.396,921.334,"Not because it's obscenity, you're creating, you would have us create yet another category of prohibitive, something that falls totally outside the first amendment."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,936.921,947.378,"--Well, I want to be clear, I think government would take the position that virtually all the material covered by this statute is independently obscene, but that's not how the government chose to regulate it."
2001.00-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.378,963.625,"If the scene of a head of a person who the other information in the movie makes it appear they're engaged in sexual intercourse and all that is seen is the head of a male and a female kissing one another, that would come covered by the statute."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,963.625,965.215,"No, I don't think that would be covered by the statute."
2001.00-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.215,965.573,Why not?
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,967.196,973.004,I think you have to read the term simulated sexual intercourse in conjunction with the other terms in the statute.
2001.00-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.004,976.147,It expressly says there's no patently offensive requirement.
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,976.147,985.972,"That's certainly true but I think if you read the statute in context, I think there's some requirement that the sexual intercourse that would be depicted would require some display of nudity in the process."
2001.00-795,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1010.129,1018.89,"Ferber pretty much said that child pornography is of almost no value, did it not?"
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1018.89,1033.54,"--Absolutely, and that's why this material that we're talking about is all probably virtually, the government could capture it as obscenity but of course if it tried to do that it couldn't ban the possession, and child pornography was treated as a different case in Ferber."
2001.00-795,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1033.54,1036.523,Child pornography is a different case but very much like obscenity.
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1036.523,1046.957,"Absolutely, like obscenity, what this Court said in Ferber is the reason the statute was permissible is because it defined a category of conduct that could be proscribed and was outside the protection of the First Amendment."
2001.00-795,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1046.957,1074.14,"There's a vast difference between an actual child who was violated and a picture, a simulation in Ferber that you have relied on so heavily, what do you make of a sentence that is not in the footnote, it is the text, that simulation outside the prohibition and the prohibition was using an actual child, simulation outside the prohibition could provide an alternative?"
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1074.14,1094.024,"Well, let me just clarify one thing because the statute in Ferber itself also covered simulated sexual activity so all these line drawing problems about what, you know, at what point does the scene in Traffic come under the coverage of the statute also applied in Ferber because it also captured simulated acts involving adults."
2001.00-795,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1106.946,1118.092,"Yes, but even that sentence in Ferber said we're not touching in this case, here we have an actual child simulation outside that prohibition could provide an alternative."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1118.092,1121.323,"--With respect, I don't think that's what Ferber meant to say."
2001.00-795,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1124.176,1125.278,It used those words.
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1125.278,1129.31,"It did, but it was decided in 1982 before this technology even existed."
2001.00-795,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1144.134,1146.429,What if we read that sentence as though it were not there?
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1146.429,1148.644,--No I think you read it in the context--
2001.00-795,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1148.644,1149.586,Not in the opinion.
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1149.586,1157.346,"--with respect, I think you treat it in the context of what was prohibited by the New York statute and the technology that was available at the time."
2001.00-795,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1195.462,1217.861,"The Court relied very heavily on the notion that if you use actual children they are harmed, they are actually harmed, so what is the primary reliance that you make for applying the same prohibition to these video images?"
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1217.861,1221.58,Well I think there's... I would make two responses.
2001.00-795,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1231.933,1239.254,"It did seem to me that the Court, and I was here, played heavy reliance on harm to children."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1239.254,1240.324,--Absolutely.
2001.00-795,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1240.324,1241.603,Actual children.
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1247.85,1262.117,"Well, I don't know that we have to answer that question in this case because we do have that, because this statute enables the government to continue to prosecute effectively cases involving traditional forms of child pornography, because the advent--"
2001.00-795,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1262.117,1264.628,But that's not an answer to Justice O'Connor's question.
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1302.792,1316.842,"--Well, I'm trying to and I think that, I mean, first of all, even in an overbreadth challenge the burden does lie on the party challenging the statute and they have to show things from actual fact in order to challenge the statute and I don't think they've carried that burden."
2001.00-795,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1329.004,1346.359,"But the gravamen of her question, Justice O'Connor can explain her own question, but as I understood it, is that there's a substantial area here where adults who are play acting roles of children are covered, and the question is what is the government's interest in that?"
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1346.359,1352.327,There isn't an interest in those play acting cases and that's why the affirmative defense allows those to take place.
2001.00-795,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1363.713,1381.18,"Why is it that the question I really would like you to get to if you can is one that's really bothering me very much is the question that Justice Scalia asked and the thing in this area I do not understand, in the entire area is why doesn't Miller work?"
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1414.703,1423.168,"Well, let me first try to say two reasons why I don't think Miller is directly relevant and if those aren't responsive to your questions, maybe--"
2001.00-795,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1423.168,1433.049,"I'd rather not hear why it's directly... not directly relevant because my question, which is my own problem, not your problem, is I'm trying to understand the area."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1487.128,1500.794,"--Well, one reason that Miller is a difficult case and doesn't... isn't terribly satisfying is it requires a case by case adjudication of that three-prong test which I would say with deference is not self-defining."
2001.00-795,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1562.965,1589.908,"Mr. Clement, before you finish there's something of great concern to me too because it seems that this is a big step away from actual child, injury to an actual child to the effect on the viewer and the same thing could be said for women with respect to pornography, portraying women in a degrading way."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1607.085,1613.237,"Well, I think there are two principal reasons why you shouldn't be worried about that particular slippery slope."
2001.00-795,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1639.698,1647.338,"If you have this out you can use simulated children, that will protect the actual children from being exploited."
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1650.121,1659.081,"Because I think, as I indicated before, there are real verifiability problems that don't arise in the context of age that do arise in computer."
2001.00-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1686.12,1690.584,"Are you asking us to read that phrase into the statute, the virtually indistinguishable phrase?"
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1690.584,1696.87,"Well, the virtually indistinguishable phrase already appears in the text of the statute, it just doesn't appear in the operative provision."
2001.00-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.071,1714.545,"You're asking us to construe the statute narrowly to apply only to things that are virtually indistinguishable from actual behavior, it would eliminate cartoons and that sort of stuff?"
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1714.545,1717.288,That's absolutely right and that's the position we've taken in all the lower courts.
2001.00-795,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1717.288,1722.248,"Even the language that says conveys the impression, you want us to give the same meaning to that?"
2001.00-795,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1722.248,1748.873,"Well, I actually think that the conveys the impression language could be given that meaning but I think the conveys the impression language is much less problematic from a constitutional standpoint if you understand subsection D of the statute to be addressed to pandering and in that context the concerns about vagueness are much reduced because you're not going to be focused on just the image, you're going to be focused on the way it's marketed, and I think in that context it won't be difficult to see whether or not it conveys the image."
2001.00-795,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1750.891,1752.143,"Very well, Mr. Clement."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,1753.869,1768.535,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The petitioner's argument if adopted would have three radical tragic consequences for First Amendment jurisprudence.
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.752,1785.407,"Excuse me, such as what?"
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,1806.065,1807.319,"--Certainly, in the film area."
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1807.319,1808.094,Lolita?
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,1808.094,1809.668,"Lolita, Traffic."
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1809.668,1816.029,"That would be a great... leaving the book, the movie Lolita, the book is perfectly okay, right?"
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,1817.731,1818.634,That's correct.
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1818.634,1820.088,The great work of western art.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,1820.088,1822.687,It's gotten critical acclaim.
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.165,1836.398,What else besides the movie Lolita would we be deprived of in order to prevent little children from being exploited?
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,1836.398,1850.21,"There's the movie Traffic, there's the movie Tin Drum, there's a whole bunch of, you know, there's the Brooke Shields movies that maybe some people don't enjoy, but again it's there, the Blue Lagoon and the series of movies such as that."
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.21,1860.756,"In respect, this is not, you know, the Mona Lisa or Venus de Milo or anything that has lasted more than 30 years."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,1860.756,1866.036,"It could very well affect, I think, painters because the statute... excuse me."
2001.00-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1866.036,1867.49,How about Romeo and Juliet?
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,1869.985,1874.465,"It could, if the movie... a movie of Romeo and Juliet were made."
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.465,1878.512,"Gee, you've seen a different version of that play than I have."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,1880.583,1884.174,"Well, it depends on how they wanted to portray it."
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1916.781,1918.683,"Very well, how should it be read?"
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,1926.748,1931.748,"One is, I think, enforcement of the obscenity laws would be one way."
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1931.748,1935.084,Apparently that doesn't work and that's why I'm puzzled.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,1945.165,1946.291,"Your honor, there's--"
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1946.291,1953.677,"How is Congress to write a statute in the area of children that gets at that problem, which is a problem?"
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,1953.677,1958.877,"--I believe that Title 18, section 2251 covers that problem."
2001.00-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2003.338,2006.129,You have no problem then with the statute before it was amended.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2006.129,2011.713,"--I have no problem, this is a new statute, 2251 and 2252 did exist."
2001.00-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.713,2012.391,What did it do?
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2015.766,2033.715,"It used the terminology, it created a category of computer images that would be nonreal or other pictures or images that are nonreal and that are fictional characters into the act and it would be prohibited if disseminated or possessed."
2001.00-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.715,2050.848,"So, well, whatever was going to be threatened in the way of free expression and so forth under the new act was simply computer images of things that were already prohibited if done by real people?"
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2050.848,2059.648,"No it did not, it included, it said any visual depiction, that would include that could be considered cartoons, illustrations, drawings, paintings."
2001.00-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2059.648,2066.809,"If the statute is construed to be, say, virtually indistinguishable then I think cartoons would not be covered."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2066.809,2085.469,But the problem is it would still suffer from the vagueness because what would happen is that in fact I had a computer image of a fictional character I'd never have a defense because I could not come forward and prove that that fictional character was over 18.
2001.00-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2087.027,2089.482,That seems way out at the fringes somewhat.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2089.482,2091.625,--Well but that leaves it to the discretion.
2001.00-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2098.802,2100.592,You could cross that bridge when you come to it then.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2100.592,2130.201,"Well, I believe when you begin to talk about First Amendment rights to put it on to a case by case basis I think you are abridging, you know, a fundamental right and I think that in addition to that you have the problem that if I get charged you're not just being charged with a violation of an obscenity law, you're being accused of being a child pornographer and that does have some connotation and that has some ill effects just from the fact of being charged."
2001.00-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2131.68,2137.128,"Well, does it cover things beyond obscene speech?"
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2137.128,2138.55,Well--
2001.00-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2138.55,2139.309,In your view.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2139.309,2144.357,"--In this it does, it would cover, you know, the morphing situation--"
2001.00-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2144.357,2145.779,Excuse me?
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2145.779,2153.58,"--I'm using the term morphing where you use an identifiable and you can merge it in on the computer to, you know, into similar--"
2001.00-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2153.58,2156.14,Images of obscenity.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2156.14,2158.611,"--That's correct, or of a sexual act--"
2001.00-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2158.611,2162.235,"That is the expansion, is covering images of obscenity."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2162.235,2179.015,"--Well, it would be images, it would be copying images of obscenity with an identifiable individual or in sexual conduct and that is harm to a real child because that person is an identifiable child and that becomes a permanent record."
2001.00-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2179.015,2187.0,But does it cover depictions of something more than obscenity?
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2187.0,2195.241,"Well, when you use the terminology simulated sexual activity it would, you know, it depends, I guess that goes community to community."
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.639,2229.874,Don't you think the statute can reasonably be read giving the definition of the activities covered not to cover two people under a bed with no depiction of sexual organs or anything else.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2229.874,2237.067,"--The problem is, is that the statute uses the term actual sexual activity and/or simulated, and again--"
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2237.067,2239.833,It depends on what you mean by sexual activity.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2248.051,2250.081,"--But that's not what the statute says, though."
2001.00-795,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2250.081,2251.872,"Well, the statute does say explicit."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2259.823,2262.864,"No it doesn't, because it says explicit sexual conduct, actual or simulated and I guess it depends on how you read that word simulated."
2001.00-795,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2262.864,2263.527,--You say explicit.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2265.557,2278.968,It means clearly and again clearly would mean to me that if it appears that they're under the blanket and that's what they're doing I think it's a reasonable inference to be made and I think that it would cover that as simulated activity.
2001.00-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2278.968,2284.865,But explicit certainly can mean something different than clearly.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2284.865,2288.312,"It can, but it's not defined in the statute."
2001.00-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2290.815,2297.567,Then maybe the courts will define it so that it wouldn't cover the kind of thing you're talking about.
2001.00-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.567,2305.831,"It is defined in the statute, sexually explicit conduct that was in quotes means actual or simulated sexual intercourse."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2305.831,2309.471,"And some other things, and it uses masturbation and--"
2001.00-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2309.471,2314.71,"It includes sexual intercourse, it seems to me it's sexual intercourse whether you see the entire body or only part of it."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2314.71,2321.527,--I agree with Your Honor that it would be simulated if they're under the blanket and you see the heads.
2001.00-795,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2321.527,2335.138,"I think the question is whether you could, a court could say well, to keep this within constitutional bounds we will read into the statute this broad requirement that there be an actual showing of sexual organs."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2335.138,2351.118,"You know, legislatures write statutes, I think the courts interpret them and I think to construe it you'd be basically rewriting the statute if you did that, if you eliminated that terminology and I don't think the government has urged that."
2001.00-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2351.118,2360.551,Am I not correct in remembering that one of the amendments to this series of statutes by Congress specifically eliminated the requirement of patently offensive and the like?
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2360.551,2365.766,They've done that in the child pornography area a long time ago.
2001.00-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2379.954,2399.895,Do you have any examples of the use of computer generated images covered by this statute where it has serious literary or educational value or scientific value?
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2399.895,2400.621,Well--
2001.00-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2400.621,2402.876,Do we have examples of that?
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2402.876,2407.428,--Today I don't know that we have examples today of that.
2001.00-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2417.741,2431.673,Because your concern is with the expansion to these images of things that are already prohibited and yet I don't think we have examples of any serious use of them in--
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2431.673,2432.183,"--Well, if I--"
2001.00-795,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2432.183,2434.053,--areas which would be of concern.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2444.679,2453.953,"--Well, that would be correct but I think it's not, you know, too in the distant future that we will be making films that will be virtual reality."
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2453.953,2460.025,"But they're their strongest argument is... I mean, I thought their argument is you're right, those things you're talking about are not covered."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2511.077,2516.053,But the problem with that is it creates a chilling effect because who's going to take the chance?
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2528.704,2556.68,"What about the other argument which is look, we're trying to protect the real children who are the subjects of the film and the reason we need this to protect them is because there is no way for any expert or anyone else to say when they see a film whether this is a film of a real person or whether it is a fake film made through virtual technology."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2559.353,2563.745,"Well, I think that becomes, you know, an excuse."
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2563.745,2564.031,Is it true?
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2564.031,2565.87,It is not true.
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2565.87,2566.38,All right.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2574.275,2587.204,"Yes, because I think you can look at the Senate hearing report where it's indicated that in 1995 in relation to cases that were brought there was a conviction rate of 97.6 percent."
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2600.336,2623.231,"You say the congressional finding is wrong then because the statute begins with, among other findings, new photographic and computer imaging technologies make it possible to produce by electronic, mechanical or other means visual depictions of what appear to be children engaging in sexually explicit conduct that are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from unretouched photographic images."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2625.614,2639.553,"That congressional finding, I don't think it was empirically, there was no empirical evidence that was really shown to Congress that that is correct, that the computer, and I believe, and I think it's clear--"
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2639.553,2643.304,So you have both your opponent and the Congress who think you're wrong on this point.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2643.304,2643.95,--Yes.
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2643.95,2644.557,Okay.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2660.374,2660.708,That's correct.
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2671.19,2681.72,Mr. Clement gave an example of another case in which the government did obtain a conviction but only because of the new statute in which the government witness was unable to say.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2681.72,2683.914,That was that government witness.
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2693.564,2696.235,"This was just a bad government witness, you say?"
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2696.235,2697.201,It could have been.
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2707.297,2711.849,"Wouldn't have gotten a conviction if the law had been what you want it to be, isn't that right?"
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2711.849,2724.619,We don't know they wouldn't have gotten a conviction with that... the testimony in that case was that the expert indicated that he was not sure and could not positively say whether it was real or not real.
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.619,2731.284,And on that basis can you find beyond a reasonable doubt that it was a depiction of an actual minor.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2731.284,2735.652,It creates an inference and a jury can draw inferences from the evidence.
2001.00-795,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2735.652,2746.405,"Suppose the law put the burden on you, on the defendant to show that this depiction does not use an actual child."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2768.481,2769.624,"Yes, I would."
2001.00-795,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2786.566,2789.774,"Okay, let's assume that that too was fixed."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2799.655,2805.783,"--I, the possessor though, you'd be switching the burden of proof then I believe and I think that would be an unconstitutional shifting of the burden."
2001.00-795,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2805.783,2813.368,"Well, you'd be making, you be... are you saying that the affirmative defense therefore is, in effect, has got to be constitutionally relevant across the board?"
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2813.368,2815.871,I believe that it is.
2001.00-795,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2819.19,2822.55,So there's no way to tailor it by affirmative defense in effect is your argument.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2822.55,2823.1,That's correct.
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2823.1,2840.305,"And how would that affirmative defense prevent some of the evils that the government is trying to prevent, for example the seduction of minors to sexual conduct by showing things that appear to be minors?"
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2846.56,2860.803,"There are currently, there are currently lots of laws that deal with anyone who attempts to entice a child and I believe that those laws could be enforced and I believe that the penalties could be increased and that could be a deterrent effect on that."
2001.00-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2868.878,2877.031,"Well, you could say the same thing about a murder statute, you know, you don't expect a whole lot of people to go out and commit murders but that doesn't mean Congress can't legislate against it."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2877.031,2884.399,"--But here you can't legislate that if it's not, if it's a virtual murder and there has been no murder, you don't go out and arrest people."
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2889.72,2905.123,"Well, if you want to talk about a very small portion of the population I would think there's a very small portion of the population that wants either to produce or to watch adolescents and children engaging in sexual conduct of the sort described in this statute."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2908.594,2915.019,But if you use the principle that's involved here then I do believe you begin the slippery slope.
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2936.856,2968.706,"What's worrying me about what you're saying now is that if their factual hypothesis is true, which I tend to doubt, but I'm not an expert, that there is no technical way to distinguish between a photograph of a real child and an imaginary child, if it were true, there is no expert who could tell you the difference and you tell me I can not have an affirmative defense, then the government cannot prosecute real child pornography."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2968.706,2970.145,I think they can--
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2970.145,2973.76,Because there would be no way to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was a real child.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2983.337,2991.322,--That's not correct because they've been able to get convictions and they've gone forward and they've gotten convictions.
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2991.322,2999.011,"Well, presumably people think that it is possible to distinguish between the real child and the virtual fake."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,2999.011,3011.822,"But I don't believe, you know, at least currently they've not lost any of the cases and there's only been the one where someone has raised the issue and that expert had indicated that they weren't sure."
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3011.822,3019.751,"I think what you're doing is in effect varying the question, you're saying, look, in the real world it doesn't happen, they can tell."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3044.765,3057.76,"I'm going to go back and I'm not begging the question, again, if I have, if there is virtual murder that looks so real on the screen, I don't go out and charge anyone with murder."
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3057.76,3078.734,"Well, we can distinguish attraction to other forms of socially damaging behavior from that particular category of social... socially damaging behavior that has for hundreds of years been treated as obscenity."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3107.512,3119.034,"If you take the logic that's behind here about people, you're getting at the person who is misusing the material and there certainly I think is, you can't even do medical--"
2001.00-795,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3119.034,3126.955,Sexual material in a category called obscenity which has traditionally for hundreds of years been regulable by government.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3126.955,3151.594,"--But the obscenity here we're making just because it's a fictional character visually participating in an activity that I can write about, we're now saying you cannot express, that we're saying, we're giving it a social status, and I think when we start to do that then we start to eliminate, we can start eliminating other areas equally."
2001.00-795,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3212.581,3227.497,"But what if we accept the government's limiting construction, the government is urging that we use this, take the congressional finding, read it into the text of the statute and then it would cut out all the good things."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3227.497,3244.565,--I believe that the Court has indicated in the past in Turner Broadcasting and in the landmark communications case that it's not for the Court to be rewriting statutes as they come out of Congress and particularly in the area when it deals in areas of First Amendment.
2001.00-795,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3249.212,3256.981,"Supposing that... suppose we could consult Congress, they would say yeah, preserve as much of this as is constitutional."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3265.774,3279.41,"--All we're asking is, is the Court sever out two phrases and that is that is, is it appears to be and that it, you know, and where it conveys the impression that a minor is engaged in sexual activity."
2001.00-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3279.41,3287.426,"Well, in X-Citement Video we did something not too different from this, reading in a requirement that wasn't express in the statute."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3287.426,3292.498,You did read in the elements of knowingly and you have to do that.
2001.00-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3312.877,3322.222,But that's an example of a case where there was a First Amendment challenge where we have read something into a statute that we might not necessarily have done.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3322.222,3326.166,The Court has the power to do that.
2001.00-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3326.166,3328.725,And there's precedent for our doing it.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3328.725,3331.108,"Yes, in X-Citement Video the Court did do that."
2001.00-795,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3348.719,3360.25,Are you saying that if real children are not used in the depiction of simulated sexual activity that it cannot be barred unless it meets the Miller standard?
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3360.25,3362.128,Yes.
2001.00-795,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3364.967,3367.677,"Eight year olds, ten year olds, twelve year olds."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3367.677,3374.782,"--They're fictional characters, because I think they do have a valid use in medical research."
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3374.782,3384.718,"Suppose you said... suppose you said... suppose I... I don't know how I'd do it, suppose I could draft a statute which had a medical research exemption."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3384.718,3386.228,It would make it narrower.
2001.00-795,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3386.228,3388.803,Would it be constitutional?
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3388.803,3401.325,"Again, I'd have to see the whole statute and, again, I think that it would depend on how it works and whether it still had the problems with the affirmative defense."
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3401.325,3405.757,Suppose you took... I just want to follow up on what Justice Kennedy said.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3413.998,3415.292,That could be done.
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3415.292,3417.939,"That could be done, you'd still have the other two parts."
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3417.939,3423.531,"Yes, and I think that most communities would feel, I think that all communities would feel that that is patently offensive."
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3423.531,3429.995,I wonder if Miller would work more satisfactorily if you did that in the case of people who clearly appear to be minors.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3429.995,3431.194,I believe that it would.
2001.00-795,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3431.194,3431.944,You think it would.
2001.00-795,1,28035,h_louis_sirkin,,3431.944,3432.286,Thank you.
2001.00-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3432.286,3437.102,"Thank you Mr. Sirkin, Mr. Clement you have one minute remaining."
2001.00-795,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3437.102,3440.733,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
2001.00-795,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3486.757,3493.374,Is there any precedent that we judge a free speech statute based on the kind of prosecutions the government has been bringing?
2001.00-795,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3493.374,3503.271,"--There is precedent and the best one I can think of is Ferber for waiting until as applied challenges to deal with the fringe cases, the tiny fraction cases."
2001.00-795,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3518.496,3520.415,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
