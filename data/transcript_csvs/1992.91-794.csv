1992.91-794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.747,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-794, Henry Harper v. Virginia Department of Taxation."
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,10.747,14.449,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,354.89,366.197,"Well certainly the state can, in a tax case the state can require a claimant to go through the procedures required of other claimants for tax refunds, can it not?"
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,366.197,374.224,Certainly a state can structure its tax refund statute in a way that provides it protection.
1992.91-794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,441.026,452.521,"Well, and I suppose the state can also put a time bar on the remedy, that you must apply for a refund or pay under protest within a certain amount of time or you can't do it?"
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,452.521,452.865,Certainly.
1992.91-794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.323,485.024,"What are the limits in Virginia, the statute of limitations or the time requirements on a tax claim?"
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,485.024,488.974,In an ordinary case it would be 3 years as a general rule.
1992.91-794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,526.21,531.568,You are only extending it to a year after this Court renders a decision in this case?
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,531.568,534.394,"Well, perhaps this Court, perhaps the Supreme Court of Virginia on remand."
1992.91-794,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,538.409,540.174,But how far back does that go?
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,540.174,546.89,"Only to 1984 would be the first... I'm sorry, 1985 would be the first tax year at issue, in dispute in this case."
1992.91-794,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,568.052,579.782,I'm a little puzzled because they make the argument in their brief that as long as you had a prepayment procedure you don't have to have a host payment refund claim.
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,589.825,600.65,In this case all the court has held is that the reason its refund statute does not apply is because of non-retroactivity of Davis.
1992.91-794,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,600.65,601.538,Right.
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,601.538,612.863,"In its second opinion it intimated that it could continue to play the Chevron game with respect to a remedy, but that's not anything that it had done before."
1992.91-794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,660.312,670.558,"Even if he had that authority, does Virginia require you to go to the tax commissioner in order later to ask for a refund?"
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,670.558,671.058,No.
1992.91-794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.266,696.952,Virginia does not say you must go to the tax commissioner?
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,704.185,705.652,You had to pay the tax first.
1992.91-794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.652,706.355,"Yes, you have to pay it first."
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,706.355,706.699,Yes.
1992.91-794,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,706.699,743.107,"But I take it, or maybe it's not correct, if you apply to the commissioner for a prepayment remedy would that extend the period of time in which you have to file your refund because the, I take it the commissioner can hold your claim in abeyance while the commissioner is determining it, and then if the commissioner denies it I take it the refund remedy, the limitation of the refund remedy begins to run from either the denial or the payment."
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,743.107,749.12,Virginia does have a procedure whereby you can preserve a refund claim in just that manner.
1992.91-794,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,761.068,777.248,"But there is a functional difference in the two routes in that if you apply for the predeprivation, for the prepayment determination it is going to have the effect of extending the period of time in which you have to ultimately file a court action."
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,777.248,780.685,"Yes, it would extend your statute of limitations."
1992.91-794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,804.176,813.344,"Mr. Kator, I think you said that the commissioner cannot relieve you of your tax liability on grounds of unconstitutionality."
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,814.172,814.938,That's correct.
1992.91-794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,814.938,815.529,He can't forgive it.
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,825.995,835.101,"I don't... I suspect it's conceivable that he could say I'm very sympathetic, I think this tax is unconstitutional but there's nothing I can do about it, but I know--"
1992.91-794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,835.101,840.896,"He cannot make a declaration of unconstitutionality with any legally operative significance, is that what you're saying?"
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,840.896,841.13,--Exactly.
1992.91-794,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.143,864.167,"Don't they make another argument, another argument that there's some sort of an equitable doctrine of repose that the Virginia court can apply that could be comparable to a statute of limitations when they think there's gross unfairness in collecting a tax retroactively?"
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,864.167,874.068,"The argument that I understand the Department of Taxation to make is that the state has its own retroactivity analysis, the Fountain v.--"
1992.91-794,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,874.068,879.723,I understood that to go not to the question of whether the rule of law is retroactive but whether there really is a state remedy.
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,901.575,913.475,"--Well, the only authority they cite for that is the Fountain case and another one that was decided on or about the same date, and those cases are retroactivity cases."
1992.91-794,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,964.596,966.689,May I just interrupt you right there?
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,974.279,975.748,Correct.
1992.91-794,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.748,982.058,"Now why does the Federal Constitution necessarily trumps this sort of, this new equitable doctrine they're coming up with?"
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,982.058,986.024,Because if it's new then there wasn't a clear and certain remedy.
1992.91-794,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.024,986.29,I see.
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,986.29,991.896,"You have a Brinkerhoff-Faris situation where they undermined your claim, your existing claim."
1992.91-794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1069.179,1081.377,Do you say that an even-handedly applied requirement that you pay under protest in order to recover cannot bar recovery?
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,1081.377,1087.609,"I wouldn't say that, I wouldn't say that it... well, yes."
1992.91-794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1087.609,1091.326,What's your authority for that?
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,1091.326,1091.608,Okay.
1992.91-794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1123.093,1129.561,"Well, why would the general rule, why is the general rule not applicable, could it not be applicable to this situation?"
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,1129.561,1133.777,"It could be, Your Honor, if it were imposed in the future."
1992.91-794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1136.228,1150.568,"Well, supposing that Virginia had in 1980, say before all of this litigation arose, adopted a rule that in order to ever get a refund for a tax you have to have paid it under protest and applied that evenhandedly up until now."
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,1156.081,1157.86,"I think that that's what McKesson holds, Your Honor."
1992.91-794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1157.86,1158.892,I think it is too.
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,1158.892,1162.781,But that is not the situation that we have here.
1992.91-794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.781,1170.559,"As I understand, you say what the situation here is that you may go through a protest procedure with the commissioner, but you need not."
1992.91-794,0,36148,michael_j_kator,,1174.807,1177.931,"Yes, as is the case with many other states."
1992.91-794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1184.897,1186.881,"Very well, Mr. Kator."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1202.155,1203.062,Let me begin with that.
1992.91-794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1230.129,1233.782,You say the procedure also involves going to court.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1235.377,1235.61,Yes.
1992.91-794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1236.252,1239.344,"You can do one or the other, and either one will be sufficient?"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1239.344,1241.264,There are various predeprivation remedies.
1992.91-794,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.944,1275.531,"Ms. Marshall, are they... I know they are available but does the state say you must use those and unless you use those you can't come in later, which is what it seems to me it's saying here?"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1289.292,1292.838,"Mr. Justice Scalia, the state gives them an option under the regulations--"
1992.91-794,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1292.838,1293.15,Okay.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1293.15,1295.804,--which are part of our submission in our brief.
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1328.058,1331.009,"Ms. Marshall, may I interrupt you just a moment before you get into that?"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1351.72,1352.688,--There is a general statute and it is applied.
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1357.654,1358.013,Okay.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1358.013,1373.43,"Perkins itself, the case that our supreme court relied on in forming and declaring the nature of the refund remedy, which the option that these petitioners took, relied on the Perkins case and it itself was a declaratory judgment action."
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1373.43,1373.836,Okay.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1384.144,1393.672,"Well, whether he could or not, that hasn't been litigated in Virginia, but the point is whether these petitioners could have gotten relief and they certainly could have gotten relief."
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1404.292,1420.723,"It may be, and I certainly will accept your answer on that point, but isn't it clear that unless he is able to declare the tax unconstitutional he could not, as you put it, exonerate them on the kind of claim that we have before us here?"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1420.723,1421.926,"No, I disagree."
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1436.702,1446.291,"Oh, I'm sure he has that general power but isn't it equally clear that he could not legally use that power without stating a legally sufficient reason?"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1465.299,1478.169,"--Well, I mean, he is subject, of course, to writs of prohibition and mandamus for arbitrary actions, but, and certainly he is presumed to act in, presumptively to act in good faith reliance on what a reasonable interpretation of the law is."
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1489.351,1498.739,"Well, if he had gone to the commissioner first, not declaratory judgment first but if he had gone to the commissioner first could he then have sought judicial review without payment of the tax?"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1498.739,1500.753,"As a declaratory judgment, that's correct."
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1500.753,1500.987,I see.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1500.987,1501.394,That's correct.
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1501.394,1503.955,May I ask though--
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1503.955,1504.44,Yes.
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.44,1515.592,--Do you have any authorities in your brief for the proposition that failure to pursue the prepayment remedy bars an otherwise available post-payment refund remedy?
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1515.592,1518.949,"Your Honor, that case has never come before the court."
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.387,1519.809,This is the first case?
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1519.809,1522.042,"--That's... well, I'm sorry--"
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.042,1522.807,And my second question--
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1522.807,1523.196,--Could I--
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.196,1523.915,"--I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1523.915,1532.255,--I wanted to say that the question of what would have occurred had they taken any of these other remedies has not been litigated in the Virginia court.
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1532.255,1532.552,I understand.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1542.361,1563.509,"I suggest, Your Honor, that Perkins and Capehart, the two cases in the 1970s, give notice to the petitioners that if they choose this particular remedy, which is one of several available remedies, it comes with that limitation, the limitation which has been engrafted on the law by our supreme court 2 decades ago."
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1565.93,1571.693,--What's the limit... I'm not sure I... that if they choose the post-refund remedy it comes with what limitation?
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1571.693,1587.406,--It comes with the statutory interpretation by the Virginia Supreme Court in Perkins and Capehart that in cases where there is reliance by all parties on the law and there would be a failure of the administration of justice for that to be overturned--
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.406,1588.202,I see.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1588.202,1591.091,--that the remedy of refund is not mandatory.
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1595.199,1595.386,I see.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1600.76,1602.462,At the trial court.
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.055,1608.132,You have argued all the way through that there's no remedy here even if there is--
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1608.132,1608.57,--We have argued all the way through.
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1608.945,1613.411,--And the... why has not the Virginia Supreme Court addressed that question before?
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1613.411,1620.579,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that there are two things that the Virginia Supreme Court did address, and there are various lens that this Court can look at the case."
1992.91-794,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1690.301,1708.138,"Ms. Marshall, did Perkins and Capehart make clear and did you argue in this case at the trial court that the rule is different for post-payment remedies than it is for the declaratory judgment remedy?"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1735.689,1739.547,"Let me suggest, Your Honor, that I believe it is clearly derived from Perkins."
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1899.64,1902.795,"Ms. Marshall, you have made a statement that I don't understand."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1906.731,1920.131,"When you look at their complaints, which we reproduced in the appendix, the only use they make of section 111 or the Federal law is to establish or try to bootstrap themselves into the state refund statute."
1992.91-794,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.938,1935.235,But do they have such a claim until you deny their request for compensation?
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1935.235,1957.6,"--Well, in McKesson, McKesson brought its claim both on Federal grounds and on state grounds, and they suggest here, and even in the supreme court, the Supreme Court of Virginia, the assignments of error decide what is waived and what is put forward, and yet in assignments of error they make no claim of unconstitutionality or due process problems with the remedial face of the case."
1992.91-794,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1957.6,1963.363,I assume there is no Federal constitutional remedy if the state provides an adequate refund remedy.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,1970.532,1975.764,"But, Your Honor, when they brought the claim they surely knew of Perkins and Capehart."
1992.91-794,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.757,2020.246,"It seems to me that's like saying a capital, a capital defendant who pursues an appeal to the state supreme court and is denied the basis of his appeal cannot then come to this Court saying that that denial was a violation of the Federal Constitution unless he has before the state court anticipated the denial and argued that the denial would be a violation of the Federal Constitution."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2021.184,2026.213,"Well, of course, Your Honor, when this case came to the Virginia Supreme Court the claim had been denied."
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.27,2042.909,"No, but the state supreme court didn't deny it on the ground there was no remedy."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2049.641,2051.141,"Again, Your Honor--"
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.141,2054.498,But they have never said that if the rule is retroactive you don't have a remedy.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2055.857,2059.699,"--Your Honor, that is a possible way of reading the case below."
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2110.368,2128.593,"Ms. Marshall, before we get away from the point, in case it should make a difference to me later, can you tell me when the first, when the point was either as a matter of pleading or briefing, when your, when the claimants here first mentioned the Fourteenth Amendment as a basis for their claim?"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2128.593,2132.264,I believe it was in this Court.
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2142.854,2143.071,Okay.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2143.071,2147.774,If you look at the assignments of error it's very clear there were two issues they presented to the Virginia Supreme Court.
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.965,2327.247,Are you suggesting... excuse me.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2338.508,2347.629,"Well, as you know, this was based principally on the statute, and it was interpreted to be simply Federal retirees versus state."
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2347.629,2349.239,"I understand, but I'm not sure that answers my question."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2349.239,2349.723,Yes.
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2349.723,2355.971,"You're saying that on the, that really for reasons I found very persuasive there really was a discrimination here."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2355.971,2356.487,That's right.
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2356.487,2361.578,"But supposing it was discrimination against a class that we're particularly interested in protecting, say females."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2363.906,2377.368,"Oh, I think, Your Honor, that that would be an Equal Protection claim and I think that you would look to, if you were looking under a Federal rule, you would look to all of the points which this Court has established as a very workable and fair rule in Chevron."
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2383.022,2399.157,"Yeah, but you're making those arguments... I'm just asking you if your basic argument about remedy would be different if it were a different kind of discrimination, if it were a constitutional discrimination against women rather than statutory discrimination against some retirees and not the entire population."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2399.157,2402.453,"--I think that goes to, Your Honor, to the foreseeability of it and the reliance interest."
1992.91-794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.076,2409.419,It seems to me it's hard to argue foreseeability when 8 members of the Court disagree with you.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2409.419,2430.488,"--Well, Your Honor, we had a very courtly dissent in that case, as you know, and we suggest that what was unforeseeable to the states... if it was foreseeable we wonder why did not any one of these petitioners come forward and, as they can, it doesn't cost any money, come forward and ask for a legal opinion by the highest legal officer of the state."
1992.91-794,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2455.307,2467.068,"They claim that they didn't have to, and that gets back ultimately to the argument of whether indeed your law required that they make that claim beforehand or allows them to do it afterwards."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2471.456,2473.877,--I don't say that they were behaving unreasonably.
1992.91-794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2529.635,2532.838,--Well then it won't be hard to refund it if it's--
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2535.993,2536.212,Pardon?
1992.91-794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2552.688,2560.076,"Well, they're asking for a refund that is disproportionate to the amount of the discrimination that was imposed?"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2560.076,2566.606,"Your Honor, I don't think there was any discrimination based on the Federal Government, but that has been decided in Davis."
1992.91-794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2566.606,2566.903,Yes.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2566.903,2578.32,"And what they're asking for is roughly 10 times the amount of what was now found to be the offending benefit that was given, and it was not funded by these 200,000 people."
1992.91-794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2583.41,2591.048,"Well, why do you say it's... how do you calculate that it's 10 times the amount of the--"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2591.048,2598.811,"This is a rough estimate based, Your Honor, on the fact that there were very many fewer, there were very many fewer state retirees in Virginia."
1992.91-794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2618.428,2628.533,--But are the class of Federal retirees asking as refunds any more than they actually paid?
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2628.533,2635.342,"They are asking for 100 percent tax exemption, and certainly the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine never entitled them to an exemption."
1992.91-794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2641.512,2656.257,But Virginia I suppose has the choice after a case like Davis to say that we will withdraw the benefit we have given to state retirees and treat everybody equally.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2662.52,2683.401,"Well, Your Honor, what I am suggesting is that there is no Federal interest that is being advanced by what really amounts to taking from these 2.5 million taxpayers a massive amount of what would otherwise be state assets available for construction of prisons and various services and transferring it to these 200,000 people."
1992.91-794,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2702.426,2719.497,"Ms. Marshall, you describe this as though it's a tort case, as though what's at issue is how blameworthy was Virginia and how entitled to... it's really not that, it's just a matter of, it's a simple Federal statute that says these people were entitled, given your tax structure, to this amount of money."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2722.214,2724.619,"Your Honor, the statute--"
1992.91-794,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.619,2729.133,"And, you know, end of problem as far as this argument is concerned."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2735.569,2738.692,"--But, Your Honor, let's go back to what is the remedial question."
1992.91-794,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.886,2764.479,I don't know what you mean when you said it has no remedial aspect to it.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2768.508,2769.648,"--Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1992.91-794,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.648,2769.93,--nothing would happen?
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2769.93,2770.617,And it was not.
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2807.695,2835.027,"Well, in your position then if there had been a predeprivation proceeding brought, either administratively in the first place or by declaratory judgment, it would have been appropriate let's say in the latter instance for the court to say you're absolutely right that you should not be assessed this tax, but the only obligation Virginia has now is to change its law, and therefore under no circumstances can you get a penny back even though you win the case."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2836.839,2839.494,"At a minimum you would certainly change the law, and that was appropriately done."
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2839.494,2842.181,"Well, I am talking about not minimums but maximums."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2845.82,2849.49,It's a position of the tax department that we would be in a totally--
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2849.49,2852.583,"Well now, excuse me, I don't want the position of the tax department as such."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2855.051,2858.987,--I do not believe so because there would have been no reliance then by the state.
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2865.953,2872.137,"No, but there would have been reliance at least with respect to the period for the tax year in question."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2879.228,2882.743,In a declaratory judgment though we're talking about a prepayment remedy.
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2907.545,2926.115,"But in the instance in which I gave in which there was the declaratory judgment, following that declaratory judgment the commissioner or the state would have been under no obligation to do anything but go ahead and collect the tax merely in hopes that the state legislature would change the law?"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2926.115,2937.923,"--No, Your Honor, I think that after the declaratory judgment the tax collector, the tax commissioner would be obligated to follow the declaration of the law that it was an invalid tax and to withhold exaction or collection of the tax--"
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2937.923,2938.705,"Well, then the law--"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2938.705,2939.173,--and to refund.
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2939.173,2948.981,"--Then the Federal statute implies something other than prospective changes of the law as the appropriate form of relief, which I think is the proposition you were disputing a moment ago."
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2948.981,2963.381,"What I'm suggesting is that when you do not take a predeprivation route and when you do not base your claim for remedy directly on a Federal right, either through a 1983 or through any other injunctive action... for example, Phillips was an injunctive action."
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2965.116,2967.833,"Well, they were at least claiming a Federal right here, you don't dispute that?"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2967.833,2975.705,They were not basing their claim... if you look at their complaint we say it is based solely on a refund statute which--
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2975.705,2982.906,"Well, it was based on a refund statute, but their predicate for claiming the refund was the claim of a Federal right, isn't that correct?"
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2982.906,2994.854,"--Your Honor, they used the Davis decision in order to try to establish that the plain language of the refund remedy statute applied, i.e. that it was improper or erroneous."
1992.91-794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2994.854,2996.899,I don't think we're getting anywhere.
1992.91-794,1,25794,gail_starling_marshall,,2996.899,3007.488,"So, Your Honors, I would suggest that as a result of the law-changing decision that this Court made in March of 1981 that this Court should affirm the decision below."
1992.91-794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3007.488,3008.16,"Thank you, Ms. Marshall."
1992.91-794,2,36148,michael_j_kator,,3011.519,3012.691,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.91-794,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3040.553,3044.974,How can there be such diametric opposition on such a fundamental point?
1992.91-794,2,36148,michael_j_kator,,3047.207,3052.579,"--I believe we did, we may have cited the cases in our earlier papers in this Court."
1992.91-794,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3084.582,3085.176,"--Could you provide it, please?"
1992.91-794,2,36148,michael_j_kator,,3086.301,3087.581,"I'd be delighted to, Your Honor."
1992.91-794,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.907,3138.499,"Well, I think there are two different constitutional violations at issue here, aren't there?"
1992.91-794,2,36148,michael_j_kator,,3150.634,3151.338,I think--
1992.91-794,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3151.338,3155.225,And I think they're saying you didn't make that claim until now.
1992.91-794,2,36148,michael_j_kator,,3155.225,3165.128,"--To be fair, Your Honor, we didn't contemplate at the time that we filed our complaint, I think that was before McKesson came down, I don't believe that we were addressing that."
1992.91-794,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3261.794,3266.9,Are you going to comment on Perkins and Capehart?
1992.91-794,2,36148,michael_j_kator,,3266.9,3273.585,"Perkins and Capehart, Your Honor, first of all those are what we would call modified prospectivity cases."
1992.91-794,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3329.126,3352.615,"What the state says, and now they may be right or wrong, is that the post-deprivation remedy is more limited than the predeprivation remedy, and that so long as the predeprivation remedy is full they are not required to give you a full post-deprivation remedy."
1992.91-794,2,36148,michael_j_kator,,3352.615,3364.752,"Your Honor, I think that that is an accurate statement of McKesson, that if in fact they have a full predeprivation remedy they can have no post-deprivation remedy."
1992.91-794,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3392.88,3393.895,That's not quite fair.
1992.91-794,2,36148,michael_j_kator,,3404.016,3412.373,"--Your Honor, I would submit that what must be clear and certain is the bundle of routes available to challenge the tax."
1992.91-794,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3446.764,3448.873,I think Virginia is arguing that its court has done that.
1992.91-794,2,36148,michael_j_kator,,3448.873,3452.559,"--Well, I don't think that that can fairly be read from the supreme court's opinion."
1992.91-794,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3452.559,3457.401,"I realize that, but I just thought that was what the state is arguing."
1992.91-794,2,36148,michael_j_kator,,3457.401,3457.948,Okay.
1992.91-794,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3457.948,3461.259,"Not that they should do it now, but that they have already done it."
1992.91-794,2,36148,michael_j_kator,,3461.259,3465.616,"Correct, Your Honor, and my point is I don't think that it is, it can be seen from that."
1992.91-794,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3507.364,3518.829,"May I ask you one last question before you... the second part of the Virginia Supreme Court opinion seems to me to be responding to this argument that you made, and tell me if I am right on your presentation."
1992.91-794,2,36148,michael_j_kator,,3526.795,3534.229,"The argument was, my argument was your refund statute says erroneous and illegal."
1992.91-794,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3568.763,3570.497,"Thank you, Mr. Kator."
1992.91-794,2,36148,michael_j_kator,,3570.497,3571.012,Thank you.
1992.91-794,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3571.012,3572.178,The case is submitted.
