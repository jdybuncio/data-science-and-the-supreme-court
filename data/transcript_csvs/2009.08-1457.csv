2009.08-1457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.37,"We will hear argument this morning in Case 08-1457, New Process Steel v. The National Labor Relations Board."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,11.601,15.119,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,35.622,57.21,"Is it your position that all of the actions of the board, including those taken by the regional offices and by the general counsel and by everybody else, is inoperative once -- once the membership falls below three?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,57.21,72.796,"--No, Justice Scalia, particularly with respect to the general counsel, the statute at 153(d) has a separate enumeration of -- of obligations and powers and authority, so we don't think that that fails."
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,76.372,84.901,"Well, it has a separate -- a separate authorization for these three -- three-person adjudicatory panels as well, doesn't it?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,84.901,88.352,"--It has -- it does, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,97.364,97.991,Okay.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,121.228,126.227,"It is our argument that the -- that once the membership falls below three, that the National Labor--"
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,126.227,127.323,The membership of the board?
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,127.323,128.649,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.649,129.71,The membership of the board?
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,129.71,132.334,When the membership of the board falls below three.
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,140.66,143.814,I understood that argument and I thought that was the only one you were making.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,151.188,152.904,"You are correct, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,162.275,165.523,"So the regional offices can't function, of the NLRB?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,165.523,166.65,"Well, we believe they can function."
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,176.379,177.428,Can the board pay salaries?
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,177.428,190.639,"--We believe they can, because there is probably a different statute that enumerates that, Justice Scalia, other than this statute with respect to the authority with respect to adjudicatory decisions."
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.639,202.15,"I'm really reluctant to rely upon this first argument that you are making, because I really don't know what it does to all of the functioning of the board."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,202.15,215.819,"Well, one of the -- Justice Scalia, one of the things that we think is clear is that the remedy for fixing an undersized board is not for the board to redefine itself and to read the statute, but for Congress or the president to act."
2009.08-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,222.736,229.123,But here the court of appeals said that the Act does two things.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,266.843,269.888,"Well, I think there is two answers to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,304.751,306.108,I didn't understand that.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,307.702,308.825,"--Certainly, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,361.602,369.19,But it's not an agent of the board because the three-member group that has a quorum of two has the full powers of the board.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,378.607,393.055,"It's a -- it's a group that is delegated authority, and therefore, whether it's a full delegation or partial delegation, we believe that the common law principles of agency and principal make that delegee group an agent."
2009.08-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,393.055,399.412,"But where does the statute make that three-member group with a quorum of two, a quorum of two, an agent?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,407.003,413.266,"Justice Ginsburg, it does not say the word ""agent"" in it."
2009.08-1457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,445.738,449.281,You should -- you should have a very direct answer to this question.
2009.08-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,452.982,469.165,"The D.C. Circuit I think was the source of your opening argument because they said when the number drops below three there is no board, and I guess that's what your opening argument was based on."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,469.165,471.493,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it did say that."
2009.08-1457,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,496.528,500.716,"Well, just on this same point before Justice Breyer I think moves to another point."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,520.02,521.13,Justice Kennedy--
2009.08-1457,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,521.13,522.815,"It says ""shall constitute a quorum""."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,522.815,532.435,"--Justice Kennedy, I think we have to start first -- and you are correct, there are two quorum provisions, but ""quorum"" is not defined differently."
2009.08-1457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,569.14,579.494,"Can you -- can you -- if you are right, it seems to me you should have a very clear, concise answer to the question that I'm just going to ask you."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,599.331,600.08,Clearly.
2009.08-1457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,600.08,600.626,Clearly.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,620.352,631.175,"Justice Breyer, the difference is that in this statute there is a clear statement that at all times the board must have a three-member quorum."
2009.08-1457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,634.032,634.407,Correct.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,634.407,634.516,The board was still in place.
2009.08-1457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,634.516,643.761,"Except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence, which says"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,653.257,664.019,"Well, the difference is that once the -- the difference between the hypothetical and the situation we are in is that there were four members, and the statute--"
2009.08-1457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,664.019,666.452,"Well, I know that, but I'm asking why does that make a difference?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,666.452,674.201,"--It makes a difference because the statute requires that at all times the board shall have a quorum of three members, a minimum quorum of three members."
2009.08-1457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,674.201,674.669,Except.
2009.08-1457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,674.669,681.556,But isn't that tied to a quorum for the board as a whole to act?
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,707.561,719.4,"Well, I think the problem is, Justice Sotomayor, that the delegation to a group of three is indeed a valid delegation."
2009.08-1457,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,768.066,770.66,But that brings you back to Justice Breyer's hypothetical.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,794.774,797.835,"Justice Kennedy, I--"
2009.08-1457,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,797.835,813.532,"If the quorum of three that authorized two to act disappears and that means the principal is no longer there, so the agent can't exercise the authority, why isn't it the same when five become four?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,813.532,819.387,"--Well, we believe that the reason that it isn't, Justice Kennedy, the same is -- terrible sentence."
2009.08-1457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,849.457,874.726,"As far as the interests of your client are concerned, is there any functional difference between what happened here and what could happen very routinely even if the board had five members, namely that after the case was assigned to a three-member panel one of the three members of the panel became unable to sit on that case, but the remaining two members were able to reach agreement so the case could be decided?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,874.726,883.41,"Justice Alito, the difference is that here there was never a way to reconstitute this board -- I'm sorry, the group -- as three members."
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.717,894.952,Isn't there another difference?
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,908.541,912.897,"--Well, I believe that the board could revise the decision of one of its panels."
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,912.897,917.631,"Well you -- you've got to tell me more than you believe in it, what -- what -- what is the case?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,917.631,920.442,The adjudication is final.
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.442,922.424,The adjudication is final.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,922.424,922.736,Of the three-member group.
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,922.736,924.362,There is no appeal to the full board?
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,924.362,925.688,That is correct.
2009.08-1457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,925.688,928.234,Then what is the reason -- I now see.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,933.179,934.758,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-1457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,934.758,935.023,--Okay.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,942.471,942.892,That's true.
2009.08-1457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,942.892,951.109,"And -- and, therefore, I would like to know, since you could also read it the other way, why should it be read your way?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,972.848,984.204,"Justice Breyer, we -- we believe that it is important to have a promote -- to have a robust debate and an expression of -- a potential for expression of dissent."
2009.08-1457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1020.707,1026.767,But the problem is that that exists whether we read your rule or not in the way you want.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1049.067,1067.965,"Justice Sotomayor, if we consented that when there was an absence, a member who dies, retires, is incapacitated, that the two members of a properly constituted three -- three-member group could still function, I certainly did not mean to say that."
2009.08-1457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1073.354,1073.697,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1077.07,1077.573,--Yes.
2009.08-1457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1077.573,1088.362,"That somebody can't die, leave, recuse themselves from that group without invalidating the actions of that subgroup."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1094.781,1104.76,"The definition of a quorum, Justice Sotomayor, is the minimum number of persons of a body necessary to transact business."
2009.08-1457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1108.212,1109.288,"No, I am talking about the group."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1109.288,1110.617,"--I am, too."
2009.08-1457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1110.617,1113.802,So the group is not defined as three or more people.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1120.83,1129.919,"In the statute, the group is defined as -- the board is authorized, and I'm reading from 153(b), Appendix 1a to our brief:"
2009.08-1457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1134.197,1134.931,I see.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1134.931,1141.256,"--""any or all"" -- that is where we find it necessary that the group must contain at least three members."
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1141.256,1147.523,"That's -- that's a totally different argument from the one that relies upon the size of the board, right?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1147.523,1149.519,"It is, and we think it's an additional argument."
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1150.723,1169.324,"Even if the board were still properly constituted and had a full five members, if one of the three members to a -- a board should die, it would no longer be a three-member board and could no longer be, as your argument goes, the recipient of the delegation, right?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1169.324,1171.543,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1183.164,1189.146,There have been situations before where the board dwindled to two members.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1204.575,1207.371,"This is the first time, yes."
2009.08-1457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1229.081,1243.622,"There is a well-established practice on the court of appeals that when a three-judge panel for some reason loses one of the members due to a death or resignation or recusal, the panel can continue to decide the case if the remaining two judges can agree."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1255.71,1257.524,"Well, Justice Alito, I think it's a different statute."
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.736,1269.659,"Well, you are shifting arguments."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1298.336,1303.803,"--Well, Justice Scalia, it's a different statute but it's also a very temporary and limited circumstance."
2009.08-1457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1316.202,1322.434,"So I would have thought, but this is only me -- other people don't necessarily go in for this kind of argument."
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.278,1357.717,"If there is no legislative history, it could be true."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1362.073,1369.665,"Justice Breyer, the legislative history I think is -- there is no legislative history on what happens when the board falls below two members."
2009.08-1457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1406.32,1424.078,"I was surprised by your answer to -- I was surprised by your answer to one of the earlier questions, because one of your amici says that any member of the board, regardless of whether he or she sits on the panel hearing a case, may request that the case be heard by all five board members."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1425.564,1431.749,"That is correct, but that's to hear it as opposed to overturn it once the decision is made."
2009.08-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1431.749,1433.652,Heard an initial -- an initial decision.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1439.15,1441.042,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1441.042,1447.133,"So you could have initially a panel of five, but that would not be reviewing the panel of three?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1447.133,1450.037,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.472,1460.172,"What's the use of having a five-member board, then?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1463.124,1463.548,--What was--
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1463.548,1467.858,"--if you have a -- you are changing, oh, we had a three-member board, that's no good, we thought that's unfair."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1476.105,1477.182,--Multiple--
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.182,1477.494,Nothing.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1477.494,1478.746,"--I'm sorry, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1490.035,1501.171,"The amicus says that the members of the board not serving on a panel are given the opportunity to review draft decisions, thus no case will issue unless it reflects the majority opinion of the full board."
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1501.171,1503.593,--It's a draft--
2009.08-1457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1503.593,1510.795,"So that can be, in effect, the opportunity for full board review before a draft decision is issued in final form; is that the way it works?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1510.795,1512.932,"--Yes, Justice Alito, it does."
2009.08-1457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1512.932,1513.4,Only--
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1513.4,1514.153,That's not--
2009.08-1457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1514.153,1516.84,"--Only if a majority of the board wants to do that, right?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1516.84,1519.539,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1519.539,1528.538,"One member of the full board can overturn a group delegation, in other words, and hear the initial decision?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1528.538,1529.053,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1539.312,1541.719,What if one board member wants to do that and four don't?
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1542.187,1545.513,One member wants to join the panel?
2009.08-1457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1545.513,1548.075,One member wants to review the group's decision.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1548.075,1550.98,That member would review the group's decision.
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1553.604,1557.773,What -- I am really confused now.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1569.456,1574.377,The decision is final once it is rendered.
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1577.906,1583.701,"But that is -- that is my question, whether they -- they can review it before it is rendered, is that what you are saying?"
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1583.701,1588.918,--They can do that or they can ask to be included on the -- on the panel.
2009.08-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.918,1590.793,They can review it before it is rendered.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1591.589,1592.618,But they can't overturn it.
2009.08-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1592.618,1605.3,Is this different from the practice that some courts of appeals follow of circulating a panel decision to the full court some days before it's issued to the public?
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1616.311,1620.73,"I believe it's the same, Justice Ginsburg, that it's exactly the same."
2009.08-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1623.324,1628.135,But that's quite different from the court of appeals sitting en banc.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1635.521,1637.444,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1637.444,1642.412,But it provides an opportunity for them to vote to hear the case en banc before it's ever issued.
2009.08-1457,0,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,1642.412,1644.143,"That's correct, Justice Alito."
2009.08-1457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1653.688,1654.593,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1662.747,1670.242,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree that the plain text controls this case and there are three features to that text."
2009.08-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.019,1716.69,Just before the third member no longer became -- no longer was a member of the board.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1716.69,1717.829,--That's true.
2009.08-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1717.829,1731.996,"So knowing when it gave it to this three member panel that it would shortly become a two-member panel, and that thereby the board would be able to act with only two members instead of with three, which is what the quorum requirement for the board is."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1763.324,1764.326,I don't think so.
2009.08-1457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1774.196,1779.07,"Except -- may I just interrupt a bit, just on the ""except"" clause at the very bottom."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1805.155,1808.73,It is the same group of people that were--
2009.08-1457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.73,1813.18,But there is no such group exists at the time that that power is being exercised.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1813.18,1815.663,"--Well, Justice Stevens, the language is written in the past tense."
2009.08-1457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1819.442,1820.334,"No, it's not the past tense."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1822.6,1826.036,"""Of any group designated pursuant to. """
2009.08-1457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.566,1832.86,"But there is no group around at the time they're -- that this case is being decided, that was designated before."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1832.86,1838.904,"That group was designated on December 20, 2007, and that met the requirements of--"
2009.08-1457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1838.904,1841.139,But your -- your inquiry is focusing on what happens 2 years later.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1841.139,1848.01,"--And -- and with respect to 2 years later, I submit to you that that penultimate sentence in 153(b) is met."
2009.08-1457,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1851.648,1864.489,"Well, I don't know how you could write the sentence without the ""ed"" unless you want to say -- to make your point, if the statute had been written the other way, to any group continuously being designated."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1864.489,1874.312,"Sure, I think you could say something like constitute a -- that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group that continues to meet the requirements of the first sentence thereof, or something like that."
2009.08-1457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.312,1878.484,"To read -- you can read the language the way you want, that -- because of the vacancy clause."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1917.483,1918.138,Right.
2009.08-1457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1920.466,1923.995,"As long as there was another member, you could -- you could do it."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1925.887,1932.555,"--So the first thing to say about that argument, Justice Breyer, and it's one that Justice Scalia brought up to my friend before--"
2009.08-1457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.555,1933.023,Yes.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1933.023,1934.571,--it is a totally different argument.
2009.08-1457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1938.162,1938.272,Yes.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1938.272,1941.114,"And my friend admitted, it's a totally new, different argument."
2009.08-1457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1941.114,1941.239,Yes.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1941.239,1942.612,It's not in the question presented.
2009.08-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.447,1972.256,"Well, don't -- don't you think it is significant that the -- the vacancy clause that you were discussing -- where is it?"
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1989.094,1991.126,The -- the--
2009.08-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.126,1999.51,"Which -- which buttresses, it seems to me, the argument that when the group is no longer a group of three the delegation is no longer effective."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1999.51,2000.465,--I don't think so.
2009.08-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2007.102,2007.57,Of the board.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2007.57,2008.288,Of the board.
2009.08-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2008.993,2010.631,But it doesn't say that about the group.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2011.43,2018.769,"--Well, but by definition, Justice Scalia, the members that had been delegated this power on December 20th are members of the board."
2009.08-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2024.845,2025.157,No.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2034.122,2038.715,"--Well, I think it -- I don't know that there is a distinction."
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2048.554,2049.63,"So, counsel, if I--"
2009.08-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.63,2050.551,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2050.551,2051.646,"--No, go ahead; finish."
2009.08-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2051.646,2053.019,"The quorum for the group should be three, then."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2053.456,2060.44,"The quorum -- well, except that, Justice Scalia, it says -- it goes on to say that the quorum is actually two."
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2060.44,2068.84,"Let -- let's say the board delegates to a group the authority to act as the board until December 31st, 2010."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2083.021,2089.129,"Well, if -- if the initial delegation did give any and all of the powers to the--"
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2089.129,2091.94,All the powers of the board until December 31st.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2091.94,2096.409,"--And then -- then I take it, yes, they could exercise that delegation."
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2096.409,2105.499,So a delegee can delegate to itself the full authority of the -- the master in the master -- agent relationship?
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2105.499,2106.638,Under the statute.
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2118.492,2122.365,"No, no; they are just -- you know, they make the distinction that the board should continue to function."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2122.365,2122.77,--Yes.
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2122.77,2126.737,Even though their original delegation was limited to 2010--
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2126.737,2127.037,Right.
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2127.037,2131.953,"--they, acting as a board, get to delegate to themselves as the group the authority to go beyond that."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2131.953,2132.14,Right.
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2136.637,2146.865,"Now, what if the board, consisting of five members -- let's say three Democrats and two Republicans -- the three Democrats delegate to a group the authority to act as a board."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2160.518,2175.557,"I think that's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and it underscores that the statute itself can't control all of those problems and whether you set the quorum at three or two, even if you have a full board of five, you can have these machinations that are potentially--"
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2175.557,2183.774,Even though the whole -- even though the whole purpose of expanding from three to five was to ensure that more than two are required for the board to act?
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2183.774,2193.223,"--Well, I think that the purpose, as the legislative history reveals, and it's set out in our brief, was to increase efficiency and to have overlapping panels adjudicating cases."
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2209.718,2211.606,"Not trying to, but succeeding in doing so."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2211.606,2212.514,"Succeeding, absolutely."
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2213.06,2215.122,"Well, I mean, it depends upon who would remove them for cause."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2215.122,2215.543,--Absolutely.
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2215.543,2216.885,"Now, who would remove them?"
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2216.885,2218.23,It would be the president.
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2218.23,2220.964,"Well, what if he's perfectly content to have two Democrats?"
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2220.964,2223.807,And then you would have other -- you would have other checks as well.
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2243.0,2256.761,"I just want to make sure there is nothing to constrain -- if you have three Democrats, three -- or two Republicans or, of course, the other way around, nothing to constrain them from acting fully as the board with only two -- two Democrats?"
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2256.761,2258.633,--I don't think the statute itself constrains it--
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2258.633,2258.996,In the statute.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2258.996,2260.821,--under either my friend's reading or mine.
2009.08-1457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2269.287,2286.608,"Is there any other legal -- this is what -- one thing, if I were thinking without the language for a moment, and I -- the Taft-Hartley Congress did, I think, want to limit the powers in a number of ways of the board, maybe expand the membership to be sure there would be both parties in larger numbers."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2325.326,2329.043,"--I think -- I think, Justice Breyer, that the board traditionally doesn't engage in much rulemaking."
2009.08-1457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2330.045,2330.263,"No, no."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2333.34,2340.086,--And I do agree that -- that at stake here is the potential to decide cases.
2009.08-1457,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2385.881,2386.552,It begs the question--
2009.08-1457,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2386.552,2396.64,"Suppose -- suppose our first inquiry were agency law, and we concluded that under agency law when the principal ceases to exist the agent may no longer function."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2409.591,2411.993,"--Sir, they are set out at page 28 of our brief."
2009.08-1457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2433.081,2452.026,"Is your point that official acts done stay in effect even though the official is gone, until the official's successor in office is appointed and that successor can remand the instruction?"
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2452.026,2453.777,That's -- that's precisely correct.
2009.08-1457,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2453.777,2455.649,But that is like the de facto officer doctrine.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2463.505,2465.315,"Justice Kennedy, those -- that's a different--"
2009.08-1457,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2465.315,2467.799,But it seems to me that's quite a different -- different point.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2467.799,2468.095,--Absolutely.
2009.08-1457,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2490.213,2500.114,--But hasn't the situation that has prevailed now for some time changed the -- the decision-making process of the board in at least two important ways?
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2531.054,2540.143,"Justice Alito, I am not here suggesting that the two-member board is ideal or equivalent or optimal to a -- an optimal thing."
2009.08-1457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2553.042,2554.606,"Well, not only is the two-member board not -- not ideal."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2565.01,2576.662,"I do think that Congress had before it a well -- it was well-known that over 460 times the board had decided cases with only two members, with the third being vacant."
2009.08-1457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.816,2580.971,But that's always when there is -- there is in existence three people who could have served.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2589.311,2593.214,"--As opposed to shutting down the entire board, yes, Justice Stevens."
2009.08-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2594.104,2594.622,It depends.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2628.59,2636.246,"--Well, I think the politics in Armageddon could cut different ways, depending -- I mean, these are nomination battles that are focused on individual personalities."
2009.08-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2660.762,2676.24,"I'm much more impressed by -- by your opponent's assertion, which I don't think you have contradicted, that for many years whenever there was a death in one of the three-member panels, that panel was reconstituted."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2690.656,2695.558,"No, it suggests that they thought three was optimal, where it was -- where they could get three bodies."
2009.08-1457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2724.141,2725.873,How -- how has it -- how has it worked?
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2732.451,2741.758,"--I believe that there is 586 or so decisions that they have rendered, and of those they have set aside about approximately 70."
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2753.173,2755.672,What actually happens on -- on the ground?
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2770.152,2773.275,If -- if -- if the board is disabled?
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2773.275,2773.98,"Yes, assume there is no board."
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2776.804,2782.52,"Well, if there is -- if there is no board, then I take it the cases would get stuck after the ALJ."
2009.08-1457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2805.746,2829.424,"--And is it -- is it correct numerically that, in fact, under identical language except the word 1935 to 1947, there were two-member panels and they decided about 400 cases, and then they took the same language, and now since 1947, roughly, what are the figures?"
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2835.281,2840.389,"Well, the -- the board only went down to two members as a whole starting in 1993."
2009.08-1457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2849.246,2851.461,Is that when the 400 cases that you are talking about were?
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2851.461,2857.336,The 460 cases were between 1935 and 1947.
2009.08-1457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2857.336,2857.492,And 1947.

2009.08-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.87,2889.352,But they never did it when they had a full board?

2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2901.394,2901.8,--Absolutely.

2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2944.64,2945.736,--Precisely.

2009.08-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3068.508,3069.163,Of this year.
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3072.771,3074.912,There will.

2009.08-1457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3080.204,3080.472,Three?
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3080.472,3081.143,Yes.
2009.08-1457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3107.457,3110.423,And the recess appointment power doesn't work why?
2009.08-1457,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3110.423,3114.924,The -- the recess appointment power can work in -- in a recess.

2009.08-1457,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3189.83,3190.863,Excuse me.
2009.08-1457,2,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,3195.842,3196.469,--That's correct.
2009.08-1457,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3196.469,3197.577,Wouldn't the--
2009.08-1457,2,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,3197.577,3202.246,"Well, except to the extent, Justice Scalia, that the statute of limitations has not run on those unfair labor--"

2009.08-1457,2,41989,sheldon_e_richie,,3210.509,3210.992,That's an argument.
2009.08-1457,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3275.279,3276.671,"Except that it said ""except""."

Circuit was referring to was the ""except that"" language, and saying in that same sentence, where there is a requirement at all times of a three-member quorum of the board, that it is -- it defies logic that Congress would in that same sentence state except when there is three that falls to two."
