1975.75-5014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,19.448,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 75-5014, Doyle against Ohio and 5015 Wood against Ohio."
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,20.94,25.22,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-5014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,738.936,745.369,Do you think there is any inconsistency between the defendant’s silence at the time of arrest and his testimony of trial?
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,745.369,746.714,Do I see any inconsistency?
1975.75-5014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,746.714,747.271,Yes.
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,747.271,749.327,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I see none."
1975.75-5014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,766.061,776.96,"Assuming that the Court -- assuming the Court should disagree with you on the question whether there is inconsistency or not, would your position then fail? Please turn on the question whether or not there is inconsistency?"
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,776.96,791.058,"I would say so, in the line of Harris versus New York, the position taken by the Court there of course related to inconsistent statements, which were at variance with the later defense."
1975.75-5014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,802.515,808.686,"Well, there could ever be a case in which silence would be inconsistent with trial testimony?"
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,808.686,809.788,I would suppose so.
1975.75-5014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.759,922.194,There was inconsistency between silence at his later trial testimony.
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,922.194,926.355,"Inconsistency, but I do not accept that the premise that silence is necessarily –"
1975.75-5014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,926.355,931.018,"At the time of the arrest, the officer cannot really know what the man is going to testify to later."
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,933.943,938.893,"Well the Court said he must be warned in Miranda, and I am relying on that."
1975.75-5014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,939.267,941.896,Warning about your silence maybe used against you.
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,948.267,949.129,But I am not agreeing --
1975.75-5014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.129,951.233,"In that circumstance, so which would be permissible I suppose."
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,951.233,958.38,I admit that some of the decisions tend to suggest that this is the case.
1975.75-5014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1003.001,1016.374,"Your client is free and you are free to argue to the jury that no inference should be drawn or that it is such a debatable inference that he may, well has just been following his Miranda warning."
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1023.509,1034.278,"Well, I think this position, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that any defendant who does not testify goes against the grant."
1975.75-5014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1060.189,1061.926,Why do you say you are penalizing?
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1072.841,1081.705,"Well, I do not say he is being penalized but I think he properly subjects himself to a testimony that tends to prove him guilty when it is provided by others."
1975.75-5014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1111.079,1124.584,"Something as a premise, Mr. Willis, the idea that the silence is incriminating, you say that he is not obliged to answer because this tends to incriminate him?"
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1124.584,1133.239,"No, I am not saying that -- I am not necessarily saying that if I am then I am not -- what I am trying to say, I am not saying very well."
1975.75-5014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1183.944,1192.22,Do you mean he has a right to reserve totally any statement about his defense until he is in open court with his counsel?
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1192.22,1193.327,That is it.
1975.75-5014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1240.852,1252.473,Mr. Justice Jackson’s often quoted observation that if a lawyer has called in any lawyer worthy assault will tell his client to say nothing whatever.
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1296.797,1298.224,"Yes, and I --"
1975.75-5014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1298.224,1302.638,Either one is a ruling of law but an observation.
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1302.638,1303.787,This is the point I was going to make.
1975.75-5014,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1364.353,1377.147,Do you draw the distinction between instances that exist at the time of arrest when the Miranda warnings are given and those that exist at the preliminary hearing?
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1377.147,1377.746,Yes.
1975.75-5014,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1435.612,1437.996,"He took the stand, did he not?"
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1437.996,1440.5,"At the trial, yes."
1975.75-5014,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1440.5,1455.533,"The election not contested by or offer any explanation of his original silence, at the preliminary hearing it was a trial tactic as lawyers would perhaps say."
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1455.533,1464.251,"Well, I would not certainly call it Mr. Justice, a trial tactic although it probably results in being just that."
1975.75-5014,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1493.213,1499.378,"At one case, once you lose your emotions to suppress your dead pigeon anyhow so far as the grand jury is concerned."
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1499.378,1502.833,"In simple -- oh yeah, so far as the grand jury is concerned, yes."
1975.75-5014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.237,1506.559,Question on the facts.
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1510.679,1511.168,That is correct.
1975.75-5014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.168,1516.234,Was it part of the theory that the arresting officers were parties to the frame?
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1516.234,1518.179,Not precisely.
1975.75-5014,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1537.056,1537.271,Thank you.
1975.75-5014,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1537.271,1546.144,And we were concerned that he was trying to get these people to go penitentiary in his place.
1975.75-5014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1546.144,1547.855,Mr. Collins.
1975.75-5014,1,38939,ronald_l_collins,,1547.855,1552.512,Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.75-5014,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1552.512,1559.198,Is the State of Ohio so in progress that it can not afford to print briefs filed in the United States Supreme Court?
1975.75-5014,1,38939,ronald_l_collins,,1559.198,1560.675,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1975.75-5014,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1563.325,1582.283,"Not complied with the rule, my question is directed that to the fact that the Great State of Ohio comes to our Court with a that has not printed, whereas most people who do appear here manage to find the means to print their briefs and it just puzzles me."
1975.75-5014,1,38939,ronald_l_collins,,1582.283,1594.306,"Your Honor, I had expected that since the petitioners had come in here in the form of a popper that we could have replied in kind if we had chosen to do so."
1975.75-5014,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1594.306,1596.877,Is there a certain right to do it under the rules and I understand --
1975.75-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1596.877,1599.204,You did not make a (Inaudible).
1975.75-5014,1,38939,ronald_l_collins,,1599.204,1600.757,"Excuse me? [Laughing] Excuse me, no."
1975.75-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1600.757,1602.638,"I mean Ohio did not make a (Inaudible), oh yes."
1975.75-5014,1,38939,ronald_l_collins,,1602.638,1608.611,"No, Your Honor."
1975.75-5014,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1887.96,1896.677,(Inaudible) how the police facts relate to the legal constitutional claims presented to us?
1975.75-5014,1,38939,ronald_l_collins,,1896.677,1909.57,"Well, it is going to be the contention as I get to it in my argument of the state that in considering the question of consistency or inconsistency was the silence at the time of the arrest."
1975.75-5014,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1918.035,1931.222,Claimed not all silence – silence may not be used to impeach under all circumstances but under some circumstances and that this is one of the cases where it maybe so used.
1975.75-5014,1,38939,ronald_l_collins,,1931.222,1940.493,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.75-5014,2,33647,james_r_willis,,2822.998,2832.201,I would say that it is not inconsistent with innocence and I would like to correct any impression that I may have given.
1975.75-5014,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2961.356,2962.206,Thank you gentlemen.
