2004.03-1407,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,6.619,We'll hear argument in the case of Rousey against Jacoway.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,7.826,11.353,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,33.231,34.947,"That was a case I dissented in, wasn't it?"
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,34.947,39.444,"Yes, but actually, Justice Scalia, I think even you will find our case more appealing."
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,39.444,43.625,"Yes, but... but it is true you have a strong textual--"
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,43.625,45.808,We have an excellent textual argument.
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,45.808,48.734,--I was a little bit surprised at your opening because it seems to me you have a strong textual argument you're now defending.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,48.734,48.962,We do.
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,53.873,55.024,What does a holistic reading mean?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,56.034,56.913,--Absolutely.
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,56.913,57.599,--text and still be holistic?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,57.599,58.573,I'm not going to look outside the text at all.
2004.03-1407,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,65.998,66.626,What does the word holistic mean?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,67.389,78.615,--I think it means read all the words in the sense that makes the most sense to you rather than plucking words at random or rather than looking at a word artificially.
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,90.386,93.08,So the antonym would be parsimonious or something like that?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,93.08,95.455,"I think it'd be partial, but I'm not sure."
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,95.455,96.315,"Well, let... let me ask--"
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,96.315,96.735,Sure.
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,96.735,97.529,--ask you this.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,117.849,126.676,"Yes, and I think payments are triggered by age because section 522(d)(10)(e) is a statute eminently about the protection in bankruptcy of retirement payments."
2004.03-1407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.116,137.525,"Well, the problem for the court below was that the person covered can ask for it in a lump sum and pay a penalty."
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,137.525,139.501,"Right, and that's not--"
2004.03-1407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,139.501,142.252,And... and that isn't then on the basis of age.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,146.956,148.621,"--Yes, that's the problem the court had below."
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,168.842,175.27,"Well, when you say full enjoyment, you... you think when... when I'm taxed on something, I... I don't have full enjoyment of it?"
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,188.681,194.574,"--That's correct, but the 10 percent tax here is designed and does, in fact, operate as a deterrent and a penalty."
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,194.574,208.035,"Well, I'm sure it does, but... but it's... it's hard to accept the notion that simply because after a certain age I get a tax benefit, I'm receiving the money on account of my age."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,209.278,215.286,"Well, Justice Scalia, the way that I would view that is prior to 59 and a half, you pay a penalty."
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,236.686,254.243,"Ms. Karlan, the... as long as this money was in the plan, it was shielded from bankruptcy, and there are... there was not unlimited access even with the penalty when it was in the plan."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,274.169,282.008,--Northrop Grumman's policy is to require individuals who leave the company's employment to roll their pension plans into an IRA.
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,297.183,297.988,Another employer's plan.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,297.988,298.483,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,298.483,301.425,But they could not have kept it in this employer's plan?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,301.425,301.795,No.
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,308.597,313.502,That was a term of the plan that it... you can remain in it only so long as you're employed?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,313.502,314.364,Apparently so.
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,314.364,331.815,Are there any other plans that are... are entities clearly covered by the statute in which the only effect of age is to enable you to avoid a tax?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,331.815,333.286,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.286,333.794,All right.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,334.304,335.309,Let me give you a couple--
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,335.309,335.729,--then you might persuade me.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,335.729,337.174,--Let me give you a couple of examples--
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,337.174,337.402,Okay.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,337.402,339.486,--that I think will be quite familiar.
2004.03-1407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,384.908,385.098,Yes.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,396.867,398.013,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2004.03-1407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,398.013,398.201,Yes.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,411.039,411.277,"Yes, that's correct."
2004.03-1407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,415.247,416.26,"--Oh, it's the Eighth Circuit."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,416.874,417.449,Yes.
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,421.339,423.222,It... it might be wrong anyway.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,424.123,424.95,"Yes, yes."
2004.03-1407,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,424.95,434.304,What is the percentage amount of the payments that are taken out of all IRA plans before people are 59 and a half?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,434.304,448.634,"Well, in the Cilek case from the Seventh Circuit, which is cited in our brief, the court there cited statistics that suggested it was between 1.2 and 1.7 percent of funds in IRA's were removed early under the penalty process."
2004.03-1407,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,448.634,452.844,And the... the payment here... it says... the statute uses the word payment.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,459.335,465.113,"It would be because it's the right to the future payments and not just the present payments, Justice Breyer."
2004.03-1407,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,465.113,487.194,"So... so... but I'm trying... what I'm trying to figure out is if a person were to take... just reading it in English, it sounds as if a person were to take the plan out before he's 59 and a half and pay the penalty, that that amount that he took out would not be a... a payment because of age, but one that he took out after he's 59 and a half and didn't pay the penalty would be."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,487.194,488.94,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
2004.03-1407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,511.849,526.709,"Ms. Karlan, let me ask something about that very point because the statute says that to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor it's allowable."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,526.709,528.521,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-1407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.521,533.998,"Are you aware of cases where the bankruptcy court has said, well, you don't need all that money?"
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,538.584,540.091,"Absolutely, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,554.777,556.32,Can we take this concrete case?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,562.025,562.367,--Yes.
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,562.367,571.434,"What was the claim here as to... was part or all of that... it would be some $54,000."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,571.434,573.875,The claim was all that all of that was necessary.
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,608.919,612.4,"--What... what do the courts do if they say, well, my client might be ill or something like that?"
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,613.207,615.042,"--Well, if the client is ill now, they get to keep it--"
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,615.042,615.316,"--No, no."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,621.183,628.46,--There isn't a reported case that talks about the possibility of future illness as a reason of exempting the money.
2004.03-1407,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,628.46,632.441,It's... I'm trying to figure out how... how... what the theory is.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,675.827,681.905,"I would say at the 1 percent and 80 percent of the people are taking the money out, it wouldn't operate really as a retirement plan anymore."
2004.03-1407,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,694.77,695.345,What percent?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,695.345,697.44,18 percent in one of the surveys.
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,702.117,703.386,"Well, they're taking out loans against it."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,705.056,715.207,"--Well, but the loans because... for example, in the Federal thrift savings plan, the interest is being paid back into your own account, it's essentially as close to taking out the money as you can get."
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,715.207,719.449,I still don't have your answer to the problem that bothered me at the first.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,733.126,738.542,It... it's not the... if you look at the statute... and let me just work my way through it with you.
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,755.701,759.778,So you say that payment doesn't... on account of doesn't modify payment.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,759.778,764.444,"I don't... I don't think you need to read it that way, and I think the most sensible reading here, especially given that the statute--"
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,764.444,767.585,"Well, I... I think the logical reading is that it... it modifies payment."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,767.585,771.349,"--Well, I... I'm not sure that it does, but even if it did, Your Honor--"
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.349,772.282,It's too holistic for me.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,779.425,784.089,"--Well, this is again... I know you dissented yesterday, but this is a less than meticulously crafted statute."
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.089,784.404,No.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,786.409,787.32,Okay.
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,787.32,787.791,But--
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,787.791,788.229,Well--
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,788.229,789.931,--but what does on account of modify?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,789.931,795.546,--I think what on account of modifies here is the kind of plan out of which the payment is coming.
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.546,797.501,Where... where is that noun?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,797.501,801.399,"There are a variety of plans, stock bonus, pension--"
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.399,805.004,"The right to receive a payment under a stock bonus, pension--"
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,805.004,805.244,--Yes.
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,805.244,808.202,"--profit sharing, annuity, or similar plan or... or contract."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,810.93,811.145,Plans--
2004.03-1407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,811.145,813.561,Why... why isn't it a right on account of?
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.561,814.806,It's the right on account of.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,814.806,817.546,"--Well, I think you can read it either way and you'll get to exactly the same result."
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,834.512,837.087,"Yes, but... but there still is a right to take payments at any time."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,837.087,839.953,"Justice... Justice Kennedy, we don't believe--"
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,839.953,840.507,So... so then you're... you're--
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,840.507,841.189,--that that's actually a right.
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,841.189,844.069,"--Under that, you're giving the... the language that follows it no meaning."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,844.069,859.934,"No, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's what I'm doing here, and the reason I don't think that's what I'm doing is because this statute clearly refers to IRA's by name as one of the plans that's entitled to exemption."
2004.03-1407,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,859.934,864.912,"But as purely English... as purely English, I read it as saying it's a right."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,886.252,887.434,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,887.434,892.988,It's a kind that gives you a right to take it with a penalty and a right to take it because of age without a penalty.
2004.03-1407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,899.819,902.66,"But under Justice Breyer's hypothetical, that's just like a savings account."
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,902.66,903.11,Yes.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,903.11,903.62,No.
2004.03-1407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,903.62,908.431,"No, because the savings account doesn't have... I mean, the savings account doesn't have the... the penalty."
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.552,923.879,That's your strong point.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,923.879,924.252,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.589,928.141,Right.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,932.223,932.994,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.524,940.884,Right.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,940.884,942.48,And I think no matter how--
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,942.48,942.895,That's a good argument.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,943.429,944.192,--Thank you.
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,956.24,960.571,Why didn't Congress just put in IRA's along with the other things?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,960.571,962.422,"--They did, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,964.97,967.331,"Yes, but that's sort of an oblique way to get it there."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,971.008,982.188,"Well, my best guess as to why they didn't do that is they started drafting the exemptions statute in 1973 and they enacted IRA's in 1974, so they stuck it in at the end of the list."
2004.03-1407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,983.363,983.732,What--
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.732,1000.561,What your... what your opponents say is that the... the thing at the end doesn't prove anything because they're willing to acknowledge that some IRA's can be so structured that you cannot withdraw until... until you reach a certain age.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1008.628,1021.898,"Well, what's wrong with that, Justice Scalia, is that all IRA's are designed and they're administered on forms that the Internal Revenue Service sets out and you buy the forms to allow for early withdrawal."
2004.03-1407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1029.55,1030.49,--Well--
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1030.49,1036.398,--that had that inability to take the money out subject to penalty prior to the age 59 and a half.
2004.03-1407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1036.398,1037.172,--Do... do we know that?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1077.774,1081.445,I don't necessarily think so for the following reason.
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1141.221,1141.761,And some don't.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1144.271,1150.598,"That's correct, but only four States offer no protection to IRA's from creditors the other--"
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1150.598,1152.177,As opposed to how many who do?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1152.177,1154.496,--46 States offer some kind of protection.
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1166.196,1168.221,"Well, that's what... with the purpose that we're talking about now--"
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1168.221,1168.459,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1168.459,1173.775,"--if it's only 6 that, faced with a bankruptcy, would shelter the IRA."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1173.775,1174.92,No.
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1212.418,1215.783,But here there was no choice of picking up on the State?
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1215.783,1237.9,"There's a... there's a weird anomaly in Arkansas, Your Honor, which is Arkansas law does, in fact, protect IRA's, but the Federal bankruptcy courts in Arkansas have interpreted that law only to protect the IRA up to $500 because of a provision in the Arkansas constitution, article 9, section 2, that means that you can only save up to $500."
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1247.004,1250.288,And one train that we didn't finish before.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1263.87,1264.506,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1272.751,1274.603,"But you... that was your claim, and I--"
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1274.603,1275.277,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1275.277,1282.058,"--How did you come to that conclusion, that the entire amount?"
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1282.058,1295.216,"Well, if you take, say, $55,000 and you ask what sort of annuity could you purchase when you hit age 59 and a half with that money, it will be an annuity that, I would guess... you know, I... I hate to do math in my head like this."
2004.03-1407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1307.409,1308.336,"Oh, yes."
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1308.336,1316.439,"--is Social Security and a $2,000 a month defined benefit plan that will never go up and against which their Social Security will be offset."
2004.03-1407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1331.978,1343.36,"May I go back and just nail down one lose end in... in an answer that you... you gave to my question, can you set up a kind of irrevocable?"
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1356.778,1358.371,"I was unable to find one, Your Honor."
2004.03-1407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1358.371,1358.912,Okay.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1358.912,1360.316,I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1360.316,1362.297,"Why didn't the Government come in here, just as a matter of curiosity?"
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1364.869,1367.064,"I... no, we do not have one, and I don't--"
2004.03-1407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.064,1368.353,The Government has no position on the matter.
2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1368.353,1370.594,"--Well, I... I don't think they've taken a position here."

2004.03-1407,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1383.067,1383.46,"Well... well, that's correct."
2004.03-1407,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.265,1394.017,Ms. McKiever.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1394.017,1396.764,"Justice Stevens, may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.696,1438.246,Is it... is it the case that other plans that are clearly covered by the text of this statute also permit early withdrawal for certain reasons?
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1438.246,1440.741,"Yes and no, and let me explain that."
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.549,1458.57,Not a single one of them.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1458.57,1459.413,Not a single one of them.
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1472.787,1476.3,"And you'd say that if one of them did, it would also not be covered."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1476.3,1477.312,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1478.639,1480.162,What... what--
2004.03-1407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1480.162,1501.374,"I take it... in... in answering Justice Scalia, I take it from what you didn't say that none of the... we'll call them kind of the paradigm example plans are, however, as... as restricted as the language in this... the statute would suggest that it had to be if you read it in a... in a very literal way."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1501.374,1503.449,--There are--
2004.03-1407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1503.449,1511.521,"In other words, they're all a little bit sinful, at least, even if they're not as sinful as... as you say the... the 401... the... the IRA is."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1511.521,1513.889,--That... that is correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1528.581,1529.905,"--Now, why?"
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1598.686,1605.466,This is different because this is the only kind of plan where you can access the funds at any time for any purpose.
2004.03-1407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1606.439,1608.664,"I know that, but... but... and you do it with a penalty."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1610.076,1610.395,--That's correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1610.395,1621.415,"But I want to know why that difference makes a difference in a world where only 1 or less 2 percent of the people do access it before they're 60, 59 and a half."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1621.415,1631.869,"Because the right to... to receive the payment, the right to access the money at any time exists no matter if it is exercised or not, and it does not meet the language of the statute."
2004.03-1407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1633.495,1633.835,"No, no."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1639.27,1639.811,--I'm sorry.
2004.03-1407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1640.236,1655.007,"My question is we all agree that there can be plans where you can get the money not having to do with age, and they fall within the language of the act, and indeed, you say some are covered."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1662.487,1670.435,Because there is no causal connection between any of the factors that are enumerated in the statute and the right to receive the money.
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.176,1672.181,I--
2004.03-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1672.181,1673.556,May I ask this question?
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1682.867,1684.764,"--Absolutely, yes, it would."
2004.03-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1684.764,1686.249,"Now, what if there were a 50 percent penalty?"
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1686.249,1692.244,"Clearly, there's a point at which it would qualify as a prohibition more than just--"
2004.03-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.244,1693.915,And what is it that makes it a prohibition?
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1705.365,1714.525,"--The reason for drawing the line is because at 10 percent, as the Eighth Circuit has stated in... in the Huebner case, it... it said that it's a minimal penalty."
2004.03-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1718.401,1720.759,But what is the purpose of imposing any penalty at all?
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1720.759,1728.635,"I would assume as a disincentive to... to withdraw, but it's clearly not a prohibition, such as the... the parking--"
2004.03-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1728.635,1732.191,But 50 percent would not be a prohibition and neither would 90 percent.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1732.191,1737.227,"--It would not be a prohibition, but it would operate more as a prohibition than 10 percent."
2004.03-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1737.227,1739.347,So it's a matter of degree rather than a difference in kind.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1739.347,1741.806,Clearly that... it's a very difficult line to draw.
2004.03-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1747.819,1751.685,It seems to me the easiest black letter rule is no tax or some tax.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1766.875,1775.616,--But the... the hallmark difference here is that it... it is the only type of account that you can access paying the penalty for any reason--
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.616,1776.11,--I assume--
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1776.11,1777.095,--regardless of the specified reason.
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1777.095,1807.127,"--that... that your answer to Justice Breyer as to why that makes a difference with regard to the purpose of the statute is that the purpose of the statute is to make sure that people have money for their retirement, and that if you can withdraw it for any reason whatever, there is no security that that money will be there for their retirement; whereas if you limit the reasons to sickness and... and a certain other number of emergency reasons, the chances the money will be there for the retirement are much higher."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1807.127,1808.032,"Well, that... that's--"
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1808.032,1808.492,Isn't that the answer?
2004.03-1407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1808.492,1810.343,"But if that's the answer, excellent."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1811.782,1813.768,"--Thank you, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-1407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1813.768,1819.799,--Let's try... let's try a million percent tax and nobody in history has ever withdrawn the money.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1822.687,1824.615,Yes.
2004.03-1407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1824.615,1824.991,"Fine, yes."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1824.991,1825.171,Yes.
2004.03-1407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1825.171,1825.624,Okay.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1853.196,1872.306,"Because clearly the... the access of money and the ability to use it prior to retirement, just as... as Justice Scalia just stated, that allows the... the debtors to... to access freely for any purpose, clearly not showing that... that it would be for retirement purposes."
2004.03-1407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1872.306,1872.681,But attachment of the--
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.681,1873.13,"All right, but it's acquired."
2004.03-1407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1877.852,1879.167,93.
2004.03-1407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1879.167,1895.462,"--If... if that is going to be your criterion, the... the total freedom for any purpose, then why, if we accept your argument, why... why don't we face sort of a daunting run or the courts face sort of daunting future?"
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1944.369,1946.385,Not necessarily.
2004.03-1407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1962.29,1977.552,"Well, but typically these plans like 401(k) plans permit hardship withdrawals, and other plans that are mentioned in the act allow withdrawals for medical reasons or to buy housing or something like that."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1988.63,1989.481,Well--
2004.03-1407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1989.481,1995.13,And every plan that I know of allows withdrawal if you terminate employment.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,1995.13,1996.433,--And that's typically--
2004.03-1407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1996.433,1997.795,"In fact, that's what happened to these people."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2003.47,2018.03,"--Well, the... the ability to access the funds, oftentimes with termination, has to do with the length of service, the years in service because they accumulate and oftentimes are not payable at the full percentage."
2004.03-1407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2034.513,2053.646,Isn't it simpler to just recognize that these plans are covered despite the right to withdraw and then rely on the provision in the statute that only permits the deduction to the extent reasonably necessary for the support?
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2060.647,2072.192,"--I understand that... that may appear to be correct, but the problem with that is that as... taxpayer status is not the hallmark in this case of if it is or is not exempt."
2004.03-1407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2095.411,2095.619,No.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2107.018,2107.794,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2107.794,2121.206,And it includes IRA's apparently because of the last provision in the statute referring back to individual retirement acts under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2121.206,2127.34,The section 408 reference is... does not in any way expand the exemption.
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.479,2157.889,Ms.... Ms. Karlan says she doesn't know of any... of any IRA that did place a... a restriction which would bring it within that exemption even though the ordinary IRA wouldn't be within the exemption.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2164.441,2165.777,--Absolutely.
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2169.2,2172.084,"They can, but do... do you know that there's... there's one out there?"
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2172.727,2174.554,--I... I do know of several out there.
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.554,2176.422,"--You didn't just draw one up for this case, did you?"
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2176.643,2178.173,I did not create one for this case.
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.146,2211.593,Was that... was that an IRA that she had?
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2212.498,2219.339,"My understanding is, yes, it was under section 408(b) was... that's my understanding based upon that case."
2004.03-1407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2219.339,2220.928,Let me... let me ask you.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2236.104,2240.357,"I... I do not know if that one specifically was, but no."
2004.03-1407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2243.576,2245.428,But why... why would anyone do that?
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2253.257,2257.058,--Clearly to protect the money potentially for retirement and... and just as--
2004.03-1407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2257.058,2259.783,"In other words, like setting up a personal spendthrift trust?"
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2259.783,2260.65,--That's--
2004.03-1407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2260.65,2263.608,I... I want to make it tough so that I... I will not be tempted to withdraw.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2264.636,2273.527,"--Well, that would potentially be a motivation because clearly the money is there readily accessible at any time to... to buy anything that the debtor chooses throughout their life."
2004.03-1407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.438,2285.33,"Should we put any weight on the title, on the name?"
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2306.729,2310.623,"--Well, the... the name is clearly not determinative."
2004.03-1407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.972,2327.186,"I'm reading the statute and if I were voting on it and put in the 408 reference and think of the word individual retirement account, is there any... I would have thought, knowing not that much about it, that of course, they'd be included."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2339.745,2340.543,--Yes.
2004.03-1407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2361.92,2364.561,"Well, are they?"
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2391.735,2395.385,That's a misnomer that that's a... a right to payment.
2004.03-1407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2421.883,2423.865,What... what if they don't repay it?
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2424.675,2426.945,There is a 10 percent penalty.
2004.03-1407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2429.15,2434.231,But what... where... where would the... where would the principal repayment come from?
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2439.369,2441.185,--That would be correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2441.185,2461.342,"I mean, we call it... the... the loan feature then boils down to a... a withdrawal subject to a periodic repayment obligation, but if that obligation is not satisfied, the bottom line will be exactly like a withdrawal because they will simply deduct whatever the balance is from the person's rights under the plan."
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.342,2463.115,Plus 10 percent you say.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2463.115,2464.142,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.818,2465.927,So it's just... just like an IRA.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2465.927,2470.067,"--But... but this is in the bankruptcy context, which makes it completely different."
2004.03-1407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2544.277,2547.415,Subject to the 10 percent if the bankruptcy trustee does that?
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2547.415,2548.515,--That's correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2549.56,2555.26,"The... the penalty still has to be paid even if it's the trustee who takes money out to pay the creditors, on your view."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2555.26,2555.941,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2593.83,2602.336,"But there... there is no penalty attached to withdrawing from a savings account, and there's also no limit on the annual contribution."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2602.336,2604.289,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2609.148,2615.531,Let me just get... get straight what... what the... what the universe of plans we have in front of us here.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2630.751,2633.147,--That's correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.21,2640.837,Would permit withdrawal for any reason whatever provided that a penalty is paid.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2640.837,2641.404,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2641.404,2642.627,None of them is like that.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2642.627,2643.708,None of them is like that.
2004.03-1407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2668.636,2680.553,"Do... do you disagree with Ms. Karlan that this is... this is a standardized product so the people, the Rouseys of this world, really couldn't get a tailor-made IRA?"
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2683.492,2686.052,--That's not... that's not correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2736.147,2745.808,These... these other plans that allow you to withdraw for certain reasons but not for any reason... what happens if you withdraw for any reason?
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2745.808,2748.467,That--
2004.03-1407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2748.467,2751.494,"What is the sanction against... I mean, you just go in."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2758.432,2765.974,"--My understanding is that... is that you cannot access the funds for a reason not allowed by those plans, that that is prohibited."
2004.03-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2823.333,2827.914,"Well, but the right to receive 100 percent is... is dependent on a factor, isn't it?"
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2827.914,2830.817,"Yes, it is."
2004.03-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2830.817,2830.995,Yes.
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2837.049,2838.209,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2862.399,2877.568,"You don't dispute that... that a very small percentage of people who have IRA's, in fact, exercise the right to withdraw, given the penalty."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2877.568,2882.195,That... that... that is... appears to be correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2960.74,2970.21,"Of course, the words, on account of, in this... this statute are sort of unusual, no matter how you construe them, because really the payment is on account of the years of service or it's on account of a lot of things."
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,2985.79,2987.08,That's correct.
2004.03-1407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3030.81,3039.067,Does your argument draw a ring around IRA's?
2004.03-1407,1,19651,colli_c_mckiever,,3047.357,3053.305,Only to the extent that... that they are not payable for any of the reasons enumerated in the statute.
2004.03-1407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3159.253,3160.985,"Thank you, Ms. McKiever."
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3165.611,3167.446,I'm going to retire early.
2004.03-1407,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3205.634,3207.561,You don't really have a right to receive it on account of age.
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3210.3,3211.385,"--Well, at the age of--"
2004.03-1407,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3211.385,3214.335,It isn't the right to receive the money that depends on your age.
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3216.617,3221.746,"--Well, that's a right that's very important because let me give you just a mathematical example of the difference."
2004.03-1407,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3221.746,3224.071,"It is a right that's important, but it's not what the statute says."
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3224.777,3225.577,The statute gives that right.
2004.03-1407,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3225.577,3228.344,"--the right to receive a payment on account of, among other things, age."
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3228.344,3229.467,And you do have that right.
2004.03-1407,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3245.347,3251.724,"No, but it lists the other reasons: on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service."
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3264.017,3266.313,"--That might be your first thought, but then--"
2004.03-1407,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3266.313,3269.743,--Or... or at least... at least some other reason that isn't closely related to those.
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3269.743,3293.702,"--Oh, but I think even if that were your first thought, you would then get to the implication that many of the Justices have been pressing today, which is the implication of that for all plans is tremendous because all plans give... well, I shouldn't say all plans, but I should say the vast majority of other plans, 401(k) plans, profit-sharing plans, and the like, do give you early access to your money, and that's valuable to you."
2004.03-1407,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3295.149,3298.931,Is it true that none of them give unfettered access?
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3302.093,3317.301,"--Well, the qualification of hardship has been interpreted by many employers to say, you want to buy a house and you can't otherwise?"
2004.03-1407,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3324.485,3324.667,"Well, yes."
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3329.65,3330.786,--I think that's--
2004.03-1407,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3330.786,3332.334,I don't even have to lie about the hardship.
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3333.35,3334.912,--I need the money.
2004.03-1407,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3351.111,3356.951,"In any of these other plans, can you get the money so long as you're willing to pay a penalty?"
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3356.951,3358.528,--As I read the New York City--
2004.03-1407,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3358.528,3361.776,"Without any qualification for disability, illness."
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3367.336,3372.695,"--I don't know, but the New York City Police Department plan appears to work like that."
2004.03-1407,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3375.956,3387.134,"Has any judge ever taken the view that... adopting Justice Scalia's approach, that while you can't put the whole IRA... exempt the whole IRA, but you can exempt 10 percent of it?"
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3387.134,3389.206,Not to my knowledge.
2004.03-1407,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3389.206,3392.099,"At least you ought to get that much, it seems to me, under his... his analysis."
2004.03-1407,2,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,3392.099,3397.29,"We'd be happier with 10 percent than nothing, but no judge has ever read the statute that way."
2004.03-1407,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3493.47,3495.796,Thank you.
