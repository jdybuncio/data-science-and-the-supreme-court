2012.12-52,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.62,"We will have argument next in Case 12-52, Dan's City Used Cars v. Pelkey."
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,8.853,12.323,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-52,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,64.752,70.795,"Mr. Bouffard, this law, this New Hampshire law, it regulates storage."
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,99.162,103.645,"Justice Ginsburg, this law regulates abandoned motor vehicles."
2012.12-52,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,105.813,107.689,So -- so it would apply to a garage operator.
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,107.689,114.576,"Well, if a garage operator came into possession of an abandoned motor vehicle, then I suppose it would."
2012.12-52,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,121.622,133.383,"Yes, but what made it abandoned was that they tried to locate the owner, couldn't and so -- this same thing could happen with a garage owner as happened to the towing truck."
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,141.926,146.266,"Well, let me be clear about this statute, Your Honor."
2012.12-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,232.025,234.04,What's -- what's your point?
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,238.057,252.847,"The reason -- the reason why these claims are preempted, Your Honor, is because they all stem from the towing of the vehicle, which was followed by the storage of the vehicle."
2012.12-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,252.847,259.889,"I mean, I guess you could have thousands of claims across the country, millions of claims where there are all kinds of towing laws."
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,275.258,277.477,"Well, I think that's a different--"
2012.12-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,277.477,279.193,And are all those things preempted?
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,280.319,281.333,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2012.12-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,282.211,286.161,Then what's the difference between this and -- and what could arise any day of the week?
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,311.415,318.836,"--There's no -- there's no claim in this case, Your Honor, that the abandoned motor vehicle law is preempted, that New Hampshire's abandoned motor vehicle law--"
2012.12-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,318.836,331.001,"Well, all right, there isn't in this case, but I'm curious to know how it works, because it seemed to me from what you're arguing, all the abandoned motor vehicle laws and all the snow emergency towing and everything else that I see every day would be preempted a fortiori."
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,332.269,357.288,"--We are arguing that the causes of action that were pled in this case, which are a Consumer Protection Act claim for damages and attorneys' fees, treble damages actually in the Consumer Protection Act claim, that claim is predicated on the consumer protection law, it's predicated on the State of New Hampshire's policy protecting consumers."
2012.12-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,390.914,393.491,My question is -- is the same as Justice Breyer's.
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,412.563,427.682,"Well, there's a difference, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, between whether the case is predicated on the New Hampshire towing law and whether or not these causes of action are related to the towing of the vehicle."
2012.12-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.646,439.147,--Suppose -- I understand.
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,472.258,475.381,"That's a very different set of circumstances, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.381,478.006,Why is that different from normal consumer protection law?
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,479.925,485.126,"Well, this -- this case involves a nonconsensual tow."
2012.12-52,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,497.011,498.372,What difference does that make?
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,515.288,516.411,"--No, we wouldn't--"
2012.12-52,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,516.411,517.862,The State can't regulate that?
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,517.862,522.035,"--I -- I think the State could regulate that, Your Honor."
2012.12-52,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,531.14,532.06,All right.
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,536.092,539.2,--A--
2012.12-52,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,539.2,544.839,"Lawfully towed, sold for parts within 24 hours because it wasn't picked up."
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,544.839,552.505,"--I think -- I think a private plaintiff could -- could probably assert that, that negligence claim."
2012.12-52,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,552.505,562.298,"Well, if that's -- if that is not related to payment for services, then why is this -- why is there such a relationship here?"
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,562.298,565.124,"That situation doesn't involve a payment dispute, Your Honor."
2012.12-52,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,571.2,573.762,It would involve a payment dispute to the same extent as this.
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,581.15,588.069,"--Well, that -- that's not a payment dispute."
2012.12-52,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,612.842,613.747,When?
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,652.794,656.964,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, we don't agree with that."
2012.12-52,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,659.086,662.506,"At what point did Pelkey say, I won't pay for the towing?"
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,662.506,677.691,"There -- there's a letter in the record of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, Your Honor, it's -- I believe it's at page 86 and 87 of the record in the New Hampshire Supreme Court, which is a letter from Mr. Shaughnessy, counsel for Mr. Pelkey, to my client."
2012.12-52,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,714.908,717.673,Not payment over towing; payment over storage.
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,717.673,723.733,--He -- he offered in this letter to pay the towing fees only.
2012.12-52,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,735.338,742.629,"If this was a consensual contract, he asked -- Justice Scalia's question."
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,753.283,761.515,The -- any breach of contract claim that might arise on behalf of the plaintiff would not be preempted.
2012.12-52,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,763.48,768.651,"How about, do consumer fraud laws apply to that contract between the parties?"
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,768.651,772.227,The consumer fraud law might--
2012.12-52,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,772.227,773.51,That's the basis of his claim here.
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,773.51,777.57,"--It might apply as a matter of State law, but it would be preempted."
2012.12-52,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,777.57,780.381,"Ah, so you're arguing that those laws would be preempted."
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,780.381,786.363,It would be preempted to the extent that it's a -- the case involves a dispute over payment for the services.
2012.12-52,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,789.018,795.577,"That gets back to whether the services include storage, which is what the New Hampshire court said it doesn't."
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,795.577,797.625,--The New Hampshire--
2012.12-52,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,797.625,802.873,That the movement of property or towing doesn't include services for storage.
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,802.873,812.01,"--That's what the New Hampshire Supreme Court said, relying on the minority view that's come out of the Ninth Circuit in the Charas decision."
2012.12-52,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,812.01,813.945,So why don't you answer that question?
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,826.625,840.152,"I think -- Justice Sotomayor, I think you are referring to the argument that's been made by my friends with regard to the final phrase in the statute with respect to transportation--"
2012.12-52,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,840.152,841.307,Exactly.
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,841.307,858.051,"--And the short answer to that question is that the term “ transportation ” is a defined term in Title 49, and it's defined very broadly for -- for good reason, because that term is used throughout Title 49."
2012.12-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,870.28,873.888,"It -- it includes storage, is the point you are coming to, right?"
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,873.888,874.483,--That's correct.
2012.12-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,874.483,875.903,The definition includes storage.
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,935.426,937.536,"No, that's not what I'm saying, Your Honor."
2012.12-52,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1002.708,1013.767,"Let's say you park your tow trucks on somebody else's parking lot, and you don't pay the rent."
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,1021.375,1031.027,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because I don't think that that scenario would fall within what Congress intended by the term “ services ” there."
2012.12-52,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1127.673,1137.437,"How does -- so if your tow truck is involved in an accident, is that -- and a suit is filed for negligence."
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,1138.607,1140.357,"I don't think that's preempted, Your Honor."
2012.12-52,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1161.536,1164.223,I'm just looking at the statutory language.
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,1189.429,1212.546,"Well, literally, I think you're -- you're right, Your Honor, that -- that the scenario you describe could fall within the literal language of the statute, but the Court has said that we can't go -- we can't necessarily go to the literal end of the earth in the reading of the statute, and we have to -- we have to limit this in some fashion."
2012.12-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.779,1225.694,"Well, let me tell you how we -- it seems to me we've limited it in -- in the Columbus case, Columbus v. Harrah's Garage and Wrecker Services, Inc. We said that,"
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,1263.242,1264.678,--Well--
2012.12-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1264.678,1271.926,"So you want us to eat those words, they were wrong, or -- or somehow you don't come within them?"
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,1271.926,1276.345,"--Respectfully, Justice Scalia, I think those words came from your dissent in that case."
2012.12-52,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1276.345,1288.449,Ah.
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,1289.292,1291.635,"No, no."
2012.12-52,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1406.635,1412.836,"No, there's a lot of language in the majority pretty much along the line that Justice Scalia said."
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,1467.764,1480.648,"Well, Justice Breyer, let me just say, first of all, that -- that consumer protection is -- is -- I'm not sure I would concede that consumer protection is -- is an area of traditional State regulation."
2012.12-52,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1497.611,1502.376,"That's your problem, which is, what is it directed to?"
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,1517.307,1521.912,"--That is what the New Hampshire Supreme Court said, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-52,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1533.533,1544.624,"But why should the tow operation be treated any different from the garage when they're doing the identical thing, that is, storing and then selling the vehicle?"
2012.12-52,0,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,1544.624,1556.103,"--Well, if a -- if a person has brought their vehicle into a garage, Justice Ginsburg, there's been no transportation by a motor carrier."
2012.12-52,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1607.316,1608.206,Yes.
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,1616.484,1620.138,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-52,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1675.644,1677.332,What about the price of the storage?
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,1678.471,1681.345,--We are not challenging the price of the storage.
2012.12-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1744.1,1750.944,But it seems to me that you can't ignore the fact that part of what tow trucks do is store things.
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,1765.796,1767.481,"Well, we would say--"
2012.12-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1767.481,1769.825,It's not just like -- it's not just like storing anything else.
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,1769.825,1775.807,"--Well, respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice, we would say that storage is a separate service altogether."
2012.12-52,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1843.748,1848.98,"Suppose, Mr. Shaughnessy, that the New Hampshire laws were more onerous than they are."
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,1868.568,1870.018,Yes.
2012.12-52,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1908.467,1913.919,"How do we draw the line, that line that you just asked us to draw between direct and indirect?"
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,1915.998,1917.792,--The direct--
2012.12-52,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1917.792,1920.728,Because now you're -- now you're articulating a different line.
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,1933.85,1934.443,--Correct.
2012.12-52,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.682,1973.193,You've just told us anything that significantly affects the transportation service is covered.
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,2001.401,2006.49,"Well, it may impinge upon his ability or impinge upon how much he can collect."
2012.12-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2023.875,2028.53,"Well, it isn't too -- I mean, this is a provision of course in the Federal Aviation Administration Act."
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,2059.437,2066.218,"--There is an effect there, and I do believe that this Court started drawing that line actually in the Travelers case."
2012.12-52,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2125.631,2126.255,All right.
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,2208.922,2217.419,"Well, believe -- I believe with respect to RSA 262, which is the statute that is in this case, it doesn't require a tow truck company to do anything."
2012.12-52,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2217.419,2222.653,"No, you -- you can just rest on that, but I'm going to have -- or somebody's going to have to write an opinion."
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,2249.406,2254.577,"Well, I think it's -- it is an easier case in this case under the FAAAA--"
2012.12-52,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2254.577,2256.137,"Oh, I think it's much harder than this case--"
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,2256.137,2257.561,"--Well, I--"
2012.12-52,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2257.561,2263.152,--because the relationship is -- is in the -- in the more general case is more direct to the tow truck.
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,2270.241,2274.16,"--I'm getting lost in the “ go tow ” command, if you will."
2012.12-52,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.16,2283.597,"We have a statute which says, if you park your car here for more than 3 hours, you will be towed, okay?"
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,2326.375,2328.965,"Well, thank you for the out, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-52,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2375.088,2389.641,I think that Justice Breyer is -- I may be speaking for him -- he's thinking that that State contract or that State regulation that permits towing companies to do this is preempted in some way.
2012.12-52,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2392.016,2393.299,Or the opposite.
2012.12-52,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2393.299,2394.469,--No?
2012.12-52,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2394.469,2396.921,He's worried that it'll be preempted.
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,2396.921,2398.029,--Right.
2012.12-52,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.029,2400.731,"And he didn't -- he didn't mention Cambridge, did he?"
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,2400.731,2401.761,No.
2012.12-52,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2401.761,2402.716,I don't think so.
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,2402.716,2404.37,"I think he did yesterday, too, Your Honor."
2012.12-52,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2404.37,2406.135,"Yes, you're both from Boston, Massachusetts."
2012.12-52,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2406.135,2408.261,And they're -- they're very attractive places except in the winter.
2012.12-52,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2435.797,2442.168,"I think maybe -- maybe we have to make it up, what the limitation -- I mean, you're quite right, everything's related to everything else."
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,2459.35,2464.33,"Well -- Justice Scalia, I don't think you have to make up too much in this particular case."
2012.12-52,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2479.464,2482.837,--Related to -- related to -- related to the movement of the property.
2012.12-52,1,18057,brian_c_shaughnessy,,2486.572,2487.898,Correct.
2012.12-52,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2649.88,2651.911,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,2662.202,2664.702,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-52,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2736.188,2739.499,"Well, it's -- I asked your friend on the other side the question."
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,2770.722,2775.83,--It's certainly a foreseeable service that could be provided.
2012.12-52,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.007,2801.82,I don't understand what you just said.
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,2802.632,2803.646,"--Yes, sir."
2012.12-52,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2816.219,2818.059,Service where?
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,2818.059,2820.309,"--I misspoke, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-52,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2821.666,2822.684,"Storage, ah."
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,2825.401,2826.868,As independent of transportation.
2012.12-52,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2871.555,2888.749,"Mr. Yelin, I gave Mr. Shaughnessy a couple of hypotheticals about very onerous regulations involving storage after the towing that might very conceivably have an effect on the tower, drive up the tower's prices, conceivably even drive the tower out of the market."
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,2892.484,2895.905,"So I have two points that I would like to make with respect to that, Your Honor."
2012.12-52,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2934.248,2935.387,How do we discover that?
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,2938.371,2939.997,"--I think in part, Your Honor--"
2012.12-52,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2939.997,2944.384,"No, I want to be able to look at the law and say the law is preempted or the law isn't preempted."
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,2950.084,2956.082,"--Your Honor, I think some of these preemption questions necessarily are factual in part in nature."
2012.12-52,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2963.191,2964.236,"Yes, that's factual."
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,2969.063,2969.703,"--Oh, no."
2012.12-52,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2973.279,2974.714,I thought that is what you meant.
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,2974.714,2975.591,"No, Your Honor."
2012.12-52,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3001.706,3014.777,"Well, but I mean, maybe these, but you can easily imagine that these types of laws would be subject to abuse and would have an adverse impact on the towing company and, therefore, on the transportation of property."
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,3014.777,3027.178,"--And if there were such abusive laws, Your Honor, and if they do impair the transportation of property and the services that a tower was willing to provide, I think that the Court would likely consider those cases and consider those--"
2012.12-52,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3027.178,3039.157,"Well, now we only -- now we not only have to decide whether this type of law is related to it, but once we say some of those laws might be and some won't be, depending upon the impact in a particular case."
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,3039.157,3048.2,"--Your Honor, I think every law has to be considered in its application, and I think that, for example, in Morales, the Court just didn't consider--"
2012.12-52,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3048.2,3051.905,Every law doesn't have to be considered in its application.
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,3059.072,3060.117,"--Fair enough, Your Honor."
2012.12-52,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3102.634,3106.147,It seems to me we have two choices.
2012.12-52,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3121.156,3123.203,I thought so at the time.
2012.12-52,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3124.17,3125.952,"--Yes, you were right."
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,3140.728,3142.21,"You are right about that, Your Honor."
2012.12-52,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3142.21,3142.99,Okay.
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,3187.939,3191.734,"Your Honor, I think the two alternatives you sketched are not mutually exclusive."
2012.12-52,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3227.999,3234.515,"So it would depend upon how severe the consumer protection law is, is that right?"
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,3251.787,3253.615,"I think the answer has to be yes, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-52,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3263.422,3265.267,"Well, why doesn't this one really whack them, though?"
2012.12-52,2,35299,lewis_s_yelin,,3271.655,3273.39,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-52,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3310.264,3311.122,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-52,3,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,3314.42,3318.48,Thank you.
2012.12-52,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3340.815,3342.282,Thank you.
2012.12-52,3,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,3342.282,3367.644,"And, Justice Kagan, the reason why this -- this case goes over the line and is preempted is because what the Plaintiff's damages claims in this case seek to do is they seek to enforce duties that go well beyond what even the New Hampshire abandoned vehicle law requires."
2012.12-52,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3432.026,3455.641,"But it also tells how the vehicle will be sold -- sold, and your client is invoking that statute in order to be able to sell the car, but wants to have enforced only the parts that are favorable to the tow operation."
2012.12-52,3,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,3468.806,3479.053,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, actually, the -- the tower here wasn't invoking the law, the tower was simply following what the law says in terms of the process."
2012.12-52,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3511.447,3516.052,But it's a process that allows you in certain circumstances to sell the car and to take the money.
2012.12-52,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3521.442,3525.535,Please.
2012.12-52,3,15510,andre_d_bouffard,,3525.535,3540.451,"Well, I -- I think that the -- the New Hampshire law is the New Hampshire law, and what we have here is -- is a tow trucker that was just making a good faith -- a good faith attempt to comply with the law."
2012.12-52,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3556.505,0.0,"Thank you, counsel."
