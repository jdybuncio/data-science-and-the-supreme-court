1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,16.23,20.221,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1965.17,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,290.701,293.234,Did the statute used to use the phrase “judgment creditor”?
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,293.234,294.717,In his -- did it one time.
1965.17,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.042,300.744,And it was amended to the present phraseology long ago?
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,302.099,303.604,It was 1952.
1965.17,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,304.376,306.382,-- is there any.
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,312.514,315.719,"We make no claims with the change in language makes any difference, Your Honor."
1965.17,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,316.239,317.415,With respect to this case.
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,317.415,319.311,Right.
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,489.383,494.694,What invalidates the lien if this affected those other statutory liens?
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,494.694,495.294,I beg your pardon?
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,496.979,497.356,Yes.
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,501.249,501.961,Maybe perfected.
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,501.961,502.735,-- after bankruptcy.
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,502.735,503.361,After bankruptcy.
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,503.361,506.786,What if they aren't?
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,506.786,507.145,"Well, if they're not perfected --"
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,507.145,508.023,That's with the Act?
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,508.023,514.504,"-- I assume they -- they then remain and retain the status of the general creditor, if they're not perfected lien holder?"
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,514.504,516.203,Under what provision.
1965.17,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,525.278,527.47,"Mr. Roberts, you may continue your argument."
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,527.47,542.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, Justice White in response to your question of what is -- is there a provision in the Act regarding a lien holder who does not perfect his liens?"
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.586,582.141,Why doesn't 70 (c)?
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,582.141,584.882,Why doesn't 70 (c)?
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.441,602.168,(Inaudible) the trustees cut out the lien and practically (Inaudible)
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,602.168,610.145,But he cuts it out for the benefit of the unsecured creditors of which this man would then become an unsecured creditor.
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.145,613.77,Do you -- do you think that would see its relevance here.
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,613.77,614.624,Yes.
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,614.624,617.385,Then that would apply the situation?
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,617.385,622.826,It would apply in that -- he would be one of those benefited by the trustee.
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,627.213,632.292,"The trustee would have the power to really cut this, (Inaudible) cut out the lien."
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,632.292,633.454,Yes.
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.237,639.723,"Well, I don't understand."
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,641.694,642.32,"Yes, it's --"
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,642.32,646.174,Lien holders are (Inaudible)
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,646.174,652.029,"He can only cut it out, Your Honor, if the man does fail to perfect it himself."
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,652.029,656.069,"Now, do you say that United States tax lien is assessed."
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,656.069,657.161,No.
1965.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.192,683.788,"(Inaudible) or filed, you would be making the same argument."
1965.17,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,683.788,687.457,Had not filed a notice of lien or not filed a proof of claims.
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,1456.869,1460.123,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.149,1890.383,"Mr. Gosline, I think in this case, the Court of Appeals said the bankruptcy (Inaudible)"
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,1890.383,1891.193,That's correct.
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.346,1907.62,"(Inaudible) in the normal case, what -- what would the trustee get by winning this case?"
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,1913.843,1924.808,"Well, I don't think -- I don't think that the Government can perfect the lien under 6323 after the date of bankruptcy and that is the 67 (b) discussion."
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.808,1927.64,67 (b) says it can?
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,1927.64,1929.314,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.131,1944.407,You want 70 (c) to control 6323 but not 67 (b)?
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,1944.407,1955.296,"No, both, because 6323 says that in the federal tax lien shall not be valid until --"
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.296,1956.146,Until?
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,1956.146,1967.975,"Until, so that there is no -- if the trustee in bankruptcy is a “judgment creditor” there is no validity in your federal tax lien until the filing."
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.975,1968.817,Exactly.
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,1968.817,1978.333,"So that if a filing is subsequent to the date of bankruptcy, the rights of the trustee will always be prior to your date of validity --"
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.333,1983.362,Section 67 (b) says expressly that nevertheless it's valid against the trustee.
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,1983.362,1984.427,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1989.735,1994.575,Let's -- let us assume for a minute that 67 (b) did say that.
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,2012.215,2015.33,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because there is no time limit."
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2031.105,2031.555,Yes.
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,2031.555,2046.048,"Within 60 days in the case of Ohio mechanic's lien, so that if 67 (b) has given affect in that situation, you have a cut-off period within which you know that there will be no more filings under 67 (b)."
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2073.449,2081.322,But 67 -- 67 (b) does express from this in the federal statute or the federal tax lien?
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,2081.322,2082.746,"I don't think it does, Your Honor."
1965.17,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2091.695,2096.545,(Inaudible)
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,2096.545,2098.593,Statutory lien.
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.593,2101.691,Including liens for taxes going to United States?
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,2101.691,2110.279,"Well, Your Honor, then my answer to this line of argument goes back to 6323."
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.254,2130.938,So 67 -- you just read 67 (b) out of it.
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,2130.938,2131.509,No.
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.509,2131.845,Go ahead.
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,2133.782,2136.596,"Well, this is important and I'm happy to address myself to it."
1965.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.635,2171.265,Is the emphasis on the validity part of that argument?
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,2171.265,2173.44,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1965.17,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2180.932,2195.155,"Well, may I ask this, does that mean, you treat 60 (b) as applicable under the so-called valid as you define valid liens which require filing of notice?"
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,2195.155,2197.456,"Yes, I think that would be --"
1965.17,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2197.456,2198.883,That isn't the language of course.
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,2200.679,2200.854,Correct.
1965.17,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2200.854,2202.165,-- and that's all under United States.
1965.17,1,39300,robert_b_gosline,,2202.165,2204.531,It's a broader language than that.
1965.17,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2606.294,2607.702,Mr. Roberts?
1965.17,2,40317,richard_m_roberts,,2607.702,2608.951,"No rebuttal, Your Honor."
1965.17,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2608.951,2611.559,Very well.
