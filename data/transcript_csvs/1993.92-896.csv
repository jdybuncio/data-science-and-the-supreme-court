1993.92-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.218,"We'll hear argument next in Number 92-896, Thunder Basin Coal Company v. Robert Reich."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,60.861,67.376,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,165.308,171.222,Are you saying there's no way they could have challenged this regulation prior to the proposed enforcement action?
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,171.222,172.844,"That's right, Justice Souter."
1993.92-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,192.966,195.748,"Then, are they in fact challenging the regulation?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,195.748,206.537,"It is a direct challenge to the regulation, but to the interpretation of the regulation rather than the regulation as it issued at the time."
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,252.446,258.971,"Mr. Bishop, I just was a little unclear from the papers, the mine representative is the union itself or particular individuals?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,258.971,261.653,--It can be the union or particular individuals.
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,261.653,262.624,What is it in this case?
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,262.624,278.282,"It is the... the designation was for the United Mineworkers and two of its professional organizers who are not employees of the mine, so it's a dual designation, both the union and the professional organizers for the union."
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,278.282,285.699,But does the Mine Safety Act contemplate an organization being the... having this authority?
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,285.699,290.42,"Unfortunately, the Mine Act is not clear on that, Your Honor, and the...,--"
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,290.42,291.682,It seems a little incongruous to me.
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,295.544,305.54,"--That is the practical effect of it, but the designation was approved by the Mine Safety & Health Administration as the designation of the union and its professional employees."
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,305.54,307.711,And that would mean any officer of the union?
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,311.414,316.847,"As I understand the way the Mine Safety & Health Administration administers the act, that's correct."
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,316.847,319.449,"I didn't get that out of the papers, but that's--"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,336.57,336.98,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,336.98,351.339,"--Mr. Bishop, you could have refused to recognize these representatives, I assume, and then stood the risk of having a citation issued?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,351.339,352.761,That's correct.
1993.92-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,352.761,360.355,"And then you could have asked for a review by the Commission, which would have gone to an administrative law judge?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,360.355,361.397,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,361.397,371.535,"And at that time, do you acknowledge that you could have raised the same issue about the validity of the regulation?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,371.535,381.42,"It is... that is a procedure that is available under the act, too, is a procedure that the mine operator here chose not to take for very special reasons."
1993.92-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,381.42,393.698,"But it's your position that notwithstanding the availability of that scheme, within which... the framework of which you could have raised the challenge, that you can go direct to district court--"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,393.698,395.808,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,395.808,397.971,--and challenge the validity of the regulation?
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,397.971,406.698,"We believe that the statute provides that opportunity, and this Court's decision in Abbott Laboratories provides the basis for that approach."
1993.92-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.698,414.943,"Well, Abbott... Abbott Labs, the challenge to the regulation was a challenge to an inevitable interpretation of the regulation."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,432.142,434.053,And we think it should have been interpreted differently.
1993.92-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.053,438.327,"Well, so you should have waited your turn to assert that."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,443.159,453.879,"Well, I don't... my understanding of Abbott Labs is it does not restrict to a choice of a regulation that was not subject to multiple interpretations."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,453.879,461.142,"Abbott Labs was part of a trilogy, and it seems to me that your case comes closest to the Toilet Goods decision."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,468.938,469.746,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,551.131,552.681,But nothing is happening immediately.
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,558.555,560.017,"Well, that's the first thing that happens."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,572.166,588.115,"I thought that the administrator said that there would be very circumscribed availability of the records, that they would not be available for any and all purposes but only for this safety purpose."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,588.115,595.871,"Even if the records are available for safety purposes, Justice Ginsburg, it causes a major change to the--"
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,595.871,609.72,"But you're speculating on a lot of what may be, as distinguished from the Gardner... Abbott Laboratories, where there wasn't any question about what was going to happen."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,609.72,611.629,"--Justice Ginsburg, I don't think it's speculation."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,669.77,678.094,"But that's exactly the position you could argue ultimately before the Commission, as has happened in other cases, I understand it has gone that route."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,678.094,712.886,"--We could have, and the reason we didn't, Your Honor, is because we were subject to the potential of losing the very right that we wanted to protect, and that was because, in a case that occurred, the neighboring mine to Thunder Basin, just 2 months before, MSHA approached the failure to post the designation and said, we will issue a citation, and we will fine you maximum daily penalties... at that time $1,000 a day, now $5,000 a day... if you do not post it."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,751.442,759.005,Are you saying the cost to that other mine of capitulating compares to the cost to Abbott Laboratories?
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,759.005,759.816,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,759.816,762.839,It didn't have preenforcement review available to it?
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,762.839,763.349,Yes.
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,769.354,773.495,"No, I'm talking about the cost of using the route that Congress directed."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,786.885,789.026,"--Well, Your Honor, we're dealing with something more than monetary cost."
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.845,809.739,"Mr. Bishop, can I interrupt, because it's through your brief, now, the right to exclude a stranger from your property is basically a State law right, isn't it?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,809.739,810.33,--It's a common law--
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,810.33,814.043,There's nothing in the National Labor Relations Act that gave you that right.
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,818.244,821.537,"--It's a common law property right, and in some cases a State--"
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.537,824.459,"So if there had never been a National Labor Relations Act, you'd have exactly the same right."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,824.459,825.831,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.831,828.153,So you're not relying on a Federal statutory right.
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,828.153,829.762,"Well, we think we are."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,843.231,845.483,It's a limitation on the union's right.
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,853.137,874.862,"--It certainly is, but four times this Court, that I can recall, and I think there were other cases, has discussed this employer's right in the context of the full reach of the National Labor Relations Act, and it has declined and refused to allow the other interests under the labor laws to cause diminution of that right."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,878.063,879.904,The source of the right is State law.
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,896.72,922.336,"Your Honor, I think after the many cases that that this Court has looked at that right, and looked at the many opportunities and arguments to weaken that right because of other advantages or opportunities or necessities created under the labor laws, that this right now is a recognized part of the full rights under the labor laws."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,922.336,929.391,"When a Federal law respects a right under State law, it becomes a Federal law, is that the position you're taking?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,929.391,930.33,It becomes part of the statutory scheme.
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,936.524,944.429,"Any time the Federal law doesn't encroach on the State law domain, that State law then becomes Federal law."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,946.141,949.695,"--No, Your Honor, I don't mean to draw it that starkly."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,949.695,965.183,"Well then, how does what is a State property law become a Federal law when all the Federal law does is says that the worker's right that this Federal law deals with doesn't go as far as to override the State's property--"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,965.183,971.797,"The only answer I can give to that, Your Honor, is that it becomes part of the framework and the fabric of the statutory scheme."
1993.92-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,992.011,1001.667,"--Mr. Bishop, if the only cost to you were the monetary cost, would you be making the argument for review that... would you be claiming the right to review that you now claim?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1001.667,1002.037,--I don't think so.
1993.92-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1005.501,1009.662,"So the $5,000 a day essentially is not your argument, is it?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1009.662,1010.723,"--Well, no, it is."
1993.92-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1053.991,1076.366,"Well, you don't take the position that every time you want to challenge an administrative interpretation and there is a running daily cost against it, that therefore a corporation such as yours should in effect have the nonspecifically statutory review opportunity that you're seeking."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1078.157,1082.999,We don't think the damages or the cost would be sufficiently great to justify it.
1993.92-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.999,1096.94,"Mr. Bishop, let me come back to your contention that unlike Toilet Goods, this case does not involve a ""may"", that there's a certainty of what would happen."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1117.013,1118.392,"Justice Scalia, that--"
1993.92-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1118.392,1125.628,"--to enforce what it wanted, in which case you would have had the same opportunity to make the argument you ultimately made by going the roundabout route to district court?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1125.628,1128.91,"--Justice Scalia, that's not totally correct."
1993.92-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1182.506,1184.146,"Well, must they proceed on the penalty case?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1189.33,1191.413,--Does the... does the agency?
1993.92-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1191.413,1191.983,"The agency, yes."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1191.983,1192.411,Yes.
1993.92-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1196.324,1201.437,So it's not certain that it would proceed by means of administrative penalty rather than action in the district court.
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1201.437,1206.672,The statute says that MSHA must issue the citation.
1993.92-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1208.082,1210.012,"No, what happens after the citation?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1210.012,1218.329,"--After the citation, what normally happens is that they proceed to go through the Review Commission authorized--"
1993.92-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1218.329,1219.329,But that is not mandated by statute.
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1221.753,1224.712,"--I think what they would do, if they want to use--"
1993.92-896,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1224.712,1226.084,"No, but legally they could, couldn't they?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1226.084,1231.557,"--I'm not sure what their answer is, is my hesitancy, but I think they have... the circumstance is I think they would do both."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1252.931,1256.425,Nothing happens immediately as a result of the posting.
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1262.378,1266.84,That depends on the designee.
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1279.058,1282.009,But that's... what happens after the posting?
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1290.856,1298.53,"There are four inspections a year, and there are other reports that have to be submitted by the mine operator."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1332.694,1365.685,"I'm just trying to understand what your exposure is, because we all recognize you have conceded that the legal question of whether this is improper interpretation of the regulation that union representatives can be the designees, that that can be settled in... through the ordinary administrative route, so I... your whole case depends on something on the order of an Abbott Laboratories disaster facing you, and I just don't see that."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1365.685,1372.588,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think the key to understanding that is to be in a position of a mine operator."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1397.466,1417.759,"There are so many enterprises that would love to come into district court in the first instance and bypass a cumbersome administrative procedure with ALJs and commissions, and most of them could make out some kind of case that it would be far better if they could, from their point of view, go right into district court."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1426.685,1428.415,"I think the difference, Your Honor, are two things."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1440.663,1442.175,Under State law.
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1442.175,1445.017,"Under State law, if I agree with that."
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1490.916,1493.527,What decision do you get that from?
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1493.527,1494.659,--Abbott Laboratories.
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1502.614,1509.089,But Abbott Laboratories relied on... I thought Abbott Laboratories relied on what was going to happen immediately.
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1513.961,1514.451,"--Well, Justice--"
1993.92-896,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1514.451,1516.214,--whole stocks would have to destroyed--
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1516.214,1517.784,--There are two parts to the Abbott decision.
1993.92-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1538.978,1549.794,"--That dictum in Abbott Labs doesn't really square very well with Whitney Bank v. New Orleans, does it, which is a case that Abbott Labs did not purport to be overruling."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1549.794,1553.647,I think it's completely consistent with Whitney.
1993.92-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1573.16,1575.573,"Well, I don't think it did in Whitney Bank, either, explicitly."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1579.253,1590.383,"The difference is that in Whitney, the court, after thorough analysis, came to the conclusion that Congress did intend this as the only route."
1993.92-896,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1592.483,1594.214,"Not explicitly, however."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1594.214,1600.108,"--You're correct, it was not explicit, but from the statutory scheme, that was the decision, so--"
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1600.108,1601.831,"Mr. Bishop, I'd like to ask you one question, if I may."
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1623.335,1625.685,"--Obviously, we think our view is appropriate, for this reason."
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.554,1633.6,Is there anything in the record that you have that demonstrates that what this Exhibit C says about what he'll do is incorrect?
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1633.6,1634.241,"--No, Your Honor."
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.115,1646.058,"But did he find as a fact that these mine inspectors, safety inspectors would in fact engage in organizing activities?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1646.058,1654.513,"Not that they would engage in organizing activities, but that the potential was high, and the opportunity was presented for them to do that."
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.513,1664.261,"Does that mean, like, talking to the miners and sort of propagandizing the union, or just finding out facts that will be useful in later... I'm a little puzzled about--"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1664.261,1680.19,"Both of those, and the imprimatur of Government authority placed on the Mineworkers Union by being allowed into the plant with the Federal Government, that's a substantial impact on the will of the voter if it comes to an NLRA election."
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1680.19,1691.928,"--Under your view, would it have been permissible for employees to designate two union members who happened to also be interested in organizing the mine to be the mine inspector, but they were employees?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1695.701,1696.993,That is totally permissible.
1993.92-896,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1698.802,1700.833,They might do exactly the same thing that these people could do.
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1700.833,1702.115,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-896,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1703.936,1710.34,"Mr. Bishop, is there any concern here about the lack of final agency action?"
1993.92-896,0,43822,wayne_s_bishop,,1710.34,1711.772,"I think not, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-896,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1758.432,1760.565,"Thank you, Mr. Bishop."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1762.468,1770.132,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1855.668,1857.801,What is the case you're referring to?
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1857.801,1866.345,"--That is Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U.S. 594, the one previous case under this act."
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.086,1869.608,And what's the point you're making about it--
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1869.608,1870.329,I... I'm--
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.329,1872.181,--That this is an important piece of legislation?
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1872.181,1873.211,"--Well, I'm--"
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.211,1874.193,We agree with that.
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1874.193,1896.195,"--Well, I'm showing that what this court recognized in the legislative history and legislative structure of the act is highly relevant to analysis of that structure and the congressional purposes as they relate to this case."
1993.92-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1896.195,1903.832,"You're picking up on a case that's cited, as far as I can see, only at the bottom of footnote 25 of the brief as your featured case?"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1903.832,1949.36,"Well, it is the one case in this Court that dealt with this act, and I'm just using it as a starting point for our explanation of what Congress was doing in revising the remedial provisions from the pre-existing ones, because they was a considerable structural change made in the penalty provisions, and this was based on concerns about... as the preamble of the act said, that this Court pointed to in Donovan v. Dewey, and we've reproduced this provision on page 1A of the appendix to our brief."
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.672,2096.147,This isn't an unsafe condition that's sitting out there ready to kill somebody.
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2096.147,2097.038,But the question--
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.038,2102.332,It's just the nomination of certain individuals instead of others as inspectors.
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2102.332,2130.94,"--The question in the case goes to the way this scheme will work and whether preenforcement preemptive strikes, as the court of appeals called them, can be brought in the district court to interfere with the statutory process for abating any violation that has been cited by the inspector."
1993.92-896,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2184.836,2188.756,"Mr. Wallace, it's possible, is it not, for nonemployees to be the representatives?"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2188.756,2190.529,--That is correct.
1993.92-896,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2190.529,2195.832,"And if that is so, suppose there's an inspection unannounced?"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2201.235,2231.075,"They don't get notice, and they therefore do not invariably participate, and that is the reason why, in the designation which appears at pages 29 and 30 of the Joint Appendix, the miners who designated these two men to be their representatives designated themselves, or some of themselves, as the alternates in case these persons were unavailable."
1993.92-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2255.031,2263.275,"Well, do you take the position that there's been final agency action here with regard to the issue raised in the district court?"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2263.275,2276.946,"--We take the position that there has not been, because there's never even been a citation issued by the Mine Safety & Health Administration that there has been a violation."
1993.92-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2293.787,2312.429,"Mr. Wallace, Mr. Bishop told us that there are quarterly inspections, so that there would be periodically inspections, and he also said that with respect to finality the interpretation of the regulation is final."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2325.497,2345.449,"Well, because the view of the district director of the MSHA will not necessarily prevail if petitioner wants to litigate it through the processes that are channeled in the act for litigating it."
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2348.491,2348.831,Exactly.
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2348.831,2350.353,--disagree with that interpretation.
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2350.353,2358.749,"It's an independent agency, but so far as the action of the... what you might say the prosecuting agency is concerned, that is final."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2360.049,2361.441,"Well, there's--"
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.441,2371.067,"I mean, in a sense, nothing's ever final until a court... you certainly wouldn't make the argument, when an agency decides something, well, we don't know whether that'll prevail until it gets to the district court, and therefore it's not final."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2371.067,2377.332,"--As it happens, there has been no citation of the violation issued in this case."
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.332,2377.58,"Well, that's a different point."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2398.175,2411.283,"Well, it's not final until the agency has done a citation for a violation--"
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2411.283,2413.343,"All right, you say the citation is what renders it final."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2413.343,2413.654,--and has proposed a penalty.
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.654,2415.326,The citation is what renders it final.
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2419.758,2425.311,"Well, it certainly would be more final than it is now."
1993.92-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2427.662,2439.102,"Mr. Wallace, in terms of where it is now, you used the phrase a moment ago that the agency had advised the Thunder Basin that, I think, as you put it, these individuals are eligible."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2443.473,2447.838,"Well, the agency doesn't do the designating under the act."
1993.92-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2447.838,2448.787,Who does?
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2448.787,2452.009,It's just the miners choose their representatives.
1993.92-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2452.009,2458.514,"Well, the agency... does the agency have a formal act of recognizing the miners' choice?"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2458.514,2463.226,"Well, there's no necessity for that."
1993.92-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2464.688,2464.998,They just show up?
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2464.998,2465.469,--arose--
1993.92-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2465.469,2472.322,"Excuse me, the agency doesn't do anything, the day comes, and somebody just gets on the phone and say, let's go over to the mine?"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2472.322,2481.739,"--Well, they... I don't know who would notify the miners' representatives to come."
1993.92-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2485.352,2494.688,"Well, somewhere in the records of the agency, there must be some... there must be some administrative act along the lines... along the following lines."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2506.886,2513.318,There's nothing in the record on that that I'm aware of.
1993.92-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2513.318,2516.1,"Well, what should be done under the statute, regardless of what's in the record?"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2516.1,2539.765,"Well, under the statute, and under the procedures that are used by the agency, groups of miners can designate representatives, and they just make the designation to the employer, who is supposed to do a posting of the designation."
1993.92-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2539.765,2541.939,It doesn't even go through the agency?
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2546.431,2550.244,That is my understanding.
1993.92-896,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2555.347,2562.632,"Oh, I see, so that in effect is the reason for your answer to Justice Scalia that the agency doesn't do anything final until it issues a citation."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2562.632,2565.884,The employees can designate... that's correct.
1993.92-896,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2583.068,2586.149,"Mr. Wallace, can there be duplicate designations?"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2591.001,2593.773,There can be... there can be duplicate designations.
1993.92-896,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2593.773,2593.943,--Then what happens?
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2593.943,2635.21,"Then the inspector can, if more than one shows up, can choose... can ask them to determine among themselves which one should accompany him, or, if he feels he would be aided by more than one, he can have more than one going along, but the statute says there has to be an equal number of representatives of the employer, so if the employer chooses to have only one representative go along, then only one representative of the employees can go on the inspection."
1993.92-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.381,2656.385,"Mr. Wallace, on this... can you help me understand Exhibit 9 in the Joint Appendix, which is at page 29, which is the letter... I don't know, it's unsigned, but I gather this is the designation, and I gather it was sent in by the union, and it names about half-a-dozen or more people, and--"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2656.385,2656.665,--Well--
1993.92-896,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2656.665,2662.54,--but it doesn't say the union itself... your adversary said that the union was one of the representatives.
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2665.692,2674.056,"--In this particular instance, there are only the two representatives listed on the exhibit which you mention, which is on page 29."
1993.92-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2755.098,2765.045,"Mr. Wallace, the... you said in the brief there's an explicit designation of the court of appeals as having exclusive jurisdiction."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2802.749,2814.287,"Well, I think that is to assure that the review will proceed in only one court of appeals and not in the D.C. circuit and also in the regional circuit."
1993.92-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2816.3,2819.922,"Well, there's, I guess, various explanations for the phrase."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2833.36,2834.511,--I think--
1993.92-896,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2834.511,2845.788,But it's certainly not the way Congress usually acts when it purports to give exclusive jurisdiction to a particular court or set of courts.
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2845.788,2862.088,"--I think it's to be read in conjunction with the fact that the jurisdiction is initially conferred for review either in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the regional court of appeals, but upon filing in one of those courts, then that court's jurisdiction becomes exclusive."
1993.92-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2881.853,2891.798,"Mr. Wallace, the regulations, the underlying regulations here, when they were promulgated, there could have been a facial challenge to the regulations."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2894.41,2904.077,"Well, I think that is correct, and certainly to the extent that the regulations are legislative in nature."
1993.92-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2986.4,3002.201,"But your position is that an interpretation of those regulations... those regulations we agree are final and subject to a facial attack within, whatever, 60 days, then the administrator interprets one of those regulations."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3009.084,3009.885,"Well, that's correct."
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3032.349,3034.281,But that's a different argument from finality.
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3046.119,3047.569,--That is correct.
1993.92-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3095.431,3109.861,"Mr. Wallace, Mr. Bishop concedes that he could have gone that way, that his client could have chosen that route, but I think his point is that there is in this regime no counterpart to, say, 405(g) and (h) of the Social Security legislation."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3112.842,3125.3,"There's nothing explicit that precludes other remedies, but of course, that was true in the Block case, and in Whitney Bank, and in many other cases."
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3161.084,3165.516,"Well, you know, you could say that the same kind of a scheme existed to some extent in Abbott Labs."
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3187.191,3187.942,It wasn't--
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3187.942,3190.954,"Are you saying never here, or are you saying that hardship isn't enough?"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3190.954,3199.208,"--Well, I... what I think I'm saying, or if... is that hardship is not the sole criterion."
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3329.654,3334.206,"Do we have any cases that say that, that say that if you challenge a regulation facially you have to do so within a certain amount?"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3343.673,3345.176,--Well--
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3345.176,3348.495,Assuming preenforcement challenge is permissible.
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3348.495,3355.982,"--Assuming it's permissible, but certainly laches is a criterion for when it should be permissible."
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.641,3405.683,"Of course, you'd object even after the citation was issued, wouldn't you?"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3405.683,3408.766,"Well, we would, because the citation--"
1993.92-896,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3408.766,3408.966,"Perhaps not on finality grounds, on grounds that--"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3408.966,3426.857,"--The citation initiates the statutory process, which is built in with incentives to bring about compliance while the litigation is occurring, but there's no pre-litigation deprivation of anything."
1993.92-896,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3434.212,3446.249,"--Would there be any mechanism whereby during the administrative review the application of the penalty could be suspended, or something?"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3449.311,3472.297,"--That can happen in the administration of whether penalty should be assessed, which is to be determined initially by a proposal by the agency, and then is to be determined independently by the administrative law judge and by the Commission."
1993.92-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3483.525,3496.402,"Could the court of appeals, where a review ultimately lies, grant a stay of any of a penalty imposed by... in the administrative process before being final?"
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3496.402,3501.717,"Well, it would have jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, and it would require a pretty extreme case."
1993.92-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3501.717,3510.932,But you would say that that takes something really extraordinary to come... to use an extraordinary writ you have to have... because your argument... tell me if I don't grasp it correctly.
1993.92-896,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3524.311,3529.054,"That is part of our submission, that is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-896,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3529.054,3530.075,--So you can--
1993.92-896,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3530.075,3530.726,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
