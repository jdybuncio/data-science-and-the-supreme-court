1974.73-1380,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.54,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 73-1380 and 1666, 1667, Chemehuevi Tribe of Indians against the Federal Power Commission and related cases."
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,35.373,38.724,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,695.105,703.592,Didn't the Commission in 1962 try to get from Congress the jurisdiction that they recurred?
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,703.592,725.186,"They did in 1935 as well, Your Honor which is recounted there and again in 1962, they sought jurisdiction which is slightly different from what's at issue here but is basically jurisdiction over the licensing of plant sites for thermal power plants and --"
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,725.186,727.234,Along the river?
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,727.234,735.509,Along the river and Congress has not yet seen fit to enact this legislation.
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,735.509,739.269,Is that still the Commission's policy or desire?
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,739.269,766.424,"Well, the Commission hasn't as a body taken the position out of that in the last few years although they are still very considerable opinion on the Commission that either the Federal Power Commission or somebody should have this kind of authority to decide on the siting for thermal-electric plants."
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,766.424,780.2,"Of course it's a view of some of the parties here, as I understand it at least that there are some of the amicus -- amici that with respect to this particular river, the secretary has a great deal of authority."
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,781.595,803.098,"Well, the Commission's counsel did point out in a petition for rehearing that it thought that with respect to the use of surplus water in this case, there was no need for the Court of Appeals to reach that because any authorization that might be relevant had already been given in this case."
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,803.098,804.081,To the Interior Department?
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,804.081,807.057,But the Commission itself has not reached that issue.
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,810.338,810.551,To be (Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,810.551,813.913,"-- be decided on remand, that is correct."
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,816.702,819.923,"(Voice Overlap) that's the whole -- that's the whole process of one of the briefs there, as I remember it."
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,819.923,836.184,"Well, it is but it's not anything we've presented in our petition for certiorari because the jurisdictional question of clashed union is what we thought was worthy of this Court's review rather than the particular situation on this one river."
1974.73-1380,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,848.595,858.448,"Well, the authority over of a citing of thermal-electric plants, that the Commission itself would be quite independent of the existence of surplus water, wouldn't it?"
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,861.083,873.52,"It's quite independent of the jurisdiction they have sought and it's quite different it its thrust from the jurisdiction that the Court of Appeals held that the Commission has, under the surplus water clause."
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,873.52,875.473,"Supposedly, project works?"
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,875.473,892.949,"It's much closer to the project work's jurisdiction and the basic motivation for it, as power consumption and power needs are expanding so rapidly is a concern on the part of the Commission for adequacy and reliability of power service."
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1289.38,1296.579,Its use is for cooling purposes and is the water consumed or is it all returned at a higher temperature to the (Voice Overlap)?
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1296.579,1313.672,"It's the -- its consumed, some water is consumed by thermal plants and this is the basic difference between the use of the water by thermal plants and by hydroelectric plants with hydroelectric uses basically a non-consumptive use."
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1313.672,1314.61,"No, but --"
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1314.61,1323.826,The Commission has not been in the business of being the arbitrary between competing demands for consumption of water in the river system.
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1323.826,1325.073,"But this is cooling water, isn't it?"
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1325.073,1325.117,It's cooling water.
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1325.117,1326.327,I mean --
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1326.327,1326.859,But it is consumed in the cooling process.
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1326.859,1328.898,"(Voice Overlap)is returned in the river, isn't it?"
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1328.898,1329.91,Some of it is returned.
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1329.91,1330.922,At a higher temperature?
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1330.922,1332.247,Yes and some of it is consumed.
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1332.247,1334.82,"Well, how is it consumed?"
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1334.82,1339.854,"Through evaporation, the heating of it."
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1339.854,1341.466,Maybe Mr. Ely can tell us.
1974.73-1380,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1341.466,1342.641,Yes.
1974.73-1380,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1343.332,1355.548,Right.
1974.73-1380,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1355.548,1356.348,Mr. Ely.
1974.73-1380,1,37089,northcutt_ely,,1356.348,1359.125,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,1793.804,1796.104,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1380,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1882.616,1886.044,To summarize that again -- how to use other than cooling?
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,1886.044,1898.846,"Yes, it -- although it is used for cooling, the cooling process itself actually results in more megawatts being produced because it makes the turbines spin faster and in turn more megawatts come out."
1974.73-1380,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1903.923,1906.977,How much the water -- of the cooling water is consumed?
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,1906.977,1908.423,"All of it, Your Honor and that's an important point."
1974.73-1380,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1908.423,1909.562,None is returned to the river?
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,1909.562,1927.61,"Yes, except for the Four Corners plant, all of these plants will evaporate all the water that is withdrawn from the river and that is why the Court of Appeals found below that thermal plants will have more of an effect on navigable capacity and the hydro potential of a stream than with a hydro plant."
1974.73-1380,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1927.61,1929.98,"Well, hydro doesn't ultimately use any water."
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,1929.98,1931.029,That's correct.
1974.73-1380,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1945.018,1946.682,(Voice Overlap) but it doesn't consume it?
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,1946.682,1948.09,"Yes, that's correct."
1974.73-1380,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1948.09,1951.749,The -- you're directing yourself now to the surplus water clause?
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,1951.749,1953.735,"Yes, as well as the project."
1974.73-1380,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1953.735,1955.667,one afterward project?
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,1955.667,1958.501,"Yes, I think that they are -- I am addressing myself to both."
1974.73-1380,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1958.501,1959.758,"At this point, your argument is the surplus water?"
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,1959.758,1960.077,Yes.
1974.73-1380,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1960.796,1961.642,As I understood you.
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,1961.642,1962.791,Yes.
1974.73-1380,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1962.791,1971.84,"Now we have seen not in this Court but in other courts, there has been litigation about the use of the water for cooling purposes."
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,1996.104,1997.169,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1380,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2038.975,2044.011,What do they do with the water if they don't -- with the excess if they do not return it to the river?
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,2044.011,2050.208,They evaporate it in large cooling ponds which are located adjacent to the plants and it is evaporated by sunlight.
1974.73-1380,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2053.871,2055.072,(Inaudible)?
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,2055.072,2057.036,Yes.
1974.73-1380,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2057.036,2061.199,And that -- is that only to deal with the salinity problem?
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,2061.199,2062.062,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1380,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2063.893,2076.96,"So within the rivers, in dealing with rivers where there is no such salinity problem, there is no barrier chemically or otherwise to putting the water back in and that is done, is it not generally?"
1974.73-1380,2,29067,joseph_j_brecher,,2076.96,2077.641,"Yes, it is."
1974.73-1380,3,37089,northcutt_ely,,3538.179,3543.838,"Your Honor, to disclose first of some of the questions last asked about salinity."
1974.73-1380,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3554.536,3555.46,"Give us a little time to find it, Mr. Ely."
1974.73-1380,3,37089,northcutt_ely,,3555.46,3556.357,Yes sir.
