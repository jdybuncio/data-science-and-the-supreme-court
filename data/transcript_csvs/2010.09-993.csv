2010.09-993,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.772,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-993, Pliva, Incorporated v. Mensing, and the consolidated cases."
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,11.056,13.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-993,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,40.141,45.612,"Well, that makes a lot of sense, but we do have our Wyeth decision that seems to cut the other way."
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,45.612,69.393,"Well, Your Honor, the Wyeth decision is premised on the fundamental conclusion that Federal law obligates and accommodates the brand manufacturer to utilize a specific regulation, the CBE regulation, in order to make a warning change, in order to comply with its obligations under 201.57."
2010.09-993,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,77.131,92.141,"But you have another -- you have another route, and that's what the government is telling us: That you could propose a revision of the label, and if you did that, then you would be home free."
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,94.843,102.163,"Justice Ginsburg, the government agrees with us that we can't actually change the label."
2010.09-993,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,112.97,116.272,"No, it was in the -- at the cert stage as well."
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,116.272,127.894,"--Well, Your Honor, I didn't read the cert stage as saying we had quite the same duty to ask the FDA, although clearly they now believe that we have a duty to ask the FDA."
2010.09-993,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,132.782,138.019,"Can we call this the take steps -- is this the take-steps doctrine, for purposes of discussion here?"
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,138.019,140.321,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, this is the take-steps."
2010.09-993,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,140.321,145.792,It's not clear to me whether you say that that is preempted or just that it was not well-pled.
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,148.492,150.243,"Thank you, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-993,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,180.946,182.148,"Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, why should--"
2010.09-993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,182.148,183.548,"Would the -- excuse me, Justice."
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,196.557,202.544,"No, Your Honor, and in fact that was in part what was -- what came up in the briefing in the Wyeth case."
2010.09-993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,223.458,224.925,But assume there hadn't been.
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,253.394,267.904,"Your Honor, I -- I don't see anything in the history, the 27-year history of Hatch-Waxman, where the Federal government has ever said that there is a legal obligation to lobby the FDA for a labeling change."
2010.09-993,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,267.904,268.67,Excuse me.
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,289.047,290.599,"Absolutely not, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-993,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,290.599,300.622,So please describe what the difference between that obligation and the obligation to suggest a label change when you know it's been misbranded.
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,300.622,307.628,"Under the FDA Regulation 314.80 and 314.98, we have a myriad of disclosure obligations."
2010.09-993,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,351.138,377.289,"So what's -- so what's the conflict with State law, meaning you have an obligation to keep your label as it is, but if you also have a Federal obligation to advise the FDA of adverse -- of adverse results and of needs for change, why can't you then comply with a duty to warn obligation because you can go to the -- to the FDA?"
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,377.289,393.817,"Well, first of all, there's a little bit of a difference between reporting all of the adverse events, which we clearly do, and asking the FDA to make a determination that the FDA has said is only for the FDA to make with respect to generic companies."
2010.09-993,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,393.817,397.785,"--Do you contest, Mr. Lefkowitz, your ability to make that request?"
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,406.724,419.698,"Your Honor, there's no question that we could certainly ask the FDA, and in fact if we had reason to believe that a label was not accurate, not strong enough, we would certainly do that."
2010.09-993,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,426.369,447.182,"Well, if you could go to the FDA, why shouldn't we look at this suit in this way: That the plaintiffs are bringing a standard failure to warn claim; that you then have a preemption defense, that you'll say it's impossible; and then in order to litigate that preemption defense, the question will be, well, if you had gone to the FDA, what would the FDA have done?"
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,458.157,470.965,"--Your Honor, that is the precise set of issues that this Court addressed both in Buckman and in ArkLa, in a situation where all we could have done, and we weren't obligated to do, was ask the FDA."
2010.09-993,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,500.984,527.182,"Well, Buckman -- Buckman was arguably a little bit different, in that there's a concern expressed in that case that requiring allowing the State suit to go forward would cause manufacturers to basically inundate the agency with proposals and warning revisions, so that there would be so many things that the agency wouldn't even be able to process them, and they would become meaningless to the consumers."
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,529.384,538.09,"Well, Your Honor, the government had articulated that proposition in the Buckman case and again several years later in the Warner-Lambert case."
2010.09-993,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,570.978,586.59,"The Federal agency says that these suits complement, they're not at odds with, the Federal regime, because they give the manufacturers an incentive to come forward."
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,606.751,619.558,"Well, we know from the current FDA database that there were over 1600 requests for labeling revisions that the FDA has not acted on, and that's just in the aftermath of Wyeth."
2010.09-993,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,625.979,631.85,Is -- is there any breakdown as to how many of those requests are generic and how many from branded?
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,631.85,645.793,"--Your Honor, almost all of them I would believe are from branded manufacturers, because generic manufacturers until the briefing in this Court have never believed that they have any obligation to ask the FDA."
2010.09-993,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,682.235,695.043,"So what are you supposed to do if your company happens by chance to come across a very, very high correlation between people who take your generic drug and who get seriously ill?"
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,704.548,709.985,"Your Honor, we have an obligation, actually, to provide all of that information to the FDA."
2010.09-993,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,715.706,722.376,And so are they saying that you -- is it conceded in this case that you did tell the FDA everything you knew about that?
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,722.376,723.21,"--Well, no."
2010.09-993,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,723.562,724.195,Or is that a point in dispute?
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,724.195,730.299,--The plaintiffs allege that we violated Federal disclosure obligations.
2010.09-993,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,738.07,738.904,"Well, how would it conflict?"
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,776.345,782.164,"--I think that law, Your Honor, would conflict with the Buckman principles and the ArkLa principles."
2010.09-993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,782.164,784.433,I thought you said you had to tell the FDA about it.
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,784.433,797.258,"If the -- I understood Justice Breyer's question to be asking whether -- not only did we have to tell the FDA, which we clearly do, but whether we then had some additional duty to ask the FDA to change the warning."
2010.09-993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,797.258,797.71,Okay.
2010.09-993,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,798.326,801.245,"What I wonder -- see, I wonder if that's this case."
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,819.189,820.975,"Well, I think that's what they're suggesting."
2010.09-993,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,822.841,826.027,When they come up here they might say this isn't just what this case is about.
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,826.027,831.662,"--Even if it's just the former, Your Honor, even if it's just the failure to disclose adverse reports--"
2010.09-993,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,831.662,832.097,Yeah.
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,832.097,841.786,"--which we know we have an obligation to do, there is no history of State regulation of communications between Federal -- Federal agencies and the regulated parties."
2010.09-993,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,846.671,879.209,"So your argument is that if we run across this tremendous, really serious -- I can make an imaginary as serious as you want -- really a serious problem, and you're saying the State has no right to say -- even if we purposely didn't tell anybody, they can't get involved because they can't get involved with our failure to tell the FDA anything because that's Federal, and we can't -- they can't get involved with our failure to try to change the warning because that's taken care of by our obligation to tell them, which we didn't fulfill?"
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,879.209,894.338,"--Justice Breyer, correct, because that's exactly -- remember, in Buckman what happened was an individual was injured because the company had not accurately disclosed, in fact had misled the agency about the purpose of marketing these bone screws."
2010.09-993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.947,917.703,"So you say that if the claim here is simply that you did not disclose properly, that claim could be brought?"
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,917.703,920.169,"Not in a State court, Your Honor."
2010.09-993,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,920.169,921.505,To disclose -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,923.338,923.957,Correct.
2010.09-993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.957,924.623,To disclose to the FDA.
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,924.623,931.277,"A claim, Your Honor, of disclosure to the FDA relates to the inherently Federal relationship."
2010.09-993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.277,938.514,"But you just described Buckman as -- as involving precisely that, failure to tell the FDA the purpose of the screws."
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,943.584,945.786,"No, I said the State suit -- I apologize."
2010.09-993,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,969.902,976.656,"But Mr. Lefkowitz, I think what the Respondents would say is that you are mischaracterizing their complaint and making it into something that it's not."
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,999.319,1005.989,"Justice Kagan, I would agree with you that what they pled below was a traditional failure to warn."
2010.09-993,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1039.479,1047.816,"Well, I agree that you don't have any ability yourself to change the warning, but here's what the FDA has said."
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,1069.581,1073.116,"Your Honor, that is exactly what the FDA says."
2010.09-993,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1168.328,1169.145,"Counsel, do you think--"
2010.09-993,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1169.145,1177.351,"Buckman was a case -- I'm pronouncing it right, I think, Buckman -- where it was a branded manufacturer, was it not?"
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,1177.351,1179.47,It was a medical device manufacturer.
2010.09-993,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1179.47,1180.72,A medical device manufacturer.
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,1196.931,1199.966,"Your Honor, I do think it's a fortiori."
2010.09-993,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1228.45,1241.96,"--Counsel, do you think Congress really intended to create a market in which consumers can only sue brand-named products?"
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,1287.489,1289.774,"Justice Sotomayor, I want to take both halves of your question."
2010.09-993,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1370.493,1373.511,"Mr. Lefkowitz, there's a certain overlap, is there not?"
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,1380.367,1381.434,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-993,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1381.434,1386.687,"And at least for those people, they have the means."
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,1386.687,1409.101,"Your Honor, I don't know whether or not the -- the FDA or this Court would hold differently in a case where the generic at issue was an authorized generic, a generic manufactured by a brand company that had, in fact, done all the clinical safety testing and might have a different basis for assessing the occasional adverse reports that they get."
2010.09-993,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1439.739,1453.647,"Counsel, all you're arguing is that this rule will have little practical effect, that there is going to be very few lawsuits that could be brought against your companies because you're just not going to have enough information to suggest a label change."
2010.09-993,0,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,1453.647,1468.508,"Your Honor, what I'm arguing is that for the FDA to impose a new Federal obligation that will significantly change the way generic companies conduct their business should go through notice and comment rulemaking."
2010.09-993,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1515.822,1517.105,"Thank you, Mr. Lefkowitz."
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1529.463,1532.999,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1557.28,1567.986,"Well, they're -- they're -- they're under the obligation to report to the FDA the facts which establish the grave risk, right?"
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1567.986,1571.188,"Yes, they are, Your Honor."
2010.09-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1572.54,1593.369,"So the argument here is whether it -- it will be the FDA ultimately that determines whether there was a grave enough risk to modify the -- the label or whether that call will be made by -- by a State court guessing what the FDA would have done, right?"
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1593.369,1595.669,"--No, Your Honor, that's not correct."
2010.09-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1613.765,1631.477,"Yeah, but -- but -- no, but -- but surely you have to establish not only that the generic manufacturer requested a label change, but that a label change would have been approved."
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1634.043,1634.762,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1634.762,1635.545,"--that's part of your case, isn't it?"
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1635.545,1636.879,"No, it's not, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1654.573,1661.162,"No, but -- but their -- their preemption claim is we had to give these warnings, and you don't contest that."
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1670.852,1671.402,Your Honor--
2010.09-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.402,1678.708,"--I mean, I don't see how you can hold them liable, so long as they continued to give the warnings that they had to give."
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1678.708,1679.124,--Your Honor--
2010.09-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.124,1691.282,"And they could have lobbied the FDA to say, you know, change the warning, but if the FDA said -- suppose the -- suppose they did tell the FDA, please modify the label, and the FDA said no."
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1692.916,1694.4,"--No, it would not, Your Honor."
2010.09-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.4,1694.817,No.
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1694.817,1698.835,"Once the FDA said no, we would have clear evidence that the FDA would have rejected the warning--"
2010.09-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.835,1699.252,I would say--
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1699.252,1701.204,--which is what this Court said in Levine is the touchstone.
2010.09-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.204,1701.704,--All right.
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1707.275,1710.06,"Yes, Your Honor, for purposes of impossibility."
2010.09-993,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1724.237,1743.464,"It appears also that the -- it's Buckman, it seems to me, the relevant case, not Wyeth, because what -- if -- you're now saying, I've learned, that -- that they have a set of FDA duties; they must tell the FDA every detail."
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1743.464,1744.316,--Well--
2010.09-993,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1744.316,1753.422,"That sounds awfully familiar to Buckman, where the State claim was basically a claim of fraud on the FDA."
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1773.92,1775.302,"--Well, there are two answers, Your Honor."
2010.09-993,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1780.173,1784.275,"No, because Levine involves the Wyeth case, right?"
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1784.275,1784.741,--Yes.
2010.09-993,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1785.227,1785.693,No.
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1810.843,1813.811,"--Your Honor, let me respond to that in -- in two ways."
2010.09-993,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1814.378,1817.246,"Be sure you answer, please, my original question."
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1817.246,1818.781,"--I -- I will, Your Honor."
2010.09-993,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1926.051,1926.467,But what happens--
2010.09-993,1,34159,louis_m_bograd,,1926.467,1929.253,"And had they done so, we would know -- one of two things would have happened."

2010.09-993,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2829.38,2834.248,"Yes, we do, because the ultimate question in the preemption case is whether there's a conflict."

2010.09-993,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3433.417,3441.421,"Counsel, the difference, as I see it, is that they're not suing you for a failure to tell the FDA."
2010.09-993,3,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,3473.542,3483.366,"Justice Sotomayor, respectfully, what's wrong with the premises, if they're claiming failure to warn, it's a very simple case of impossibility preemption."
2010.09-993,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3549.292,3553.177,"Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, if you had asked, you would be in a different situation."
2010.09-993,3,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,3567.087,3583.716,"Your Honor, and again just to pick up on -- on what Chief Justice Roberts said and Justice Scalia said, we have done everything we are required to do, which is to provide all of the information about adverse reports that we have and all of the results of our investigations to the government."
2010.09-993,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3593.654,3600.058,"The government is taking the position that there's no clash between the government, the State, and Federal law."

2010.09-993,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3641.902,3652.21,"The -- the -- Buckman was about, was a -- it was a very odd case to be brought under State law for fraud on a Federal agency."
2010.09-993,3,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,3652.21,3660.549,"--Your Honor, it was a case brought by a plaintiff who was injured claiming that the company had not made proper, adequate disclosures to the FDA."

2010.09-993,3,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,3675.225,3676.375,--Absolutely.
2010.09-993,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3677.108,3681.395,"Otherwise, the government would be saying you have an obligation to lobby, and I don't think they're saying that."
2010.09-993,3,31493,jay_p_lefkowitz,,3681.395,3689.299,"--Well, in a sense the government is really saying we -- to lobby or to propose changes is a -- is a very fine distinction."
