2019.18-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.36,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1233, Romag Fasteners versus Fossil, Inc. Ms. Blatt."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,8.36,21.12,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Lanham Act authorizes courts to remedy trademark violations by awarding infringers profits subject to the principles of equity."
2019.18-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,237.4,266.8,"Ms. Blatt, could you concentrate on the word ""equity""? Do you think equity would sustain an award for innocent or good-faith infringement without a more culpable state of mind? Because there's a wide swath of behavior between truly innocent, truly good faith, and willful."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,278.8,279.88,Yes.
2019.18-1233,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,281.12,281.72,But how?
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,281.72,287.92,"-- the earlier case, you would need a greater showing of the other purposes or the other equitable factors."
2019.18-1233,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,414.12,418.84,"Pre- -- pre-Lanham Act, that's not much, right?"
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,418.84,421.16,"Three? Well, sure."
2019.18-1233,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,422.76,424.24,"Pre- -- pre-Lanham Act, I said."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,424.24,424.72,Yes.
2019.18-1233,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,424.72,425.48,Yeah.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,425.48,426.0,Yeah.
2019.18-1233,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,429.92,430.12,Yes.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,430.12,432.24,And that was a Supreme Court case.
2019.18-1233,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,432.24,432.8,Right.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,432.8,435.52,"You didn't award profits, but the -- the district court did."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,444.36,450.68,"So -- and then we had a third case that -- the third case is Prest-O-Lite, and that's from New Jersey."
2019.18-1233,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.64,487.52,"How is willfulness defined? I mean, here the jury found callous disregard, but not willfulness."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,491.88,492.2,Yes.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,531.12,531.32,Is it --
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,531.32,538.76,"But they're similar because callous disregard under Second Circuit case law was a function of willfulness, it just wasn't willful blindness."
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,538.76,556.4,"I can't work out, there's maybe an obvious answer to this that I've missed, but -- but in reading the statute, I thought, well, suppose you do have to have willfulness in order to get profits, and there would be a certain number of cases you don't get profits, right, okay."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,591.68,592.52,Maybe I don't understand the question.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,595.0,595.44,In this case --
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,595.44,596.48,-- absent willfulness.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,596.48,598.44,"-- they think that, but I want to know why."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,607.0,607.56,Right.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,607.56,608.08,Okay.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,633.72,635.72,"Well, if you're saying you should read willfulness into the --"
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,635.72,637.24,"No, I'm not -- I'm saying --"
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,637.24,637.48,No --
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,637.48,638.44,"-- it's what you do, yeah."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,638.44,642.0,"Yeah, so if your view is that you read it into it but then courts can read it out --"
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,642.0,643.92,They did not say they can read it out.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,667.16,667.52,So --
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,667.52,670.24,Now why isn't that what that sentence does? I just want to --
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,670.24,670.92,I think this sentence --
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,670.92,671.32,-- know what it does.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,671.32,671.56,-- helps us.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,678.52,680.12,No matter how appealing the case?
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,680.12,682.32,"Yes, that's why we're here on a petition to --"
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,682.32,684.32,Has anybody argued about this sentence?
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,684.32,685.28,Yes.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,685.28,686.4,In our brief -- in your brief you put that?
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,686.4,686.92,Yes.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,686.92,687.44,Good.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,688.84,691.2,"I mean, it's -- it's in the intro and it's in the --"
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,691.2,691.44,Fine.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,695.4,697.56,I don't know the page.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,742.76,746.0,"Well, I was trying to understand the significance of the case."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,764.08,764.44,So --
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,764.44,778.24,"Now, you say still this is very bad because don't you know, that the trademark is owned by some widows and orphans and terribly suffering people and -- and -- and you should certainly give them some money or goodness knows what'll happen, you know --"
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,778.24,778.8,"Right, so --"
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,778.8,782.08,"-- very appealing case that you're worried about, therefore you say --"
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,782.08,782.4,Yeah.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,782.4,783.4,-- read willfulness out of it.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,786.04,787.4,So we're not reading it out.
2019.18-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,813.04,837.56,"Ms. -- Ms. Blatt, your -- your lead argument, of course, is the phrase willful violation under Section 1125(c) and the willfulness is not -- doesn't appear in the other part, but 1125(c) includes willfulness, it's about willfulness. So, and I gather this is the argument on the other side, saying willful violation under -- that's kind of like just the label, this is what it is."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,848.04,848.56,Right.
2019.18-1233,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,985.04,1009.6,"Of the cases where the courts have said that willfulness is a necessary condition, which one would you cite as being -- as leading to the most unjust result? The case where -- where a court said we're not going to award profits because there wasn't any willfulness and that's very unjust based on the facts of the case, is there one you would cite as an example?"
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1009.6,1026.32,"No, because they don't say, like their -- the leading case, that Regis case by the highest court in Massachusetts, it just says, we're not going to -- although the law is conflicted, we're not going to allow profits, and they're mostly relating to a fraud-based tort."
2019.18-1233,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1080.92,1117.72,"Do you think it's open to us, Ms. Blatt, to pick a position someplace between you and Mr. Katyal? In other words, Mr. Katyal says, never under any circumstances can you get profits without willfulness and you say, well, willfulness is just one factor among the things that you think about. But I -- I would think that there's some kind of intermediate position, which is based on the history and -- and a general sense of it, which is that willfulness might not be a -- an absolute necessity but it certainly should be entitled to very significant weight. You know, you could say like a presumption of a kind."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1117.72,1133.28,"No, I would not say a presumption unless you're going to give us the same presumption, the presumption of compensation when other remedies aren't adequate and a presumption against unjust enrichment. And here's why we sort of used the Kirtsaeng case as an -- as an example in terms of fashioning our rule, is that I do think it's a sliding scale."
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1158.72,1160.24,"Well, how do you do this?"
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1160.24,1160.48,Sure.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1160.48,1185.64,"I think -- I guess your view is there's no willfulness requirement. But what it says is the plaintiff shall be entitled to recover defendant's profits, damages, and the cost of the action -- okay, it says that -- subject to principles of equity. Okay? Now, we have a problem."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1196.24,1197.12,It's also not true.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1197.12,1198.92,"No, well, I -- I -- I understand."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1205.72,1206.12,Sure.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1206.12,1207.04,All right.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1214.04,1214.32,No.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1214.32,1219.88,How do you want us to write that sentence? What principles of equity require?
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1219.88,1225.92,So -- and I think it helps to say that all of the courts have agreed on what the principles of equity mean.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1316.24,1316.64,I have that part.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1316.64,1318.36,-- cares about trademark infringement.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1318.36,1324.6,"But is it all right to say this, that there could be cases where -- some profits but not all profits?"
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1324.6,1325.64,Yes.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1325.64,1327.2,Is the equitable thing to do?
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1327.2,1327.88,Yes.
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1327.88,1329.32,"Yes, so we could say that?"
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1329.32,1330.2,Yes.
2019.18-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1339.88,1342.08,"Well, that's a little strange."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1361.96,1372.28,"Sorry, I was -- yeah, and this is a different, separate issue that I was referring to, not just profits, but there's a debate in this case whether you get profits that are attributable to the infringement."
2019.18-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1375.12,1375.68,"Oh, sure."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1375.68,1375.92,That --
2019.18-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1375.92,1376.52,"Well, that's a --"
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1376.52,1376.6,That --
2019.18-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1376.6,1377.72,-- different legal basis.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1378.08,1379.16,"That's all I was talking about, yes."
2019.18-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1379.16,1380.96,"In response to Justice Breyer, you didn't --"
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1380.96,1381.32,No.
2019.18-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1381.32,1384.96,"-- didn't say, okay, profits are $100,000, you take 50; I'll take 50."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1384.96,1391.32,"No, so the profits that are attributable to the infringement, at least the other side would say, you know, you don't even get your $900."
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1418.6,1424.08,The profits on the purse are -- are -- are $4 million.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1452.0,1452.4,So --
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1452.4,1453.68,-- on -- on three purses.
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1453.68,1454.08,So --
2019.18-1233,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1454.08,1454.36,Or maybe --
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1454.36,1466.2,"-- there's a separate legal issue which the parties haven't briefed and there's no dispute in the case law, but it's just an amount, whether you're either limited to the attribution or -- and, if not, what kind of mental state would go over that."
2019.18-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1467.48,1475.72,"Yeah, but it's still -- I mean, it's unlikely that there will be $4 million in profits attributable to this little thing that nobody could see, and that's a question."
2019.18-1233,0,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1483.8,1488.92,I would say that the equity -- the traditional factors are -- are the equity ones I talked about.
2019.18-1233,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1513.12,1518.16,"Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal."
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1518.16,1529.64,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: My friend tries to make this case seem easy, but to do that, she has to sweep both Congress's words and two centuries of history under the rug."
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1692.32,1706.32,"Mr. Katyal, my basic problem is that as I'm looking at these cases, the term ""willfulness"" over the centuries has been differently defined by different people."
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1767.0,1767.28,So --
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1767.28,1774.64,"-- willfulness being just conscious avoidance, not recklessness, not callous disregard, not this, not that?"
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1774.64,1776.28,"Justice Sotomayor, at the time --"
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1776.28,1776.56,How do we --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1776.56,1776.92,-- of the --
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1776.92,1784.48,"-- do that in light of 117(a), which doesn't have an equity limitation."
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1792.96,1794.44,"Absolutely, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1830.88,1831.16,Go --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1831.16,1831.52,-- got a case --
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1831.52,1836.96,"-- go to the more important part of my question, which is: What does willfulness mean?"
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1836.96,1837.4,All right.
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1837.4,1840.52,And -- and where is there --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1840.52,1841.0,In --
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1841.0,1842.44,-- a universal definition?
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1842.44,1851.84,"Yes, we think there is a universal lowest common denominator of willfulness at least meaning what exactly the district court charged here, the petition appendix page 43A which is --"
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1851.84,1852.84,Common denominator --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1852.84,1853.2,Yeah --
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1853.2,1854.84,-- which is to say it was the only --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1854.84,1858.72,-- which is the defendants must be actually aware of the infringing activity.
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1877.6,1878.08,Why should --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1878.08,1896.88,"Case after case says willfulness meaning knowledge is -- is required. And my basic point is, she's got no case on the other side that disagrees with this with except the possible hypothetical of Oakes in 1883, which, again, didn't actually award profits in the absence of willfulness. And --"
2019.18-1233,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1896.88,1897.56,Mr. Katyal --
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1897.56,1898.28,Why should --
2019.18-1233,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1898.28,1923.6,"-- you say that ""principle of equity"" means willfulness, but in many cases, as Ms. Blatt pointed out, the statute uses the word ""willfulness,"" so you say plain text, ""principles of equity."" I would say if it said ""willfulness,"" that would be plain text, but ""principles of equity""?"
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1923.6,1930.0,"So, Justice Ginsburg, as our brief explains, every time Congress -- and they certainly didn't use willfulness in the 1946 act."
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1967.76,1967.84,Well --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1967.84,1989.72,"So, for example, Section 1115(b)(9), which you can look at Joint Appendix page 135, that has that, that says that laches is available to fight incontestability and Section 1069 from the '46 Act says laches is available to contest inter partes determinations. If you adopted her reading, you'd be saying, well laches isn't anywhere else in --"
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1989.72,1990.2,Why should --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1990.2,1990.72,-- the statute.
2019.18-1233,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1990.72,1991.32,"No, no, no --"
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1991.32,1996.8,Why should we assume that Congress wanted to exclude reckless infringement?
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1996.8,2003.16,"Because Congress in 1946 acted against the backdrop of long-standing, consistent practice."
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2005.24,2005.64,But there --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2005.64,2008.6,-- she is able to give you in which there was an award given.
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2008.6,2017.88,"But as Justice Sotomayor points out, willfulness is a -- a vague word, ambiguous word, sometimes covered what we would consider recklessness."
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2019.2,2019.64,Because --
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2019.64,2020.16,-- exclude recklessness?
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2020.16,2034.32,"-- here, Justice Kavanaugh, there's a more specific tradition. There's no doubt, cases like Ratzlaf say ""willfulness"" means different things in different contexts, but here it is always meant at least actual knowledge, subjective knowledge --"
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2034.32,2035.28,What would be --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2035.28,2036.36,-- and not recklessness.
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2036.36,2039.36,What would be the policy objective achieved by excluding --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2039.36,2039.8,Well --
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2039.8,2040.84,-- reckless infringement?
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2040.84,2045.88,"-- so we do think they are there, but we think Congress used this phrase and your job is to interpret the phrase --"
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2045.88,2045.96,I agree -- I --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2045.96,2046.44,-- and to essentially get to it.
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2046.6,2047.24,I understand that --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2047.24,2047.52,But --
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2047.52,2048.0,But can you answer --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2048.0,2048.44,-- the policy --
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2048.44,2048.56,Yeah.
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2048.56,2069.88,"-- objectives are -- are, I think, incredibly strong, that is, the tradition of profits comes from equity and the idea that damages weren't -- weren't at that point in time available in courts of equity. And so courts looked to profits. Then there was a separate rationale of unjust enrichment but that was all about moral blameworthiness, about wrongdoing."
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2075.8,2079.0,"But if you're reckless, you're -- there is some wrongdoing."
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2079.0,2080.96,But I -- it's always been more than that.
2019.18-1233,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2139.88,2164.8,"Mr. Katyal, can we return to Justice Ginsburg's question for just a moment on the statutory text and whether principles of equity might be an unusual way of saying willfulness? As I understood your response to Justice Ginsburg, that we would -- we would perhaps read out laches as a defense, and -- and I -- I just -- my problem with that is that when we say ""principles of equity,"" we -- we mean laches."
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2195.32,2196.12,So --
2019.18-1233,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2196.12,2211.04,"And why didn't you make an argument that we should, as a background principle, assume some sort of consistency with the common law when Congress was legislating? You seem to have disclaimed that and said no, no, there's a textual hook here and it's principles of equity."
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2213.56,2223.68,"We certainly made exactly that argument citing Morissette in our brief for the idea, even if there weren't the price -- principles of equity, Congress acts against the backdrop of the common law and is deemed to interpret it."
2019.18-1233,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2296.6,2310.8,"But -- but as Justice Sotomayor just pointed out, there wasn't -- there isn't in the cases a uniform agreement on what ""willful"" means."
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2336.28,2345.24,"Justice Ginsburg, ask her to cite a case in which callous disregard was enough before 1946 to find -- to -- to find a profits award."
2019.18-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2369.24,2372.72,That -- that wasn't original with me. (Laughter.)
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2372.72,2383.6,"And that's exactly what's happened here, is that you've had two centuries in which this phrase, at equity, has been interpreted by court after court, and it is a fast rule."
2019.18-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2409.12,2413.08,Reading all those I'll -- I'll try this again and maybe I should ask you.
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2440.28,2441.0,Absolutely.
2019.18-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2444.12,2445.24,"No, I'm not just -- treble, but up to a limit?"
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2445.24,2446.68,"-- profits, but you can't treble profits --"
2019.18-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2446.68,2448.16,Up to a limit? But a sentence --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2448.16,2450.64,You can't just treble profits because that is a harder --
2019.18-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2450.64,2451.04,Correct.
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2456.84,2457.08,Well --
2019.18-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2457.08,2459.12,So I thought is this all much ado about nothing.
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2459.12,2463.8,"Well, again, I think that the award is subject in the first instance of the gate to principles of equity."
2019.18-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2463.8,2464.4,"Yeah, all right. Fine."
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2464.4,2467.2,"But there's a much more important answer here, Justice -- Justice Breyer."
2019.18-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.24,2497.2,I'm still trying to get the -- it's -- I don't know why I -- I can't get it.
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2529.72,2529.92,Justice Breyer --
2019.18-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2529.92,2531.52,And so we want more money.
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2531.52,2538.64,"Yes, Justice Breyer, it does work with respect to damages, not with respect to profits, because up above in 1117 --"
2019.18-1233,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2538.64,2539.0,Yeah.
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2539.0,2542.28,-- profits is subject to the principles of equity.
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2544.28,2547.24,"But damages is notoriously hard to prove, correct?"
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2547.24,2548.68,"Well, I actually disagree with that."
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2580.2,2593.6,"You -- you've mentioned a couple times whether it's worth the candle to not have a willfulness requirement, but is it worth the candle to exclude all reckless cases as Justice Breyer has stated --"
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2593.6,2593.92,Yes.
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2594.64,2601.92,-- when -- when willfulness will usually be a key factor in the calculus regardless of who wins here?
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2601.92,2602.16,Right.
2019.18-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2646.68,2647.28,"Well, counsel --"
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2647.28,2647.96,That's the danger.
2019.18-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2647.96,2657.12,"I -- how much would you have asked for? I mean -- I mean, it's -- it doesn't strike me as overreaching to ask for every dollar of the profits if you think you're entitled to profits."
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2657.12,2659.12,"Well, that's the down -- that's the downside here."
2019.18-1233,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2709.96,2719.72,"May I ask two questions about that tradition? The first is you've said several times that Ms. Blatt has zero cases, and I believe Ms. Blatt said that she had three cases."
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2719.72,2720.4,Right.
2019.18-1233,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2720.4,2751.16,"So if you would address that. And the second is, although you point to a lot of cases in which the results come out your way, there are comparatively few where the court sets out the rule as a categorical one. You know, in many of these cases, the courts do seem to be thinking of willfulness as a factor, a significant factor, but not a gateway requirement. So those results might come out your way, but they don't articulate the rule that you propose, do they?"
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2751.16,2751.72,Five -- yes.
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2828.08,2835.6,"Mr. Katyal, the problem is, as I read those cases, you do have a handful, a little bit more than a handful, that say you need willful."
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2847.52,2850.36,"We -- we agree not every case states the rule, but our --"
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2850.36,2851.32,But it also --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2851.32,2855.4,She doesn't have a case on the other side with the exception of the theoretical possibility of Oakes --
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2855.4,2855.76,Why don't you --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2855.76,2856.16,-- which doesn't.
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2856.16,2858.24,Why don't you deal with the three cases that she points to.
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2858.24,2858.44,Yeah.
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2870.48,2878.44,"Well, it's only the last 20, maybe 30 years that we had Lexis to cite cases like that, but --"
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2878.44,2879.24,"Well, I think, you know -- I think --"
2019.18-1233,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2879.24,2880.48,"Lexis and Westlaw, but --"
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2880.48,2894.72,"But, Justice Sotomayor, I think, you know, this Court in the McLean case said courts constantly refuse profits awards because of a lack of willfulness, citing the English case of Moet, which is the best case. It's on all fours with this."
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2973.56,2973.72,But in --
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2973.72,2974.44,-- Music case was.
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2974.44,2982.92,"-- stating the rule in your brief, you consistently say good faith, not willful, innocent, not willful."
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2992.4,2993.12,"Right, and --"
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2993.12,2999.64,And that -- and that -- your description in the brief consistent also seems consistent as Justice Sotomayor says with the rule.
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2999.64,3003.28,And I should have made this clear with respect to Justice Ginsburg's question.
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3031.52,3035.76,"How about subjective recklessness, conscious disregard of a substantial risk?"
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3035.76,3036.32,Yeah.
2019.18-1233,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3042.28,3042.84,Right.
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3044.12,3060.8,"No, I don't think so. Here, I think -- you know, here the question is that, you know, because here -- the district court here found, this is at page 47A, the evidence at trial at most could support a finding that Fossil was negligent, not that it acted in reckless disregard with willful blindness and the like."
2019.18-1233,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3061.0,3076.84,"Mr. Katyal, could you explain the features of trademark that make it different from copyright and patent where as -- if I understand correctly, you can get profits without showing willfulness?"
2019.18-1233,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3076.84,3077.08,Yeah.
2019.18-1233,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3176.84,3181.72,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt, five minutes."
2019.18-1233,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3181.72,3186.88,You may want to cut me off. So I -- I don't know what to say.
2019.18-1233,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3324.16,3336.0,"You're quite right that I'll read the treatises and I've read the Lemly brief, and I will read the sources, but I don't understand your statement that they would receive no damages."
2019.18-1233,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3336.0,3336.28,So --
2019.18-1233,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3336.28,3346.16,"I thought the statute, that I have in front of me, says that they're entitled to recover profits and any damages sustained."
2019.18-1233,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3346.16,3346.4,Right.
2019.18-1233,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3346.4,3353.72,"And so you don't need willfulness to recover any damages sustained, do you? Or have I miss understood what --"
2019.18-1233,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3353.72,3353.84,No.
2019.18-1233,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3354.48,3355.2,-- they're saying?
2019.18-1233,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3355.2,3366.32,-- the logic of the Respondent's argument is that the same common law rule that required willfulness for profits in the same breath said fraudulent intent was also required for damages. So it's a --
2019.18-1233,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3366.32,3368.0,All of those cases say that --
2019.18-1233,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3368.0,3369.16,All of the treatises --
2019.18-1233,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3369.16,3369.56,You're right.
2019.18-1233,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3369.56,3370.12,-- four out of the five.
2019.18-1233,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3370.12,3371.92,"All of the treatises. Yeah, forgive me."
2019.18-1233,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3371.92,3373.76,One of the cases.
2019.18-1233,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3373.76,3375.68,"Nobody is claiming, are they? I wouldn't --"
2019.18-1233,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3375.68,3375.8,Nope.
2019.18-1233,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3375.8,3376.12,No.
2019.18-1233,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3376.12,3376.4,Nope.
2019.18-1233,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3377.44,3386.76,"Nobody is claiming that you need willfulness for -- that the client, no matter how poor, no matter how -- he gets his damages, right?"
2019.18-1233,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3386.76,3387.2,Right.
2019.18-1233,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3464.44,3465.04,Ms. Blatt --
