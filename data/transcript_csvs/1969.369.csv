1969.369,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,348.283,355.319,"As the -- once having granted temporary authority, does the Commission have unlimited power to keep granting extensions?"
1969.369,0,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,355.319,361.055,Under decisions of this Court until the permanent authority case --
1969.369,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,361.055,361.964,It didn't matter --
1969.369,0,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,361.964,366.85,-- is granted.

1969.369,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1801.485,1805.009,Where is that printed?

1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.215,2445.743,"Could I just ask you, do the Commission's rules prescribe a standard, a substantive standard for when temporary authorities to be granted more specifically, do the rule say whether or not the absence of single-line service as compared with joint interline service is a basis for temporary authority?"
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2445.743,2446.58,"Yes, Your Honor, they do."
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.58,2446.583,What did they say?
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2446.583,2448.463,"That is the rule, point four."
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2448.463,2455.698,What did they say?
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2455.698,2458.328,Generally --
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.328,2461.08,They say generally that single-line -- the desire for single-line service --
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2461.08,2462.482,Is not enough.
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.482,2463.268,-- isn't enough?
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2463.268,2464.487,"No, no."
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.866,2483.474,Well now did the Defense Department say what need it had over and beyond the single-line service?
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2483.474,2486.9,The Defense Department's need over and above beyond single-line service --
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2486.9,2488.46,But that's was --
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2488.46,2489.9,They had -- they expressed so.
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.066,2503.707,I know but the single-line service isn't a reason for getting temporary authority?
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2503.707,2504.192,It is here Your Honor --
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.192,2505.352,Under your rules?
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2505.352,2530.366,"It is here Your Honor because this rule further provides that a grant of temporary authority to effect single-line service will be authorized only when it is clearly established, and there are two test that the carrier providing -- the carriers providing multiple line service are not capable of or have failed in meeting the reasonable and immediate transportation needs of the shippers."
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2530.366,2530.448,"Oh, I know --"
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2530.448,2530.836,Mr. --
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2530.836,2539.888,-- but the -- I gather the Defense Department; one of its big reasons from wanting this single-line service is just because of the single-line service?
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2539.888,2541.764,"That is not correct, Your Honor."
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.11,2554.133,"I know but that wouldn't be enough under the rules to want a temporary authority, would it?"
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2554.133,2555.126,It would be warrant.
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2557.275,2569.089,"You mean under that rule if I commence and say well the only reason I want this temporary authority is to provide the single-line service and the only reason of what single-line service, it saves time and money."
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2569.089,2573.91,"Your Honor, we would say that you would have to show what the deficiencies were."
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.91,2577.314,"Well, the only deficiency is that the other carriers are interlined."
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2579.528,2595.548,"But the question of only interlining is that were talking about here, Your Honor, vast geographical areas and commodities and for the -- for an applicant to come before the Commission and say he simply desired single-line service would not be sufficient."
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.217,2618.406,Single-line -- this rule is the need -- the desire for single-line services sometimes -- they perfectly added at places for granting a --
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2618.406,2620.777,"It could be very much so as in this case, Your Honor."
1969.369,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.777,2623.162,In spite of this rule?
1969.369,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2623.162,2640.832,"But it's not in spite of the rule, it's because of the rule, Your Honor."
1969.369,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2800.997,2806.379,"Very well, Mr. Cerra."
1969.369,2,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,2807.45,2810.087,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.369,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,5739.442,5745.119,"Mr. Chief Justice, if I -- may I just make a couple of points."
1969.369,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5800.433,5801.959,On an exempt basis.
1969.369,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,5801.959,5807.281,"On an exempt basis, and that service was being discontinued."
1969.369,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5850.08,5862.075,"But if this a default in the first place, failure to answer the questions like 8 and 9, doesn't that perhaps altered the situation somewhat?"
1969.369,3,29742,joseph_a_califano_jr,,5862.075,5876.161,"I think Mr. Chief Justice that as I've indicated in this many the appellees have considered, there's no -- if you say no efforts have been made, that's an answer to -- that's an answer to 8 and 9."
1969.369,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5944.709,5945.838,Thank you Mr. Califano.
