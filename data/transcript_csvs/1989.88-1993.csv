1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.987,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1993, Robert A. Butterworth v. Michael Smith."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,11.022,14.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1993,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,63.506,73.798,Isn't... wasn't your policy overturned solely with respect to a witness disclosing his own testimony?
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,73.798,75.248,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,104.817,110.971,"Which... which, as applied to a witness revealing his own testimony, what is the state's interest?"
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,110.971,124.647,"Your Honor, the interests are numerous, and they are borne of those general interests that are cited on pages 12 and 13 of our brief, as well as by this Court in the Douglas Oil case, with these specific additions."
1989.88-1993,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,143.942,148.596,"Well, that may be so, but why prevent a witness from revealing his own testimony?"
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,148.596,157.035,"Because if a witness may reveal his own testimony, he will be able to also implicate the questions that are asked."
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,162.004,163.272,"I don't see that, I don't see that it necessarily is."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,172.628,189.756,"--Your Honor, when we talk about testimony, that word has a certain common understanding, and that is when you look at a transcript of testimony what you see are the questions asked and the answers returned."
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.333,222.811,"Well, suppose... supposing the Florida statute had been held invalid by the Eleventh Circuit only insofar as it prevented a witness from disclosing his own testimony, but it also said that the witness, in disclosing his own testimony, could not do it in question and answer form."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,229.231,237.087,"Your Honor, the difficulty with that as I see it is that it begins to enter into legislative determinations."
1989.88-1993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,270.225,280.433,"Mr. Waas, suppose... suppose the witness does not preface his disclosure with this is what I testified to."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,294.907,295.543,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.543,296.059,It does not.
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,296.059,299.395,"And that, I believe, points out a misconception in this case."
1989.88-1993,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,328.747,329.714,"Well, let me ask you then--"
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,329.714,330.699,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,330.699,332.266,--can he disclose the fact he testified?
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,332.266,337.068,He can disclose the fact that he was called before the grand jury.
1989.88-1993,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,337.068,343.122,Could the man in this case get on a news broadcast and say I testified before the grand jury yesterday.
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,350.894,352.878,"No problem with either one of those questions, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,352.878,353.195,That would be perfectly all right?
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,353.195,354.612,"That is correct, for this reason."
1989.88-1993,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,368.086,378.128,"If that's the case, what is the state interest... I'm sorry, if your answer to me is correct, what is the state interest in saying that's all right, but it suddenly implicates a great state interest if he adds the words ""and I so testified yesterday""?"
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,378.128,379.128,"--For this reason, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,389.584,390.686,"No, this doesn't identify... just this particular case."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,395.571,407.73,"--Your Honor, your hypothetical may involve... in the skeletal posture of the questions it is quite possible that with respect to that case there would be no triggering of the interest."
1989.88-1993,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,407.73,408.18,Okay.
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,408.18,425.525,"But, as the cases which we recite in our reply brief demonstrate, the fact of the absence of any vitality of the interest justifying grand jury secrecy in a particular case doesn't mean that the interests don't exist to the point of overcoming a First Amendment claim."
1989.88-1993,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,425.525,435.215,"Can you give me a hypothetical in which the witness' description of his own testimony would imperil, after the grand jury investigation is over, would imperil the... would be contrary to the policy of the statute?"
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,435.215,436.565,"Yes, Your Honor, for this reason."
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,438.417,441.284,Justice Stevens asked you to give him a hypothetical.
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,441.284,441.718,--Yes.
1989.88-1993,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,479.743,481.445,Does he listen to all the other witnesses testify?
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,502.275,513.465,"--But, Your Honor, what has happened in that case is that at that point, because he has now learned about another person's testimony, if he were to reveal that he would be knowingly revealing grand jury testimony."
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,513.465,514.0,Well--
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,524.205,525.538,"Your Honor, that is correct."
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,532.442,535.494,"Well, but the whole law is devoted to putting parameters around things."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,547.986,590.147,"Your Honor, as I understand it, with respect to those cases involving the former CIA agent and those cases involving opportunities to engage in First Amendment activities on political... on military bases, this Court said, as I understand this, that even though the interests were not demonstrated to be viable in those cases, the interests of protecting national security and protecting military secrets were enough to overcome the First Amendment claims in those cases, even though those interests were not real and demonstrated for those particular cases."
1989.88-1993,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.147,596.634,"Well, I suppose you can't say that you are really trying to protect the life of the... of this fellow who wants to reveal his own testimony."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,624.654,633.426,"Your Honor, I understand that, and I am not suggesting that there may not be alternative policy choices available."
1989.88-1993,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.234,650.536,"Well, I was trying to give you... I was trying to give you an example where your... that would defend your position."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,650.536,688.994,"--I understand that, and I am just trying to point out that with respect to the First Amendment posture of the case, when you are talking about the vitality of those interests and apply them to particularized efforts to disclose what has become grand jury information by virtue of its having been imparted, then the question becomes whether it is more feasible for a state to protect its own interests by prohibiting public dissemination or disclosure of that which the grand jury is considering and undertaking."
1989.88-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,740.112,748.033,"Well, Mr. Waas, I suppose that that could be said of Federal investigations for violation of Federal laws in Florida."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,748.033,748.383,--That is correct.
1989.88-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,748.383,757.657,"But the Federal rule on disclosure of grand jury testimony is not as broad as you describe Florida's as being, is it?"
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,757.657,758.857,"No, that's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,758.857,766.077,"And indeed, application of the Federal rule in the State of Florida would not prohibit what Mr. Smith proposes to do."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,766.077,766.846,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,774.85,778.904,"And yet the, the public interest is the same."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,800.65,806.904,"With respect to your... the first question that you asked with respect to the Federal rule, you are quite correct."
1989.88-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,807.84,810.056,I'm talking about Florida's statute now.
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,821.914,828.42,"--Your Honor, the statute prohibits disclosure of testimony and evidence given to the grand jury."
1989.88-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,828.42,832.788,So it wouldn't prohibit disclosure of the identity of the grand jurors?
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,832.788,847.898,"If... if, within the context of questions asked by a grand juror, the identity of the grand jurors is disclosed, then, because it is testimony, to that extent--"
1989.88-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,847.898,851.267,"Well, if it isn't testimony it doesn't prohibit it."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,852.517,855.402,--The statute itself does not address identity of grand jurors.
1989.88-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,859.62,865.774,"If... if you regard those questions as testimony, I mean, that's your theory?"
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,865.774,866.341,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,879.767,882.802,"Well, I suppose the state could just say Juror Number 1, Juror Number 2."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,890.106,891.075,Quite possibly.
1989.88-1993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.55,936.104,"Mr. Waas, what was the rule about grand jury secrecy at the time the First Amendment was adopted?"
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,936.104,945.06,"As I understand it, the common law pertaining to grand juries did not preclude witnesses from testifying."
1989.88-1993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1005.197,1005.863,"Well, but it doesn't."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1010.399,1011.267,--That is correct.
1989.88-1993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1011.267,1014.386,"--that meant you would not disclose that information to anybody, didn't it?"
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1024.175,1025.859,"I am not so sure, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.859,1027.359,"Well, that's how I interpret it."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1027.359,1055.463,"I believe that any of these kinds of statutes, where a particular type of investigation is underway, be it a judicial qualifications commission or an ethics commission or an elections commission, and there is an oath that the... that the witness will not divulge that which he testified to before the forum, still has the substance of that information which is free to be disclosed because it comes from alternative sources, which this Court is most sensitive to."
1989.88-1993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.876,1080.161,There was no general prohibition.
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1092.469,1105.377,"Your Honor, I am not aware of any other secrecy standard imposed other than the one that is indicated here, and that's that a witness cannot disclose what he tells the grand jury."
1989.88-1993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1105.377,1108.329,I am asking was that the situation at common law?
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1108.329,1111.716,Under common law a witness was free to disclose.
1989.88-1993,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1117.72,1122.655,"Which would always be imposed, or which was imposed case by case?"
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1122.655,1125.79,I am not sure whether it would be imposed in all instances.
1989.88-1993,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1127.892,1130.094,Wasn't it imposed just for the life of the grand jury?
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1134.046,1137.015,The oaths of secrecy?
1989.88-1993,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1137.015,1137.498,Yes.
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1141.319,1149.656,"Your Honor, I am not sure, but I do know that the oaths now don't have a time frame established."
1989.88-1993,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1155.143,1157.595,"Your statute, as I understand it, is in perpetuity?"
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1157.595,1157.995,--That's correct.
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1158.947,1165.851,"It seems to me, Mr. Waas, that the position you contend for really has a potential for abuse."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1176.659,1177.759,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1194.703,1207.344,"So, your only quarrel then with the Eleventh Circuit's disposition of this case is that you're afraid its disposition would allow the release not only of the answers of a witness in the grand jury but the questions as well?"
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1207.344,1211.713,"--That, and the interests that surround grand jury secrecy generally."
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.713,1215.034,But... let's not get into these vague abstractions.
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1219.902,1222.704,"Your Honor, the problem with the Eleventh Circuit opinion--"
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1222.704,1224.554,Can you answer my question?
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1224.554,1224.937,--Yes.
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1224.937,1231.458,"I said what else, other than what we have just talked about, does the Eleventh Circuit's opinion forbid you to do which you want to do?"
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1231.458,1245.367,"It... it forbids the state from being able to assure, on a continuing permanent basis, that what is disclosed by witnesses before the grand jury remain before the grand jury."
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1247.985,1250.104,"But, this is a very general response, Mr. Waas."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1260.393,1260.977,That is correct.
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.977,1270.518,"But what you're afraid of is that the Eleventh Circuit's opinion will not only allow that, but it will allow disclosure of a transcript which would show questions as well as answers."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1274.303,1287.377,"When the information that is imparted contains names of persons who may be proven innocent, that is subject to disclosure before the grand jury now."
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1292.764,1298.168,"Well, but you're not going to protect the innocent accused if the guy goes out and says the same thing as he has said before the grand jury."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1301.804,1314.095,"But if it's disclosed to the grand jury it identifies potential targets, it identifies potential witnesses that... whose identity may not have been previously disclosed."
1989.88-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1351.934,1360.39,"But what you're saying is if the grand jury door is open only as far as the Eleventh Circuit opened it, it necessarily is going to be all the way open."
1989.88-1993,0,26286,george_l_waas,,1362.759,1381.537,"Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit's opinion takes away that which is available under the rule... under the Federal rule upon which Mr. Smith seeks to model Florida's law, and that is the ability to impose any kind of post-testimony protective order."
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1524.886,1529.323,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.132,1547.634,"Excuse me, I thought we just went over that."
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1554.871,1556.657,"--Your Honor, the problem with that is--"
1989.88-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1556.657,1558.509,And that is what this whole fight is about.
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1566.229,1582.022,"--Your Honor, certainly that is true, but also the problem with the ability to put into column A what he learned or knew before the grand jury and what he learned as a result of the grand jury, and differentiate that so he is not prosecuted criminally for his speech."
1989.88-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1595.648,1597.8,What he learned from the questions that people asked him?
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1597.8,1598.6,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1600.919,1606.637,How does one learn things from the questions that are asked you?
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1609.323,1610.858,"Well, certainly, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.147,1630.069,"Well, don't you... don't you agree that, or do you, that your client wants to reveal not only his testimony but the questions?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1630.069,1632.371,"Yes, Your Honor, he does want to reveal the questions too."
1989.88-1993,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1632.371,1651.435,"Do you agree with the interpretation of the statute that was given to us by the petitioners' attorney, that you... a witness can disclose the substance of his testimony, not by reference to the fact that it's testimony, but he can tell everything that he knows independently by the transaction?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1651.435,1655.887,"Your Honor, certainly if that was the case that statute would be grossly unconstitutional."
1989.88-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.348,1673.765,Just a minute.
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1676.3,1677.835,"I'm sorry, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.835,1679.202,Do you agree with that interpretation or not?
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1679.202,1680.052,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1680.052,1684.673,"And has it, has the state ever argued to the contrary before a Florida state court?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1684.673,1690.577,"Your Honor, there is no definitive interpretation of the statute in Florida state court."
1989.88-1993,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1694.945,1695.881,The state has?
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1695.881,1701.785,"Yes, Your Honor, that is, by the breadth that I just mentioned, the identities of the grand jurors and comments made."
1989.88-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1701.785,1716.71,"Well, they said... Mr. Waas said here this afternoon that the statute did not prohibit Mr. Smith from saying who the identities of the grand jurors were if he knew them."
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1716.71,1721.162,"Your Honor, that is definitely contrary to the assertion that they made in their briefs."
1989.88-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1730.352,1734.256,"Well, didn't you hear his response this afternoon to my question?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1734.256,1735.256,"Yes, Your Honor, I did."
1989.88-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1741.576,1745.695,"Well, what are we arguing about here?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1755.568,1758.151,"And the answers, Your Honor, and the ability to say I testified."
1989.88-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1758.151,1768.125,"Well, to the extent... well, I thought Mr. Waas said that he could reveal, under the statute, that he had been called to testify before the grand jury?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1768.125,1774.045,"Yes, Your Honor, but he will not concede the fact that a person can say I testified before the grand jury to the following."
1989.88-1993,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1846.875,1859.218,"What is it that you can't do under the interpretation of the Florida statute that we now have before us from your opponent, of the things you just said?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1859.218,1864.103,"I testified, Your Honor, that... and identified the assailant who was."
1989.88-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.359,1885.618,"We have rules of Court governing what our law clerks can generally disclose, and it's darn little."
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1931.731,1934.016,"Your Honor, as a former law clerk, I know the oath."
1989.88-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.061,1959.334,"Oh, so you would extend the same rule to here, then, I gather, that each individual restriction has to be justified."
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1961.367,1967.487,"Your Honor, I think there is a problem with a general rule, and especially if it is a permanent and absolute ban on speech like this one."
1989.88-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1967.487,1969.189,"Well, we better be very careful then."
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1971.141,1972.691,"Well, Your Honor, just like--"
1989.88-1993,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1972.691,1978.462,Can grand jurors be forbidden from disclosing the testimony?
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1978.462,1981.58,"--Your Honor, grand jurors are in a totally different setting than Mr. Smith."
1989.88-1993,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1981.58,1982.197,Why?
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,1982.197,1985.632,Mr. Smith comes into this proceeding having the information that is requested.
1989.88-1993,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1998.959,2000.292,"Well, suppose your same hypothetical."
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2006.113,2006.897,"Your Honor, I think--"
1989.88-1993,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2006.897,2008.397,Same horrible hypothetical.
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2008.397,2012.718,"--Your Honor, the sting that that has is that it's someone inside the grand jury itself."
1989.88-1993,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2012.718,2014.751,"Well, doesn't that make it all the more credible?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2014.751,2023.407,"Your Honor, it does, and that is why this Court can restrict the First Amendment speech to a grand juror to a much greater extent than it can to a witness."
1989.88-1993,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2024.526,2026.943,We restrict the most credible speech and not the least credible speech?
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2029.411,2032.697,"--Well, I thought the most credible speech here, Your Honor, would be the witness, the victim."
1989.88-1993,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2038.182,2039.117,"Well, we're quibbling about the hypothetical."
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2043.736,2049.906,"--Your Honor, I think because the grand juror hears all the testimony."
1989.88-1993,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2054.393,2057.411,"So if you had three witnesses, they could all testify, but not the grand juror?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2057.411,2058.311,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.313,2088.681,And what if a reporter... your client is a reporter?
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2088.681,2089.217,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2089.217,2098.738,He gives his testimony and he... the grand jury... the state wants to know where he got his information.
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2117.284,2124.271,"Your Honors' decision I think in Branzburg v. Hayes decided that question, Your Honor, almost 16 years ago."
1989.88-1993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.271,2132.294,I just want to know what your... do you think the state has an interest then in not having him reveal his testimony?
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2132.294,2134.746,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.092,2160.377,What about confidential advice to the President?
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2184.075,2195.531,"--Your Honor, if the person that you are speaking of is a member of government and has acquired information as a government employee, then I think that a greater degree of breadth of secrecy could be imposed."
1989.88-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.695,2228.604,"I agree that the interest may be different, but it doesn't seem to me that we're constrained by our First Amendment law to apply a piece-by-piece approach as you are urging upon us."
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2244.114,2251.868,"Well, Your Honor, the problem is... with general rules... is here the chilling effect is substantial in its breadth."
1989.88-1993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.03,2326.35,"You don't make a distinction between the reporter and the... any other citizen, do you?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2326.35,2330.302,"No, Your Honor, the same First Amendment privilege here would apply equally."
1989.88-1993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2330.302,2343.978,"So, if your reporter finds... knows that there was a witness who testified before the grand jury and he talks to him, the witness should be able to tell the reporter that, without violating this statute you think, that yes, I testified and here is what I said."
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2343.978,2351.132,"Your Honor, I think that puts us right in the middle of Landmark Communications sort of territory and not in the situation that we're in now."
1989.88-1993,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2357.369,2369.594,"Is the state's interest in preventing targets from becoming fugitives substantially satisfied because in many cases they make the arrest before the indictment, before the grand jury proceeding?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2369.594,2391.626,"Your Honor, certainly they make arrest prior to the indictment, but I think this Court affirmed, I think it's called Worrell Newspapers v. Westhafer, you affirmed a Seventh Circuit decision, although you didn't ride on it, where there was a statute that permitted... that prohibited anyone from revealing the fact that a sealed indictment had been returned against an individual."
1989.88-1993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2419.277,2426.965,"Well, I gather then that you wouldn't object to preventing your client from publishing this story while the grand jury was still in session?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2426.965,2429.834,"Your Honor, I don't think I'd concede that."
1989.88-1993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.921,2438.69,"Well, what is your position?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2439.69,2440.023,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2449.562,2461.269,"What about... what's your position about your client publishing what he learned before the grand jury, if he did learn anything?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2461.269,2464.305,"Your Honor, I think he should certainly be able to publish what he learned."
1989.88-1993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2478.231,2504.815,"Well, he can... after... I take it that you would say that even during... when the grand jury is still in session, if he knows who a witness is or has been before the grand jury, he can talk to that witness and that witness, as you say, is free to, you think, to talk during... and so your client learns that testimony and he publishes it."
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2504.815,2506.115,"Yes, Your Honor, and that's--"
1989.88-1993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2506.115,2508.417,Either during the grand jury or after it.
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2508.417,2511.369,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that's certainly the way it is in the Federal system."
1989.88-1993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.809,2551.409,"Well, the witness might be able to do that, but you wouldn't contend that the prosecutor--"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2551.409,2552.844,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.844,2554.061,--or the reporter.
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2554.061,2554.611,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.604,2571.972,"Mr. Waas, what did it mean in 1791, or do you know what the common law was?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2578.376,2579.578,"Yes, Your Honor, I think I do."
1989.88-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2579.578,2583.864,"That is, you could... you could disclose everything unless you were put under oath?"
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2583.864,2586.565,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that's the way common law is."
1989.88-1993,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2604.36,2608.079,Any indication that that oath survived the term of the grand jury?
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2608.079,2611.966,"Your Honor, I do not know the answer to that question."
1989.88-1993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.966,2626.274,"May I ask you to go back to the question that your opponent was asked at the beginning of the argument about whether the statute applies to the content of testimony when the... when the former witness doesn't say ""and I so testified"", but just talks."
1989.88-1993,1,26205,gregg_darrow_thomas,,2646.537,2647.337,"It's she, Your Honor."
1989.88-1993,2,26286,george_l_waas,,2753.658,2754.941,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-1993,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2878.386,2892.646,"I suppose if we said that the witness can say that he appeared before the grand jury and he said thus and so, there would be very little reason for Florida to prohibit anybody else from saying that he appeared before the grand jury and said thus and so."
1989.88-1993,2,26286,george_l_waas,,2905.287,2906.42,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's my point."
1989.88-1993,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2910.774,2915.659,"--Yes, but there's a big state interest in protecting the witness in many cases, and lots of times a witness isn't going to tell."
1989.88-1993,2,26286,george_l_waas,,2926.033,2934.889,"--That may be true, except that in the First Amendment context it is not so much who is doing the disclosure, but what is disclosed."
1989.88-1993,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2935.556,2939.775,"Well, certainly it is, because if the witness fears for his life, he is not going to disclose."
1989.88-1993,2,26286,george_l_waas,,2942.227,2942.677,--That is correct.
1989.88-1993,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2950.166,2955.469,"But nobody is questioning the validity of the statute as applied to grand jurors, court reporters, stenographers, everyone else."
1989.88-1993,2,26286,george_l_waas,,2958.838,2960.54,--That's correct.
1989.88-1993,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2962.023,2968.277,"What will happen if grand jury, five years later, calls this man."
1989.88-1993,2,26286,george_l_waas,,2972.514,2985.256,"If, five years later, he is called to testify, he would not be able to disclose the fact that he testified before the grand jury with respect to the testimony that he imparts to the grand jury."
1989.88-1993,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2985.256,2986.106,Isn't that rather silly?
1989.88-1993,2,26286,george_l_waas,,2987.191,2992.493,"Well, Your Honor, if you're looking at a time constraint--"
