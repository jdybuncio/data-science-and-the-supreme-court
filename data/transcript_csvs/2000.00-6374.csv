2000.00-6374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.68,"We'll hear argument now in No. 00-6374, Dale Becker v. Betty Montgomery."
2000.00-6374,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,8.711,13.541,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-6374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,75.38,80.248,"I should know this... when you file a notice of appeal, do you file with the district court?"
2000.00-6374,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,80.248,81.157,"You do, Your Honor."
2000.00-6374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,81.157,83.22,So Rule 11 applies at that point?
2000.00-6374,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,83.22,85.328,It does technically.
2000.00-6374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,112.82,119.258,If I were on the court of appeals and I thought that Rule 11 requires a signature--
2000.00-6374,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,119.258,120.91,Handwritten signature.
2000.00-6374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,120.91,124.709,"--and I was a little fussy about it, what would I do?"
2000.00-6374,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,132.344,143.035,"It is problematic, Your Honor, and I think the answer is Appellate Rule 1 which does, as I noted, make clear that you do have to comply with the district court rules and the Rules of Civil Procedure."
2000.00-6374,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,157.153,158.805,"And please clean up your act a little, okay?"
2000.00-6374,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,158.805,159.26,Well--
2000.00-6374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,159.26,161.405,Clean... clean it up within thirty days.
2000.00-6374,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,170.034,175.152,"--Your Honor, the only thing that has to be done within thirty days is to make sure you've established an intent to appeal."
2000.00-6374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,177.752,182.044,Does it say that... it says you have to establish an intent to appeal within thirty days?
2000.00-6374,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,193.44,204.502,"--Well, as this Court has construed Rule 4 and Rule 3 of the Appellate Rules in Smith and Torres, it has said the touchstone for jurisdiction is to establish the intent to appeal within thirty days."
2000.00-6374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,204.957,206.731,I don't know how good law Smith is.
2000.00-6374,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,206.731,209.869,--You don't know how good law Smith is?
2000.00-6374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,209.869,210.241,Yeah.
2000.00-6374,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,216.807,220.727,"Well, I may be referring to the wrong Smith decision."
2000.00-6374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,249.006,251.44,I wasn't referring to Smith.
2000.00-6374,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,251.44,257.096,"--I do think there are some older cases that aren't necessarily reflected in the current rules, but--"
2000.00-6374,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,257.096,275.96,"Mr. Sutton, could we go back to your answer to Justice Kennedy about Rule 11... isn't the answer on the other side that once you file the notice of appeal, authority over the case passes from the district court to the court of appeals, so at that point, up until the notice of appeal, you're in the district court."
2000.00-6374,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,292.596,301.967,"--And Your Honor, that is why I was relying on Appellate Rule 1 which incorporates those rules, and that would therefore give appellate courts authority to make sure that someone did correct the signature."
2000.00-6374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.998,317.199,"Of course, I suppose if you haven't filed a proper notice of appeal, you're still in the district court."
2000.00-6374,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,328.716,340.317,"What the court has said and what the rules reflect is that as soon as the district court clerk receives the notice of appeal, it doesn't say anything about validity, it is immediately sent to the court of appeals."
2000.00-6374,1,40973,stewart_a_baker,,1571.67,1576.993,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-6374,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3186.648,3187.68,A few brief points.
2000.00-6374,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3263.098,3265.121,"Thank you, Mr. Sutton."
