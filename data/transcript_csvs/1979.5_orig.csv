1979.5_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,90.493,We will hear argument next in United States v. California.
1979.5_orig,0,29257,john_briscoe,,95.991,99.415,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,533.231,540.067,"The Santa Barbara Biltmore pier was never used for navigation, was it?"
1979.5_orig,0,29257,john_briscoe,,540.067,541.243,"Yes, it was."
1979.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,561.291,564.143,"Well, to just dock at the pier, so to speak?"
1979.5_orig,0,29257,john_briscoe,,564.143,567.094,Yes.
1979.5_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,614.718,618.542,What are the dimensions of these five piers roughly?
1979.5_orig,0,29257,john_briscoe,,618.542,631.889,"I believe -- if any of you have noticed the blue binder, I believe that is Exhibit I, it has photographs and it has all the specifications and historic data, and so forth, on the piers."
1979.5_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,651.567,654.005,What did you refer to?
1979.5_orig,0,29257,john_briscoe,,654.005,654.818,Exhibit I.
1979.5_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,662.86,664.314,Is there one for each of us?
1979.5_orig,0,29257,john_briscoe,,664.314,664.744,Pardon?
1979.5_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,664.744,666.083,Is there one for each of us?
1979.5_orig,0,29257,john_briscoe,,666.083,667.724,"No, I'm sorry, there's not."
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1779.357,1782.488,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.5_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1899.504,1910.139,"Well, some of those things you were just describing are put there for the very purpose of developing accretions to the land, are they not?"
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1910.139,1911.625,"Quite true, Your Honor."
1979.5_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1911.625,1916.466,"That is, the sand that is carried and the silt carried on the waves."
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1916.466,1918.355,That is correct.
1979.5_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1918.355,1923.395,"Now, you say there is no such function of the --"
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1923.395,1925.676,these piers have no such function.
1979.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2023.472,2029.995,"What about a breakwater that extends out to sea, slants off the shore and creates some calm water behind it?"
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2029.995,2036.442,That would be an Article 3 structure if it were attached to the shore and it were a solid structure extending into the water.
1979.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2039.994,2041.771,The only thing is it isn't on posts.
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2041.771,2043.285,Correct.
1979.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2043.285,2052.795,"But it goes out and if a pier went out out in exactly the same direction, you would say it is not -- did not extend the waterline?"
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2052.795,2055.166,"That is correct, for the simple reason --"
1979.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2055.166,2066.658,But a breakwater would even though all the ships did was come around the breakwater and anchor just inside the breakwater and unload by boat?
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2066.658,2069.594,The pier could not extend the base line and I would like to --
1979.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2069.594,2070.685,But the breakwater could?
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2070.685,2073.975,"The breakwater could, and this is the common sense of that distinction."
1979.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2074.444,2077.331,"It is just like the Revenue Code, that is just because it is."
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2077.331,2080.231,The pier doesn't displace the low water mark.
1979.5_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2092.004,2092.902,"Oh, no."
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2097.355,2102.135,"But you don't, Your Honor, behind a solid peninsula that extends into the ocean."
1979.5_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2105.4,2108.323,"No, this is just a line."
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2116.319,2117.644,"Well, if it is perpendicular --"
1979.5_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.644,2120.149,"No, it isn't perfectly perpendicular."
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2129.535,2157.197,"Well, that structure could well be an Article 8 harbor structure, but it would also in our view be an Article 3 structure because it displaces the water for its whole extent, and the very tip of it would be -- you could trace low water line around the whole of this structure and that, after all, is the standard that is contained in Article 3 and in the statute, where is the low water line, does it follow the structure or does it flow under the structure, and in this case it goes right under the structure without hindrance."
1979.5_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2157.197,2170.688,"What if you had a pier built of solid wood pilings, not pilings or posts every 20 feet but simply solid?"
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2170.688,2173.67,"A solid wooden structure, assuming it could be constructed and stay up --"
1979.5_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.67,2176.461,Like a cement pier that went right out --
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2176.461,2186.247,"That structure would be an Article 3 structure, there would be no question that that structure would displace the water with solid land and would displace the low water line at the tip of that structure."
1979.5_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2188.043,2190.083,So if I built a wooden pier.
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2196.796,2198.104,It is an Article 3 structure.
1979.5_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2198.104,2199.058,It extends the coastline.
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2199.058,2200.399,It does indeed.
1979.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2344.688,2346.512,Do you say those are Article 3 structures?
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2346.512,2347.57,Those are Article 3 structures.
1979.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.57,2349.132,What are Article 3 structures?
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2349.132,2354.936,Article 3 structures are solid land masses that displace the low water line.
1979.5_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2358.772,2369.839,"Well, would they be equivalent to the small peninsulas that are developed by the groins or the sand gradually builds up along side of them?"
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2369.839,2383.047,"That would be a perfect example of an Article 3 structure, any solid mass that begins on the land and continues into the water and pushes back the water, changes the location of the low water line, would be an Article 3 structure."
1979.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2503.179,2510.86,You don't deny that at least some of these piers are used regularly by ships?
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2510.86,2515.26,Five of them are used and tied up regularly for exchanging passengers and cargo.
1979.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2515.26,2518.594,"And if you define port like your colleague, they are ports?"
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2518.594,2524.623,"That's true, Your Honor, but the dictionary defines the word differently and it --"
1979.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2524.623,2527.911,"Is the word ""port"" used in the convention?"
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2527.911,2532.218,"The word ""harbor"" is used in the English version and ""port"" appears in the French version."
1979.5_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2568.991,2575.751,"I suppose if these piers would be ports and hence extend the coastline, one of these deep water ports would be a --"
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2575.751,2576.613,Precisely.
1979.5_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2584.402,2587.546,Or any anchored buoy to which a ship could tie out in the --
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2587.546,2589.681,Precisely.
1979.5_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2637.363,2641.619,Is that in part because they are not connected with the mainland?
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2641.619,2661.844,"That is correct, but California's view of a port is any place where boats anchor and load and unload, in our view is over-broad because it would embrace many structures totally unconnected with land or structures that are nothing but pipes that run from the land undersea out to a deep water anchorage where boats can pump petroleum."
1979.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.767,2847.441,"Mr. Shapiro, I just missed it."
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2851.457,2861.804,It is appontement.
1979.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2861.804,2862.647,A bridge.
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2863.163,2863.554,Right.
1979.5_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3138.131,3144.649,Do you suggest California would be bound by the American position in those treaty negotiations?
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3144.649,3146.221,"We don't suggest that, Your Honor."
1979.5_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3151.817,3156.118,"It is a bargaining process, is it not, not a judicial --"
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3156.118,3157.773,A bargaining process?
1979.5_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3157.773,3163.691,"The American position, the U.S. position was a bargaining position."
1979.5_orig,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3163.691,3173.232,We took a bargaining position that was disadvantageous to ourselves because we believed that it was wrong to use structures of this kind as a matter of international law.
1979.5_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3239.971,3241.802,You have about three minutes remaining.
1979.5_orig,2,29257,john_briscoe,,3241.802,3244.009,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.5_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3256.238,3259.14,I didn't read his suggestion that way.
1979.5_orig,2,29257,john_briscoe,,3262.402,3265.689,"Well, I would characterize it that way too."
1979.5_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.278,3306.776,"But we have in our cases turned to the convention, haven't we?"
1979.5_orig,2,29257,john_briscoe,,3306.776,3307.605,"Oh, yes."
1979.5_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.605,3313.325,And the question arises what do some of the words mean in the convention to which we have turned for guidance.
1979.5_orig,2,29257,john_briscoe,,3313.325,3314.41,That's correct.
1979.5_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3314.41,3325.441,And the people who negotiated and signed that convention and used those words perhaps have some notion about what they meant.
1979.5_orig,2,29257,john_briscoe,,3325.441,3336.1,"Well, we would suggest that also the British government, which takes the opposite view, that piers ought to be treated as parts of the coast, whether they are port piers or recreational piers --"
1979.5_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.1,3336.71,I agree.
1979.5_orig,2,29257,john_briscoe,,3347.501,3356.688,"Well, the parties that negotiated the treaty with Mexico, which Mr. Shapiro referred to, were not the parties who negotiated the Geneva Convention."
1979.5_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3391.966,3392.612,"Thank you, gentlemen."
