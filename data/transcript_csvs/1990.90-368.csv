1990.90-368,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.149,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-368, Sheldon Baruch Toibb v. Stuart Radloff."
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,55.97,59.61,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.578,208.328,"Mr. Lieb, if you're right, does this mean that consumer debtors can be placed into involuntary bankruptcy under chapter 11 by creditors?"
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,208.328,213.19,"--It does mean that, although we think it's unlikely that that will happen very often."
1990.90-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,213.19,214.622,Why is that?
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,214.622,233.994,"Because... because... for the same reasons that we think that consumers will not generally... well, it doesn't generally make sense for a consumer to use chapter 11 because of the complexity and the length of a chapter 11 proceeding."
1990.90-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,247.143,254.858,"Well, Congress certainly expressly rejected that under chapter 13, didn't it?"
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,254.858,263.072,"Congress did reject that in chapter 13, but there were peculiar reasons for rejecting that in chapter 13 which don't apply in chapter 11."
1990.90-368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.075,467.326,"Well, in your example about your property, why would the debtor... if it's going to be sold in one proceeding or another, why would it, why would he want to sell it in chapter 11 rather than chapter 7?"
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,467.326,469.129,"--Well, in a--"
1990.90-368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.129,470.307,Just to help the creditor?
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,470.307,484.757,"--Well, the... if I take it your question is asked what is the individual debtor's motive, the motive is to yield as much as possible to pay off his creditors in full and hopefully to regain some of the value that may exist in the asset."
1990.90-368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,484.757,498.528,"I thought maybe his desire would be to retain the property for himself and maybe, maybe he's got... he obviously doesn't have a steady income or he'd be in 13, I suppose."
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,498.528,499.287,Well--
1990.90-368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,499.287,501.691,But it may be he has potential to earn money--
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,501.691,503.5,"--Well, it's--"
1990.90-368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,503.5,504.94,--and pay off his creditors in full.
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,504.94,513.407,"--That's another scenario where it might make sense, although in this case because of the individual debtor's high level of debt he wouldn't qualify for chapter 13."
1990.90-368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,516.018,519.52,But he can get in chapter 11.
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,519.52,520.941,He can get into--
1990.90-368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.941,521.602,You think.
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,521.602,523.823,--We submit that he can get into chapter 11.
1990.90-368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,547.209,553.652,What does he have to show to get a plan approved under chapter 11?
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,553.652,559.737,"Well, what he has to do is provide a disclosure statement which is approved by the court."
1990.90-368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.141,569.414,"And he can scale down the unsecured, I suppose, if he can--"
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,569.414,577.629,"--Well, he can't scale down the unsecured creditors to such an extent that they would get less in chapter 11 than in chapter 7--"
1990.90-368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,577.629,578.069,--Yes.
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,578.069,579.63,--because of the best interest test.
1990.90-368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.63,580.09,Sure.
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,580.09,588.615,But he... so his plan must at least provide the same amount that a hypothetical chapter 7 debtor would... creditor would receive.
1990.90-368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,588.615,590.188,Before the credit down operates.
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,590.188,590.816,That's correct.
1990.90-368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.618,595.851,And he can't scale down secured creditors?
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,598.552,614.632,"--He can postpone secured creditors, and secured creditors... I mean, if secured creditors feel like they are not getting as much as they are entitled to, they may, they can vote against the plan and prevent it from being confirmed."
1990.90-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,619.086,626.84,Can the creditors clearly prohibit the chapter 11 plan if they choose?
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,626.84,637.626,"--If a sufficient number or amount of creditors in one class votes against it, then they can prevent the plan from being confirmed."
1990.90-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.626,644.582,"Well, what if all there is basically is some consumer debt and a home with a mortgage on it?"
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,644.582,645.754,Right.
1990.90-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,645.754,650.215,Can the holder of the mortgage prevent the chapter 11?
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,650.215,662.774,"It, I think it depends on whether the... on the given facts of the case and whether, for example, the consumer debt and the mortgage debt are lumped into one class."
1990.90-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,663.695,666.197,"Well, what is normally done in that regard?"
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,666.197,673.179,--I think in... that secured creditors are often considered in a different class.
1990.90-368,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,688.2,706.332,"Well, under chapter 11 I take it the debtor can propose and the court can approve a lower rate of interest on the mortgage, and can modify the maturity of the debt?"
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,706.332,724.995,"A debtor could propose that, but if, for example, the secured, the mortgagee would not receive the same amount doing the arithmetic that he would receive in a chapter 7 liquidation and decided to object, the plan can't be confirmed, pursuant to section 1129."
1990.90-368,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,939.023,940.385,"Very well, Mr. Lieb."
1990.90-368,0,38089,peter_m_lieb,,941.606,942.508,Thank you.
1990.90-368,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,942.508,953.815,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-368,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,964.851,969.135,"What does the term Mr. Marzen, as you just used it?"
1990.90-368,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,970.175,975.31,--It's actually defined in the Bankruptcy Code itself under 1017.
1990.90-368,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,975.31,976.379,How is it defined?
1990.90-368,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,976.379,981.863,"It's defined to mean debts contracted primarily for a personal, family, or household obligation."
1990.90-368,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,983.845,989.318,"So then a mom and pop store, its indebtedness would be a consumer debt?"
1990.90-368,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,989.318,992.251,--A mom and pop store could have business debts and consumer debts.
1990.90-368,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.251,995.142,But they would be distinct from one another?
1990.90-368,1,41785,stephen_j_marzen,,995.142,995.924,Yes.
1990.90-368,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1339.058,1340.818,"Thank you, Mr. Marzen."
1990.90-368,2,30691,james_hamilton,,1343.039,1349.213,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-368,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.24,1787.319,"Mr. Hamilton, what is your response to a point made by Mr. Marzen that if we accepted your contention we would be establishing kind of a very difficult jurisdictional test?"
1990.90-368,2,30691,james_hamilton,,1791.601,1795.565,"Well, this is obviously, Mr. Chief Justice, a factual question."
1990.90-368,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.718,1832.028,"The difficulty with having it such a heavily factual question is, of course, that the bankruptcy court might rule one way and a district court or court of appeals reviewing the judgment another way, and you might just have a lot of wheel spinning."
1990.90-368,2,30691,james_hamilton,,1832.028,1834.191,You may have factual questions.
1990.90-368,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1840.954,1845.848,Courts that have followed the Eighth Circuit rule in this case?
1990.90-368,2,30691,james_hamilton,,1845.848,1846.76,"That's correct, yes."
1990.90-368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1930.632,1933.583,Would that be provided they don't have regular income?
1990.90-368,2,30691,james_hamilton,,1933.583,1935.675,"That would be one reason, yes."
1990.90-368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.783,2335.827,But that's only if some feasible plan to pay off these debts over a period of time.
1990.90-368,2,30691,james_hamilton,,2335.827,2353.298,"Well, I... assuming that the plan that he has suggested would be approved by the court, then he would protect his asset, his stock, he would protect any post-petition income he might make, regardless of the amount."
1990.90-368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.298,2356.381,But the creditors would get more than they would get in chapter 7?
1990.90-368,2,30691,james_hamilton,,2356.381,2361.874,"They would get the same thing under his plan, because... they would get $25,000, basically, minus some expenses."
1990.90-368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.874,2363.795,But they wouldn't lose anything?
1990.90-368,2,30691,james_hamilton,,2363.795,2365.928,They wouldn't lose anything in the circumstances.
1990.90-368,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.928,2368.018,Except the time when they would get it.
1990.90-368,2,30691,james_hamilton,,2368.018,2373.132,"The time might be different, yes, depending on how long it took the plan to be worked out."
1990.90-368,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2382.047,2387.63,To what extent can the creditors prevent the chapter 11 proceeding?
1990.90-368,2,30691,james_hamilton,,2387.63,2394.495,"Well, the creditors of course, classes of creditors can object by a vote."
1990.90-368,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2409.916,2414.698,"If that's so, then what's the harm in it?"
1990.90-368,2,30691,james_hamilton,,2414.698,2417.98,What is the harm?
1990.90-368,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2445.92,2454.385,"Well, I suppose one way of trying to ascertain Congress' intent once we start speculating about it is to ask the question Justice O'Connor asked."
1990.90-368,2,30691,james_hamilton,,2462.97,2466.042,They may well have asked that question.
1990.90-368,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2561.365,2563.226,"Thank you, Mr. Hamilton."
1990.90-368,3,38089,peter_m_lieb,,2569.3,2573.522,"Mr. Chief Justice, I have nothing further to add unless there are any questions that the court has."
1990.90-368,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2573.522,2575.164,Very well.
