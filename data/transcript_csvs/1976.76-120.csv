1976.76-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.557,"We will hear arguments now in 76-120, United States against Martin Linens Supply Co. and May I say to counsel in this case and the other cases scheduled for today."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,42.693,46.224,"Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the court."
1976.76-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,276.346,296.647,"In your view Mr. Easterbrook, I assume at the stage of trial that the jury announced it was deadlocked, was there an authority in the judge to at that point direct a verdict of acquittal?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,296.647,304.502,"Your Honor, directed verdicts of acquittal by the jury were abolished by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 (A) and therefore in our view, he did not have such authority."
1976.76-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,304.502,310.041,"Well, he had no authority at that stage to terminate the proceedings by an acquittal?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,310.041,312.895,Not by a directed verdict to acquittal.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,340.134,346.704,But the motion is filed within seven days as provided by Rule 29 (c)?
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,346.704,348.104,"Yes, it was Your Honor."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,348.104,350.73,The motion for judgment of acquittal.
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,350.73,351.84,Yes.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,351.84,353.257,And that motion was granted.
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,353.257,357.715,It was indeed and we think that that kind of decision can be appealed.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,357.715,358.269,I know you do.
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,358.269,367.941,But before I come to that I would like to discuss two issues that are lurking in the background of this case but that we think the court need not to address.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,452.039,458.526,"Well, the argument in your brief under A would cover a mid-trial termination?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,458.526,458.646,Yes.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,459.367,467.28,"It is only the argument under B that would cover this case, but not a mid-trial."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,468.492,470.678,We are not at all abandoning that argument.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,476.481,478.806,But you are talking about a mid-trial termination?
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,478.806,481.226,But we do not believe it is necessary to reach that question in this case.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,481.226,484.014,"But if we access your argument A, we have reached the question, have we not?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,484.014,494.003,"That is correct, but I think it is more appropriate for me to make here at a greater length the narrower arguments that would avoid the necessity to reach that particular one."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,506.176,508.011,"That is involved in the Brown case, is it not?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,508.011,509.051,The same issue was involved.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,509.051,511.02,Decision for certiorari is pending here?
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,511.02,512.289,Yes Your Honor.
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.344,609.087,"Mr. Easterbrook before you get too deeply into the double jeopardy argument, do not you have a statutory problem?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,613.334,617.938,Our statutory authority is the first paragraph of the criminal appeals act.
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,658.918,662.754,"In Wilson, it did not occur in effect that it was a dismissal of the indictment?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,662.754,665.244,The court held that it did not make any difference I think.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,754.473,774.84,In the Jorn case the District Court as I remember had dismissed indictment because he thought that a new trial was constitutionally impermissible under the double jeopardy clause and that view was ultimately affirmed in this court.
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,791.79,793.02,Yes Your Honor.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,815.219,816.728,And that argument was ultimately rejected.
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,816.728,817.89,Right.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,827.022,839.229,"Well, here the argument is, I do not know whose argument you are talking about, here your opponent’s argument is that the double jeopardy clause bars a new trial because there has been a judgment of acquittal, of not guilty."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,839.229,851.854,"Right and that presents the question whether the double jeopardy clause independently bars review of the judges’ findings, even if the second trial would not by itself violate the clause."
1976.76-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,851.854,856.28,What is effect of the finding of acquittal?
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,856.28,858.002,Assuming that the judgment is not…
1976.76-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,858.002,860.781,Does it mean not guilty?
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,860.781,862.946,It means in this case that according…
1976.76-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,862.946,864.526,It means that he goes free?
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,864.526,867.049,"It means the defendants go free, That is right."
1976.76-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,867.049,869.333,And cannot be tried again on that charge?
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,869.333,872.724,And cannot be tried again unless we prevail on appeal.
1976.76-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,905.092,911.042,"But the Rule 29 (c), what was the purpose of it?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,911.042,927.242,"Rule 29 (c) was to bring proceedings to a close in the case where the government did not have a case and I would like to make one thing quite clear in case if there is any misunderstanding, we do not contend that a second trial should be held automatically after there is a mistrial declared."
1976.76-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,947.021,952.234,"At what stage, at what point precisely did the district judge do that?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,952.234,964.529,"The District Judge has power under Rule 29 (c) to enter a judgment of acquittal at any time during the trial when the motion is made, and on a motion made within seven days after trial."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,986.967,996.317,"Mr. Easterbrook, you told us at the beginning that in entering the order the District Court wrote no opinion, but I cannot even find copy of the order here."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,996.317,999.281,Copy of the order is in our petition for writ of certiorari.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,999.281,1001.192,I could not see that.
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1001.192,1020.541,"Towards the rear, it is at pages 40 (a) to 43 (a), there are two separate orders, they are both denominated judgments of acquittal and in both of those orders the judge recites that the reasons stated in the motions for judgments of acquittal are good and valid and that further this defendant is not guilty."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1020.541,1022.096,And he used the phrase Not Guilty.
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1022.096,1023.551,That is right.
1976.76-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.551,1042.71,"Mr. Easterbrook, would you be making the same argument if there has been mistrial, but the judge had just exercised his power to enter a judgment of acquittal or when the jury reported that they were deadlocked, that would be the mistrial sort of thing?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1042.71,1051.636,"Well, our position is that once the jury deadlocked, the fact of the deadlock is the manifest necessity to create the right to a second trial."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1079.685,1115.722,"You told us that the federal rules have abolished the directed verdict of acquittal, but up until recently there was such a thing as a directed verdict of acquittal and had the district judge done that when the jury reported they were deadlocked had he then on motion or without motion said well, I have considered all the evidence and I hereby direct you to reach the verdict of acquittal, that functionally would be precisely the same as this case, would it not?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1115.722,1118.149,"No, it would not Your Honor."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1131.538,1135.437,"In that case first, and then you would involve in any or all of the hypothetical as you want."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1135.437,1142.332,I think your case is the case in which the judge sends the jury out to consider under outrageously erroneous instructions.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1146.719,1160.086,"Now, this is after the jury comes back and says we are deadlocked, we can not reach a verdict and the judge says, well, that was nearly a motion of acquittal and I had it under consideration and I now direct you to reach a verdict of acquittal."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1160.086,1161.501,And he sends the jury out to do that.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1161.501,1164.194,"Well, even if he does not, generally he used an open court."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1164.194,1169.097,"Alright, at that point, our argument is the same as the argument here and in our view, it is no longer…"
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1169.097,1173.96,"It was directed jury verdict of acquittal, why is not that a Fong Foo case?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1173.96,1179.875,"The Fong Foo case was a case in which that happened in mid-trial, before the jury said it was unable to agree."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1215.852,1224.647,"Hypothesis is that the jury does not agree and the judge at that point says, well I am going to direct you to enter a verdict of acquittal."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1224.647,1232.919,"It is our view Mr. Justice Stewart that what happens after the jury is unable to agree, is where double jeopardy purpose is immaterial."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1232.919,1235.484,"That is what I thought, even though it is an instructive verdict of acquittal."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1235.484,1238.465,"Even though it is an instructed verdict, but it is not this case."
1976.76-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1238.465,1241.031,(Inaudible)
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1241.031,1242.21,"No, Your Honor, I do not believe so."
1976.76-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1242.21,1247.333,(Inaudible) says specifically that you can do it after the jury is deadlocked.
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1247.333,1249.429,"Yes, Your Honor and we agree entirely with that."
1976.76-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1266.621,1276.369,That gives you judgment of the given case before (Inaudible)
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1276.369,1289.026,"Your Honor, in our view that is a much more difficult case because if he simply does it on his own, it deprives the defendant of his right to receive the verdict of the jury, something he was not deprived of here."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1289.026,1291.033,He has not been deprvied of it very much to get it directed.
1976.76-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1291.033,1294.783,"What verdict of the jury is not here, you have not gotten any verdict either."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1294.783,1299.274,"That is correct, just because the jury was unable to reach a verdict and that is the same as in any mistrial case."
1976.76-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1299.274,1308.435,It happens that the jury have afforded an (Inaudible).
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1308.435,1309.605,"No, Your Honor."
1976.76-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1315.867,1328.67,If he grants the judgment of (Inaudible) as the jury would allow (Inaudible).
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1328.67,1329.25,Yes Your Honor.
1976.76-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1329.25,1333.244,And then nothing (Inaudible)
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1333.244,1335.952,We do not agree with that proposition Your Honor.
1976.76-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1346.948,1367.654,"In my hypothetical case, defendants have not opened their mouth, but as the case is ended and both sides rest, the judge says, I will not cross, leave this to the jury, I would cross with the jury and I grant a judgment of acquittal."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1367.654,1373.356,"Your Honor, in our view, we probably cannot appeal that judgment, if the defendants have not opened their mouths."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1373.356,1376.496,"Right, but what did the defendant do here?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1376.496,1377.669,There are two differences.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1387.565,1396.855,"Well, in my case, would it normally be the defense counsel make such a motion at the end of the criminal trial, does he usually do this?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1396.855,1402.139,"It is common Your Honor, but the defense counsel also has the option to ask the jury first and then ask…"
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1402.139,1408.383,"Well, if you we ask for judgment of acquittal, he can be retried."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1408.383,1415.988,"If the judgment of acquittal is granted and if he was not entitled to it, those are two important preconditions in our view."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1432.637,1434.929,"Well, he is not that complaining about anything he has been deprived of?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1434.929,1440.557,"I know I was – I am sorry, I was dealing with Mr. Justice Marshall’s hypothetical and that again is not this case, I would like to return."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1440.557,1445.299,"Of course the defendant asked for a verdict of acquittal from a very moment he pleads not guilty, does he not?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1450.025,1451.661,But he usually has his choice of time.
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1451.661,1452.866,Ask to be acquitted.
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1452.866,1455.697,"Mr. Justice Stewart, he usually has his choice of timing."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1481.397,1495.174,"The same case is relevant here, one could analyze his motion for a directed verdict for acquittal as a position at that time, I am not going to waive the jury and ask the judge."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1495.174,1505.711,"But unless the prosecution agrees to do that, the prosecution also has a right to have the case go to the jury which is what upheld in Singer and we have indeed relied on Singer in this case."
1976.76-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1505.711,1506.424,You have?
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1506.424,1508.156,Yes we have.
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1564.116,1576.809,"Mr. Easterbrook, I have to interrupt you because you had called my attention to the Wilson case and the court describes the order of the District Court as the dismissal of the indictment at two or three places at the beginning of the opinion, where do you find that was a judgment?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1576.809,1584.351,"Your Honor, the judgment entered in Wilson was denominated by the judge as a judgment of acquittal."
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.351,1587.497,"It was on the ground, was it not that there was unreasonable delay in final hearing?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1587.497,1588.409,Yes it was…
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.409,1592.083,"So, that is certainly and normally, be properly called the dismissal."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1592.083,1598.302,"We argued in Wilson that that is what it was really, functionally a judgment of dismissal and it was not a judgment --"
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.302,1600.084,That is not true as this case --
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1600.084,1602.287,"That is correct, but my --"
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1602.287,1604.738,You have a statutory problem.
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1604.738,1617.002,My use of Wilson for that purpose was because we have had in Wilson a very long and complicated argument about whether this document which was called a judgment of acquittal was in form or in function an order dismissing the indictment.
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1617.002,1626.2,"Well, but everybody agrees now that it was in function an order dismissing the indictment whereas in this case, in function we have an order acquitting the defendant, are they not different."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1626.2,1632.472,The court reached the conclusion in Wilson as I read that case though by deciding that did not make any difference.
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.472,1636.934,"Where did you find that in the Wilson, I just read the page that you cited before and I…"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1636.934,1651.511,"I can also refer you to 337 to 339 in which the court discusses what Congress meant in passing the Criminal Appeals Act, but I can go beyond Wilson I think, because in United States against Sanford, we have the same problem we have here."
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.537,1684.504,"That depends on whether in function the order is a dismissal and acquittal, but how can you characterize this is in function as the dismissal after the trial is all over, that I do not understand."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1691.535,1696.198,"We cannot call it a dismissal of the indictment, but what we can say is it does not make any difference."
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1696.198,1699.476,"(Inaudible) if you cannot call a dismissal of the indictment, you cannot appeal."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1699.476,1730.038,"We can say I think Your Honor that Congress intended in the Criminal Appeals Act to remove all non constitutional bars to appeal from final orders terminating the prosecution and that Congress used language that it thought encompassed all of those categories of final orders terminating the prosecution and although it did not use this particular language, under the interpretation of that statute in Wilson which goes back to the legislative history, Congress intended its language to be broad enough to cover this case."
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1730.038,1743.976,"And maybe Congress correctly thought that a judgment of acquittal could not be appealed because a retrial would be barred by them, double jeopardy clause, and maybe the reason they did not use any phrase."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1743.976,1757.227,"One more point Mr. Justice Stevens, the Third Circuit in Wilson had held as a matter of law, that the judgment in that case was in fact an acquittal and not a dismissal of the indictment, that it was an acquittal in both form and functions."
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1757.227,1762.749,"Well, I understand all that, but how you get over the fact that in this case in function it is an acquittal."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1771.38,1773.497,We do not dispute that.
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1773.497,1779.841,"You just say some acquittals can be appealed and there is no authority that you have cited that supports that proposition, is it not?"
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1779.841,1787.213,"I think Sanford supports that proposition, absolutely because in function, the judgment in Sanford was an acquittal."
1976.76-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1817.787,1833.63,"Well, that was really the equivalent under the Old Criminal Appeals Act of the judgment notwithstanding the verdict, was it not, I forgot the name of the – that was involved in that case, where the indictment in effect did not charge a crime, taking all the evidence into consideration."
1976.76-120,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1833.63,1836.236,It was not a case where the indictment did not charge a crime.
1976.76-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1860.166,1863.022,Mr. Smith.
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,1863.022,1867.48,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1976.76-120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2305.559,2314.868,"Mr. Smith, before you get to those cases, just so I know what your answer to this question is when you are discussing those other cases."
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,2336.597,2339.133,"Your Honor, I am not going to suggest that."
1976.76-120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.104,2362.042,"You are not saying then I take it that just the fact that the judge has done what the rule has entitled him to do, namely under a judgment of acquittal based on the evidence, automatically forbids appeal."
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,2362.042,2368.27,I am not saying that Rule 29 arises to constitutional level if the court please.
1976.76-120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.27,2371.597,"Again, I just want to know, is it appealable or not?"
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,2375.673,2379.044,Where there is a jury verdict of guilty…?
1976.76-120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2379.044,2381.997,Yes.
1976.76-120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2381.997,2384.311,General motion under 29c within seven days.
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,2384.311,2386.008,I think it could.
1976.76-120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2386.008,2389.391,"And if it reversed, the guilty verdict is reinstated?"
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,2389.391,2390.252,It is reinstated.
1976.76-120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.488,2403.837,"Now, I would like to listen to those cases."
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,2403.837,2428.176,"And I think that we have taken the position and I think it is perfectly supportable that Jenkins is a controlling case and I particularly direct Your Honor’s attention to Footnote 7 in that case where Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if you will remember had before the dissenting opinion or the dissenting position taken by Judge Lombard out of the second circuit."
1976.76-120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2964.983,2969.243,"The merits of your case or the government’s case are not really before us here, are they?"
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,2969.243,2980.397,"No sir, but these all go to the judge's comments that are in the Appendix which show the state of mind of the judge when he found not guilty and acquitted."
1976.76-120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2980.397,2991.638,"But your position is that even if the judge was – when pressed your position would be that even if the judge was quite wrong in entering the judgment of acquittal, nonetheless it is not appealable?"
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,2991.638,2993.796,That is Fong Foo if the court please.
1976.76-120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2993.796,2995.808,Exactly and that has to be your position.
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,2995.808,2998.03,Yes sir and Fong Foo says that very clearly.
1976.76-120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3016.646,3026.483,"And the fact really that this was a criminal contempt rather than a mine-run claim, and like criminal case does not have anything basically to do with the issue before us, does it?"
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,3026.483,3027.696,I think not if the court please.
1976.76-120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3036.878,3042.112,This case has been argued just as though it were a mine-run criminal prosecution.
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,3042.112,3061.15,And that of course is one factor that shows the comprehensive effect of the Court’s ruling in this case is because there is no real reason that it should not apply to other cases except for the fact that you have the judge finding -- he is the one against whom the contempt is posed.
1976.76-120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3061.15,3065.65,"Well, That is a little circumstance of this case, but it does not really affect the basic issue here."
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,3065.65,3072.063,I think on that we would have to say that whatever distinctions you could make would be hard to abstain.
1976.76-120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3129.653,3134.176,"He had two other opportunities to say the same thing, did he not?"
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,3134.176,3135.231,You mean earlier?
1976.76-120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3135.231,3135.714,Yeah.
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,3135.714,3136.291,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.76-120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3136.291,3138.301,Yes (Inaudible) and he did not.
1976.76-120,1,32888,j_burleson_smith,,3138.301,3139.056,He did not.
1976.76-120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3158.41,3160.798,"He convinced the eleven jurors though, did he not?"
1976.76-120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3160.798,3183.957,"Yes, he did and at all tender that is one reason we do not want them to have another shot, but also the government has got another shot even after this because what judge would, the trial judge was saying, he said, let us get on with the civil contempt."
1976.76-120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3403.685,3407.099,"Thank you gentleman, your case has submitted."
