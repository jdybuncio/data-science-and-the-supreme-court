1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.059,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-244, Charles Quackenbush, California Insurance Commissioner, v. Allstate Insurance Company."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,17.143,20.095,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,41.048,43.682,"Perhaps you should say the most recent, rather than the last."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,45.673,46.883,"--Exactly correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.995,159.029,"What authority do you... you see, when you say it's a matter of discretion whether the court will provide relief or not, I don't care whether you call it equity or antiquated or anything else, the crux of the matter is, I can understand this abstention doctrine when the court below has discretion as to whether it wants to grant relief or not."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,181.299,183.19,--Assuming--
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,183.19,184.031,Where does the power come from?
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,184.031,204.243,"--Assuming the hypothetical, Justice Scalia, you're exactly correct, and... however, the question comes, is there a Federal... fundamentally the question is, is there now a Federal court of equity, and the fact is there is not a Federal court of equity."
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,209.889,221.689,"Which has discretion to deny judgments that are... judgments for money, has discretion to say, well, you're entitled to this money, but I just think I'm not going to give it to you."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,226.113,227.094,"--Of course not, Your Honor."
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.615,233.879,"So I don't care whether you call it equity or not, the fact is, if the court must grant relief, it seems to me the court must entertain the case."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,233.879,242.285,"--The question is, what is the power of the court to grant relief, and what is the relief requested of the court?"
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,265.312,274.559,"Whose discretion doctrines have been long-established in cases where the court was able to say, yes, you have a good case but I'm not going to give you relief."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,277.103,279.367,"I don't agree with that, Your Honor."
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.268,293.832,"I'm not talking about deferral, I'm talking about dismissal."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,302.407,302.708,Precisely.
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,302.708,304.801,That was not a request for an injunction.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,308.414,311.378,"That's exactly correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.378,312.31,What did the court do in that case?
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,313.392,315.312,In Fair Assessment?
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,315.312,315.582,Yes.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,315.582,319.586,"In Fair Assessment it dismissed, Your Honor."
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,319.586,321.419,Are you sure it dismissed?
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,321.419,322.571,"I mean, it remanded, Your Honor."
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.075,327.343,That's not my recollection.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,327.343,331.968,--That a court has the power to remand the case.
1995.95-244,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.453,374.166,Was this case dismissed in the Federal court?
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,374.166,375.158,"No, Your Honor."
1995.95-244,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,378.861,380.253,Without any dismissal.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,380.253,381.915,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1995.95-244,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,392.935,398.988,Would we have to overrule Thermtron in order to make the appeal possible?
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,398.988,403.011,"Not in our opinion, Justice Breyer."
1995.95-244,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.454,412.02,"Thermtron said no appeal would lie, that it could only be breached by mandamus--"
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,412.02,412.26,That's--
1995.95-244,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,412.26,412.608,--remand.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,412.608,414.211,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1995.95-244,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,430.353,436.767,So... but don't... that poses the problem.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,449.756,450.637,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-244,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,450.637,451.278,All right.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,453.592,455.131,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-244,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,455.131,455.391,All right.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,466.38,467.03,"Yes, Your Honor, and--"
1995.95-244,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,467.03,468.573,So we do have to overrule Thermtron.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,468.573,473.886,--In the sense as to that issue--
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.886,476.518,Thermtron was mandamus.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,476.518,477.609,--Yes.
1995.95-244,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,477.609,483.862,"Yes, so... but it said you could only review it through mandamus, so you couldn't review it through an appeal, and here they reviewed it through an appeal."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,483.862,495.871,What I meant by our not being opposed to overruling Thermtron is that we agreed with the dissent in Thermtron that the... a remand order should be totally barred from--
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.871,496.151,Well--
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,496.151,496.591,--being reviewed.
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,496.962,517.967,"--You have the dissent in Thermtron, which did not prevail, you have the opinion in Thermtron, which did prevail, and then the Ninth Circuit, here, is even further over than the... because it said not only... we don't have to worry about mandamus because you can appeal this, and it seems to me the majority opinion in Thermtron makes that quite clearly wrong."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,520.528,528.373,--The majority opinion in Thermtron said that a remand order is not reviewable by appeal.
1995.95-244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,543.308,566.012,"But Mr. Rubinstein, if the Ninth Circuit didn't do that, wouldn't it have run smack against another decision of this Court, that is in the Moses H. Cone case, was, what sense would it make to say that if the Federal court stays the action, then the review is by appeal under the Cohen doctrine, but if it remands, then either there's no review at all, or only mandamus review?"
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,566.012,579.77,"--That's... it is correct, Justice Ginsburg, that the two decisions have issues that are not exactly on all fours with one another."
1995.95-244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,592.699,595.711,"Mr. Rubinstein, suppose the case had come up this way."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,619.239,620.429,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,620.429,622.893,And Allstate wants to take an appeal.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,628.457,631.028,"An appeal from the dismissal, yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,631.028,631.729,Appeal from the stay.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,631.729,674.829,"Yes, Your Honor, and part of the demonstration in this case as to the problems with the Ninth circuit decision is that in another case arising out of the State receivership court, the Morgan Stanley case, the Ninth Circuit in a similar situation where the suit was filed in Federal district court in the first instance, and we, on behalf of the Insurance Commissioner, moved to dismiss, the Ninth Circuit did dismiss based on the same considerations that... the same type of considerations that the district court remanded the instant case on."
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,713.865,718.189,"Mr. Rubinstein, you've raised two questions in your certiorari petition."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,732.41,740.156,"Well, Your Honor, I think we do get to the second question because it was reviewable by mandamus."
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,740.156,742.366,But that's quite a different standard.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,764.654,765.933,"Your Honor, I agree with that."
1995.95-244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,769.316,772.689,"Mr. Rubinstein, what do you do, then, with the Ninth Circuit saying to this Court, we're puzzled."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,781.577,790.075,"--Justice Ginsburg, as I as going to say, I agree with the Chief Justice's characterization so far as it went."
1995.95-244,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,804.775,822.954,"But Mr. Rubinstein, if it's not appealable we're not going to reach the second issue, so you have to persuade us that this is appealable, and to do that you have to overcome what the Court said in Thermtron, so I would think that would be your first line of attack here."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,822.954,826.317,"Well, certainly we stand on Thermtron, and--"
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,826.317,828.44,"You're saying its not appealable, are you not?"
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,828.44,828.6,--Yes.
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,829.912,837.087,"Well, if it's not appealable, then it never was in the court of appeals, and we certainly can't do anything more on the merits."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,837.087,839.289,I understand--
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,839.289,841.239,What your--
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,841.239,845.222,"--Mr. Chief Justice, what you're saying, and Justice O'Connor, I understand what you're saying."
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,845.222,854.959,"--So you, to get to the point you really want to make, your opponent would have to prevail on the appealability question, and then you would have to prevail on the merits."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,858.279,858.74,"No, Your Honor, I--"
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.74,859.981,"I mean, they do go in different directions."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,862.464,890.692,"--I think that you should adopt the doctrine that this Court established in the Penn General case and Pennsylvania v. Williams, which says that... which we cite in our briefs, that in the case of an insurance insolvency, that the Federal district courts do have the reasoned discretion if it's appropriate in that given case to remand cases--"
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,890.692,891.794,--the appealability issue now.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,892.114,897.179,--or to dismiss cases in favor of the underlying procedures.
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,897.179,899.31,"--I'm talking about the appealability issue, the first issue."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,904.876,920.895,"I don't believe that it's necessary to repudiate Moses Cone, but if you have a choice, if this Court sees itself as having that choice, then we strongly recommend that you stand with Thermtron."
1995.95-244,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,920.895,929.35,"Because, as... that's what I... what are the merits... you're probably almost neutral on this issue, so you'd be quite helpful in looking--"
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,934.715,935.457,I know the case.
1995.95-244,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,935.457,953.228,"--And it seemed as if Thermtron's statement, which was quite brief on this point, grew out of two 19th Century cases, one called Wiswall and one something else, which was making a very old-fashioned, since-discarded distinction between mandamus and appeal as a way of dismissing jurisdictional orders."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,985.635,1021.328,"Well, stare decisis, of course, Your Honor, but beyond that there's a question of giving the... recognizing the fact that the district courts need to have the discretion to control their own dockets in part and also, from the position of this Court, you do have a massive judiciary to consider, and if all remand orders are going to be appealable, then the number of appeals in the Federal system will increase by 3,000 or more, if I understand the data."
1995.95-244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1021.328,1028.3,"But that sounds like an argument to get rid of Thermtron, too, and to go back to... which I think was your very first position, everything comes under 1447(d)."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1031.864,1062.565,"Well, since you get to the same place with Thermtron, then Thermtron satisfies the need, but there's one other point I'd like to make, and that's it, that as a matter of substance, it seems to me that a remand order, which is dealing with a case that began other than in the Federal system, and sends that same case back to the system where it began, is qualitatively different, substantially different from a case that begins in the Federal system."
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1079.936,1089.052,"Mr. Rubinstein, in your brief you make the point that in Moses H. Cone there were separate State and Federal proceedings, whereas here there's only one proceeding."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1090.594,1091.075,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1091.075,1093.306,But there weren't two independent proceedings.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1093.306,1118.283,"That's the point that I'm... I just was trying to make, is that the remanding of a case that started in State court, and it's the only proceeding, sending that back to State court is significantly different than dealing with a case that starts in the Federal system, at least in terms of the judicial philosophy, it seems to me."
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1118.283,1118.493,Why?
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1118.493,1119.665,Why should we burden--
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1119.665,1121.025,I'm not getting it.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1122.837,1123.246,--Because--
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1123.246,1124.868,They have a right to be in a Federal court.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1138.719,1150.566,"--Again, the... it's not final in a sense of remand, because the same case that started continues where it began."
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1150.566,1155.141,"So far as the exercise of Federal jurisdiction is concerned, it is absolutely final."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1155.141,1156.82,"Well, not necessarily."
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1156.82,1159.014,"You mean, they might remand again?"
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1159.014,1159.952,No.
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1159.952,1169.65,"Well, then, if you don't assume that it's because they can remand again, once it's out, it's out, and it's just... it's out just as finally as if it were dismissed as an action originally brought there."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1169.65,1174.364,"For the purposes of argument, Your Honor, I'll accept that."
1995.95-244,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1174.935,1176.437,"Well, is there any argument about that?"
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1183.353,1185.083,--Over that particular case.
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1222.369,1230.864,"--Okay, but absent that speculative possibility, there doesn't seem to be a difference between the remand in the one kind of case and the dismissal in the other."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1234.577,1239.719,"For the reason, Justice Souter, that I said, which is their--"
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1239.719,1243.201,The speculation that a Federal issue may arise in the State case and get taken up?
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1243.201,1250.177,"--No, Your Honor, because the one case begins as a Federal case in the Federal court."
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1251.817,1261.174,"No, but the qualita... what you call a qualitative difference, which, you know, assumes a qualitative difference relevant to this issue, is simply a procedural difference."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1261.174,1282.107,"Well, no, because the intervening thing that has occurred is that a Federal district court, based on abstention doctrine, which is important to Federalism issues and comity issues, has determined, in the exercise of that discretion, that that case for those reasons should be in the State system."
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1282.839,1294.857,"But the decision, the reasons for making that decision are going to be the same reasons whether the case got there by removal, or whether the case got there by being filed there in the first place."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1296.64,1310.487,"--Well, they're not precisely the same reasons, and in terms of... if... in the terms of asking me if there are any other differences, that's the only other difference, other than the ones I've already mentioned to Justice Breyer."
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.487,1310.757,Mr.--
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1310.757,1315.161,But I see... it may not be enough to swing the argument one way or the other.
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.935,1322.297,"--Mr. Rubenstein, could I come back to Fair Assessment?"
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1357.272,1357.482,That's--
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.482,1357.923,That's quite a different issue.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1357.923,1360.794,"--That's not how I understand the case, Your Honor, and--"
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1360.794,1366.568,"Well, how do you explain the language I just read to you, remanding them to their State remedies provided, of course, that they're adequate?"
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1366.568,1374.103,"--Well, because the... the cause of action was cognizable in State court, and--"
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.103,1374.513,That's a State remedy?
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1377.977,1382.01,"--Well, in some instances."
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1382.361,1383.913,I never heard language used that way.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1384.414,1385.286,"--Well, RICO is--"
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.286,1385.857,--It might be anything you want.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1385.857,1394.381,"--RICO is cognizable in both systems, and is RICO a State remedy when it's in State court and a Federal remedy in Federal court, or--"
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1394.381,1396.975,"Well, I think it's a weak case for the point you're making."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1412.029,1413.41,"--Well, Thibodaux's a case in point--"
1995.95-244,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1413.41,1414.101,Frankfurter says that.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1414.101,1417.445,"--Thibodaux's a case in point, but another case--"
1995.95-244,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1417.445,1418.387,Thibodaux.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1418.387,1423.392,"--that sounds similar to the point that you're making, Your Honor, is Colorado River."
1995.95-244,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1432.248,1434.702,"Well, can you tell us, what is the source of this rule?"
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1450.89,1465.281,"Well, I'm not going to rely only on comity, but to further principles of Federalism and to promote ""Our Federalism"" as recognized in the Younger case and concepts of comity."
1995.95-244,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1471.436,1477.21,"What would you say, just so you can get the main thing that I think interests you the most... that's what I'm trying to ask this for."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1516.186,1532.567,"Well, the response, Your Honor, first of all is it would subject this Commissioner, if that were the rule, and all commissioners similarly situated, to dozens, or even hundreds of litigations in various Federal courts across this country and possibly even to litigations in other countries."
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1552.079,1554.221,Did the court dismiss the case in Thibodaux?
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1556.844,1560.184,I don't recall precisely at this moment--
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.184,1560.425,But that's crucial.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1560.425,1561.747,"--Your Honor, but I believe that the case--"
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.747,1564.518,"The court just sat on the case, waited for the State--"
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1564.518,1564.728,--The case--
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.728,1565.039,--court to act.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1565.039,1567.142,"--The case went to State court, Your Honor, as I understand it."
1995.95-244,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1567.142,1568.041,The State went... I don't think so.
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1568.041,1571.053,I think the--
1995.95-244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1571.053,1581.311,"I'm not entirely clear on why there would be more litigation if you allow Federal courts to get into the act instead of just having the State tribunal do it, certainly not to be decided by the Commissioner of Insurance."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1581.311,1586.774,--If the Commissioner cannot marshall the assets--
1995.95-244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1586.774,1597.232,"Well, he can't marshall the assets till he knows what the merits of this very basic contractual issue is, and some court's going to have to decide it, and may have to decide it in several different forums."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1597.232,1619.285,"--But as this court recognized in Allied and Bendix, the issue of arbitrability is a matter for contract law, and the States are free, and in fact would have the duty to determine whether or not an arbitration clause should be enforced consistent--"
1995.95-244,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1619.285,1622.537,"And they'd have to decide that by the same rules of law that the Federal judge would decide, wouldn't they?"
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1622.537,1662.905,"--No, because there are local issues involved, and particularly where we're dealing with a comprehensive and massive insurance insolvency, the issue of whether the arbitration clause stands shoulder to shoulder with the insolvency clause, and how it interrelates with the claims statutes of the State of California which require a certain procedure to occur with respect to these same claims in the State proceeding, that also would be shredded if all these cases could be moved to Federal courts, hither-thither, as opposed to being administered in this claims process."
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1662.905,1666.976,"Yes, but each of these cases could have been brought, I suppose, in a State court."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1666.976,1669.64,"No, they couldn't, under the--"
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1669.64,1672.693,"In the court of another State other than California, couldn't they?"
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1672.693,1675.913,"--That's... that's incorrect as well, because--"
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1675.913,1688.471,"Well, isn't it true that, let's say if Allstate wants to sue on... as plaintiff in its reinsurance contracts and Allstate has a place of business in some other State, it's not... it doesn't have to go to California to sue, does it?"
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1688.471,1689.212,"--Yes, it does."
1995.95-244,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1689.212,1689.503,Why?
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1689.503,1703.214,"Because this is... under the Bank of New York case, this is an in rem or quasi in rem proceeding and, in addition to that, over 10 years ago this Court issued injunctions requiring exactly that."
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1703.214,1704.854,"Thank you, Mr. Rubinstein."
1995.95-244,0,33957,karl_l_rubinstein,,1704.854,1705.425,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1995.95-244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1705.425,1707.307,"Mr. Donovan, we'll hear from you."
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1707.307,1719.198,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1995.95-244,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1799.348,1803.271,"Well, what do you make of the language in Thermtron on that point?"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1803.271,1822.742,"--Well, the language in Thermtron, Your Honor, as we pointed out, is language which did assume that an appeal was not available and therefore mandamus would lie, but Thermtron has to be understood on the basis of the case that it, in turn, relied on, which is the Wiswall case, and Wiswall should be understood in light of the case that it in turn cited, the Comstock case."
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1823.694,1826.766,You mean we should repudiate language in Thermtron?
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1826.766,1827.877,"--Well, I think that the--"
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.877,1828.788,Are you?
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1828.788,1843.368,"--Well, I think that the language in Thermtron poses a difficulty, yes, but I'm... but the language in Thermtron, the assumption in Thermtron that in fact appeal was not available was, if it was a holding, as close to dictum as a holding can come."
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1844.6,1844.87,Well--
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1844.87,1846.51,It was not discussed in the case.
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1846.96,1849.123,--But it was necessary to the Court's reasoning--
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1849.123,1852.576,"--In a technical sense, yes, it was a holding, but in fact--"
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1852.576,1854.949,--So you're asking us to depart from the holding in Thermtron.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1854.949,1855.958,--We're looking--
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1855.958,1856.829,Are you?
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1856.829,1857.3,--Yes.
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1871.672,1876.026,"We've never held that any appeal will lie from an order remanding, have we?"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1876.026,1886.2,"--So far as I'm aware, the appeal... you have held in the Waco case that there are elements of an appeal... excuse me, from a remand order that can be appealed."
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1900.112,1900.332,So--
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1900.332,1902.603,--decision that was incorporated in the remand order--
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.603,1903.644,--we have never held--
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1903.644,1903.823,--was.
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.823,1907.946,"--then, that an appeal will lie from a remand order."
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1907.946,1909.508,"So far as I'm aware, no, the Court has not--"
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1909.508,1911.449,And you're asking us to do that here.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1911.449,1915.272,--What we're asking is to apply basic and fundamental principles--
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1915.272,1918.555,You are asking us to hold that an appeal will lie from a remand.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1918.555,1918.755,--That's correct.
1995.95-244,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1969.133,1976.019,"Yes, but... maybe it's technical, but there is the difference that in the remand situation the litigation goes on."
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,1981.232,1992.01,"That's... well, it is in fact... it's only technically not true in Cone, but the notion that the case continues in the State court really is a completely formalistic difference."
1995.95-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2007.431,2007.681,Well--
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2007.681,2015.294,"For purposes of the court of appeals, 1291, this is a final decision, because it is all the district court can do."
1995.95-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.294,2023.312,"--Isn't Justice Stevens right that the litigation goes on, but that this is the paradigm case of a final collateral order?"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2023.312,2023.92,That's right.
1995.95-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2023.92,2031.747,"And so it's really appealable under Cohen, if you were to be technical about it, but, of course, it's not more nor no less appealable than Thermtron itself."
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2035.28,2041.084,"That's... Thermtron, if the case had... if the Court had looked at it in Thermtron I believe that is what it would have concluded."
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.937,2088.257,"If we agree with you on this and hinge it on the Cohen doctrine rather than saying it's a final decision within the strict meaning of 1291, it would not be the case, would it, that all remand orders would necessarily be appealable?"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2103.297,2104.018,That may be the case.
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2125.923,2130.807,"What orders... what remand orders would not be final, if your views prevail?"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2130.807,2138.692,"--Well, for example, it... I think it remains an open question whether or not a remand order under the court's discretion, district court's discretion with respect to the supplemental jurisdiction statute."
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2138.952,2139.152,Well--
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2139.152,2139.883,--that's before the case--
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2139.883,2143.386,"--that's the end of the proceeding in Federal court, isn't it?"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2143.386,2146.037,"--Well, it would depend on the circumstances in which that came up, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2178.2,2178.648,Right.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2178.648,2181.002,But it's a question that may eliminate that class of cases.
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2208.963,2216.52,"Well, it also relied primarily on the statement in the statute that they shouldn't be reviewed by appeal or otherwise, didn't it?"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2216.52,2219.442,--I don't think that was what Thermtron was talking about.
1995.95-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.629,2257.78,Just a simple point.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2276.066,2276.927,That's exactly right.
1995.95-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2276.927,2277.177,All right.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2279.289,2279.699,I think--
1995.95-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2279.699,2287.434,"Am I right in saying that the statute, irrespective of what we do, would bar most reviews, and we're only talking about a small category?"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2287.434,2292.409,"--We're talking, by definition, about remand orders that are on extrastatutory grounds."
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2395.1,2402.076,"Is it going to make any difference, then, whether a remand order is reviewed by mandamus or reviewed by appeal?"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2402.076,2415.893,"--If the Court were to hold, we think erroneously, but if the Court were to hold that mandamus was the proper remedy, we think the Court would have to make clear that mandamus would apply in the Wiswall-Comstock sense, which is whether we issue... whenever a district court does not go forward."
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2424.051,2425.921,"Well, Thermtron is not a 19th Century case."
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2427.944,2431.975,"--That's true, and Thermtron did, in fact, recite the language from the earlier cases."
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2479.931,2482.174,You're going to get to the merits question.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2482.174,2483.286,I'm going to get to the merits right now--
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.286,2483.897,I knew you were.

1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2640.472,2653.09,"--They're not... but what they're not... however many exceptions there may be, what the teaching of NOPSI said, and what it clearly is not, is some kind of freewheeling authority on the part of the district court to weigh a little State law here and a little inconvenience to the liquidator there."
1995.95-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2659.374,2662.506,"Why should discretion, as such, make the difference?"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2669.783,2677.097,"Well, discretion matters because it's only discretion that can legitimize a decision to go forward."
1995.95-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2685.111,2692.286,But there's no categorical reason why a so-called unflagging responsibility should suddenly flag when we get to a discretionary judgment.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2692.286,2694.126,"Well, that's right, and that's why--"
1995.95-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2694.126,2700.321,"So there's no reason, in principle, to say that discretion is the determinant here, is there?"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2700.321,2707.076,"--Well, that's correct, and I think that's why in the first statement in the court's NOPSI decision is a flat statement that a district court simply does not have--"
1995.95-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2707.076,2716.192,"Well, if that's the case, then, then it follows that it really isn't the discretionary nature of the act which justifies abstention at all, is it?"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2716.192,2717.191,--It is the--
1995.95-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2717.191,2720.554,If you accept the so-called unflagging responsibility.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2720.554,2722.066,--It is not the discretionary nature of the act.
1995.95-244,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2728.223,2730.203,That's... I'm not getting your distinction.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2730.203,2739.909,"--Well, as I... for example, the liquidator has argued here that the court... the district court should be understood to be exercising equitable discretion whenever it abstains."
1995.95-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2752.073,2752.541,All right.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2807.419,2812.003,"Well, the difficulty... first of all, the... as we've explained in the brief, California has not centralized."
1995.95-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2813.024,2819.479,"They said in their brief they had one court, one single court that reviews all the decisions coming out of this administrator."
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2819.479,2823.953,The... there is a court in California which is handling the liquidation proceedings.
1995.95-244,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2870.838,2875.119,"Yes, like giving money to one policyholder will inevitably affect how much another one gets."
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2875.119,2881.063,--But that would affect only in the sense that any... that does not affect the absolute... the rights under a contract.
1995.95-244,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2947.917,2966.409,"Mr. Donovan, you seem to be making a very good outline for an opinion that Judge Norris might have written but, in fact, it seemed to me that he defused labels, and he says there's a bright line between law and equity and you can't have any kind of an abstention when you have a case for money damages."
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,2966.409,2971.993,"Well, I was trying to respond to Justice Breyer's question, and just to finish that up, the last point is, I don't think there's any policymaking here."
1995.95-244,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2994.62,3000.025,"I'll have to read the decision again, but I had the impression that the Ninth Circuit was telling district judges it's all very easy."
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3003.816,3012.952,"--I don't think that's the case, because it did point out, for example, citing Professor Shapiro's article, that the common law prerogative writs afforded some discretion, so I don't think it did make that sharp distinction."
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.952,3013.223,"It's pretty true, though."
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3014.024,3014.315,Well--
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3014.315,3017.877,--it's usually equitable relief in which courts have discretion to withhold or grant.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3017.877,3019.61,--It's very hard to imagine circumstances--
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.61,3019.85,"Nothing surprising about that, is there."
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3019.85,3021.89,"--in which there would be discretion, witness this case."
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3021.89,3029.217,"Yes, and you stand by the point that we've never done Burford abstention in a case involving legal relief."
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3029.217,3030.646,There's no case that I'm aware of.
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3030.646,3030.867,Never dismissed.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3030.867,3032.639,I think the only... the only other--
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3032.639,3035.251,"Thibodaux in fact did not involve a dismissal, did it?"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3036.002,3036.282,--Thibodaux is--
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3036.282,3037.674,--a deferral of action by the Federal--
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3037.674,3040.779,--And Thibodaux really is basically Pullmanlike reasoning.
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3044.232,3052.778,"--It's last line is, by retaining the case, the district court, of course, reserves power to take such steps as may be necessary for the justice--"
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3052.778,3053.008,--That's--
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3053.008,3054.33,--It was a retention of jurisdiction.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3054.33,3054.83,--That's correct.
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3167.099,3168.459,That goes to your other point.
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3192.988,3195.782,"--No, we don't acknowledge that Fair Assessment is contrary to our position."
1995.95-244,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3220.817,3224.361,Was the plaintiff remanded to a 1983 action in State court in that case?
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3224.361,3234.858,"--The plaintiff was remanded to State court specifically, without regard to what his action was, but it was regarded... it was... the assumption was that he would have an adequate remedy in State court and was therefore referred to a State court remedy."
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3237.44,3241.992,What do you say the respondent wants in Pennsylvania v. Williams?
1995.95-244,1,20728,donald_francis_donovan,,3241.992,3245.454,"--I think the respondent was completely misunderstood, both that case and its exception."
1995.95-244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3389.352,3390.484,"Thank you, Mr. Donovan."
