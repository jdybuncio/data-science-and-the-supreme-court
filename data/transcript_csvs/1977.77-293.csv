1977.77-293,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,66.818,We will hear arguments next in Kulko against the Superior Court of California.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,72.04,76.326,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-293,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,279.202,281.893,"Mr. Stotter, could I interrupt you here at this point?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,281.893,285.923,"Certainly, Justice Blackmun."
1977.77-293,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,285.923,293.522,"Anywhere or at anytime, was ever any attack made on the Haitian Decree of Divorce in this case?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,293.522,305.271,"No, sir and that was the decree in which the appellee moved to be established in California in the initial action filed in California."
1977.77-293,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,305.271,307.928,Do you think it is invulnerable to attack at this late date?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,307.928,309.153,"I do, sir."
1977.77-293,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,309.153,309.874,You do?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,309.874,311.461,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-293,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,311.461,319.753,It recites on its face that both parties are domiciled and resident other than in Haiti.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,319.753,335.415,"I think, Justice Blackmun, that there is enough authority both in New York and in California that these parties would be estopped to take a position inconsistent with their joint Acts in going to Haiti."
1977.77-293,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,341.507,344.445,Have both parties remarried?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,344.445,345.309,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-293,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,345.309,346.705,The doctor too?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,346.705,349.1,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-293,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,374.518,382.366,Well anyway I thought your argument basically is that California law allows special appearances without waiver?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,382.366,382.625,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-293,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,382.625,385.482,And that was what the procedure you followed?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,385.482,385.963,Precisely.
1977.77-293,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,385.963,387.661,Was that not the complete answer?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,387.661,389.376,I think so.
1977.77-293,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,570.838,573.755,You are getting me a little bit confused.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,575.539,579.227,"The decree was entered in Haiti, Your Honor."
1977.77-293,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,579.227,580.183,Not in New York?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,580.183,583.273,"If I said decree, then I stand corrected."
1977.77-293,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,584.79,585.73,I just want to be clear.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,595.006,627.262,"I think the facts, Mr. Chief Justice, of New York domicile is important in this case, but not for the traditional reasons that there was a decree entered in New York, but simply because the facts and circumstances relating to the parties and their agreement as negotiated in New York gives a great deal of importance to the ties that New York would give to its contracts and certainly to its negotiated marital settlement agreements."
1977.77-293,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,664.992,668.879,"She preferred to have this marriage settlement, did she not?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,668.879,669.775,"I am sorry, Justice Marshall?"
1977.77-293,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,669.775,674.662,"She preferred to have the marriage settlement, cash."
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,674.662,675.32,That is correct.
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,679.82,682.229,"At that time, at what time are we talking about, Mr. Stotter?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,682.229,692.067,We are talking about at the time of the marital settlement agreement and the Haitian Decree which took place only in a matter of days separating each other.
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,692.067,696.863,They were living in New York as domiciliary of New York as husband and wife?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,696.863,698.299,"That is correct, at all times."
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,698.299,701.701,"Up to the time of the Haitian Decree, at least."
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,701.701,703.422,Up to the time of their separation.
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,703.422,714.432,"Until they went to Haiti or somebody went to Haiti and got a divorce and I suppose the jurisdictional support for that divorce was somebody’s domicile in Haiti, but in any event, they had been living in New York."
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,721.461,722.029,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,722.029,723.742,It is a military duty.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,723.742,725.315,It ran this way.
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,728.298,729.063,Right.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,729.063,735.381,The wife departed from the family leaving the father and the children in the State of New York.
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,735.381,736.268,Before or after the divorce?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,736.268,736.799,Before.
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,736.799,739.184,Before the divorce.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,739.184,741.445,She went to California.
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,749.278,751.278,She personally or did her lawyer?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,751.278,764.113,"First, her lawyer negotiated and then she personally came from California to New York to execute the agreement and then left from New York, she did, to go to Haiti with consent of the doctor."
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,764.113,765.523,And then she obtained the decree in Haiti.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,765.523,775.55,She obtained the Decree of Haiti and then she returned to California and the father returned to the family home where the children were which he had never departed.
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,775.55,777.473,He returned from where?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,777.473,778.843,"I am sorry, the father never left."
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,778.843,782.097,He continued to reside in New York.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,782.097,783.358,That is correct.
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,783.358,785.228,"At that time, also were the children?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,785.228,787.135,That is correct.
1977.77-293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,787.135,799.165,"Mr. Stotter, is not the issue we have to decide whether Dr. Kulko did anything in California that subjected him to in personam jurisdiction in United States, is that it?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,799.165,799.57,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,799.57,800.743,When are you going to get to that?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,800.743,802.64,"I will in a moment, sir."
1977.77-293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,802.64,807.524,Your time is running out.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,807.524,835.488,I think that the Court should recognize that one of the major issues involved here is whether the context required to establish personal jurisdiction under International Shoe should be of more substantial type or nature in domestic or family law proceedings than those existing in other cases.
1977.77-293,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,911.573,930.767,"You are here attacking the judgment of California and I think it would be very helpful to us, it certainly would be to me, if you would tell me what it is that is wrong about California’s assertion of jurisdiction based upon their contact with the children and the wife?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,930.767,953.17,"Well, if Your Honor please, California had two lower court cases, both of which rejected the concept that these type of acts were essentially the type of acts that were contemplated by this type of a criteria."
1977.77-293,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1011.322,1014.079,But did the father not pay for the airfare?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1014.079,1014.839,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-293,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1014.839,1016.695,Is that not a consent?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1016.695,1021.214,"Not in the traditional situation, Your Honors."
1977.77-293,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1071.431,1080.967,"The mother in this case sought in personam money judgment against your client, did she not?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1080.967,1100.118,There were no proceedings relative to any action filed by the mother at any time in the State of New York or anywhere else claiming that the father was indebted to her for some act or acts.
1977.77-293,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1100.118,1105.33,What did the mother seek in her action in the Superior Court of California?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1105.33,1112.923,The mother sought only to establish the Haitian Decree and to establish child support perspectively.
1977.77-293,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1114.071,1117.046,Did she not ask for an increase?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1117.046,1118.362,That is correct.
1977.77-293,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1118.362,1120.512,It is a little different from what you just said.
1977.77-293,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1120.512,1122.606,"Well, that is an in personam money judgment."
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1122.606,1123.463,That is correct.
1977.77-293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1127.074,1128.672,And also custody of the children.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1128.672,1130.969,And also custody which we did not contest.
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1138.804,1145.455,"Well, the real question is did the California court have personal jurisdiction over your client in this case?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1146.024,1150.583,That is the very bottom issue.
1977.77-293,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1150.583,1161.63,"The answer to that question may turn on whether simply on the adjustment of custody was sought or whether an in personam money judgment was sought, may or not, it may differ?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1161.63,1162.476,It does differ.
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1181.772,1195.128,"Page 7 of the Appendix which contains the complaint, paragraph 4 of the complaint clearly asks for the court to award money to the plaintiff against the defendant, does it not?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1195.128,1197.635,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1197.635,1199.567,The question is did the court have jurisdiction?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1206.849,1234.531,"The position of the appellant is no, because the appellant has absolutely no contact with the State of California, in any respect, has never entered the California, in any circumstance was not doing business, did not do an intentional act of the type which this Court has found applies in the economic sphere in other types of cases."
1977.77-293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1368.011,1376.04,"Mr. Stotter, I suggest that what she did or did not do is not relevant to the question we have to decide."
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1410.002,1411.49,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1414.757,1416.164,With its application?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1416.164,1416.972,That is correct.
1977.77-293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1416.972,1431.303,"As I understand it, the way they applied it was said that probably no parental act more fully invokes the benefits and protections of California law than that by which a parent permits his minor child to live in California."
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1444.005,1445.743,Not as a fact.
1977.77-293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1453.056,1454.764,I understand it.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1487.857,1502.532,"Justice Brennan, the question of the purposeful nature, I guess, is the factual question which, under this particular statute, is submitted to this particular Court."
1977.77-293,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1502.532,1505.779,You want us to decide the factual question?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1505.779,1506.273,"No, sir."
1977.77-293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1574.118,1588.562,"Of course, your Supreme Court distinguished between the daughter and son saying that the father had done nothing in New York which had the effect of committing the son to California in the same way that he had done with the daughter."
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1588.562,1589.133,"That is correct, Justice Brennan."
1977.77-293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1589.133,1592.708,"Therefore, they refuse to accept jurisdiction."
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1598.408,1600.841,"No, Justice Brennan."
1977.77-293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1622.262,1638.384,"Well, they finally wind up with “we deem it fair and reasonable to subject to him the personal jurisdiction for this court for both children” where his committed acts with respect to one child confers personal jurisdiction and as consented to the permanent residence of the opposition."
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1644.205,1654.596,They basically say that he consented to the son because he did not commence an immediate action even though at the time he was under a restraining order from the State of California against removing those children.
1977.77-293,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1654.596,1657.859,"Mr. Stotter, the airplane ticket, was it round trip?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1657.859,1658.732,"No, sir."
1977.77-293,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1659.194,1660.121,It was one-way.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1660.121,1660.87,That is correct.
1977.77-293,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1660.87,1663.739,How do you expect the child to get back?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1663.739,1684.897,"He had hoped that the child would recognize that life with the mother would not be as ideal as she thought it would be and that by giving her an opportunity for her day in California, so to speak, she would see that life in California was not as good as life in New York."
1977.77-293,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1684.897,1689.61,"The answer to my question is how would the child get back, walk?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1689.61,1698.933,"I think the child would simply have called the father and said much the same way “I would like to come back to New York,” and a ticket instantly would have been available."
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1698.933,1708.516,"Mr. Stotter, earlier you mentioned there might be a difference between jurisdiction to award a money judgment and jurisdiction to determine custody."
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1727.019,1727.98,Yes.
1977.77-293,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1765.525,1768.058,That did not involve a matter of personal jurisdiction.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1768.058,1769.394,That is correct.
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1775.695,1782.68,"But the relief prayed for on the paragraph would result in a modification of the decree of the settlement agreement between the parties, would it not?"
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1782.68,1790.434,That is correct and relief in terms of custody might well be granted without getting into money judgments at all.
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1790.434,1803.038,It almost would follow inevitably under this settlement as I understand it that there would be some increase in the support money because the support under the agreement was calculated on the basis of temporary time with the wife.
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1803.61,1814.498,"I think there is no question about the fact that both California and New York, as a choice of law issue, would have recognized that these children were entitled to support."
1977.77-293,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1836.367,1842.876,Can a California Court constitutionally order your client to pay money?
1977.77-293,0,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,1851.388,1853.03,"Justice Stewart, I think that is correct."
1977.77-293,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1874.492,1884.213,Mrs. Thorn?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,1884.213,1888.292,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-293,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1901.382,1902.557,What difference does it make?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,1905.373,1907.129,That is correct.
1977.77-293,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1910.238,1912.213,He was served in this litigation?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,1912.213,1913.07,"Yes, he was served personally."
1977.77-293,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1913.07,1913.786,In New York?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,1913.786,1917.343,"In New York, yes."
1977.77-293,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1975.382,1978.8,"We can still treat it as certiorari, could we not?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,1978.8,1981.335,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.722,2028.942,You do not suggest there is not a federal question then.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2035.095,2035.463,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.463,2037.028,Is that what you are suggesting?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2037.028,2037.65,I am suggesting --
1977.77-293,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2037.65,2040.526,Or are you also saying it is not a substantial federal question?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2040.526,2052.056,"I am suggesting that it is not a substantial federal question, Your Honor, because of the unique happen stands of facts in the situation."
1977.77-293,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2052.056,2060.286,I would think of Justice White’s question and the Chief Justice’s question posed two quite different inquiries.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2084.951,2088.789,I think my answer to one would be no.
1977.77-293,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2094.371,2128.093,"I can conceive of a case where there might be a very substantial constitutional claim in the sense that a party litigant has had a constitutional right violated and yet nonetheless one would say it is a set of facts that is never going to recur and this Court only takes 150 cases a year and we simply would not grant certiorari in a case like that, but if it were an appeal as of right, we would probably not feel free to say there was no substantial federal question."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2128.093,2131.968,I would answer yes to the second question.
1977.77-293,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2131.968,2139.014,You say that there really is not any really doubtful federal question in the case even though it was to recur time and again.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2144.439,2153.303,"I am saying, Your Honor, that this is a unique set of facts that does not justify the Court in assuming jurisdiction."
1977.77-293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2153.303,2156.069,Let me ask you about that.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2168.887,2170.559,"Yes, she was."
1977.77-293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2170.559,2178.479,So there was a consensual agreement that would be embodied in the decree that the wife would have custody.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2178.479,2178.904,Correct.
1977.77-293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2178.904,2200.775,"So by consent, under this agreement, the children would be residing with the ex-wife in California and there is an agreed upon amount for support and then the wife sues in California to increase support and serves the husband in New York jurisdiction?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2200.775,2202.46,I think that raises a different case.
1977.77-293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2202.46,2205.396,Why would it be different?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2220.18,2229.039,"I would answer that by saying, in this case, we had a substantial change in the status of the children after the making of the agreement."
1977.77-293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.039,2233.722,"Well, that may be so, but what does that got to do with jurisdiction?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2233.722,2244.097,I think it has to do with the reasonableness of the contacts which led the California Supreme Court to feel that the exercise of jurisdiction was reasonable in this case.
1977.77-293,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2244.097,2270.106,Do you think the California Supreme Court either in retired Justice Sullivan’s opinion for the court or in Justice Richardson’s dissenting opinion that the members of the court thought they were dealing with a federal constitutional issue?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2270.106,2275.629,I think they felt they were dealing with the application of Code of Civil Procedure.
1977.77-293,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2275.629,2289.338,"Justice Richardson, in his dissenting opinion, begins by saying “in my view, it is unreasonable to subject petitioner to the jurisdiction of the California courts under the circumstances in this case” and then he goes on with the facts and so on."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2294.39,2295.083,"That is correct, Justice Stewart."
1977.77-293,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2295.083,2303.091,Nor indeed does Justice Sullivan’s opinion deal with the question as though it is a constitutional question.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2303.091,2303.668,That is correct.
1977.77-293,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2303.668,2305.55,Was it presented to that court as a constitutional question?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2305.55,2307.417,"No, it was not, Justice Stewart."
1977.77-293,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2307.417,2308.196,It was not?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2308.196,2310.986,It was not presented as a constitutional question.
1977.77-293,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2320.073,2338.491,"It is presented to us in the jurisdictional statement as a constitutional question, whether California’s construction of your Civil Practice Act extending in personam jurisdiction over the non-resident appellant violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, that was never presented to the California Supreme Court?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2338.491,2339.763,"That is our position, Justice Stewart."
1977.77-293,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2339.763,2343.514,"Well, that is a matter of fact, not a matter of somebody’s position."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2343.514,2345.623,"That is a matter of fact, Justice Stewart."
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2350.67,2359.113,"Mrs. Thorn, does the California Supreme Court not expressly say that the limits of the statute are defined by the constitution?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2379.074,2379.364,That is correct.
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2379.364,2384.274,Did the court not necessarily decide the constitutional question when it decided there was jurisdiction?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2384.274,2401.731,"I think it was inferring that decision was limited by constitutional perimeters, but that it was not really construing it as the constitution in this particular situation."
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2401.731,2411.065,"The holding of courts, talking about the lower court’s holding, accords with established due process principles."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2424.352,2429.92,"I think it would be fair to say that, Justice Marshall."
1977.77-293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2429.92,2437.869,"In fact, the analysis of the California court was whether International Shoe or Hanson v. Denckla required a different result."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2439.668,2441.171,"That is correct, Justice Stevens."
1977.77-293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2444.771,2449.454,"Before you go to that, since we have got you interrupted anyway, let me be sure I understand your position."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2475.66,2482.292,"Well, it would be weaker in the sense that there would have been less acts by the father causing an effect."
1977.77-293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2482.292,2489.348,But there would have been a clear consent to the children being there unambiguous and all that and he paid the tickets in my case.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2489.348,2495.458,It would be a strong in the sense that the contract was to be performed there in many instances.
1977.77-293,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2495.458,2504.34,"Actually, the children’s presence would certainly be the effect of his having made and signed that agreement in New York, would it not?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2504.34,2504.95,That is correct.
1977.77-293,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2504.95,2507.549,So how would the issue be any different than the one we have now?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2507.549,2517.105,"Well, only that the contract that we have in the instant case was to be performed partly in California because he was to pay support there when children were in her custody."
1977.77-293,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2517.105,2530.958,"Partly or not, if your Supreme Court’s test whether or not he committed the children to the benefits of California law, under the agreement he did, did he not, even though only parts of it?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2530.958,2531.664,That is correct.
1977.77-293,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2531.664,2535.832,"Well, is the constitutional issue any different?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2535.832,2538.358,"No, the constitutional issue would not be different."
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.358,2550.891,"You would not claim though that California would have jurisdiction or would you, if custody was litigated in the Divorce Court and custody was awarded to the mother?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2550.891,2558.601,I think that would depend as to whether it was understood in that custody litigation that the mother lived in California.
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.601,2569.213,"Well, if everybody knew she lived in California and the father was ordered to pay and mail to California $300 a month for child support."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2569.213,2571.879,"I think there is some distinction, Justice White."
1977.77-293,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2571.879,2588.282,"Do you suppose California court would think that set of facts will satisfy the California test of something done outside by the defendant, if he resisted the custody decree?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2588.282,2590.513,"I think that would be different, Justice Brennan."
1977.77-293,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2593.02,2594.765,"Well, it is an agreement that may --"
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.765,2595.605,Let me give you another one.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2595.605,2598.433,It is a contract.
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2598.433,2611.696,"The mother now moves to Oregon and wants more money, files a suit in Oregon and the father has never said a thing about Oregon."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2614.03,2622.475,"I think that it begins at that point, Justice White, to get weaker because there are not the contacts with Oregon that we have with California."
1977.77-293,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2622.475,2636.341,Did the California Supreme Court not place the rather long-arm jurisdiction here on the proposition that he in effect sent the children and submitted them to the custody of the State of California and all its protections?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2636.341,2638.725,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.77-293,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2638.725,2643.212,So that would not apply as he has never done that with respect to Oregon.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2643.212,2644.263,"That is right, so Oregon would be distinct."
1977.77-293,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2644.263,2647.795,Oregon could not have any jurisdiction over him.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2647.795,2654.22,"I do not believe that jurisdiction would be the same, but this was not a unilateral act."
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.638,2673.832,"Mrs. Thorn, I am still not sure you answered my question."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2692.453,2694.202,And that he will pay support?
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.202,2695.29,And he will pay support.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2695.29,2696.475,To them in California?
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.475,2698.252,Yes.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2698.252,2700.052,I think it would be stronger.
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.052,2701.522,Stronger for jurisdiction in California?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2701.522,2703.008,For jurisdiction.
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2703.008,2703.551,I see.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2703.551,2715.816,But I think we have the intervening force here of active acts on the part of the father which resulted in these children being residents of the state and needing to be supported in California.
1977.77-293,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2715.816,2720.296,"Mrs. Thorn, may I ask you a question about the active acts."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2731.895,2736.528,"Had not paid her airfare, had not sent her with her clothing?"
1977.77-293,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2736.528,2745.709,"The facts are clear, I take it that the daughter asked to go to her mother in California."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2745.709,2747.143,Yes.
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2762.666,2766.622,"Because he had run away, had he not? Had he run away from the father?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2766.622,2772.809,"No, he had left, but he had told the father that he was going."
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2772.809,2780.99,"Your Supreme Court said that as to the boy, but what the father did would not subject the father to in personam jurisdiction."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2792.144,2794.656,That is correct under the opinion.
1977.77-293,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2820.199,2821.886,He was in New York when he wrote the letter?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2821.886,2822.998,Yes.
1977.77-293,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2822.998,2833.095,And you say writing a letter to somebody in California is activity in California of a kind that would submit you to the jurisdiction of a California court and to order you to pay money?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2833.095,2845.314,"Certainly not standing alone, but I believe it was a recognition by him that he had by his activity done acts in California and that he realized he had to change their agreement."
1977.77-293,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2845.314,2863.265,We will resume there at 1:00.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2866.268,2868.706,Thank you.
1977.77-293,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2891.511,2909.52,"Mrs. Thorn, I think you were before lunch going to start to address when we interrupted you, your point as to the fact that your claim at least that the husband in this case waived his claim by making a general appearance."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2910.492,2911.643,"Yes, I was going to address the mootness."
1977.77-293,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2911.643,2916.725,"You can do it whenever you wish in the course of your argument, but I would be interested in what you have to say on that issue."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,2916.725,2928.545,"With regard to the issue of mootness, the California Supreme Court opinion was filed on May 26, 1977 and became final on June 25."
1977.77-293,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3028.374,3053.293,"Mrs. Thorn, I think it was some-40 or 50 years ago that this Court decided a case in which it said that one could pay a judgment rendered against him by the highest court of a state and not supersede it or nonetheless pursue an appeal here without the case becoming moot."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3058.313,3069.258,"Well, here they are raising jurisdictional issue and making a special appearance only."
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3083.782,3087.185,Did you urge this ground in the state court?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3087.185,3091.468,"This happened after the state court opinion became final, Justice White."
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3091.468,3098.018,Did you urge it in your motion to dismiss in this Court?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3098.018,3106.507,I do not have a copy of the motion to refer to.
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3106.507,3123.255,Do you want to borrow my copy?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3123.255,3125.296,"I do not believe it was urged, Justice Marshall."
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3125.296,3131.65,"Another thing is what law determines, California law or Federal law?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3131.65,3133.625,As to whether or not the issue is moot?
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3133.625,3135.559,Yes.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3135.559,3140.515,"I am not sure I know the answer to that question, Justice Marshall."
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3140.515,3144.614,You were the one who was raising it?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3144.614,3146.226,It would be our opinion.
1977.77-293,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3146.226,3149.397,"But if it is moot in California and it is moot here, is it not?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3149.397,3152.841,"I would think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.77-293,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3163.585,3189.013,Would there not be a federal element in this Court’s decision as to whether the petitioner or appellant is free to pursue his remedy by way of appeal here and nonetheless protect what he conceives to be his pending interest in the State Trial Court while we have the appeal before us?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3189.013,3195.729,"I think that he had the right to protect, as you honor suggests."
1977.77-293,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3213.676,3214.713,Let me start it out.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3232.107,3255.425,I am asking that you recognize that in asking for a form of affirmative relief from the California Superior Court that appellant made the general appearance causing the matter to become moot at this level.
1977.77-293,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3312.413,3312.88,Excuse me.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3336.892,3341.153,Prior to the rendering of the California Supreme Court opinion.
1977.77-293,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3341.153,3355.626,"So your reliance in the argument that what he did constituted general appearance, everything occurred after the coming down of that opinion, right?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3355.626,3356.017,That is correct.
1977.77-293,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3356.017,3362.707,"And apparently, in order to preserve his opportunity to come to this court, is that it?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3362.707,3363.896,That is correct.
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3363.896,3366.28,That is what is before us?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3366.28,3367.224,Excuse me?
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3367.224,3369.892,That is what is before us.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3372.704,3388.19,"Yes, but I believe that the documents with regard to the proceedings in the San Francisco Superior Court subsequent to the rendering of the Supreme Court opinion of the State of California have been lodged with the court in our brief."
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3388.19,3394.154,"He sought a nunc pro tunc, makes it moot before?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3394.154,3398.298,"No, that happened after, Justice Marshall."
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3413.164,3422.736,"Mrs. Thorn, in your footnote on page 11 of your brief, you end up by saying “there is no personal appearance as long as the court is not asked to exercise jurisdiction on the merits."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3427.817,3432.185,"In the San Francisco Superior Court, he asked them for a continuance."
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3432.185,3434.896,He asked them not to decide the merits.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3434.896,3442.194,"He asked them not to decide the merits, but he asked them for a continuance or a denial of the motion without prejudice."
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3444.698,3446.859,That is not a request for decision on the merits.
1977.77-293,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3446.859,3448.163,It was just the opposite.
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3448.163,3450.7,It was just the opposite.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3463.736,3477.247,I believe we had cited in the brief the applicable cases I am looking for them.
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3477.247,3483.575,"Footnote 3, page 11, they seem to all be against you."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3483.575,3489.527,Those are different kinds of requests.
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3504.712,3507.066,What case?
1977.77-293,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3507.066,3517.906,This is on the fall back position anyway?
1977.77-293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3517.906,3521.163,"Zobel v. Zobel, that is it, I guess."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3521.163,3528.508,"Yes, it is Zobel v. Zobel at page 13, Justice Stevens."
1977.77-293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3528.508,3533.948,"For request for a continuance to plead to the merits, but they did not ask for a continuance to plead to the merits."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3533.948,3538.578,They asked for a denial of the motion without prejudice.
1977.77-293,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3538.578,3540.683,That is not continuance to plead to the merits.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3557.506,3568.993,"The second case down, Knoff v. City and County where there was a written motion to continue hearing which we have here."
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3568.993,3576.926,"A party comes in and says, “I want a continuance in order to file a special appearance.”"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3582.923,3593.782,A continuance in order to file a special appearance would not be a general appearance under the expressed terms of California Code of Civil Procedure 418.10.
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3593.782,3596.715,Where will I find that?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3596.715,3607.428,"That is at the Appendix to our brief where California Code of Civil Procedure 418.10 is set out in its entirety, 418.10."
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3637.311,3642.123,But he did not appeal on that and you are not either?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3642.123,3648.025,We are suggesting that by that activity at that time.
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3648.025,3652.404,"So far as I am concerned, how does that get into record?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3657.426,3674.953,"That is correct, but appellant requested a stay from Justice Rehnquist of this Court and he attached portions of the record of the San Francisco Superior Court to his request for stay and it is, therefore, part of the record and before the Court."
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3703.621,3705.452,May I ask you a question?
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3712.116,3715.83,The argument about the jurisdiction of the court?
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3715.83,3717.336,Yes.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3720.597,3721.163,I do not think so.
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3721.163,3723.773,This is all the way across the country.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3723.773,3727.37,If she had moved to Hawaii prior to the trial?
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3727.37,3731.986,Just exactly instead of California and she kept on going.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3731.986,3733.685,And the agreement?
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3733.685,3735.394,"Yes, everything else is the same."
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3735.394,3740.765,The agreement provided for performance partly in California and not Hawaii?
1977.77-293,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3740.765,3741.806,Everything in Hawaii.
1977.77-293,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3741.806,3745.434,I said everything was in Hawaii.
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3753.572,3757.135,"Then I would say that the situation would be the same, Justice Marshall."
1977.77-293,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3757.135,3759.586,"It would be the same in New Jersey, too, would it not?"
1977.77-293,1,42177,suzie_s_thorn,,3759.586,3770.616,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it would."
1977.77-293,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3785.766,3791.575,"I believe your time has expired, Mrs. Thorn."
1977.77-293,2,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,3794.599,3803.574,"Briefly, the California Supreme Court specifically found that there was no knowledge by the father of Darwin’s departure."
1977.77-293,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3820.723,3825.149,Is that the Appendix of the Green brief?
1977.77-293,2,35126,lawrence_h_stotter,,3825.149,3829.67,"The Green brief, the Court specifically finds only a special appearance."
1977.77-293,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3901.285,3902.124,"Thank you, counsel."
