1987.86-5963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,57.67,"Mr. Cunningham, you may proceed whenever you wish."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,57.67,60.455,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-5963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.458,202.331,"Well, the integrity of the system depends to a certain extent to one complying with rules of court requiring you to give lists of witnesses."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,202.331,203.231,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,223.561,226.262,Would that be a continuance?
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,226.262,228.881,"It would depend upon the circumstances of the case, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,228.881,232.416,"Certainly, the prosecution never wants a continuance in a criminal case."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,237.904,265.305,"Well, I would point out in that regard that in Illinois that there is a long line of cases that were the state has violated the discovery rules and seeks to now put what would be termed a surprise witness before the court that if the defendant simply objects and asks for a preclusion and the court then admits the testimony, on appeal the defendant has waived his right to appeal if he has not requested a continuance."
1987.86-5963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,300.145,307.333,"So you are saying in effect that you could flagrantly, as the trial court finds, violate the rules of the court and nothing would happen?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,307.333,309.216,"No, Your Honor, I am not saying that."
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.618,315.67,"At worst you get thrown into the briar patch, that is you get a continuance."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,315.67,316.839,"--I am not saying that either, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.195,354.314,What about getting other witnesses to impeach that witness?
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,354.314,355.797,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.797,358.266,"That would have required a continuance, would it not?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,358.266,359.466,"Not in this case, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,378.43,385.334,"What about getting other people to come in and say that this man is a congenital liar, other people who knew this witness?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,385.334,392.606,"Well, Your Honor, certainly if the prosecution believed that they had other evidence that needed to be investigated, they could request a continuance."
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.606,398.241,And the only way to get that sort of evidence would have been a continuance.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,398.241,401.393,"Well, our argument here, Your Honor, is that the burden should be on the state."
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.032,412.234,"If you are in violation of the rules, and the burden is on the state."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,413.353,418.888,"We believe that the burden is on the state, Your Honor, because it is the state that is seeking to preclude the witness from testifying."
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,428.678,438.569,"Suppose you come up on the day of trial with hearsay testimony, and the judge says I am not going to let this in because it is hearsay."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,467.355,472.04,My answer is that the court should endeavor to ensure that the defense is able to present its witnesses.
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.04,475.075,"In that hearsay case, you would expect a continuance?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,475.075,475.592,"Well, it would depend."
1987.86-5963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,486.799,494.405,"Mr. Cunningham, what do you do at the point where the court says you have been doing this over, and over, and over again and I have got to stop it?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,494.405,501.559,"Well, that is exactly what the judge said here, not to that counsel personally, but he said that it had been happening in his courtroom over and over."
1987.86-5963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,501.559,505.361,The way that I read it he was talking about that lawyer.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,505.361,507.396,"Well, he said that this had happened in three or four other cases."
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,538.101,552.342,"Would the case be different constitutionally if instead of the attorney that it was the defendant himself who had just not brought forth this witness until the last minute because he is afraid that he might have been intimidated, or maybe he intimidated the witness and did not want to identify him until right before trial?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,552.342,554.361,"I think that the case may well be different, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.094,584.38,You do not take the position that the preclusion sanction is never appropriate?
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,584.38,586.415,"Well, we have taken that position in our brief."
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.415,587.765,But you just seemed to be abandoning it.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,587.765,589.034,"Well, we have taken that."
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.906,606.912,But your more extreme position that it is never an appropriate sanction would require us to even allow the defendant to play games with the court?
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,606.912,624.207,"Well, as I pointed out in Braswell v. Wainwright, the Fifth Circuit suggested that perhaps if it were so flagrant that could be construed as a knowing and intelligent waiver by the defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to present witnesses and that would be approached in this Court."
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,624.207,626.992,And you are saying that this kind of waiver could be made on behalf of the defendant by his counsel?
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,626.992,628.342,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.485,707.389,"It sounds to me like the inquisitorial system, not the adversarial system which we have."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,710.507,713.293,"Exactly, and that is the truth gathering system that I am referring to."
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,716.043,717.578,Subject to certain rules.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,725.933,726.716,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.716,737.572,"And here what the court was saying is this evidence is unreliable, because it has not been subjected to the testing process that our requirements of advance notice provide for."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,739.69,739.99,No.
1987.86-5963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,750.331,759.768,"So that the system would work in other cases, that advance notice and ability to check out witnesses would occur in those cases."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,759.768,774.092,"But if that test is going to be applied, if it is going to almost be a per se preclusion every time the defense violates discovery such as it did in this case, then we are not recognizing any longer the importance of the Sixth Amendment right."
1987.86-5963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.092,779.48,"Well, the Sixth Amendment right is such as the Justice suggests to rules of evidence."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,792.137,795.274,"That is correct, Your Honor, but I do not think that the rules take precedence over the right."
1987.86-5963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,841.636,852.444,"Mr. Cunningham, may I inquire, please, when the compulsory process claim was presented to the courts below?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,855.746,860.383,"There was an exception taken in the trial court, and it was noted in the post-trial motion."
1987.86-5963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,861.8,865.918,"Well, but never under the rubric of a compulsory process claim?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,865.918,866.37,--That is correct.
1987.86-5963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,876.809,878.178,And it did seem to be.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,880.045,883.147,"Yes, I do."
1987.86-5963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,886.499,887.817,Right.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,887.817,891.819,"In the appellate court, we cited the due process clause."
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.089,957.547,"But you did not really make a constitutional argument to the trial judge at the time of his ruling, you did not say that there was a constitutional requirement of the balancing test?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,957.547,959.447,"At the time of his ruling, the defense attorney did not, but the state has not contested that."
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.134,970.188,"But what I am really suggesting is, I am not suggesting, that technically there is not jurisdiction."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,981.829,989.832,"Your Honor, our position is that it is not the burden of the client, not the burden of the defendant, I am sorry, to impose upon the court that balancing test."
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.968,1001.29,"In doing the balancing under your view, would the judge's doubts about the credibility of the witness be a factor that he could weigh, and here the judge did express such doubts?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1001.29,1006.111,"He said, for what it is worth, he expressed some doubt about a portion of the credibility."
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.111,1008.33,That part of his testimony is inherently improbable.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1008.33,1008.83,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1017.502,1020.537,What about harmless error?
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1020.537,1021.32,"Well, Your Honor--"
1987.86-5963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1021.32,1039.515,"I mean if one were to find that there may be a violation of a compulsory process clause say in a hypothetical case, but the witness' testimony was so tangential or so minor that it could not possibly have affected the outcome, certainly that sort of a review for harmless error would be permissible, would it not?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1039.515,1042.617,"--I do not believe that in the trial court that should be permissible, frankly."
1987.86-5963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1047.771,1057.293,"An appellate court reviewing your claim could say true, there was a violation of the compulsory process clause, but it was just harmless error."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1057.293,1058.293,There is no question about that.
1987.86-5963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1077.807,1083.444,And also a presumption in favor of the rule.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1083.444,1085.01,"Your Honor, the rule that we are talking about--"
1987.86-5963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1085.01,1087.662,You have got two presumptions here.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1093.466,1094.835,--The rule that we are talking about--
1987.86-5963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1094.835,1100.906,"So you are going to put the burden on the state to prove that it is good, how do you do that?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1100.906,1106.643,"--The Illinois statute, the Illinois discovery statutes, do not require preclusion, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1107.56,1110.445,But the judge does.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1110.445,1111.378,"--Well, that is our argument."
1987.86-5963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1111.378,1112.214,That is the rule.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1112.214,1114.78,That would be a mechanistic approach.
1987.86-5963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1141.649,1145.018,But the defendant did not ask for that in this case.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1145.018,1151.505,"No, it was the state who failed to ask for a continuance or failed to demonstrate in any manner that it was going to be prejudiced in this case."
1987.86-5963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1151.505,1155.291,"Well, did defendant have no responsibility at all?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1155.291,1162.396,"Your Honor, to put it on the defendant would be very difficult, because he does not know what position is in in terms of prejudice."
1987.86-5963,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1184.626,1188.612,I do not see where you shift the burden here.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1200.604,1203.171,"Well, I think that we should look at the intent of the rules."
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1215.281,1219.899,"But there is really more than that at stake, it seems to me, there also."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1244.966,1249.835,I think that we have to maybe measure what the quantum of prejudice is when you say that in every continuance there is prejudice.
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.024,1258.274,"I know, and they are not a healthy thing."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1258.274,1259.893,So I think that we have to take a realistic view.
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1441.878,1445.864,To take once again the application of your Sixth Amendment theory to hearsay.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1468.378,1469.48,I think that we have to look at the other factors.
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1469.48,1470.48,"Every case, case by case?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1470.48,1472.58,"I think so, case by case."
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1472.58,1481.936,"No absolute rule excluding hearsay, you have to say, well, let's see, maybe we will have to have a continuance so you can go get the original declarant, go get Wormley?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1481.936,1482.288,Yes.
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1485.24,1487.856,"No, you are just saying that you are entitled to a continuance."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1487.856,1490.542,"No, I am saying that you would have to look at it case by case."
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1499.38,1506.284,"The judge could not just say look it, today is the trial date, you know what the rules of evidence are, you should have been here with your evidence."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1522.06,1522.995,"Perhaps he could, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1524.895,1537.136,"But it is the same principle that you are urging under the Sixth Amendment, that the rules designed to assure the reliability of evidence do not have to be absolutely followed."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1547.861,1550.996,"--Well, that is true."
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.55,1596.791,"How can you say that there is no question of unreliability, if the state says one of the reasons why we want you identify your witnesses in advance is so that the other side will have a chance to do the investigation that is necessary to determine their credibility?"
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1596.791,1597.258,What I am saying--
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1597.258,1598.977,It is designed in part for reliability purposes.
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1598.977,1605.63,"--What I am saying, Your Honor, is that there are other remedies for the state to be made whole so that they would be put into that position."
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.63,1608.015,"Well, there are the same other remedies in the hearsay example."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1608.015,1609.232,"Well, let me give an example, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1619.306,1620.173,"No, of course not."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1622.508,1623.625,So they would have known who he was.
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1623.625,1626.727,"Whether he was at the scene, and I guess that he was not in concurrence with the scene."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1626.727,1630.329,But instead of that what the state got was that they got his full testimony under oath.
1987.86-5963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1630.329,1632.745,"Well, yes."
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1632.745,1639.685,"So what I am saying is that there are other remedies, other less severe remedies, that we feel are appropriate certainly in this case."
1987.86-5963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1644.637,1650.374,Does the state have no right to depose a listed witness in Illinois?
1987.86-5963,0,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,1650.374,1654.46,"Not in Illinois, no."
1987.86-5963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.246,1658.329,"Thank you, Mr. Cunningham."
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,1667.518,1672.756,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-5963,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1736.162,1748.57,"Mr. Shabat, may I ask, is there any evidence that the defendant was closely involved in this noncompliance with the discovery rule, or was it just the lawyer who was responsible?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,1748.57,1783.56,"Your Honor, the record reflects that at the time, at the time during trial, after the jury had been selected, after opening statements by both the state and the defense, and after two of the state's key witnesses had testified on both direct and cross-examination that the court sent the jury home until the next day."
1987.86-5963,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1807.392,1814.031,"Yes, but my question was was defendant personally involved in the noncompliance?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,1814.031,1828.874,"I suggest that it can be inferred that when he learned, when the defense attorney is telling the court that he learned, although we do not know directly and specifically and we can only infer, that he learned it from his client who was sitting there at counsel table."
1987.86-5963,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1828.874,1835.195,Then the answer to my question is that there is no evidence that the defendant was personally involved in this?
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,1835.195,1842.931,"There is no direct evidence of that, that is correct."
1987.86-5963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1894.983,1904.088,I take it then that you are saying then that preclusion is automatically justified in every single case of noncompliance?
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,1904.088,1906.707,"No, sir, that is not our position."
1987.86-5963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1930.489,1940.779,"That may be the state rule, but is it your position that the Sixth Amendment would never, never forbid preclusion?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,1940.779,1941.88,No.
1987.86-5963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.88,1942.414,Sometimes?
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,1942.414,1945.33,"There are circumstances, there are circumstances."
1987.86-5963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.33,1948.901,"What are they, just name one?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,1948.901,1960.126,"I think that it would involve a circumstance where the nature of the violation, for example, being one that was fairly technical."
1987.86-5963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.747,1985.757,"Let's take it, would... would the Sixth Amendment ever forbid preclusion where there is a failure to reveal a name of a witness in compliance with the rule?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,1985.757,1988.459,It might.
1987.86-5963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.279,1999.831,So do you think that there is a balancing process that must go on in every case?
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,1999.831,2000.517,"Most certainly, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2002.65,2009.788,"The same in hearsay, of course, right, the same with hearsay, because I mean the Sixth Amendment applies to that too?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2009.788,2011.822,"Well, no, I do not believe so."
1987.86-5963,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2022.53,2030.802,I thought that you were telling us that part of the purpose of this rule is if there has not been the time to investigate the witness that the evidence is unreliable.
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2032.236,2033.404,"--In this case, that is right."
1987.86-5963,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.404,2036.356,"Well, just in this case, but not generally under these rules?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2036.356,2036.906,No.
1987.86-5963,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2060.054,2101.565,"Mr. Shabat, suppose in this case instead of saying what he did to the judge, as I understand what you told us, that what defense counsel said was I have just learned, suppose he had gone to the judge and said, judge, I made an awful boner here, it is not my client's fault, I have known about this witness and I forgot to put it down, and that is why I did not comply with the discovery rule, and I do not think that my client should be penalized by denying him his right under the Sixth Amendment in those circumstances, what would you do with a case like that?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2101.565,2110.488,"--I would have to weigh that factor, Your Honor, with due regard to the other factors present in the case such as when does this occur."
1987.86-5963,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2110.488,2112.054,Just when it occurred here.
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2112.054,2117.908,That is essentially what the defense lawyer tried to say.
1987.86-5963,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.625,2150.815,"Your position is just that the balancing was properly done here, you agree that there has to be balancing in every case?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2150.815,2153.767,"Yes, sir, that is correct."
1987.86-5963,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.8,2159.069,"There is not much of a dispute really, is there, between you and the other side?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2166.591,2172.661,"--My opponent, I believe, is arguing that a preclusion is never appropriate."
1987.86-5963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2191.69,2197.027,Did you not argue that we should overrule Washington v. Texas?
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2202.164,2220.375,"In the brief submitted by the State of Illinois, we suggested that based on our historical analysis of the evolution of the writing of the compulsory process clause that perhaps Washington v. Texas should be reconsidered."
1987.86-5963,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2266.69,2271.058,"I suppose, let me change Justice Brennan's hypothetical a little."
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2285.235,2289.354,It is possible.
1987.86-5963,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2311.183,2316.754,The hypothetical that I gave you was that it was a sheer secretary's oversight.
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2316.754,2319.873,That would certainly weigh in favor of not precluding.
1987.86-5963,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2319.873,2322.741,Do you have in Illinois a notice of alibi rule?
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2322.741,2324.725,"Yes, and it is reciprocal as well."
1987.86-5963,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2324.725,2328.979,And you would take the same position with respect to that that you are taking here?
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2328.979,2331.097,"Yes, I would, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2401.61,2408.847,"Mr. Shabat, does it make any difference in the balancing how crucial the evidence is that the witness intends to give, do you suppose?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2408.847,2413.233,"Yes, it can and it should, because it is important."
1987.86-5963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2413.233,2415.518,How important was this evidence?
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2415.518,2417.12,"Not very, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2452.793,2467.303,"Mr. Shabat, if you believe that the victim was armed and his brother was armed, or at least his brother, when they testified to the contrary and that the only gun was that of the defendant, and if you believe the man, it would really change the facts quite a bit."
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2467.303,2468.003,Perhaps.
1987.86-5963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.632,2497.238,"Perhaps it really does not have anything to do with the issue, but was this retained counsel, defendant's counsel, or was this appointed counsel?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2497.238,2497.588,Yes.
1987.86-5963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2497.588,2498.038,Retained counsel?
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2498.038,2499.672,"I believe it was, yes."
1987.86-5963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2499.672,2512.248,"Does that answer the Petitioner's repeated point about that you could have gotten a postponement of a day or so, do you think that your last answer answers that?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2512.248,2517.836,"Your Honor, I believe that a continuance would have been inappropriate in this case."
1987.86-5963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2537.13,2543.934,"Trials have been interrupted before in Illinois and Chicago, have been interrupted in the middle of a trial, right?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2546.686,2550.04,"--Most likely, hopefully not for this reason though."
1987.86-5963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2595.401,2602.988,"But you could have had the continuance come after the state's case in chief, could you not, because Wormley was not going to be called until the defense case."
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2602.988,2605.19,"There is another aspect to that, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2638.763,2642.882,That does not happen in all criminal cases.
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2642.882,2643.398,What is that?
1987.86-5963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2643.398,2650.738,"Have you not ever heard of a criminal case where the lawyer says you are the arresting officer, well tell what happened?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2654.623,2657.908,"Well, that--"
1987.86-5963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2657.908,2669.281,"If they waited two days or one day, there could have been a preliminary investigation, could there not?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2671.866,2672.585,"--Yes, I believe we do."
1987.86-5963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2694.998,2696.033,We all understand.
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2700.902,2703.704,"--I think that is central to my argument, Your Honor."
1987.86-5963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2721.981,2723.283,"Well, let me ask you then."
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2723.283,2723.683,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-5963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2723.683,2735.075,"If this happened on the first day, would you be in favor of a postponement, a continuance?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2735.075,2742.979,"If by the first day, Your Honor, I take your meaning to be prior to the selection of the jury, prior to opening statements?"
1987.86-5963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2742.979,2748.816,"Well, do you want this to be a case limited to the facts in this case?"
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2748.816,2749.918,No.
1987.86-5963,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2749.918,2766.094,"If you do not want it limited to facts in this case, then stop emphasizing these facts."
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2801.434,2827.382,"Your Honor, I believe to the contrary, that we have a record here that shows that the judge was if not specifically articulating any of the criteria that we have discussed today as part of his decision in deciding to preclude the witness that he was fully cognizant of the actions available to him."
1987.86-5963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2974.561,2979.632,Let me ask you about this repetitious problem that happened over and over again.
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,2994.909,2996.677,Yes to both.
1987.86-5963,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.494,3009.234,"Because I suppose that if you look at it as the latter as part of the problem, then the rather shabby behavior of this lawyer is relevant and perhaps partially attributable to his client."
1987.86-5963,1,36717,michael_shabat,,3009.234,3011.186,"Yes, that is our position."
1987.86-5963,2,38965,richard_e_cunningham,,3256.095,3257.561,"Thank you, Your Honor."
