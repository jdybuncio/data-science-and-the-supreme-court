1984.83-2032,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.176,"Mr. Horowitz, I think you may proceed when you're ready."
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,1589.397,1593.249,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.83-2032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1598.737,1599.787,Which time?
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,1600.689,1604.641,"--In the second decision, the decision that's the subject of this petition."
1984.83-2032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.693,1693.964,"Well, did the Board say that it was considering simply the fact that they were deportable or the fact that they had been smuggled in illegally?"
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,1693.964,1705.189,"--They said that they considered... in their summary of what they considered, in addition to the frivolous appeals... and it did say ""in addition to""... that they had used a paid smuggler and had failed to depart voluntarily."
1984.83-2032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1705.189,1710.493,And the Court of Appeals said that was not a permissible exercise of the Attorney General's discretion?
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,1710.493,1720.266,"No, what the Court of Appeals said, that the Board hasn't explained why these facts are a peculiar problem under the immigration laws."
1984.83-2032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1722.884,1727.621,"When you're dealing with unfettered discretion, why should the Board have to explain anything to the Court of Appeals?"
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,1727.621,1734.191,The derivation of the term 1956 decision of this Court in Jay versus Boyd.
1984.83-2032,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1755.687,1762.007,"Last term in Phinpathya, the Court said it was entirely within the Board's discretion."
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,1762.007,1762.526,That's correct.
1984.83-2032,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1762.526,1770.179,So I think the language has been very broad and makes it very difficult to justify the Eighth Circuit's approach.
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,1770.179,1777.618,"The language... that's footnote 6 in Phinpathya, which of course you wrote."
1984.83-2032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1799.566,1822.731,"Well, but it's not so much a jurisdictional question I was asking about, but your suggestion, based on the Court of Appeals' opinion I realize, that the Board not only must state reasons why it chooses not to reopen the case, but has to explain to the satisfaction of the Court of Appeals why these reasons make the case different from some other case."
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,1824.933,1844.495,"No, I don't think that the Court of Appeals was... I think what the Court of Appeals was applying was an arbitrary and capricious standard, and saying there's a range of decisions that we might disagree with, that we have to uphold, we must affirm, because you are the primary enforcer of the immigration laws; but we as a Court of Appeals have a duty to make you make those decisions in a rational way."
1984.83-2032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1861.789,1873.497,"But there's a presumption of regularity in any administrative proceeding, and surely the burden is on the party that wants to upset the decision to show that these people have been treated differently from somebody else."
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,1889.274,1895.529,I don't think that the Court of Appeals was saying that there is a presumption that the Board did anything wrong.
1984.83-2032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.433,1916.943,"But can a rational Court of Appeals fairly say that the reasons given by the Board here don't make any sense to us... smuggled in, illegally entered the country, frivolous appeals?"
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,1936.787,1940.724,I think it's more a matter of what they were imposing was a matter of administrative fairness.
1984.83-2032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1940.724,1944.426,"Well, where did they get the right to impose that?"
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,1944.426,1946.978,I think it's what Congress intended.
1984.83-2032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1946.978,1949.83,"Well, where do you get... at what part of the Act do you find that?"
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,1949.83,1957.484,"Congress provided for suspension remedy, and I think what the Court of Appeals assumed is that Congress intended that remedy be evenhandedly administered."
1984.83-2032,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1957.484,1964.257,But Congress didn't even require motions for rehearing to be granted or considered.
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,1967.376,1971.828,"The Board's been provided... well, the motion process is provided by the Attorney General."
1984.83-2032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.524,1997.976,"Well, in Wang it said broad discretion."
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2010.034,2012.902,Jay is inconsistent in its usage.
1984.83-2032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2022.341,2026.143,"Did Congress say ""sound discretion""?"
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2026.143,2030.947,"In the Section 244 in the Act itself, it says"
1984.83-2032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2033.347,2035.315,"They didn't modify it with any adjectives, then?"
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2035.315,2037.367,That's correct.
1984.83-2032,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2064.501,2071.422,And then the Eighth Circuit on the first go-around sat on it for a solid year.
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2073.524,2074.124,I don't know why.
1984.83-2032,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2089.652,2094.02,And a three or four-page opinion for a whole year.
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2098.508,2099.924,"Yes, I think that's correct."
1984.83-2032,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2099.924,2102.19,Are they that far behind?
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2103.542,2107.661,"I'm not that familiar with the practice of the Eighth Circuit, Mr. Justice Black."
1984.83-2032,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2107.661,2109.88,What did your client get out of the first go-around?
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2109.88,2114.684,He got a chance to apply for suspension.
1984.83-2032,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2114.684,2115.434,That was all?
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2115.434,2126.824,"Well, it's possible, and the Court of Appeals did read their previous opinion the second time around as mandating that the motion to reopen be granted."
1984.83-2032,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2133.144,2137.696,"Well, what did the Court of Appeals mean by law of the case?"
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2137.696,2147.219,"--I think they felt that, when they considered it the second time, that the first time they had ordered the Board to reopen and that the Board wasn't free to deny the motion."
1984.83-2032,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2147.219,2151.44,"Well, are you arguing that the second gave them nothing that the first hadn't already given?"
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2151.44,2151.94,"Oh, no."
1984.83-2032,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2230.106,2238.712,By what standard should we review the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the conduct before them and by them wasn't frivolous?
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2238.712,2245.616,"I think some deference is due the decision of the Court of Appeals, since the activity talked about took place in front of them."
1984.83-2032,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2289.776,2298.148,"May I ask you a question about Jay against Boyd, which I hadn't read before the argument and I've just read it, and the scope of the discretion in the case."
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2320.164,2326.484,"I think that's what we're arguing, is there's been an evolution in the practice of administrative law and there has been an evolution in this Court's decisions."
1984.83-2032,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2326.484,2330.37,"If you make that argument, then you're basically... it's basically a procedural argument."
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2330.37,2331.386,"Yes, i think essentially--"
1984.83-2032,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.386,2335.072,And then what's wrong with the procedure that the Attorney General did follow?
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2345.713,2350.848,--We're not arguing that that class of behavior can't be sanctioned.
1984.83-2032,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2364.757,2371.161,--But why can't he say that the time that's gained by appeals that we think are frivolous are enough?
1984.83-2032,1,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2378.601,2385.755,"I think in terms of expertise, this isn't something that the agency was set up to decide."
1984.83-2032,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2420.094,2422.296,"Anything further, Mr. Horowitz?"
1984.83-2032,3,35007,lawrence_h_rudnick,,2656.962,2658.146,--could be an abuse of discretion.
1984.83-2032,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2664.885,2665.768,"Thank you, gentlemen."
