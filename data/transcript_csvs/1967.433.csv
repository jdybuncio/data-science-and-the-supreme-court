1967.433,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,45.792,48.849,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.433,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,337.855,340.061,But didn't you say part of that was subsidy?
1967.433,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,340.061,354.274,"Yes sir, and I don't regard that if I have to buy a corporation that's supposed to be earning $9.5 million, I think the fact that $4.5 million is a subsidy dependent on year-to-year appropriations of a legislature makes that a far different character of earnings, but that's what part it is."
1967.433,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,424.196,426.684,Is that after a subsidy from the State of New Jersey?
1967.433,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,426.684,427.143,Yes sir.
1967.433,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,434.91,436.609,"The same -- that same amount, 4.5 million?"
1967.433,0,28253,howard_j_trienens,,436.609,437.986,"Yes, I believe so, yes sir."
1967.433,1,36070,myron_s_isaacs,,2521.225,2527.529,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.433,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3123.597,3123.792,"Well, Mr. Isaacs."
1967.433,1,36070,myron_s_isaacs,,3123.792,3125.151,-- wholly feasible to do that.
1967.433,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3125.552,3126.502,"Mr. Isaacs, is --"
1967.433,1,36070,myron_s_isaacs,,3126.502,3126.675,Yes sir.
1967.433,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3126.675,3198.543,"-- aren't you confronting us -- this Court with a dilemma that I suppose the Penn-Central offer -- made an offer to New Haven, suppose that were approved by the ICC and the District Court, and suppose the New Haven rejected the offer by either the New Haven or some appropriate class of security holders, I suppose it would follow from what you say that the -- hence -- that -- they just have to keep that process up until something were done that was satisfactory to the New Haven, the trustees and the appropriate class of security holders or that the Penn-Central would have to lease the New Haven road and operate it on a lease basis and even that would assume that the terms of the lease would be accepted by the New Haven, wouldn't it?"
1967.433,1,36070,myron_s_isaacs,,3198.543,3209.504,"If you had a final solution by lease, that would -- there would be some either acceptance by New Haven or crammed down by the courts."
1967.433,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3248.802,3248.953,But then who would be --
1967.433,1,36070,myron_s_isaacs,,3248.953,3249.861,-- stopped the --
1967.433,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3249.861,3252.53,Who would be at whose mercy?
1967.433,1,36070,myron_s_isaacs,,3252.53,3252.564,I don't --
1967.433,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3252.564,3252.741,Do you think that would (Voice Overlap) --
1967.433,1,36070,myron_s_isaacs,,3252.741,3255.889,-- and nobody would be at anybody's mercy at that point.
1967.433,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3306.002,3310.48,"Well, they've either got a great deal of power or not quite enough power?"
1967.433,1,36070,myron_s_isaacs,,3310.48,3311.518,"They've no power at all, Your Honor."
1967.433,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3311.518,3312.094,(Inaudible)
1967.433,1,36070,myron_s_isaacs,,3322.19,3330.705,"I'm not suggesting that we could hope to have power equivalent to that at Penn-Central, we can't and don't."
1967.433,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3525.809,3541.294,Mr. McDermott.
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,3541.294,3543.453,May it please the Court.
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3759.086,3768.374,"Mr. McDermott, I am not entirely sure that I clearly understand the position of B & M here."
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,3772.754,3773.884,That is correct sir.
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3773.884,3775.932,"Except for valuation, you're --"
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,3775.932,3777.247,As to B & M.
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3777.247,3786.312,"Yes, and you're asking that we consider valuation at this time and that we remand with respect to the valuation point."
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,3786.312,3786.939,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3786.939,3790.355,But otherwise that we affirm the order below.
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,3790.355,3790.859,That is correct.
1967.433,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4186.417,4192.255,Is the value -- was the value of B & M contested?
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4192.255,4194.625,"Yes, it was the -- it would be fair to say it was contented."
1967.433,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4194.625,4198.914,Whose figures did the Commission exempts?
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4198.914,4207.737,"The Commission, as to B & M, accepted figures in the record submitted by a joint witness for the petitioning railroads."
1967.433,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4223.989,4226.684,Was there any evidence to contradict that?
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4226.684,4245.991,"Well, there -- yes there were -- so-called four were -- four way merger study introduced which reflected substantially the types of unifications of management that the Commission details in its finding and in its order in which it says N & W can accomplish under control."
1967.433,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4261.867,4277.115,"But after all that's said and done, the Commission did attempt to determine the equities accepting as a basis the testimony would be in those witnesses."
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4277.115,4281.154,"No, that the testimony of a witness presented jointly by the petitioners."
1967.433,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4281.154,4282.211,Is that B & O?
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4282.211,4284.601,"No, that would be Erie-Lackawanna, D & H and --"
1967.433,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4284.601,4287.328,(Inaudible) was the B & O -- was the one B & O (Voice Overlap) --
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4287.328,4290.096,"No, no, B & O was not a party to this proceeding."
1967.433,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4290.096,4291.312,It has nothing to do with that?
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4291.312,4292.939,"No, that's correct."
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4292.939,4301.437,Is this the only opportunity that there will be for Boston and Maine to attack the exchange ratio?
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4305.588,4307.235,How does that work?
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4310.544,4310.671,Well --
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4310.671,4315.661,"This has not been accepted by Boston and Maine, has it?"
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4315.661,4316.374,"No, it has not."
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4318.968,4321.867,"Alright, they'd submit -- it hasn't been submitted, the Boston and Maine?"
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4321.867,4322.872,Correct.
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4322.872,4340.26,"Well isn't -- won't that -- won't there be a proceeding, subsequent proceedings when it is submitted to Boston and Maine and isn't that the time when the exchange ratio will be right for judicial consideration?"
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4340.26,4345.073,"Well, this is a hazardous area in which to make a prediction as to future litigation."
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4359.168,4359.194,(Inaudible)
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4359.194,4363.454,And then the corporation would be based with the procedural consequences of that action.
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4363.454,4365.419,"Yes, I'd wonder."
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4422.929,4425.889,That is correct -- that is substantially correct Mr. Justice.
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4461.298,4465.545,But suppose your stockholders agree with you and they reject this --
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4465.545,4465.832,Yes.
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4465.832,4467.056,-- what happens?
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4467.056,4489.202,"Well, under such a situation and assuming that D & H had accepted the terms proposed for them, then under the outstanding orders of the Commission, we would be precluded from proceeding in Penn-Central either on a joint application with Penn-Central or on a petition filed under that reserved authority."
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4489.202,4489.505,And then --
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4489.505,4492.156,And we would have to seek our home elsewhere.
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4492.156,4503.469,"Then -- well, then you'd -- your stockholders rejected the offer, I don't know, would you have a court remedy at that point?"
1967.433,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4503.469,4504.345,I suppose not.
1967.433,2,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,4504.345,4508.25,I would think not sir.
1967.433,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4561.031,4569.361,Mr. Von Starck.
1967.433,3,23191,ernest_r_von_starck,,4569.361,4572.396,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.433,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4779.21,4782.259,Where does Reading run to and from?
1967.433,3,23191,ernest_r_von_starck,,4782.259,4790.948,Reading lines are located primarily in Eastern Pennsylvania with trackage up into New Jersey and some down into Delaware.
1967.433,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4928.596,4933.798,I don't understand your position entirely either.
1967.433,3,23191,ernest_r_von_starck,,4942.106,4942.147,No --
1967.433,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4942.147,4956.534,"All you're asking us to do is to order that the Commission have a hearing on your -- the grievance that you communicated to us, is that right?"
1967.433,3,23191,ernest_r_von_starck,,4956.534,4957.436,Yes sir.
1967.433,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4977.412,4988.653,Mr. MacDougall.
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,4988.653,4992.314,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.433,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5034.579,5041.773,What you are saying is you want a hearing on the merits of the merger in the pending Pennsylvania District Court suit?
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5041.773,5043.141,"Right, we want a hearing on that."
1967.433,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5047.383,5051.178,"So -- which you may have -- go forward with the District Court action, is that it?"
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5051.178,5052.882,We are afraid.
1967.433,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5070.338,5072.198,But what's was the status of those?
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5072.198,5074.134,"Oh, we're going to have a hearing next week."
1967.433,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5075.375,5076.379,A hearing of what?
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5076.379,5084.772,"Yes, we filed our briefs in the Penn-Central and the Inclusion Case in the Pennsylvania Court and the Government will answer that on December 13th."
1967.433,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5084.772,5086.373,What's the nature of the hearing?
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5086.373,5095.286,"It's on the permanent injunction to set aside the orders on the merger and the Inclusion Case, both consolidated in one case."
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5107.413,5109.983,How did you become a party in the New York case?
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5109.983,5115.958,We had been interveners on behalf of Erie-Lackawanna in September 1966.
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5115.958,5117.43,So you were a party?
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5117.43,5119.875,We're a party at that time.
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5119.875,5120.071,And weren't you --
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5120.071,5120.394,We did not --
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5120.394,5128.696,"-- obliged to raise all the questions about the merger, you had to raised in the -- in order of the three-judge-court of New York."
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5128.696,5130.391,"Well, two reasons, no."
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5137.465,5138.988,"Oh, I don't -- it's about the consolidation --"
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5138.988,5139.408,"Well, our --"
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5139.408,5145.639,"-- its about you, you as a party, were you required if you were going to attack the order of New York court which you were."
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5145.639,5146.176,Yes.
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5146.176,5149.197,But you're required to raise all your grounds if you attack that?
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5149.197,5162.471,"No, what happened was that on the mandate from this Court to the District Court, the District Court issued an order on mandate from this Court in which they just kept an injunction and remanded the cause completely back to Interstate Commerce Commission --"
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5162.471,5165.871,"Oh, I understand that, but you remained a party to the case."
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5165.871,5168.431,"Well, we would -- we moved to withdraw from the case."
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5174.521,5174.639,And they -- and --
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5174.639,5175.84,"-- on the 16th of June, and they got --"
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5175.84,5177.455,And they refused to let you withdraw?
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5177.455,5178.366,That's right.
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5178.366,5178.74,Do you think that --
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5178.74,5179.694,-- in the Penn-Central case.
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5179.694,5181.194,Was that error?
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5181.194,5186.124,"Yes, we cite that as error that our motion to withdraw should've been granted, right."
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5186.124,5188.646,Let's assume that it was an error.
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5188.646,5192.516,"Well, that is a -- it wasn't (Inaudible), I --"
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5192.516,5198.271,Then you were required to submit what ground you had to attack the merger in the New York court.
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5198.271,5204.422,"We were given until August 2nd to attack it and to file our brief six days later, on August 8th."
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5204.422,5205.865,"Well, were you required --"
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5205.865,5206.016,(Inaudible)
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5206.016,5208.13,Assume that schedule was a reasonable one.
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5211.517,5216.983,"Well, they said you are required to follow it or be dismissed with prejudice in Penn-Central."
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5216.983,5217.86,That's right.
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5217.86,5218.63,That's right.
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5218.63,5226.616,"And you think that to, do you think you're entitled to present some grounds to attack the merger in New York in some other grounds and some other --"
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5226.616,5227.214,Well --
1967.433,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5227.214,5227.943,-- requirements?
1967.433,4,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,5227.943,5228.759,We didn't assert it.
1967.433,5,22766,edward_a_mcdermott,,5511.902,5512.669,This I don't know.
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,5591.319,5594.483,May it please the Court.
1967.433,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5910.431,5914.021,"Well, has a proposal been made to the bondholders?"
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,5919.083,5920.677,Yes indeed.
1967.433,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5920.677,5920.858,And what --
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,5920.858,5921.226,It --
1967.433,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5921.226,5923.912,And what is the proposal in terms of the bondholders?
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,5923.912,5941.997,"It's a very complicated proposal Your Honor which in saying that we had rejected it, neither E-L nor N & W nor any other parties who've complained about are not having taken this take it or leave it -- have seen fit to describe either to the court below or to you."
1967.433,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5941.997,5942.662,"Well, you mean it's --"
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,5942.662,5942.668,Yes -- it --
1967.433,6,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5942.668,5944.687,-- too complicated for us to consider?
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,5944.687,5947.106,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1967.433,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5964.936,5967.19,Did the Commission examine it?
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,5967.19,5972.068,"It was put before the Commission, the Commission never mentioned it."
1967.433,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5989.216,5992.14,You do not challenge the whole orders.
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,5995.375,5996.656,We do not Your Honor.
1967.433,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5996.656,6001.011,You only do it insofar as you want a reservation made for your bond?
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,6001.011,6003.124,"A reservation -- exactly, Your Honor."
1967.433,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6003.173,6010.74,Doesn't mean maybe that it will cost more or less in the future than it has been indicated as it would now?
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,6010.74,6012.234,"What would cost more, Your Honor?"
1967.433,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6012.234,6019.062,"The bond, the bond to -- more money that have to go to them or less money than what's indicated now."
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,6019.062,6019.081,We --
1967.433,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6019.081,6020.457,What I'm getting at is this.
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,6033.084,6036.456,"Your Honor, we have had no opportunity to negotiate."
1967.433,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6038.159,6039.924,I'm not talking about the justice of it.
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,6043.363,6048.591,Section 5 (2) Your Honor requires no vote from stockholders at all.
1967.433,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6081.248,6081.426,What I'm asking --
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,6081.426,6082.051,They --
1967.433,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6082.051,6093.738,"What I'm asking is quite different, that the number here, objecting to this going through and like reservations are made to do certain things in the future to the reference to their business."
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,6098.13,6114.995,"We merely want to have a reservation to come back to the Commission if there is an abuse of the control beyond what the Commission contemplate, beyond what the Commission contemplated or should have contemplated as bounds --"
1967.433,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6114.995,6129.792,"Do you think following your suggestion, the suggestion about the bondholders will result in factually frustrating the completion of the merger after the merger has already been completed?"
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,6129.792,6131.091,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1967.433,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6131.091,6131.666,Why?
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,6131.666,6140.086,We would hope that the imposition that the clarification that this retention of jurisdiction which the Commission has made.
1967.433,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6164.346,6166.524,You want your name put in there.
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,6166.524,6167.471,"Yes, we would like."
1967.433,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6173.349,6180.138,"Well, that (Inaudible) tend to frustrate the ultimate completion of the proceeding."
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,6180.138,6192.587,"Not at all, you -- well, there will be a reservation so that if N & W steps over the bounds and its control, we can come back and apply to the Commission and ask them to require it to stay within the bounds."
1967.433,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6202.288,6211.637,Are you saying that what the order they are making with reference to your people will cause the bondholders to lose a part of their bond?
1967.433,6,35828,malcolm_fooshee,,6211.637,6251.383,"It will -- it may well cause, and I will hope to show you in just a moment that the earning power can be taken from behind our bonds that no -- for 50 years, N & W can see that no interest is payable on all these more than $70 million income bonds which at $3 million a year, they mature in 2015 and 2020, $50 -- to 50 at $3 million a year for 50 years is more than a 100 -- is about $150 million and if that's compounded, it's enormously beyond that."
1967.433,6,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6265.516,6273.876,Mr. Solicitor General.
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,6273.876,6277.25,May it please the Court.
1967.433,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6326.145,6329.487,You're going to submit the (Inaudible) --
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,6329.487,6329.923,"Well, I would suppose --"
1967.433,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6329.923,6331.422,-- in light of that?
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,6331.422,6342.734,I would suppose that they should have appeared in the New York City -- in the three-judge District Court in New York and that they are properly foreclosed for not having.
1967.433,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6342.734,6347.441,And would be foreclosed in the pending actions of the District Court of Pennsylvania?
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,6347.441,6362.706,"Yes, that the decision of the Court in New York operates its res judicata to determine their interest in that case."
1967.433,7,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6491.904,6496.822,"Mr. Solicitor General, forgive me for interrupting your argument."
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,6513.98,6526.506,It's my understanding that they do not oppose the merger but they do oppose the inclusion terms.
1967.433,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6536.49,6544.472,They oppose the adequacy of the inclusion proceeding and they further maintain that no merger can take place --
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,6544.472,6545.414,They maintain --
1967.433,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6545.414,6545.499,-- it's only (Voice Overlap) --
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,6545.499,6557.005,"-- this unless there are -- unless they -- unless the rights which they claim with respect to inclusion are upheld, that then the merger should not go ahead."
1967.433,7,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6570.611,6574.472,"Well, I'm not sure about it, but it is quite important."
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,6598.96,6599.771,I think that is correct.
1967.433,7,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6599.771,6601.177,So that really does amount to --
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,6601.177,6628.901,"That the position of the Norfolk and Western is -- that the existing order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the present circumstances does not carry out the mandate of this Court's decision of last term, which if it is taken one phrase and the opinion is taken literally, that there must be found a haven for these roads that that has not been done."
1967.433,7,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7578.272,7598.936,"Mr. Solicitor General, perhaps you could clear me up whether the Commission ever find that the merger of Penn-Central, Penn and the Central would be in the public interest if the three railroads became part of that system?"
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7598.936,7604.198,I'm afraid I have no knowledge about that.
1967.433,7,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7609.972,7648.407,"Well, if one of the possibilities, if these railroads don't accept the present results of the Inclusion Case and the other possibility is going into Penn-Central, how can the Commission not have -- if it wants the merger to go forward, how can it say that it has not found that inclusion would not be in the public interest, Penn-Central, because we have to -- how can the merger go forward if it's necessary to find that it is in the public interest to include the three -- these three lines."
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7648.407,7660.122,"As I understand it, there was -- at the time of decision, no issue before the Commission with respect to the inclusion of these three lines and Penn-Central, isn't that right Mr. Ginnane?"
1967.433,7,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7660.122,7661.522,"Well, I can take it --"
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7661.522,7668.91,They had petitioned for inclusion at an earlier time and had withdrawn those petitions in Penn-Central.
1967.433,7,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7689.118,7710.317,"And why is it this then though -- why is -- if the Commission wants the Penn-Central merger to go forward, it seems to me that it has almost found that if it hasn't expressly and had -- for all practical purposes found that inclusion of these three roads in Penn-Central would not be able to (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7710.317,7714.875,It seems to me that for all practical purposes it has so found.
1967.433,7,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7746.389,7769.221,"Well, what do you say that as long as there is an open -- that there is an open alternative for these three roads, namely to go in to the Penn-Central system that the Penn-Central merger should not go forward?"
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7769.221,7773.066,"No, I don't think I -- I don't think I --"
1967.433,7,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7773.066,7791.049,(Inaudible) because you've already indicated that you would say that the public interest would require that the merger not go forward if these three roads were involved because there would be monopoly conditions in New England.
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7812.954,7817.09,Then I would be greatly surprised if they would find it here.
1967.433,7,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7864.247,7884.686,Mr. Solicitor General may I put to you some basic propositions here related to the colloquy between you and Mr. Justice White and let's see if the -- what your position is with respect to them.
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7935.996,7936.029,I think we're in --
1967.433,7,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7936.029,7936.824,-- this far?
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7936.824,7937.447,I think we're entirely --
1967.433,7,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7937.447,7937.923,Alright that's --
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7937.923,7938.081,-- together.
1967.433,7,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7938.081,7939.045,-- point one.
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7975.436,7979.123,"Yes, and it is our position that the Commission has done that."
1967.433,7,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7982.65,7997.653,"Now, it's not of -- now, if that is the case and the issue before us is not whether these roads will or will not accept it but whether the Commission has done what this Court held to be its duty --"
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7997.653,7997.889,And that is our --
1967.433,7,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7997.889,7998.753,(Inaudible)
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,7998.753,8003.802,-- precisely our position and it is the reason why we think the judgment below should be affirmed.
1967.433,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8003.802,8028.866,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask you just one broad question, is it your argument that it is in the public interest for this Court to give a blanket affirmance of the judgment below without requiring the Commission to retain jurisdiction for any purpose in the placing of this merger and inclusion?"
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,8028.866,8033.722,"Well, it is our position that the Court should affirm the judgment below."
1967.433,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8048.178,8067.483,"So, does it occur to you that if there are any -- on any of these issues that the Commission should retain some jurisdiction other than it has for the purpose of placing it and seeing that the rights that are contemplated under the Commission's order are actually given?"
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,8067.483,8070.272,I don't know of any such issue.
1967.433,7,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8106.462,8111.607,"But the Commission did reserve jurisdiction, is it not?"
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,8112.109,8112.119,I believe --
1967.433,7,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8112.119,8112.605,-- put my hands --
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,8112.605,8113.623,I believe it did.
1967.433,7,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8113.96,8123.089,I can't put my hands on the reservation of jurisdiction in this mass of papers here but it -- wasn't there a general reservation of jurisdiction?
1967.433,7,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,8123.089,8126.271,I believe there is a general reservation of jurisdiction.
1967.433,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8137.593,8145.116,Mr. Barr.
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8145.116,8148.234,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.433,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8344.858,8357.32,"(Inaudible) stock that the Commission thought there were -- that the mortgage had (Inaudible) -- the mortgage deed had ample value, underlying your mortgage or not?"
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8357.32,8360.618,Let me explain the situation with respect to the bondholders Mr. Justice White.
1967.433,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8385.923,8387.875,Are those general mortgage bonds and all the --
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8387.875,8398.303,"Those are all of the debts Mr. Justice White all of the debt holders, general mortgage, contingent interest bondholders, every kind of debt that we have."
1967.433,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8490.019,8494.695,Why is the market value of the debt only half of its face value?
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8494.695,8499.323,"Well, I'm not an expert on the market Your Honor but it is because --"
1967.433,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8499.323,8501.183,With poor chances of being paid?
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8501.183,8503.323,Certainly.
1967.433,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8650.415,8652.006,By merger?
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8652.006,8655.524,"No Your Honor, absolutely not by merger."
1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8678.227,8688.382,"Well, the net of it is that Norfolk & Western emerges as a sole -- would emerge as the sole stockholder of Erie and Lackawanna?"
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8688.382,8689.108,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8689.108,8691.09,And that the Erie and Lackawanna --
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8691.09,8691.107,That's not --
1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8691.107,8692.224,-- would remain --
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8692.224,8693.114,In due course.
1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8693.114,8693.642,Right.
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8701.912,8703.495,Exactly the claim they now have.
1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8717.158,8720.04,Is that the same difference?
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8720.04,8720.538,I beg your pardon.
1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8720.538,8721.362,It's the same difference.
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8721.362,8724.599,"The same difference, yes sir."
1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8823.937,8823.982,Perhaps I --
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8823.982,8824.616,-- one of the Court --
1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8824.616,8825.579,"Perhaps, I missed you."
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8831.625,8832.174,"Yes Your Honor, that is truly --"
1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8832.174,8838.529,"What you're talking about is true, just an inclusion limited to the Erie-Lackawanna."
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,8838.529,8843.887,"That is true, Your Honor and I'm going to come to that as my second point and I'll deal with that at some length."
1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9012.827,9012.837,You're talking about --
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,9012.837,9014.047,-- in bad times of --
1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9014.047,9020.94,You're talking about the earnings of Erie and Lackawanna though assuming that it remained as a separate --
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,9020.94,9021.337,"No Your Honor, I'm not."

1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9035.202,9046.776,"Well then, what you're saying that the bondholders' fear of a hesitation and dilution of their efforts is quite farfetched."
1967.433,8,42445,thomas_d_barr,,9046.776,9049.597,"Quite farfetched is exactly the way I would describe it, Your Honor."

1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9145.56,9167.651,"I suppose the fear of the bondholders is that Norfolk & Western as emerging as a sole stockholder of E & L, will so handle the fears of E & L that there won't be any interest -- they won't pay any money to pay their -- the interest on their bonds."

1967.433,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9190.996,9195.241,"Well, then you have a question as to whether the bondholders have a remedy against that."

1967.433,9,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,10449.439,10455.471,"And you're here urging that we affirm the judgment below, is that right?"

1967.433,9,28052,harry_g_silleck_jr,,10460.133,10461.291,Correct.
1967.433,9,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,10461.291,10491.906,"Well now, is this an academic exercise or an indication of interest in the public welfare or do we assume that Delaware & Hudson, in spite Mr. Dumaine's letter wants to have this approval, presumably, so that it can be appropriate transactions can be completed and the matter is presented to the stockholders or whatever is required for consummation, is that a fair assumption?"
1967.433,9,28052,harry_g_silleck_jr,,10491.906,10499.701,"We certainly do want it to be approved from that standpoint and as far as we know today, Mr. Dumaine may never come up with a proposal."
1967.433,9,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,10525.35,10529.702,"But he is bound by what you're saying today, hasn't he?"

1967.433,9,28052,harry_g_silleck_jr,,10537.698,10538.324,Yes.
1967.433,9,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,10538.324,10539.459,And he is the president of it.
1967.433,9,28052,harry_g_silleck_jr,,10542.515,10546.562,He is speaking in his capacity as a stockholder as well as president.
1967.433,9,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,10546.562,10547.185,I see.
1967.433,9,28052,harry_g_silleck_jr,,10563.087,10590.711,Mr. Barr has shown that the record would support the inclusion of E-L in the system without D & H inclusion and in that regard I would like to add one point because I wish to pick direct issue with the Solicitor General's remarks that we are in a position to or want to try to hold up these merger matters.

1967.433,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,12747.845,12759.208,Does it seem to be involved to the extent that we are urged and act -- and to act instantly in order to save a railroad on its present financial setup.
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,12759.208,12772.066,"Well, I think what you're being urged to do by the New Haven trustees Mr. Justice Black is to act promptly to save the transportation facilities of the railroad not the stockholders and the bondholders."
1967.433,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,12772.066,12774.711,Is that the basis of the Court -- the Commission findings?
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,12774.711,12775.757,That's the basis of the findings.
1967.433,11,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,12775.757,12777.644,It is not based on the other.

1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,12798.072,12802.313,Not on the basis of the current market value because I think of the securities.

1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,12871.578,12871.709,That's right.

1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,12889.306,12890.448,That's quite correct.

1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,12925.721,12927.04,-- if they consummate the merger.
1967.433,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,12927.04,12935.674,"That's what I -- if the merger is approved, it must go forward and whatever the result, Penn-Central is stuck with it, is that it?"
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,12935.674,12939.124,If the -- it's stuck with it in this sense in the --
1967.433,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,12939.124,12944.474,"Suppose it's -- suppose it was a review of it, of this recent order --"
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,12944.474,12945.018,Yes.
1967.433,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,12945.018,12960.295,"-- I should see, and could happen I expect that the Commission might be reversed and then they go back to the Commission for something else, something better for that, what's Penn-Central's position then?"
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,12960.295,12989.373,"I understand that having consummated the merger, you have the Penn-Central -- two companies involved by that Act, it would be found by any conditions that the Commission fixed or -- originally or on remand under Section 5 (2) (d) of the Act to be so far as this New Haven situation is concerned."
1967.433,11,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,13252.592,13266.384,"Mr. Cox, do you mean that a reasonable minded businessman in one of the three roads shouldn't really anticipate that he has much of a chance of getting in the -- getting into Penn-Central."
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,13266.384,13267.823,That's precisely what I mean.
1967.433,11,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,13267.823,13280.32,And that he reads the Commission orders and pays full attention that the -- his options have been considerably reduced by the (Inaudible).
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,13280.32,13281.565,That's precisely what I meant.
1967.433,11,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,13319.442,13319.618,But isn't it --
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,13319.618,13320.471,-- the Commission has made (Voice Overlap) --
1967.433,11,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,13320.471,13342.119,"Then you make a reasonable argument that the -- that it would -- that if one of the options that was opened for these roads was still the -- to turn it -- turns -- turned down these proposition and to go with the Penn-Central, then the Commission could not have approved the immediate consummation of the merger without violating the mandate of this Court."
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,13342.119,13345.879,I am afraid I could -- would not and could not accept that.
1967.433,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,13356.718,13358.822,"Mr. Cox, may I ask you this question."
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,13370.571,13371.618,Yes.
1967.433,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,13371.697,13376.121,-- permission to N & W the right to come back and ask for --

1967.433,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,13386.778,13387.315,Yes.
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,13387.315,13389.672,-- then they could renew their applications in the Court --
1967.433,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,13389.672,13391.156,"Well, they gave actually -- they gave a year --"

1967.433,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,13391.265,13392.018,-- did they not?
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,13394.3,13394.633,"Apply, that's right."
1967.433,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,13394.633,13396.239,-- to be included in Penn-Central.
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,13396.239,13396.254,Yes.
1967.433,11,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,13396.254,13397.441,What will happen to that?
1967.433,11,26750,hugh_b_cox,,13397.441,13426.798,"Well, see that -- they have now -- they have been granted the -- in this -- and the applications to go into the N & W has been granted and the Commission also provided that if they were granted, their applications for admission to the Penn-Central should be deemed denied.And I assume that subject to whatever happens to the inclusion order on review of those petitions and for inclusion to Penn-Central have been denied."
1967.433,11,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,13426.798,13429.418,"Very well, Mr. Cox."
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13436.051,13444.079,"We've read at outset, we ought to make it plain just what the situation is on this right to petition in Penn-Central."
1967.433,12,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,13466.733,13469.036,That's the provision of the inclusion order.
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13469.283,13475.687,The -- it's the double provision of the retention of jurisdiction in Penn-Central plus the conditions in the inclusion order.
1967.433,12,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,13478.071,13479.744,How about D & H.
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13479.744,13485.197,"If the D & H turns it down, they do not have an absolute right to petition."
1967.433,12,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,13523.89,13526.183,But he wants us to affirm.
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13526.183,13526.89,"Sure, he does."
1967.433,12,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,13684.443,13685.457,How do they do that?
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13687.545,13688.46,How do they do that?
1967.433,12,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,13688.46,13688.576,Yes.
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13688.576,13692.612,"Decide now that it's going to be -- well, here are the choices."
1967.433,12,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,13695.949,13697.61,That's what they decided.
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13697.61,13699.395,Decided they could come in.
1967.433,12,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,13699.417,13702.356,"Yes, and -- now wait, how do they go beyond that?"
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13702.356,13707.521,They can decide that you -- that Penn-Central is out for you folks.
1967.433,12,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,13707.521,13709.417,And would that satisfy you?
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13709.417,13718.871,If they had done that plus deciding that they wouldn't be subsidized to the injury of the other eastern railroads during this long period.
1967.433,12,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,13718.871,13725.606,What you're saying is that we're ought to declare Appendix G unlawful.
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13725.606,13726.542,"Yes sir, exactly."
1967.433,12,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,13726.542,13735.265,"And if we did that then that would force these roads into the bosom of the N & W, is that right?"
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13735.265,13755.251,"If they had decided that Penn-Central should be foreclosed and if they have decided the form in which the N & W ought to take -- to carry these roads and bear in mind that with this million and eight of operating savings which is peanuts in this business, there are great opportunities to make Erie a viable system in another form of N & W."
1967.433,12,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,13755.251,13762.77,"Yes but in that way, you want them to get rather Appendix G -- N & W is not a party to Appendix G."
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13763.878,13764.84,We're a victim.
1967.433,12,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,13765.501,13765.712,Well now --
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13765.712,13766.045,We're a victim.
1967.433,12,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,13766.045,13767.945,It's -- you're affected by it --
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13767.945,13768.122,Yes sir.
1967.433,12,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,13768.122,13787.588,"-- and now what you're saying is that Appendix G ought to be eliminated and that means that these roads would be a subject of the siphoning of and diversion of traffic and then it have to go looking for somewhere else so they can get something to eat, isn't that right?"
1967.433,12,28253,howard_j_trienens,,13787.588,13799.413,"They go one place to the other and I would hope they would go to a deep place, the ultimate faith that this Court expected the Commission would decide for them in which the Commission keep saying, “Well, that's something we're going to look at tomorrow or we're going to see some more petitions."
1967.433,12,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,13908.15,13913.392,Mr. Migdal.
