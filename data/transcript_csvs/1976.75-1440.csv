1976.75-1440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.217,"We’ll hear arguments next in 75-1440, Maher against Roe."
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,46.354,50.273,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1440,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,96.345,100.035,"Well, does it differ much from the Pennsylvania requirement?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,100.035,112.119,"It says Your Honor to allow -- the attending physician merely has to state that in his opinion, the abortion is medically necessary for the patient’s health, that’s all and that is not challenged."
1976.75-1440,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,112.119,115.066,No but is that much different from the one we have just discussed in Pennsylvania?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,115.066,120.283,"Well I think it’s even more -- more liberal, Your Honor."
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,156.976,169.279,"I suppose there are provisions to detect and apply sanctions against fraud on the part of physicians under the Medicaid program, not only in this area, but through out the program, aren’t there?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,169.279,177.536,"There are Your Honor, but current press is correct, the country is quite remiss in that area the present time."
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,180.388,188.266,"Well, I can understand why it would be, but that program would be applicable here as well as applicable in other parts of Medicaid, wouldn’t it?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,188.266,188.597,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,188.597,193.95,And found the physician was consistently lying.
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,193.95,196.049,"Well in this particular area, abortion is --"
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,196.049,200.197,Getting public funds that were not -- that nobody was entitled to?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,200.197,206.806,"Oh Your Honor, there is no question that would be fraudulent and the state does have a quality control system."
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,206.806,211.755,"So to that extent, I suppose his certificate is subject to question, isn’t it?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,211.755,213.152,Yes.
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,227.961,247.317,"Well let's say if a physician were consistently prescribing drugs that were not needed, not medically necessary just in order to get public moneys and nobody -- that neither he nor the patient were entitled to, wouldn’t he be subject to sanctions, criminal --"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,247.317,258.694,"He would, Your Honor and I believe at a certain point, he would no longer be accepted for participation in the Title 19 program."
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,531.12,543.024,Do you understand the District Court’s judgment to have been based upon the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or on something else in the Fourteenth Amendment?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,543.024,545.435,"It’s not absolutely clear, Your Honor."
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,561.692,562.534,Or another part of that same amendment?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,562.534,565.274,Another part of the same amendment.
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,565.274,567.032,It was Blumstien?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,567.032,571.868,"I think it may well have been Blumstien, Your Honor."
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,572.487,577.307,"Well, a little bit like the Shapiro case in this Court which is also I think involved your statement."
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,577.307,578.178,Yes Your Honor.
1976.75-1440,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,819.709,830.334,Do you think Connecticut that excluded the expenses of the child birth either under the statute or constitutionally?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,830.334,831.389,I believe they could.
1976.75-1440,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.341,845.105,Including paying for child birth?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,845.105,847.388,"Yes Your Honor, I believe so."
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,847.388,850.07,Do we have amicus brief in this case from HEW?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,851.883,852.572,"No Your Honor, we do not."
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,852.572,853.407,"We do not, do we?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,853.407,854.305,No.
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,854.305,856.845,I want to be sure I wasn’t missing anything.
1976.75-1440,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,856.845,882.149,"Mr. Walsh, if we analyze the case as an equal protection case for a moment, the three-judge district court seem to say that whether it’s a compelling state interest or rational basis test, Connecticut has not advanced any state interest whatsoever for discriminating between pregnant women who elect an abortion as opposed to pregnant women who elect to bear the child."
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,891.484,904.745,"Well first of all, we rely very heavily on the physical interest because we think it’s a very important interest for the state to be able to control its medical expenditures in the pubic health field."
1976.75-1440,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.743,930.892,"If, let me just take this to the two parts to your answer."
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,951.811,953.07,"No, Your Honor."
1976.75-1440,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.858,1033.733,What you are saying -- let me just see if I can state in my own language.
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1046.028,1046.202,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-1440,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.202,1047.182,That’s what you’re saying?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1047.182,1047.991,Yes.
1976.75-1440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1047.991,1055.788,"And some of the categories might be wise and some might be unwise, but you say the legislature has a right to make its own mistakes?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1055.788,1082.235,"Yes indeed, Your Honor and as the other part of the answer I was going to say was when the state is compelled to include a non necessary medical service in it’s program and at the same time because of physical necessity it must exclude services like orthodontia and periodontia and we have two cases challenging and right now in Connecticut, two cases challenging the federal statute for excluding those things."
1976.75-1440,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1093.211,1099.853,"Mr. Walsh, what other medical service do you have to file all of these explanations?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1099.853,1106.282,I think Your Honor they are all listed on page two of appellee’s brief in a footnote.
1976.75-1440,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1127.18,1129.751,"Well, this chiropractic medical?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1129.751,1130.569,Pardon?
1976.75-1440,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1133.786,1137.975,"I’m not talking about HEW, I’m talking about Connecticut."
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1137.975,1139.268,Connecticut attempted.
1976.75-1440,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1142.405,1147.246,"Well, you admit that you do put special emphasis on abortions?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1147.246,1147.74,No.
1976.75-1440,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1148.67,1152.676,You put a little more than you do on appendectomies?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1152.676,1172.502,"Yes Your Honor, but the reason for that, one of the reasons for this seeking of prior approval is that if it were not done that way, the hospitals would not know whether they are going to receive payment for the treatment until after they had submitted their request for payments to the state."
1976.75-1440,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1176.107,1187.981,"Mr. Walsh, I suppose there maybe larger concerns on both sides surrounding the question of abortion then there are to question of appendectomy or orthodontia."
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1204.279,1210.332,"Well as I said Your Honor, it does not prefer births to abortions."
1976.75-1440,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1259.629,1261.672,Well okay.
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1291.715,1295.104,Legislating to prevent --
1976.75-1440,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1295.104,1298.451,Fall of the birth rate to zero?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1298.451,1300.857,"I believe that they would have an interest, yes Your Honor."
1976.75-1440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1309.4,1321.866,"I suppose within that broad reach that you argue, also the state could be like the legislature, could say we will pay for cosmetic surgery in order to make our people more beautiful if they wanted to."
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1323.794,1336.362,Thank you.
1976.75-1440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1336.362,1340.275,You may continue Mr. Walsh.
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1340.275,1340.638,Thank you.
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1537.003,1546.929,Do you think it would be constitutionally impermissible for part of the motivation of the state of Connecticut in this case to be its moral objection?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1546.929,1571.18,"I think, Your Honor that as long as the Court is satisfied that the state has a valid purpose and that its primary motive is not to see or subterfuge that the state -- that the Court should then uphold the regulation because otherwise it will get into an extremely nebulous area of trying to ascertain subjective intentions of the legislature in this case."
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1571.18,1598.25,"Well, let’s assume that we -- that all those palace (ph) of proof had been surmounted and that it were established that at least part of the purpose of Connecticut in denying public funds for abortion on demand or whatever you wish to call it were moral, would that make Connecticut’s action invalid in your view?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1598.317,1599.388,I believe it would not.
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1629.447,1641.498,Well I’m -- my question assumes that there has been clear and convincing proof and that it is shown -- has been shown that the part of Connecticut’s reason for doing this is it’s moral objection to abortion on demand.
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1644.652,1669.926,"No Your Honor because Your Honor I said partly reason and I say if it’s partly if it’s a secondary reason because after all, all legislatures and executives for that matter have their private views on abortion and that does not mean that their private views are necessarily implanted or -- it’s too very difficult to determine what percentage of their motivation is a factor in influencing their decision."
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1669.926,1674.862,"But you do concede that if it were the sole reason, it would be constitutionally impermissible?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1674.862,1679.305,"I think if their where the sole reason, Your Honor that would certainly a very terrible thing."
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1697.649,1700.738,"It carries out the same program, but for quite a different reason?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1700.738,1701.596,That’s right Your Honor.
1976.75-1440,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1701.596,1717.063,"What would be the constitutional basis in your view for saying that if the Connecticut statute was the primary reason for passing, as Justice Stewart’s question, was the moral objection to abortion?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1723.088,1732.339,"Of course when you say Connecticut, that’s of course some three million citizens and I think if in fact the court is convinced that there is a valid physical purpose --"
1976.75-1440,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.339,1759.741,"But we’re assuming there is no valid physical purpose that the State of Connecticut in it's legislature and a legislative history of a Bill says we will go as far as we have to under the Supreme Court’s decision and under the constitution and we will not criminally punish any doctor who provides an abortion, but we morally object to abortions and we will not go any further than the Supreme Court requires us to go and we think this is permissible."
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1764.444,1766.001,If I understand Your Honor’s question.
1976.75-1440,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.717,1784.719,Isn’t that the motivation of every single legislative Act that’s ever passed by a legislature to impose the views of the legislature on the populous?
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1784.719,1787.362,Or presumably representing that majority to populous when it does so?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1787.362,1796.001,Yes when it represents the majority except that there is a certain constitutional protections against the theority of the majority which this Court has often fronted to --
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1796.001,1801.087,Or if you can analogize this I suppose to a jury trial.
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1838.756,1839.513,"Oh, I think yes."
1976.75-1440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1855.273,1859.159,"And then the legislature could take that moral view, could it not legitimately?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1859.159,1861.146,"I believe it could, Your Honor, yes."
1976.75-1440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.146,1878.243,"Didn't this Court in Miller against California and the related cases say affirmatively by a majority of the Court that the state has a responsibility, an affirmative responsibility for the moral environment and atmosphere of a community within the state?"
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1878.243,1879.298,"Well, that’s correct Your Honor."
1976.75-1440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1879.298,1882.111,Doesn’t that really answer Justice Rehnquist's question?
1976.75-1440,0,23441,edmund_c_walsh,,1882.111,1882.954,"I believe it would, Your Honor."
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2009.369,2011.902,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this Court.
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2171.343,2173.976,Is this an equal protection case in your view?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2173.976,2194.12,I see this case is rather heavily a due process case because of the fundamental right asserted and as well an equal protection case and the class under the equal protection standard is made up of persons who are asserting their fundamental right to make the abortion choice.
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2194.12,2205.129,"If it’s a due process case, do we have to pay any attention to the question whether benefits are provided in the event that the child is born, apparently?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2214.839,2220.004,"If I could talk to that, I thought your first question was that if it did not pay for birth at all, yes."
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.004,2222.224,"Right, that was limited to that."
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2222.224,2232.795,"Then I believe it -- if the state provided no benefits for child or whatsoever, then the case was certainly be very different in due process terms but --"
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.795,2234.45,Why would it be different in due process terms?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2239.62,2247.731,"That may well be a due process case and in fact, I conceive of the right to welfare benefits for maternity care as a due process question."
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2247.731,2255.351,"You have, everybody has a right to publish a free press, but that doesn’t impose an obligation on the state to subsidize your free press, does it?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2255.351,2263.71,Absolutely not and we are not asserting here that the state has an obligation to pay for an abortion for indigent women.
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2282.293,2284.067,Isn’t that an equal protection argument though?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2284.067,2285.549,I think it’s both Your Honor and --
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2285.549,2290.201,Would you state your due process argument in sort of simplified form for me?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2290.201,2304.669,The right to choose determinative pregnancy is the right of personal privacy and personal liberty which is incorporating the concept of liberty in the Fourteenth Amendment which may not be deprived without due process of law.
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.621,2319.814,"Well, you are going in equal protection of course."
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2348.99,2350.407,I don’t believe it could have.
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.407,2355.988,Then how was that now -- does that refute your due process argument?
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2355.988,2356.415,The due process --
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2356.415,2357.534,I don’t believe it does.
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2357.534,2361.354,-- is distinct and not stop you from getting an abortion.
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2363.615,2368.336,The due process argument I make is not -- is a little bit different.
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2397.915,2409.655,"What would happen if the state says we will pay for natural birth, but not a cesarean, would that be due process?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2409.655,2410.447,"Yes, it would."
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2410.447,2414.515,"At best it would be equal protection, wouldn’t it?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2414.515,2415.348,"No, Your Honor."
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2426.906,2439.713,Would it be a denial of either constitutional right for the state to subsidize an educational program urging women to bear children and to make the choice one way rather than the other?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2439.713,2442.43,It might and that would raise different kinds of questions.
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.43,2443.544,"Well, how would they be different?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2443.544,2445.88,"Well, the state’s interest would be different."
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2451.638,2466.729,"Well, the motivation of the state would be precisely the same as what you say the motivation of the state was here to exercise the influence of its moral views?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2466.729,2472.155,What the state does all the time in the educational process is certainly to assert its moral views.
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2479.348,2481.093,"Well, take my jury trial case."
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2500.613,2501.953,That’s true Mr. --
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2501.953,2505.283,Wasn’t that same point as we have here?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2505.283,2506.819,I don’t believe it’s exactly the same Mr. Justice Stewart because the --
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2506.819,2513.344,"Well, not exactly the same being tried in the criminal case, but exactly the same as having an abortion, but isn’t that constitutionally --?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2513.344,2521.076,Well as I see it -- the opportunity for the jury trial is absolutely afforded to the defendant and --
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2521.076,2529.357,It is not to be mean but you got to have to pay for it by himself in many states if he is convicted he is to work it off in prison?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2529.357,2529.861,That’s correct.
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2529.861,2534.529,Whereas if he exercises his equal right not to have a jury trial.
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2538.577,2547.605,"Yes -- in the case, we are discussing there is virtually and absolute prohibition on the opportunity of the woman to have the service and there is similar prohibition."
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2547.605,2550.784,"Only an indigent prohibition, isn’t it?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2550.784,2551.756,Yes.
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2584.075,2595.901,But is -- you do not suggest this in part my brother Marshall’s question is clear that any woman in Connecticut does continues to have a constitutional right to have an abortion.
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2605.719,2611.723,Yes sir.
1976.75-1440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.679,2659.803,Well is that a separate question here?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2659.803,2662.808,"Yes, it is a separate question Mr. Justice White."
1976.75-1440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2662.808,2678.925,Suppose the jurisdictional statement didn’t lay that in two separate way as to whether independently the necessity to certify in detail constitutionally?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2678.925,2693.448,I believe the question -- the prior authorization and certification necessity is part and parcel of -- is the medical necessity requirement because that requirement is not imposed in any other way.
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2705.928,2714.007,"Mrs. Katz, could Connecticut say that all medical procedures require a certificate of the same type?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2714.007,2716.072,Absolutely not Mr. Justice Marshall.
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2717.018,2718.052,Why?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2719.203,2720.587,Could it?
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2721.836,2724.264,And would you have any complaint?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2724.264,2728.136,If every service had to have a certificate of medical necessity?
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2728.136,2728.678,Yes.
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2728.678,2736.628,Any statement that an abortion must be medically necessary for the health of the patient I would have a complaint in that.
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2736.628,2750.673,"If they said that any medical procedure requiring payment must first have the same type of certificate, would that be okay?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2750.673,2752.906,I don’t believe it would because --
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2752.906,2753.683,Why not?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2753.683,2763.663,Because it is impossible to conceive of an unnecessary abortion unless the woman is not pregnant.
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2770.428,2771.843,You didn’t say pregnancy?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2771.843,2773.297,I understand that.
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2773.297,2779.568,"I said appendicitis, ingrown in toenails, etcetera."
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2789.125,2805.663,"The reason I would object to that is that any suggestion as this record well shows that an abortion must be medically necessary, works to me to be exclude abortions which are necessary for the end desired by the patient, the doctor but which may not."
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2805.663,2808.18,Then answer is that the state could not do that?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2808.18,2808.685,No.
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2809.022,2811.576,"If it good for everything, but abortion."
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2811.576,2815.005,The state could require that every service be necessary.
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2815.005,2817.096,Other than abortion.
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2817.096,2818.404,I’m sorry Mr. Justice Marshall.
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2826.784,2828.709,I thought of question I asked you.
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2828.709,2833.845,I differentiate between medically necessary and necessary.
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2833.845,2836.345,"So if it is necessary, that would be alright?"
1976.75-1440,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2836.345,2842.642,In (Inaudible) judgment then if it isn’t the judgment of the doctors.
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2842.642,2850.965,"If the service had to be necessary, only that where necessary in the judgment of the doctor that would be valid."
1976.75-1440,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2850.965,2852.973,"Oh, you have me confused."
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2852.973,2860.074,Then you now argue the equal protection which what I thought you arguing all along.[Laughter]
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2860.074,2864.821,We are arguing -- I think we are arguing both Mr. Justice Marshall.
1976.75-1440,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2866.643,2868.002,(Inaudible)
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,2868.002,2874.094,Certainly.
1976.75-1440,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2996.685,3002.928,Mrs. Katz what if your client were at the other end of spectrum here so to speak?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3031.733,3038.447,"Yes Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe it would in that case."
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3055.85,3060.004,"Mrs. Katz, let me take Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question one step further."
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3082.314,3087.35,I think that there would be definite constitutional objections to that sort of program.
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3096.307,3107.833,"I assume in my example that they continue to pay for child birth for the indigent, but they just try to tip the scales in favor of abortion in the desire to control population."
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3111.536,3116.778,That would again be a program which was weighting the choice.
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3116.778,3122.928,"And you say the state has no interest whatsoever, no legitimate interest in the rate of population within its borders?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3122.928,3123.997,It may and that may --
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3123.997,3131.203,"Well then if it has an interest, why can’t it tip the scales one way or another or seek to?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3131.203,3140.678,Because that interest is not rise to the level of justification for an infringement in this area under this Court’s prior decisions.
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3140.678,3144.792,Which prior decisions say you cannot pay a bonus for one choice rather than another?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3154.606,3181.311,"The prior decisions Roe and Bolton do deal with preventing the choice, but the decisions on pubic benefit programs that consider this sort of interference go directly to weighting the choice and there maybe a different balancing process when the state asserts and demonstrates an interest in limiting population or increasing population."
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3187.211,3196.458,What I’m trying to identify in my own mind is whether it’s critical to your case that we treat this as something like a deprivation as oppose to a subsidy.
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3205.9,3220.427,"We don’t argue that we have to prove that the woman was totally prohibited from making one choice rather than the other under Maricopa County, under Shapiro v. Thompson in past cases, a penalty is sufficient."
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3224.974,3226.99,So there’s really no penalty here?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3233.361,3245.95,"Except that under Shapiro versus Thompson, it was specifically stated that that is the same as a penalty and under memorial hospital it was stated that that is the same as a penalty."
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3255.561,3258.245,Economic disincentive?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3258.245,3260.799,Yes Mr. Justice Stewart.
1976.75-1440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3342.708,3343.788,Can I ask you Mrs. Katz?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3353.08,3354.208,It’s optional.
1976.75-1440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3354.208,3354.519,What?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3354.519,3355.599,As optional?
1976.75-1440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3355.599,3356.725,Yes.
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3367.127,3368.002,That is correct.
1976.75-1440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3370.432,3370.797,What.
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3370.797,3373.466,It would still cost them their share of the federal program.
1976.75-1440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3373.466,3373.903,How much?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3373.903,3374.785,50%.
1976.75-1440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3374.785,3380.536,That’s 50% and so but their physical interest then is limited to that 50%?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3380.536,3381.32,Yes.
1976.75-1440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3381.498,3388.135,And as compared with carrying the birth to term which they pay for?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3388.135,3389.817,"No -- yes, that’s correct."
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3389.817,3397.61,"The matching fund, it’s a 50% matching program all away across the board isn’t it?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3397.61,3397.99,Yes sir.
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3400.893,3402.33,It’s all 50%.
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3402.33,3404.358,"In Connecticut, it's all 50%."
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3405.565,3407.326,Family planning is 80% or 90%?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3407.326,3408.712,Family planning is 90%.
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3568.79,3572.295,"Mrs. Katz, I’m not sure that completely meets your opponent’s argument."
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3589.521,3601.206,"Yes Mr. Justice Stevens, but that is logically not a persuasive argument because we are -- Connecticut would not in fact have to pay for a whole host of services."
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3603.36,3611.598,"Well, the District Court, that they talked about cosmetic surgery, the District Court said well, that’s different because it is not a constitutionally protected right, but I just wonder if that’s valid."
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3618.984,3620.527,Nobody in the entire state?
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3620.527,3621.72,Correct.
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3621.72,3622.807,Perhaps not but the --
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3622.807,3627.864,"Well then, do you have a constitutional right to cosmetic surgery?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3627.864,3632.432,But it would not be a fundamental right in this area of privacy.
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3632.432,3641.592,"There nothing to be more fundamental than a constitutional right, constitutionally guaranteed right which my brother Stevens is hypothesizing?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3641.592,3643.19,It is simply --
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3643.19,3652.564,"Suppose a person seriously disfigured is the result of an accident, wanted to have plastic surgery to correct his appearance and the state said no, we have a statute that prohibits that."
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3655.47,3656.86,It maybe constitutionally protected.
1976.75-1440,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3656.86,3659.41,But not as well protected as the right to make the abortion you say?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3659.41,3671.243,Well I think that maybe correct and that may also be necessary service and in fact is paid for by the state of Connecticut in those circumstances.
1976.75-1440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3671.243,3684.016,"But if the -- if the Second Circuit is correct in the way it construes the statute, Connecticut could pick and choose among the “necessary” services that (Inaudible), is that right?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3684.016,3689.66,That is right except that there have to be some limitations on the constitutionality of its choices.
1976.75-1440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3691.003,3701.87,"Well it may be so, that maybe so, but you would say that it would have to choose to plan the abortions because of the impact that they can (Inaudible)"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3701.87,3703.177,"Yes sir, I would."
1976.75-1440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3703.177,3705.951,You say then the statute would permit that?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3711.643,3713.294,Yes sir.
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3713.294,3729.682,"But it say would it be equally wrong or less unconstitutional in your hierarchy of constitutional rights for a state to say we’ll pay for appendicitis operations, but not for gallstone operations?"
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3729.682,3730.646,Within the Medicaid program?
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3730.646,3731.883,Yes.
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3731.883,3733.557,It would be less wrong.
1976.75-1440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3733.557,3734.447,Less what?
1976.75-1440,1,34715,lucy_v_katz,,3734.447,3734.936,Wrong.
