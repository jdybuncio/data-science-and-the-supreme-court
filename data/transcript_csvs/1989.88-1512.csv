1989.88-1512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.176,"We'll hear argument now in Number 88-1512, Albert J. Ferens v. John Deere Company."
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,10.769,14.492,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,79.564,84.849,The purpose of that filing was to get the benefit of the Mississippi statute of limitations?
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,84.849,86.279,"There is no question about that, Your Honor."
1989.88-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,102.722,103.313,"Well, how could they?"
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,103.313,104.134,On the contrary--
1989.88-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.134,105.617,Was there any basis to do so?
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,105.617,107.506,"--There was no basis to do so, Your Honor."
1989.88-1512,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.25,138.227,"Mr. Tucker, could the court sitting in Mississippi have declined to grant or allow the transfer?"
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,138.227,140.569,"It certainly could have, Your Honor."
1989.88-1512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.329,225.324,The holding of Van Dusen I don't believe is inconsistent with the result reached by the Third Circuit here.
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,227.167,228.807,"I am saying the reasoning in Van Dusen, Your Honor."
1989.88-1512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,368.02,381.848,"--Your case would have more, perhaps, gut appeal to it if you had kept your so-called venue privilege in Mississippi and not transferred it back to Pittsburgh, where the action... or accident occurred."
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,381.848,394.667,"Well, Your Honor, what I am suggesting though is that the applicable law selection is a result of the initial selection of an appropriate venue forum."
1989.88-1512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,447.283,454.856,Is it... is it perfectly clear under 1404 that it is available to plaintiffs on the same terms it is... as it is to defendants?
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,454.856,465.715,"It's... it does not specifically say this statute is available to plaintiffs, but it talks it for the convenience of parties, it does not limit it to availability of defendants."
1989.88-1512,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,478.165,481.955,And on the same terms substantially as is to defendants?
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,481.955,487.459,There is nothing in the language indicating that its availability is on different terms.
1989.88-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,540.422,544.076,"Once the rule is adopted it wouldn't defeat the venue privilege, would it?"
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,574.646,578.937,"--But I am not sure that you and I are disagreeing, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,624.178,648.415,"Well, that may be a sensible enough rule, but all I am suggesting is that it doesn't seem to me to be an accurate description to say we are taking away, or we would be taking away, the plaintiff's, the plaintiff's venue selection right if we held that if, on his initiative, he wants to trade that for a more convenient forum, he has to trade the law along with it."
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,648.415,649.126,"Well, what I--"
1989.88-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,649.126,650.776,It doesn't seem to me an unreasonable rule.
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,650.776,662.633,"--I think what we are talking about, Your Honor, is not necessarily simply the right to select the venue, because obviously by transferring a case you are changing the venue."
1989.88-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,686.53,688.149,But there it was a defeat.
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,721.943,738.902,"I understand that, Your Honor, but I am suggesting that in Van Dusen the Court's consideration of 1404 led it to conclude that essentially 1404 has nothing to do with the applicable law following a transfer."
1989.88-1512,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,767.701,772.786,"--If it is as clear as that, why would we reserve the question, as we did explicitly?"
1989.88-1512,0,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,772.786,780.049,"Because the question was not before the Court, Your Honor, and I think it is wise for the Court not to decide issues that are not before it."
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,1743.167,1753.386,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1791.87,1795.163,"Well, you say they have abandoned them because that is the issue we have to decide, isn't it?"
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,1795.163,1814.027,"Well, I think that is the issue that has to be decided, but the reason I make that point is I think the threshold inquiry is to ask why as a choice of law matter does a court select one statute of limitations or one choice of law rule over another choice of law rule."
1989.88-1512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1839.913,1844.084,"Well, of course, if it is pending in a state court it would have been filed in the state court, too."
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,1849.48,1849.827,Right.
1989.88-1512,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1860.136,1866.81,"Well, it's a principle that states may select the law which should apply, is it not?"
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,1866.81,1869.331,"Absolutely, and that is what the court held in Wortman."
1989.88-1512,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1869.331,1884.75,"And then you have to show, I suppose, that there, in order to prevail, that there is some policy implicit in 1404 that overrides that state choice, whimsical as it may be in some instances."
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,1884.75,1901.922,"I am not suggesting that there... and in fact the court has held by its earlier grant of certiorari in vacating the Third Circuit's prior judgment, that Mississippi's choice of law rule is not to be overthrown."
1989.88-1512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1947.34,1952.644,"You acknowledge the case would be different if the defendant had moved for the transfer, is that right?"
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,1952.644,1954.366,"Absolutely, Van Dusen would--"
1989.88-1512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1954.366,1956.868,What if... the statute doesn't say anything about plaintiffs or defendants.
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,1962.111,1976.43,"--I believe that, in light of Van Dusen and in light of the applicable choice of law rules, that you would apply the transferor forum's choice of law rules, because the original forum is still--"
1989.88-1512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1976.43,1977.141,What if the plaintiff--
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,1977.141,1982.383,--the forum which the plaintiff had selected in which to litigate their claim.
1989.88-1512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1982.383,1986.137,--So in that case you would treat that like a defendant-initiated transfer.
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,2011.004,2025.123,"I... that raises a problem of getting into subjective intent of the plaintiff, and I don't think... I think you really have to look to what happens on the record."
1989.88-1512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2025.123,2034.73,"So, you would limit it to the case where the judge calls the parties in and says hey, this looks kind of silly, we're trying a case in Mississippi when all the witnesses and the parties are in Pennsylvania."
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,2050.719,2052.081,Well--
1989.88-1512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.081,2057.813,"Why should that be a waiver of the right to file in Mississippi, which you acknowledge he had?"
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,2057.813,2068.58,"--He had a right to file in Mississippi, but as a practical matter, he's not pursuing his claim in Mississippi when he, when he is the one who seeks the transfer."
1989.88-1512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2068.58,2069.12,But he would if the motion were denied.
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,2074.254,2077.827,"Well, I think that would be the desirable result of--"
1989.88-1512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2077.827,2082.041,The desirable result then we would have all these Pennsylvania lawsuits ought to be tried in Mississippi.
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,2082.041,2092.567,"--Well, I think the result as a practical matter is that it will serve... a ruling in favor of Respondent will create a prophylactic rule that basically discourages--"
1989.88-1512,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.567,2093.428,"That's right, it will discourage these motions."
1989.88-1512,1,21000,david_p_helwig,,2093.428,2101.383,"--plaintiffs from even filing in inconvenient forums, except in the situation where that is there only forum as a practical matter because--"
1989.88-1512,2,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,3328.469,3329.881,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.88-1512,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3438.221,3439.303,"Thank you, Mr. Tucker, your time is expired."
1989.88-1512,2,40637,richard_b_tucker_iii,,3439.303,3440.205,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
