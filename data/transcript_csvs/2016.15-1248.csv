2016.15-1248,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.15,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case No. 15-1248, McLane Company v. the -- excuse me -- EEOC. Ms. Ho."
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,9.15,90.475,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The language and structure of the statutory scheme, the tradition of appellate review, and the sound administration of justice all counsel in favor of reviewing EEOC's subpoena enforcement decisions for abuse of discretion. First, under the statutory scheme, the EEOC's investigative authority is not plenary, like other agencies, but is cabined by the statutory limit of relevance to the charge under investigation, as this Court said in Shell Oil. Because this inquiry is extraordinarily contextualized, the district court's fact-intensive determination should be reviewed under a unitary abuse-of-discretion standard, as this Court has held. Second, the tradition of deferential appellate review is robust, not only for administrative subpoenas, but also for close analogs, such as search warrants and grand jury subpoenas. Third, the district court is the judicial actor best positioned to decide the issue for any number of reasons that this Court articulated in Pierce and is applied in subsequent cases."
2016.15-1248,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,92.66,94.555,Pierce you --
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,94.555,95.99,-- natures.
2016.15-1248,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,95.99,99.305,Pierce you mentioned. Rule 11 is another.
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,131.845,141.12,"I think, your Honor, in -- I think this case shows that an action to enforce a subpoena is more like those."
2016.15-1248,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,196.22,227.985,"But why -- why was the way with a fact sensitive, fleeting facts, multifarious facts, according to Judge Watford, the pivotal issue is a legal one; that is, what does relevance mean within the context of the EEOC's investigatory authority? He treated that as a question of law."
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,231.655,245.275,"Your Honor, I think the answer to that question lies in what is, I think, critical here, both with respect to the proper standard of -- of review and the ultimate resolution."
2016.15-1248,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,291.1,308.64,"But they would say, if it's a question of law, if the district court got the law wrong, that is ipso facto an abuse of discretion because he has no discretion to misapply the law."
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,308.64,309.53,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2016.15-1248,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,338.84,339.135,So --
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,339.135,340.275,-- the district court.
2016.15-1248,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,340.275,380.61,"Can you clarify for me exactly what's on appeal? There are essentially two rulings by the district court, one on the pedigree information sought -- the name, address, Social Security number, et cetera, of the people who had taken the strength test at issue -- and a second part, a disclosure of the reasons for the termination of the employees who had failed the test. As I read the record below, the district court did not give a reason for denying the second request."
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,401.46,415.625,"Well, what the -- what the Ninth Circuit did -- and thank you for the opportunity for the clarification -- is it -- it reversed and it actually remanded for the district court to make that determination in the first instance."
2016.15-1248,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,416.02,422.17,So are you reversing that? Are you -- are you appealing that part of the remand?
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,422.17,423.05,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-1248,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,434.28,434.43,All right.
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,445.1,445.58,That's correct.
2016.15-1248,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,456.15,457.19,On the second question.
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,457.19,479.6,"On the second. And -- and our -- our position is that one difference that an abuse of discretion standard makes is that under an abuse of discretion standard, as opposed to the de novo standard that the Ninth Circuit applied, the proper course for a holding that the district court did not apply the correct legal standard as the Ninth Circuit held here."
2016.15-1248,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,500.51,513.68,"Why would you remand it to the district court? Because if it went back to the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit could very well say, we -- we decided a question of law, the scope of what's relevant."
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,550.08,554.79,"They might say two things, Your Honor, and we -- we don't know."
2016.15-1248,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,601.4,605.115,"That, I -- I -- I'm -- I've always been somewhat uncertain about that."
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,649.985,650.54,Well --
2016.15-1248,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,650.54,659.534,"Anything? They can just go into your house and -- I mean, you know, absent the Fourth Amendment protection -- go to a business and say, we want every document you've ever had."
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,661.185,667.6,"This -- what stops that, I think, are two features of the statutory scheme here."
2016.15-1248,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,675.975,676.35,Well --
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,676.35,677.19,-- under investigation --
2016.15-1248,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,677.19,679.55,-- relevant to the charge that a person has already brought.
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,699.495,700.74,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-1248,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,700.74,701.375,Because?
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,701.375,706.55,Because -- and I think what Your -- what Your Honor is posing is a commissioner's -- is a commissioner's charge.
2016.15-1248,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,706.55,706.87,Yes.
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,706.87,713.29,And the -- the EEOC has its own regulations which govern what must be in a commissioner's charge.
2016.15-1248,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,720.28,721.88,So there has to be enough information --
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,721.88,725.27,So the language -- the language that this Court used in Shell Oil --
2016.15-1248,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,725.27,725.67,Well --
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,725.67,730.635,"-- was relevant to the charge under investigation and what ""relevance"" means in this context."
2016.15-1248,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,745.57,746.715,Where does that come from?
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,746.715,748.26,That comes from Shell Oil.
2016.15-1248,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,751.0,755.62,Reasonably expected to shed light on the charge under investigation.
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,755.62,756.205,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1248,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,756.205,764.78,"So the law is fairly clear that when the EEOC asks for a piece of information, they have to be able to meet that standard."
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,764.78,765.57,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1248,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,779.45,790.95,"Could you briefly explain what you understand to be the charge here, and why the so-called pedigree information is not relevant to the charge?"
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,790.95,820.39,"Certainly, Your Honor. And the charge here, we don't think -- and to use the language that I was using with Justice Breyer, we don't think that anything the evaluation-taker knows or has experienced in this case can shed light on the charge under investigation for two reasons. First, the evaluation itself does not mimic job duties."
2016.15-1248,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,848.7,867.045,"That may be so, but how do you answer Judge Watford's simple point, that if you're dealing with a test and in -- both men and women have failed it, when you want to ask the test-taker what happened after you -- you failed the test."
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,892.765,904.69,"And, Your Honor, in this case, McLane voluntarily provided all of the information with respect to, at that time, the over 14,000 evaluation takers."
2016.15-1248,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,904.69,905.77,Except number one --
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,905.77,906.14,To the --
2016.15-1248,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,906.14,919.81,"So -- so there's no way that the -- that the EEOC could contact these people and ask the question that Judge Watford posed. So you flunked the test, what happened to you after?"
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,919.81,951.295,"Your Honor, the -- the information did include gender and it also included the -- the -- the passing scores and the scores that did not meet the requirement and whether any adverse employment action took place with respect to that individual. So to answer that question, Your Honor, which we -- we don't disagree would be relevant, that information has already been -- been provided to the agency."
2016.15-1248,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,969.31,970.455,I'm -- I'm sorry.
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,988.74,989.29,That's correct.
2016.15-1248,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,990.68,991.08,And so --
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,991.08,992.65,-- termination that is back --
2016.15-1248,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,992.65,1014.68,"So why isn't the reason for termination relevant to the charge? If your terminating keeps only women for failing the test, but keeping men and maybe some terminating later for some other reason, doesn't that show that there's a problem?"
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1014.68,1019.3,"The -- Your Honor, we haven't advanced a relevance argument with respect to the reasons for termination."
2016.15-1248,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1024.32,1031.655,"Now, where do you -- I'll allow on rebuttal. My question was where do you get the undue burden? But you can answer on rebuttal."
2016.15-1248,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1031.655,1032.395,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2016.15-1248,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1032.395,1036.975,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kovner."
2016.15-1248,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1036.975,1045.21,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Historical and functional considerations strongly support an abuse of discretion standard of review here."
2016.15-1248,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1112.86,1121.005,"But, Ms. Kovner, here the question whether to enforce the subpoena is the whole ball of wax, right? This is an action to enforce the subpoena."
2016.15-1248,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1140.475,1141.65,"Yes, there are."
2016.15-1248,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1208.31,1231.365,"Could you please tell me -- walk me through exactly what you think, the government thinks, is what the court, district court is doing when it makes a decision to enforce a subpoena? What are the legal steps? What are the factual steps? I'm not quite sure."
2016.15-1248,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1251.565,1252.39,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-1248,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1256.32,1257.96,And -- and tell me where you're getting that from.
2016.15-1248,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1259.49,1259.87,Yes.
2016.15-1248,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1344.13,1357.645,"Could you explain to us your view of how -- how this information, the names of the test-takers, would shed -- shed light on the -- the charge?"
2016.15-1248,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1357.645,1358.12,Yes.
2016.15-1248,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1409.49,1411.935,Why? That's the part I don't understand.
2016.15-1248,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1427.12,1427.73,"Well, she's --"
2016.15-1248,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1427.73,1429.66,Saying so -- you could have that every day of the week.
2016.15-1248,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1456.805,1457.69,Well --
2016.15-1248,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1457.69,1457.965,Yeah.
2016.15-1248,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1457.965,1467.375,"So I think there are two pieces; one is, is it relevant, and the second is, is it an undue burden. With respect to whether it's relevant, I think if you look at page 39 of our brief, this Court has said time and again --"
2016.15-1248,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1467.375,1482.87,"Of course it's always relevant when anyone complains about anything to go and see if really there's something suspicious going on by interviewing every single employee, even if there are 500,000 employees."
2016.15-1248,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1505.29,1505.7,That's right.
2016.15-1248,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1548.05,1566.645,"As you say, Counsel, there is a bit of tension between your position that abuse-of-discretion is the appropriate standard because the district court is more familiar with the proceedings and all that, and that we should make a ruling on whether there was an abuse of discretion as a matter of law without any intervening review."
2016.15-1248,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1566.645,1579.995,"Well, we think that in the narrow class of cases where the decision rested on an actual legal error, and where it's clear what the appropriate relevance determination is, it's appropriate, then, for a court of appeals, or in this case, this Court --"
2016.15-1248,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1579.995,1582.65,"Well, relevance determination is something that is pretty fact-intensive."
2016.15-1248,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1582.65,1584.59,That -- that's right.
2016.15-1248,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1589.91,1592.29,It was -- I'm left at the moment -- I'll go back and read it.
2016.15-1248,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1628.235,1636.485,"So -- so with respect to the geographic scope, Your Honor, I think it's really important that we didn't initially seek this information with respect to the entire company."
2016.15-1248,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1691.325,1707.05,"Could you say a little bit, Ms. Kovner, about how it is that you're persuaded that this Court did make a legal determination that was affecting its judgment, as opposed to maybe using some careless words, but was really making a relevancy determination?"
2016.15-1248,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1707.05,1707.69,"Yes, your Honor."
2016.15-1248,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1750.295,1768.59,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kinnaird."
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1768.59,1777.47,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There can be no abuse-of-discretion review if the district court has no discretion."
2016.15-1248,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1925.8,1939.7,"I'll -- I'll look up the cases, but in an evidentiary case, civil case or a criminal case, the question of relevance, I suppose at the end of the day, relevance is a legal matter."
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1956.365,1967.1,"It's applicable, and it supports my position about double discretion. Relevance is a judgment about the relationship of certain evidence to a claim."
2016.15-1248,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2017.36,2017.94,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2020.47,2026.175,"It's telling them because they're drawing the legal line and saying, you can't cross that line."
2016.15-1248,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2033.46,2038.595,"Well, if the line depends on relevance, it's exactly the same thing: It's telling them whether it's relevant or not."
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2038.595,2048.275,"Well, that's why the courts have adopted a standard of ""obviously wrong."" ""Obviously wrong"" is not a discretionary determination. So the district court really has no discretion."
2016.15-1248,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2122.99,2128.445,"What about the nature of the charge, the contours of the charge? Isn't that factual?"
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2128.445,2129.445,"No, that's legal."
2016.15-1248,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2130.51,2133.89,Contours of the charge in a particular case is a legal question?
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2133.89,2134.57,Absolutely.
2016.15-1248,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2141.44,2159.985,"What about the burden on the other party? It would seem to me that the district court would have a considerable degree of familiarity with the nature of the -- the defendant's operations, how burdensome it is in light of what they've produced so far."
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2159.985,2162.6,And that's an analytically separate inquiry.
2016.15-1248,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2171.69,2173.68,I think she said Morton Salt and --
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2173.68,2174.62,Morton Salt is --
2016.15-1248,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2174.62,2174.84,Yeah.
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2190.475,2191.05,Well --
2016.15-1248,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.05,2193.835,So isn't that -- what about the question was asked?
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2193.835,2196.28,"Well, respectfully, Your Honor, I think that's not true."
2016.15-1248,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2196.28,2197.06,"Oh, okay."
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2200.62,2201.06,Well --
2016.15-1248,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2201.06,2201.72,The other --
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2201.72,2204.64,"Well, it's constitutional, and constitutional should be de novo."
2016.15-1248,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2212.73,2212.94,All right.
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2229.18,2231.39,"No, there's a Fourth Amendment limitation on that, Your Honor."

2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2238.355,2239.59,"Well, that's right."
2016.15-1248,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.2,2245.07,"I don't see how we'd do it, frankly."
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2260.42,2260.7,Well --
2016.15-1248,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2260.7,2266.54,"You, unfortunately for us, because you wrote an excellent brief, only have about 20 -- 20 minutes or so. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1248,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2266.54,2268.82,So -- so do you see the difference?
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2268.82,2277.43,"Well, to be clear, Your Honor, the fact question of what the burden is, is reviewed for clear error, just like in the Ornelas historical fact questions."
2016.15-1248,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2325.14,2325.805,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2335.95,2336.405,Yes.
2016.15-1248,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2336.405,2342.095,Why is that any different here than it is under Rule 401?
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2342.095,2356.705,"Because the -- the district court is -- has the -- is the initial decision-maker in determining relevance, because relevance is inherently a discretionary judgment about the relationship of evidence to a claim."
2016.15-1248,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2363.075,2375.43,So if we take the -- so you don't have a problem in saying that it's within the discretion of the district court reviewing the EEOC --
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2375.43,2375.59,No.
2016.15-1248,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2375.59,2378.13,-- to decide relevancy?
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2378.13,2378.53,No.
2016.15-1248,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2379.28,2384.89,"And -- and it's only the court of appeals, then, who has to review it as a matter of law? I'm a little --"
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2384.89,2385.52,"No, I'm sorry."
2016.15-1248,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2385.52,2386.43,I'm a little --
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2386.43,2387.995,I'm sorry that I wasn't clear.
2016.15-1248,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2407.49,2419.03,"It doesn't under 401. Under 401, it resides both in the district court and in -- on the -- in the court of appeals as an abuse-of-discretion standard of review."
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2419.03,2419.43,No.
2016.15-1248,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2469.7,2483.795,"But, Mr. Kinnaird, do you think that your whole argument might be taking the words ""abuse of discretion"" a bit too literally? In other words, your idea is that you can never use that term unless there is some discretion, some real choice."
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2483.795,2484.45,Right.
2016.15-1248,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2484.45,2501.93,"And, you know, it might be that sometimes we use that term when that's not really true, but what we just mean to say is that a certain amount of deference should be given because the -- because we're at the right institution to make a -- to make a particular kind of judgment."
2016.15-1248,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,2501.93,2502.38,Right.
2016.15-1248,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2746.065,2749.935,"Thank you, Mr. Kinnaird. Ms. Ho, you have three minutes remaining."
2016.15-1248,3,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2749.935,2804.73,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me make one point and then, Justice Sotomayor, respond to your -- your questions. I heard both my friend Mr. Kinnaird and -- and my friend from the government make very categorical absolutist statements about a case -- about cases that involve testing, and the cases that involve testing pedigree information will always be relevant. This is a case that shows that facts matter. And we don't dispute that in a case where you have a test that mimics job duties or involves subjectivity, perhaps talking to people would shed light on the charge under investigation. But in this case, this evaluation that is at issue, talking to people simply can't shed light on it because it doesn't mimic job duties and everyone experiences the test the same way, so I think that underscores the importance --"
2016.15-1248,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2804.73,2805.57,I don't -- I don't follow that.
2016.15-1248,3,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2848.095,2874.67,"Two responses to that, Your Honor. But first, I think it's important to underscore that the data that McLane voluntarily provided to the agency, the data does disclose whether -- it discloses the -- the gender, men or women, it discloses who passed or who failed, and it also discloses whether any adverse employment action was taken within 90 days."
2016.15-1248,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2875.38,2880.06,"Yes, but adverse -- adverse employment action can cover a wide range."
2016.15-1248,3,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2882.675,2902.66,"And -- and, Your Honor, perhap -- perhaps that is why the district court in our said -- in our case did not -- did not -- said information depending on what the data shows may -- may be relevant depending on the facts that are uncovered. The government's argument is not one based on the facts that have been uncovered."
2016.15-1248,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2909.15,2912.09,I'm having a very hard time with your answer.
2016.15-1248,3,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2918.505,2920.39,And I apologize for being --
2016.15-1248,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2920.39,2925.05,You can -- you can basically give a test that says is your hair true blonde or not?
2016.15-1248,3,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2925.05,2926.24,"No -- no, Your Honor."
2016.15-1248,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2926.24,2935.135,"And even though it has no relationship to the job, you can give that test and fire people basically because they are not true blonds?"
2016.15-1248,3,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2935.135,2936.11,May I respond --
2016.15-1248,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2936.11,2936.38,Sure.
2016.15-1248,3,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2936.38,2938.07,Mr. Chief Justice? No.
2016.15-1248,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2992.21,2993.365,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.15-1248,3,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2993.365,2994.065,Thank you.
2016.15-1248,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2994.065,3002.805,"Mr. Kinnaird, this Court appointed you to brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below."
