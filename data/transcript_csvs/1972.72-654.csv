1972.72-654,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,43.277,"We will hear arguments next in 72-606, Oklahoma against Mason."
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,49.747,54.183,May it please the Court.
1972.72-654,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,153.075,161.923,Couldn't it be something less than that Mr. Solicitor General that there was enough of the question about the West case that some precautions might have been taken.
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,161.923,168.944,"Yes Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's true, but I suppose that's almost always true with respect to a trustee."
1972.72-654,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,199.822,205.977,Mr. Solicitor General does the record show the approximate size of the decedent’s estate.
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,214.693,240.27,"I believe that the items are indicated on Page 6 of the Appendix and they would appear on a quick addition to come to about a $125,000 for the estate, Osage headrights 48,000, security of sales and trust 19,000, surplus trust funds 48,000 and two other items."
1972.72-654,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,504.803,516.265,You just mentioned -- does everyone conceive that there is no difference between the Osage Allotment Act and the General Allotment Act or purposes of this case.
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,516.265,532.197,"No Mr. Justice, I think there are clear distinctions between the Osage Allotment Act and the General Allotment Act including the two items that were specifically relied on by the Court in the West case."
1972.72-654,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,541.331,543.452,It’s the Squire case?
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,543.452,544.09,Sorry Mr. Justice?
1972.72-654,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,544.09,547.713,"It’s the Squire case, it relied on the Squire case?"
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,547.713,549.877,"In the Squire case, the General --"
1972.72-654,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,549.877,551.706,The obligation to return the property.
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,551.706,566.563,The obligation to return the property and a provision that the property should be subject to taxation after a certain date which carried an implication that it was not subject to taxation beforehand.
1972.72-654,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1111.881,1121.475,Mr. Solicitor General and even if that world rule I take it your position would be nevertheless the liability was erroneously --
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1121.475,1122.463,Yes Mr. Justice.
1972.72-654,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1138.5,1141.975,So you would press for reversal here even if we were to overrule.
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1141.975,1146.782,We would press for reversal even if you were to overrule it.
1972.72-654,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.606,1152.714,Would West take with it Oklahoma Tax Commission in 319 U.S.?
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1152.714,1153.443,Would --
1972.72-654,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1153.443,1156.176,Would overruling West take with it Oklahoma Tax Commission?
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1156.176,1157.935,I would thank so Mr. Justice.
1972.72-654,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.032,1195.039,But a state privilege to tax wouldn’t mean the federal (Inaudible) and as a matter of federal tax policy or as federal -- the federal government wouldn’t need to impose its taxes.
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1195.039,1211.911,"Not necessarily, although it is quite clear that the actions which have been taken by federal executive representatives have been taken based on a view that the approach in Squire weakens the West."
1972.72-654,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.911,1221.724,But I would suppose that Congress expressly said in so many words that federal estate taxes to apply in Indian property.
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1222.902,1226.759,"Congress could say so, there isn't a slightest doubt."
1972.72-654,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1232.052,1237.591,It's just a -- it’s a matter of administrative application of the existing estate tax.
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1237.591,1250.747,"Influence, Mr. Justice, by impressions created as to whether this Court in Squire so impaired the West case that yet ought not to be followed."
1972.72-654,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.296,1267.913,"Well, certainly there has never been any indication that Congress disagree to either West or Oklahoma?"
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1267.913,1270.869,"No, nor agreed or disagreed."
1972.72-654,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1270.869,1271.273,Or Squire.
1972.72-654,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1271.273,1274.834,"Or Squire, that's right."
1972.72-654,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1299.211,1301.666,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1313.813,1317.349,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.72-654,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1360.678,1364.645,"They must tax on the barrel head, at issue here for Oklahoma."
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1364.645,1369.191,"Yes, sir I have -- would not, of course, in this particular case I suggest this is --"
1972.72-654,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1369.191,1370.122,Overall.
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1370.122,1370.688,"Yes, sir."
1972.72-654,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1437.838,1447.662,"Mr. Duncan, suppose the United States in this case, they had taken the position that it wouldn't pay the inheritance tax."
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1452.025,1460.626,"Well, we would have -- I think that we would have had to taken the United States to court --"
1972.72-654,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.626,1462.117,In Court of Claims.
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1462.117,1467.379,"-- in reliance upon the -- I reliance upon the West decision, yes Your Honor."
1972.72-654,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1467.379,1471.394,So you do feel that the West is correctly decided?
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1471.394,1494.807,"Well, I think that the practicality of the situation required the State to have taken the government to court with regard to West, whether or not West is still should be considered with law, should this Court decide otherwise, would not place a severe burden upon State of Oklahoma, if we are talking about perspective actions only."
1972.72-654,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1494.807,1503.066,The reason I asked this last question is because I think I didn't find in your brief any statement to the effect that you felt that West was a correct decision.
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1503.066,1505.084,Well --
1972.72-654,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.084,1508.806,"Well, a lot of trust properties have inspired it?"
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1508.806,1509.482,"Yes, sir."
1972.72-654,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1509.482,1514.412,I mean -- and so the client (Inaudible) significant.
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1516.243,1519.635,"No, that's correct."
1972.72-654,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1536.051,1538.16,And the idea what they aggregate is --
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1538.16,1539.687,"In the future, in the past."
1972.72-654,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1539.687,1542.194,The existing ones.
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1542.194,1544.64,"No, sir, I do not."
1972.72-654,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.204,1599.681,"Mr. Duncan, a following up on Justice Blackmun's question, I can certainly see why the Solicitor General of the United States feels itself in a difficult position here, since it's both a fiduciary for the Indians and representative of the United States."
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1615.371,1618.275,"Mr. Justice, I am sorry, we gave that impression."
1972.72-654,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1672.361,1692.097,"Now we don't at least in theory in this case, we don't need to decide anything more than what you have just argued, do we, in order to decide in your favor that until or in last the West case is overruled, it's to be considered law."
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1713.775,1716.457,"Yes sir just -- that's, of course, what we argued at the time the Court of Claim --"
1972.72-654,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1716.457,1721.443,"At least, in theory, we wouldn’t -- don’t need to say anything more in order to decide in your favor, in this case."
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1731.867,1733.885,"Well, I believe that's correct."
1972.72-654,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1744.908,1749.618,"Now you erode it and undermined that whatever, but nobody claims that it's been expressively overruled."
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1749.618,1750.584,"No, that's correct."
1972.72-654,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1796.666,1805.12,"All you need to say is that as of the time this case was heard in the Court of Claim, it was a good law, West was a good law, that's all you have to do."
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1805.12,1806.531,"Yes sir, that’s exactly --"
1972.72-654,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1806.531,1808.361,"You don’t even need the adjective, do you?"
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1810.249,1811.658,"That’s right, it was law --"
1972.72-654,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1811.658,1812.785,It was the law.
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1812.785,1814.22,"It was the law, that’s --"
1972.72-654,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1814.22,1816.031,"But you don’t need anymore than that, do you?"
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1816.031,1820.184,No.
1972.72-654,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.184,1824.914,Do I understand that you position is on the refund of inheritance taxes?
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1824.914,1836.829,"Yes, Your Honor, 68 O.S, Section 227, provides for the general timing in which a refund can be claimed."
1972.72-654,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1864.101,1872.251,"Now what -- the Oklahoma Tax Commission against the Texas Company 336, that’s also involved here."
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1872.251,1884.387,"Well, of course, the Court, you referred to it in your opinion in Mescalero and although it has not -- it was not a part of my brief at the time it -- we were relied --"
1972.72-654,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1884.387,1890.388,"Well, let’s assume West -- Let’s assume West is -- that Oklahoma Tax Commission (Inaudible)?"
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1895.723,1912.428,"Well, I would like for the Texas Company case to stay however if the West decision goes, it’s the court who returns the West decision, which is the case, on all four squarely in point, it’s hard to imagine that we are going to have some other case that’s going to put us in a better situation."
1972.72-654,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.428,1927.117,Well I know -- I just want to make clear that you would -- you conclude that the Texas Company case was (Inaudible) than West?
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1927.117,1929.899,"Well, I would assume that it would be trouble also."
1972.72-654,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1929.899,1931.557,Sort of a a dominant theory.
1972.72-654,1,37823,paul_c_duncan,,1931.557,1934.461,Yes sir.
1972.72-654,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1934.461,1939.468,Thank you Mr. Duncan.
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,1945.113,1949.956,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-654,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2006.854,2019.617,"Does that really solve, in a technical sense, the conflict problem, because the special counsel would still be speaking for the United States, the same United States that his trustee is, is that not so?"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2019.617,2037.562,"The same problem occurs in the public defender area where the government employs both sides of the fence there, but I think we are used the accepting the loyalty, diverging loyalty of the both sides of the counsel there, and I think that could grow up with respect to Indian rights."
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2070.844,2074.384,"Mr. Hobbs, it has never been overruled, right?"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2074.384,2078.675,"West, to this day, has never been expressly overruled."
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2078.675,2082.543,"As -- it wasn’t my question, has it ever been overruled?"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2082.543,2083.397,West?
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2083.397,2083.775,Yes.
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2083.775,2084.71,"Yes, your honor."
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2087.329,2089.728,And what language said?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2089.728,2091.407,"It was, by implication, and --"
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2091.407,2095.837,"Ah, overruled by implications."
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2103.192,2112.607,The trustee should have advice the word or rather should have taken action to hire an attorney and have this question resolved in 1956.
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2112.607,2117.026,Do you mean he could have gotten a better timing than the Solicitor General’s office?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2117.026,2117.997,"No, it’s the Solicitor General’s --"
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2117.997,2118.832,It’s no where --
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2118.832,2121.009,-- Office who should have been one to do it.
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2121.009,2125.97,"Well who -- well, what other lawyer could have given better advice than that?"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2125.97,2128.126,"I am not sure I follow the question, but the United States --"
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2128.126,2134.267,The question is where you have got the case that is on all forth with your case.
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2139.976,2144.294,Eight lower courts have disagreed with you Your Honor and have held that the --
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2144.294,2150.364,We are not considering any lower court; we are considering a decision of this Court.
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2150.364,2151.553,Of course but there is a --
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2151.553,2157.48,Now what court of competent jurisdiction has overruled this Court?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2157.48,2159.425,No lower court can overrule this Court.
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2162.917,2171.141,"Well, even if this Court now says that West should be overruled, do you win?"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2171.141,2176.047,"Well, we then reach the question of fiduciary liability but ultimately we would win, yes."
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2176.047,2177.194,(Inaudible)
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2177.194,2183.814,I think it’s a necessary conclusion.
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2242.349,2246.99,Why it was wrongfully paid over?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2246.99,2248.823,If West is as I said --
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.823,2252.499,When I call back to time West was decided?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2252.499,2254.431,West was decided 1948.
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2254.431,2256.2,What does it go by there from?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2256.2,2261.318,"Yes, the United State is not subject to the statue of limitations at least until 1977."
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2261.318,2262.871,So it will go back forever?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2262.871,2265.314,"Well, that could go back to 1947."
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2265.314,2266.701,Why not forever?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2266.701,2267.272,Pardon?
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2267.272,2268.195,Why not forever?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2268.195,2270.644,"Well, Oklahoma didn’t collect the tax earlier than that."
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2270.644,2271.615,"Oh, I see."
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2271.615,2277.309,We are just dealing with 24 years of taxation.
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.515,2327.308,"Well the court -- I thought you are telling the court was relevant enough to be retained its client -- and do you think West Oklahoma relevant enough to be cited in there because that was -- if they were cited, they were litigated within?"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2327.308,2332.561,"Well, one must draw its own conclusion as to why they weren’t cited."
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2344.913,2347.238,Was there a law of enactment involved?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2347.238,2352.439,"Yes but there is so parallel, it’s almost impossible to reach different conclusions under them."
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.439,2353.503,Well that’s your argument?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2353.503,2354.454,"Yes, of course."
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2354.454,2359.735,And the Capoeman case did you ask this Court to overruled West?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2359.735,2360.982,No.
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2362.86,2364.091,Why?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2364.091,2364.677,I don’t know.
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2364.677,2366.761,You said it was so horrible?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2366.761,2370.314,"I wasn’t with the firm at that time, I can’t personally answer here."
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2370.314,2373.228,"Well, you looked into the brief, didn’t you?"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2373.228,2373.897,Yes.
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2373.897,2375.009,But in the brief --
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.009,2377.743,I am looking at it right now.
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2377.743,2382.098,Did the brief asked that it be overruled?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2382.098,2384.767,I don’t know Your Honor.
1972.72-654,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2457.325,2471.236,I suppose you would be possible to decide that the government perhaps did have an obligation to begin testing through litigation after 1956 even though this Court were to decide and West was still good law.
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2475.107,2478.196,Correct and we would take that position.
1972.72-654,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2650.257,2653.396,Would there be other tribes in the Osage involved?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2653.396,2655.306,Osage is extremely unique.
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2833.752,2835.546,It's not a fortiori case in which direction?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2850.789,2851.391,That's right.
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2851.391,2854.334,But does it work the same way in the opposite direction?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2854.334,2858.331,"Well No, if Federal taxes then a fortiori state taxes."
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2858.331,2858.604,Yes.
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2858.604,2859.781,If state taxes --
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2859.781,2860.996,It's nit a fortiori tax --
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2860.996,2865.704,"Not a fortiori but very compelling, very difficult not to find the other."
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2865.704,2867.15,But it's certainly not a fortiori?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2867.15,2869.772,"No, no, the a fortiori runs in the direction I said."
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2869.772,2872.464,Some can be a fortiori in both directions by definition?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2872.464,2874.043,"No, no of course not."
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2874.043,2880.164,Isn't the whole question a statutory question?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2880.164,2882.403,"Yes it is, interpretation of statues."
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2882.403,2895.561,Strictly statue and the Congress easily could I suppose they exempt Indian property from it's own estate tax and still permit states to tax?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2895.561,2896.566,Certainly it could.
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.566,2909.476,"And you must and you are saying that -- you are relying on implied exemption from state, from states estate taxes."
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2911.652,2912.378,"No, of course not."
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.378,2915.382,And there is no expressed exemption in the regulations or anything else?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2915.382,2916.925,Right nor in the Capoeman case.
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2916.925,2917.513,"No, no."
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2917.513,2918.913,We say that the construction --
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2918.913,2925.684,Except with the court read the particular allotment statue there to imply an exemption.
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2925.684,2929.196,"Yes, and here is what the court saw in the Capoeman case."
1972.72-654,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2979.49,2982.035,But this Indian has died?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2982.035,2985.013,"Well, there is no Mr Justice Blackmun."
1972.72-654,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3300.608,3331.951,"Suppose if fiduciary had not been to government, I realize you have an Indian involved here, but let's assume you had a private fiduciary, a lawyer in Oklahoma representing a private estate in which all of the other facts and circumstances in this case existed substantially. The Supreme Court decision not overruled except of some lawyers who did think it was overruled by implication."
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3343.42,3345.73,"Well as in this case, certainly."
1972.72-654,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3397.055,3403.954,"What about the Solicitor General's suggestion that just three weeks ago, we didn't think it was overruled?"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3403.954,3417.993,"Well, you say that in Capoeman in my opinion showing that you -- there are many ideas in that case that you still have full-blown agreement with."
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3447.656,3451.666,"And you aren't suggesting, you know, a return to federal-instrumentality law?"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3451.666,3452.571,Excuse me Your Honor?
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3452.571,3459.913,And you aren't requesting any return to federal-instrumentality which Oklahoma Tax Commission is heavily involved in?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3459.913,3468.777,"Well the case is perfectly valid and accepted by the Bar, the Indian Bar with that respect, federal-instrumentality rule."
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3494.371,3500.003,In West the Court said expressly that we don't find any exemption here.
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3511.446,3513.135,I am not sure I follow.
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3514.221,3517.59,Isn't that said -- that is what the Court said in West?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3517.59,3524.959,"Yes I was following an idea, first born in the Choctaw (ph) case 1931, carried along in Superintendent of Five Tribes --"
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.959,3526.287,But that's what it's conclusion was.
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3532.27,3536.518,But Capoeman said it wasn't necessary to do that and that's why they are inconsistent.
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3538.16,3559.484,Wasn't part of the – at least part of the rationale of Capoeman be proposition that it could hardly be presumed that the guardian would tax the ward and that there was emphasis in part's of the opinion upon that relationship and that relationship simply doesn't exist in this case?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3559.484,3560.418,It does Your Honor.
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3562.081,3565.887,"Nor in West, no -- the Oklahoma is not the guardian of these Indians?"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3565.887,3566.134,Oh!
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3567.832,3571.962,Exactly and that was United states tax in Capoeman?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3571.962,3587.093,"Well, I was troubled by that language in Capoeman because that language harks back to 1924 Attorney General's ruling which followed a line of cases that said just that."
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3602.863,3617.132,"Well and that is your view, that is the way you read it, but concededly there was language in Capoeman opinion along the lines I have indicated, was there not, that it is hardly to be presumed that the guardian would tax the ward for the guardian's benefit."
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3635.313,3635.836,Well the United States --
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3635.836,3638.221,TO maximize or the income or whatever?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3638.221,3641.628,The United States has a great deal to say when this oil is pulled out of the ground.
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3641.628,3644.802,Yes but this is an Oklahoma Tax Return?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3644.802,3658.17,"But if the guardian is not going to tax his own ward that it is always been regarded at least by myself that if the Federal Tax does not lie, estate tax a fortiori does not lie."
1972.72-654,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3658.17,3660.566,But maybe a fortiori is in the other direction?
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3660.566,3661.287,That is what I was --
1972.72-654,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3661.287,3668.943,The language of Justice Stewart quotes from Capoeman is the dominant force in that case?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3668.943,3685.263,"No I have been -- I have learned through many cases in many text books, I reached that conclusion through that and that is the way I see it, that the Federal Tax is the hardest tax defined that lies."
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3694.958,3699.756,Because it was -- the Court was trying to accommodate two federal statutes there.
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3699.756,3700.424,Right.
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3700.424,3706.262,Federal tax statutes and a Federal allotment statute?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3706.262,3709.872,Perhaps what I meant to say is based on this.
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3722.576,3728.439,The Court in West said you have to find an express exemption?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3728.439,3732.581,Capoeman said you did not have find an express exemption.
1972.72-654,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3732.581,3734.903,For a federal tax?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3734.903,3737.544,True.
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3765.764,3769.66,"So this property here is not timber, it is a mineral property permit, is it not?"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3777.193,3777.764,Correct.
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3777.764,3779.549,"It used to be astronomically high, did it not?"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3779.549,3780.7,Yes.
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3780.7,3781.877,Up in the --
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3781.877,3785.127,It is petering out.
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3786.449,3788.589,Are the reason of depletion --
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3788.589,3790.387,Yes it is gone.
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3790.387,3791.833,Was it oil or gas or both?
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3791.833,3794.686,"Oil, some gas, mostly oil."
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3873.101,3877.149,"Yeah, and this – the decedent was lived on reservation, where the reservation Indian --"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3877.149,3880.259,Yes.
1972.72-654,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3888.844,3897.46,"But it is not in the record, you can hardly – anyway if it is not the racket it means that you have not relied on it up till now?"
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3897.46,3900.98,"That is right, we have not relied on that."
1972.72-654,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3900.98,3901.422,"Thanks you, Mr Hobbs."
1972.72-654,2,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3901.422,3903.239,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1972.72-654,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3903.239,3904.465,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
