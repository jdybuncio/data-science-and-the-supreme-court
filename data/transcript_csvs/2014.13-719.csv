2014.13-719,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.091,"We'll hear argument next in Case 13-719, Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Company v. Owens."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,9.778,13.261,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,47.201,68.051,"Well, how do we know that the reason the court of appeals did -- did not -- or sustained the refusal to take it, how do we know that the reason was that they disagree with you on what the standard -- what the court of appeals' reason was?"
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,68.832,73.737,"Well, we know that the court of appeals let stand a district court decision."
2014.13-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,73.737,83.654,"--Right, and so your -- your -- your job is to argue that that was an abuse of discretion, because the statute says that they may, right?"
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,84.888,89.698,"Well, an abuse of discretion -- an abuse of discretion is not necessary to be shown here."
2014.13-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,105.849,112.518,Is it always an abuse of discretion for the court of appeals to let an erroneous decision stand?
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,112.518,114.486,Not necessarily always.
2014.13-719,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,157.016,159.373,"Well, that seems a little extreme to say it may never be corrected."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,202.372,217.491,"Well, Justice Kagan, in this situation, given what the Tenth Circuit has done and given that the case has made it this far, as Judge Hartz pointed out in his dissent below, it's highly unlikely that a situation like this would arise again."
2014.13-719,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,242.511,245.667,I'm not sure you're joining issue with the question Justice Kagan asked.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,249.134,253.508,"Well, the Tenth Circuit did not explain the reasons for its decision."
2014.13-719,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,253.508,260.364,But the dissenters in the case thought -- explain why they thought it was wrong.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,263.942,265.3,"Well, they may have, they may not have."
2014.13-719,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,286.464,287.774,"I mean, I'm not sure what--"
2014.13-719,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,287.774,288.79,Go ahead.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,303.675,309.875,"There has not been another reason that's been given, and the reason that the district court gave was clearly erroneous."
2014.13-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,344.377,362.494,"I'm -- I'm wondering in some later case, could attorneys who want to remove within the 30-day period seek mandate from the Tenth Circuit to mandate the judge not to require the evidence?"
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,362.494,368.133,"--Well, they could -- I suppose they could try something like that."
2014.13-719,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,420.972,443.259,"Mr. Berreth, I -- I apologize for going back to this not merits question, but on the question of why the Tenth Circuit did what it did, Judge Hartz, who was, of course, dissenting from denial, made reference to the fact -- and I'm just quoting here -- that the judges were very busy, and the appeal presented a knotty matter that requires a decision in short order."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,455.286,474.105,"Well, in a case like this where all parties agree that there's a case in the court of appeals, so that there is jurisdiction under Section 1254, the Forsyth v. Hammond case confirms that this Court has the power, the certiorari power to -- to look to the whole case, to look to any aspects of the case."
2014.13-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,474.105,489.412,"But I thought Hohn, which I think you used as explaining why the case is in the court of appeals, but Hohn said the only thing that you can review is the COA, certificate of appealability."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,503.813,511.013,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, the difference in that case was that the government conceded error."
2014.13-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,523.35,537.284,"But I thought -- are you saying that all parties concede that this case is in the court of appeals, both with respect to the proper exercise of the court's jurisdiction in taking the case and as to the merits?"
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,537.284,538.094,That's right.
2014.13-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,546.342,551.355,"Well, I -- I think that's contrary to Hohn, as Justice Ginsburg has just indicated."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,551.355,557.197,"--Well, Hohn did not purport to overrule Nixon v. Fitzgerald--"
2014.13-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,557.197,557.775,All right.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,564.397,570.536,"--Justice Kennedy, this -- this case presents different issues than were in play in Hohn."
2014.13-719,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,606.708,619.391,The reason is that any careful lawyer in the Tenth Circuit will -- will know that we -- we'd better put the evidence in the notice of removal.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,630.98,632.214,That's right.
2014.13-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.976,647.8,"--But the district court's opinion is not -- certainly not circuit law, so I think you exaggerate when you say it establishes bad law for the circuit."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,648.581,650.331,"Well, the--"
2014.13-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,650.331,655.516,"The circuit let the district court decision stand, but that doesn't make the district court decision circuit law."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,655.516,661.405,--The district court was relying on circuit law in making its decisions.
2014.13-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.405,662.451,And maybe it was wrong.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,662.451,669.62,"Well, the circuit law, which started this, the Laughlin case from 1995, is wrong, we would submit."
2014.13-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,673.732,674.046,I see.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,679.085,679.693,That's right.
2014.13-719,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,724.001,724.029,--All right.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,728.222,745.84,"The circuit abused its discretion by letting stand a decision that so plainly violated the plain language of the statute that exists in a case in which further review is highly unlikely, so that if it's not corrected now it may never be corrected."
2014.13-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,763.6,771.329,"To put it more simply, you think that the circuit abused its discretion by relying upon an improper legal reason."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,771.329,771.99,We do believe it.
2014.13-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,771.99,773.328,"That's classic, right?"
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,773.328,774.203,We do.
2014.13-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,775.108,779.217,"Now, it isn't quite clear that they did, because they didn't say it."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,791.461,792.539,--That's right.
2014.13-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,792.539,792.927,That's your position.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,792.927,793.264,That's right.
2014.13-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,794.04,795.49,There is nothing more to it than that.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,795.49,797.815,"--This Court reviews judgments, not rulings."
2014.13-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,797.815,798.233,"No, no."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,798.911,799.795,And--
2014.13-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,799.795,809.089,"What we reviewed is the word ""denied"", and the question of the word ""denied"" is we're not certain why, but we have a good suspicion."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,813.181,821.88,--What else is in the argument is that this Court is not required to find an abuse of discretion to rule in our favor in this case.
2014.13-719,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,839.826,843.309,"In other words, you win either way."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,852.134,853.867,"That's right, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.13-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,880.045,883.168,We don't know what the Tenth Circuit did.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,922.699,934.148,"I'm saying that once the application for an appeal was filed, there is a case in the court of appeals, therefore, this Court's power is so extensive it can review any aspect of a decision."
2014.13-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.146,939.552,Is that right?
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,964.213,971.944,"Justice Scalia, under Forsyth, though, this Court does have the power to not be constrained by the district court's--"
2014.13-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,971.944,974.304,"I thought your answer would be, of course, he is right."
2014.13-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.552,1020.91,Do you agree with that description of the dissent?
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1023.283,1031.936,--The dissent said that the district court felt constrained by this pre-existing Tenth Circuit precedent to refuse to consider the evidence.
2014.13-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1031.936,1032.655,Yes.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1045.774,1047.243,It did not explain that.
2014.13-719,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1047.759,1055.489,You have different judges who possibly read different language in the dissent to suggest what the dissent is thinking.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1061.221,1070.811,"But based on what happened here, there is just simply no way that the Tenth Circuit's decision can satisfy an abuse of discretion standard."
2014.13-719,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1070.811,1076.746,Let me give you an example of something that happens quite frequently and maybe you can tell me if this situation is any different from that.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1125.289,1125.32,No--
2014.13-719,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1125.32,1130.616,What would be -- is that different from this situation?
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1130.616,1131.599,--It's not very different from the situation.
2014.13-719,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1138.3,1145.516,"Mr. Berreth, that assumes that when an appeals court decides whether to take an appeal, all they are doing is making a merits determination."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1170.553,1181.547,"--I believe that what we do know, what we can glean from this, though, is that by failing to correct this clear error of law, that was an abuse of discretion."
2014.13-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.677,1218.548,"Well, I guess it's an abuse of discretion whenever we fail to correct a clear error of law on a petition for certiorari."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1231.979,1234.214,I don't believe it would be an abuse of discretion for this Court.
2014.13-719,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1241.882,1244.662,But this statute gives the appellate courts tremendous discretion on this area.
2014.13-719,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1269.729,1275.981,That might be a little premature.
2014.13-719,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1275.981,1277.533,All right.
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1334.831,1341.109,"--Well, this Court doesn't need to know whether the Circuit Court made a merits decision to reverse in this case."
2014.13-719,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1350.059,1357.102,"Do you think it's appropriate for this Court to dismiss certiorari, in other words, the case is not before us, and then opine on the merits of the case?"
2014.13-719,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1357.102,1357.383,No.
2014.13-719,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1362.557,1367.864,I thought the suggestion was that we tell the Tenth Circuit that this was wrong?
2014.13-719,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1367.864,1368.067,No.
2014.13-719,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1370.441,1379.767,"Well, if we simply dismiss certiorari, what do you think we have the authority to say other than the reasons for dismissing certiorari?"
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1379.767,1385.844,"Well, I think number one, you have the power to rule in favor of my client in this case."
2014.13-719,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1428.139,1433.684,How can -- how can we remand for an appropriate consideration of the factors if we don't say that what took place was inappropriate?
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1433.684,1439.837,"That's -- a decision on the merits would cover all those bases, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1449.364,1452.55,Is the only way that we can do that is by granting cert before judgment?
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1452.55,1456.268,I don't believe that that's the only way that that can be done.
2014.13-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1458.189,1470.653,"Well, let's assume that we think the case that Hohn controls and this case is in the -- in the court of appeals only for the purpose of determining whether the appeal should be taken."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1478.619,1485.055,"--Justice Kennedy, the Court's certiorari power is broader than that, I believe."
2014.13-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1495.61,1497.017,"Well, do we grant it on the ground that it's interesting?"
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1501.203,1522.6,"--You grant cert on cases of national importance, on cases in which there is one wayward circuit that's so flouting the plain language of the -- of the statute that it -- that it -- that it should -- needs to be corrected, that defendants in the heartland of the country, in these six states, should have the same benefits as defendants in those other states."
2014.13-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1522.6,1524.381,"In other words, we grant cert to the district court?"
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1524.381,1530.457,This Court can grant cert to the district court in very rare circumstances.
2014.13-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1530.457,1540.499,"And that's the only way we can do it, it seems to me, if you assume that the case is in the court of appeals only for the purpose of determining whether to take an appeal."
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1540.499,1545.856,"Well, the Nixon v. Fitzgerald case, though, confirms that the court is not so constrained."
2014.13-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1545.856,1549.965,"Well, but we would sort of frustrate the statute, wouldn't we?"
2014.13-719,0,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,1603.287,1617.092,"Well, when Congress provides in 1453 for appellate jurisdiction over the remand orders, Congress is providing for jurisdiction in this Court because Congress didn't legislate to the contrary."
2014.13-719,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1641.599,1643.286,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1649.753,1652.237,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-719,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1683.661,1692.561,"So -- so if the court of appeals said we are not accepting this petition because of the race of the person seeking removal, that's just too bad?"
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1693.501,1698.905,"If they give a reason, I think this Court can review a reason."
2014.13-719,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1709.059,1721.974,"So if every case in which parties seek removal, a particular race of a person seeking removal, their case is denied 100 out of 100 cases."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1731.189,1731.392,No.
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1741.827,1746.668,But it was just pointed out that lawyers in the Tenth Circuit are not going to take that risk.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1778.327,1789.197,"Your Honor, I think that's what the dissent pointed out, is that, what lawyer would not put on evidence after having that Tenth Circuit rule set forth as it has been for the last 20 years."
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1807.004,1810.486,Maybe -- maybe because it thought there wouldn't be any controversy.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1819.92,1822.762,"--That's a good point, Your Honor, and that's entirely possible."
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1834.211,1839.18,"You actually started out by saying 1447(d), which I thought had nothing to do with this case."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1893.156,1893.672,"Well, Your Honor--"
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1893.672,1893.999,Yes or no?
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1893.999,1895.774,"--No, Your Honor."
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1895.774,1899.617,"No, we can't review any case when they turn it down, no matter what their reason."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1901.679,1912.209,"1450 -- as you pointed out, 1453(c) and 1453 in total adopts the entirety of 1446 and 1447, with limited exception."
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1912.209,1912.534,No.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1930.106,1931.296,And my answer is still--
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1931.296,1932.046,"No, it doesn't--"
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1932.046,1932.871,--still the same--
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.871,1934.036,"--No matter how terrible the reason, it doesn't."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1934.506,1934.713,--No.
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1939.834,1940.017,"No, no."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1945.053,1945.856,--As in this case.
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1945.856,1951.941,They say we do not accept the appeal because 1453 only applies to stoppage in transitu.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1963.124,1966.653,Denied for some clearly improper reason?
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1966.653,1968.294,"Yes, denied for some clearly improper reason."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1979.053,1982.131,"I understand, Your Honor, and I don't think I have any cases, but--"
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1982.131,1982.537,All right.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1995.767,1996.422,"--Well, let me see if I can--"
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1996.422,1999.624,"I don't do that, but, I mean, but I'm not going to get you to say anything more."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,1999.624,2002.435,"--Let me see if I can address it, Your Honor."
2014.13-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.166,2068.596,Do you think it's -- it's constitutional for Congress to say that certain minor issues or what it regards as minor issues shall not be appealable for any reason whatever?
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2082.778,2085.316,"Your Honor, I don't think Congress can -- no, I don't think Congress--"
2014.13-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2085.316,2086.683,You don't think Congress did that here.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2086.683,2088.244,--I don't think they did that here.
2014.13-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.166,2090.166,I think you're going to lose then.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2090.166,2110.018,"--I think they made a simple declaration in 1447(d) that remand orders are not worth the time of the Court to handle on review, and with respect to class actions, we're going to let the court of appeals make that choice of whether it makes -- if it merits any attention on appeal."
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2111.58,2121.169,"Do you pay any attention at all to the obvious purpose of the Class Action Fairness Act, which was to get cases out of the State courts and into the Federal courts?"
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2130.087,2131.384,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.222,2157.186,"You said that you would argue that the amount in controversy was not satisfied and it seems to me that most plaintiffs who are bringing class actions are not going to be argued, oh, we can't prove $500,000."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2157.186,2177.351,"--Your Honor, as much as my client would like to see this be a bigger case than it really is, this particular case, as the Court knows, when the original allegation was made on a conclusory basis of $8.2 million, that was made on the basis of all of the potential damages for all of the royalty owners."
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2213.384,2219.568,"You had alleged in your complaint that the damages that you were seeking were under $500,000."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2222.177,2225.41,"We -- we had no idea at that time, Your Honor."
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2229.11,2237.169,"--But when they -- when they did allege in the notice of removal that the amount in controversy was met, you didn't contest that."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2237.169,2239.185,We didn't need to at that time.
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2252.586,2259.632,"But what you didn't say is that there is no such evidence and that our damages are less than $500,000."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2259.632,2267.049,--We -- we didn't know -- we didn't have any evidence at all as to what the amount in controversy was so we didn't allege it in our petition.
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2278.651,2286.292,But there's a peculiar -- this State doesn't require the complaint to state the amount in controversy.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2303.113,2312.686,"In -- if I had been in -- in the -- in the know at the time this case was filed, I would have alleged what the amount of damages were."
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2348.656,2358.168,"If there's only one circuit then, I mean, that is so antithetical with the whole notion of the Federal rules that you don't plead evidence."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2375.49,2386.328,"--Well, the -- the way I read the JVCA in 1446(a) is that the grounds must be just plainly stated, just like a regular pleading."
2014.13-719,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2403.196,2413.786,I just have never -- I'm a little hard-pressed to understand why the district court would be without power to decide this question.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2423.798,2428.561,"--Certainly, that could have been done if they had gotten over the procedural hurdle to begin with."
2014.13-719,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2456.659,2457.315,But I don't see where you get that.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2508.795,2512.87,"Well, the reason for that, I think, is that the original notice is not a pleading."
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2525.647,2528.272,But this is -- this is a provision for removal.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2543.063,2549.262,You have to for the notice of removal because (c)(2) does a couple of things.
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2585.686,2594.805,"If -- if the plaintiff wanted to challenge that, I could understand your position and then you would have the respective parties putting in their evidence."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2606.082,2614.518,"Justice Ginsburg, in this case as in most class actions, plaintiffs have no evidence that they could possibly put on."
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2632.448,2651.846,"But when you bring a class action, you're looking for big bucks and the likelihood that it's going to be controverted, that the plaintiff who's brought a class action in the State court is going to say, oh, no, we can't -- we can't make the amount in controversy, that sounds very strange to me."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2658.827,2664.263,"--Well, in this particular case, this case really isn't worth $5 million."
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2684.27,2690.3,"Well, I don't follow that because ordinarily a plaintiff would state what the plaintiff's damages are."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2690.3,2697.672,Plaintiff in a class action generally does not have the evidence of how many class members there are or how much they've been damaged.
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2719.317,2722.989,"In -- in the -- let's take a case in the Federal court, a class action case."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2725.971,2730.126,"If they know what the amount in controversy is, they could state what the amount of controversy is."
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2743.121,2749.76,But you would say that all that the plaintiff would say is we meet the amount in controversy?
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2749.76,2756.397,They could say the amount in controversy is 5 million or it's 7 million or whatever it may be.
2014.13-719,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2813.795,2814.008,I'm sorry.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2871.022,2875.646,"--Well, plaintiff usually has absolutely no idea what the allegation may be."
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2896.309,2896.778,Not necessarily.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2910.429,2923.406,"It -- it could be -- if 1446 was written such that 1446(a) was the end of it and there was no further part of the statute, then all they would have to do is make an allegation and that would be the end of it."
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2925.235,2926.562,They have to allege the facts.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2932.266,2933.106,--Yeah.
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2948.382,2948.834,Isn't that a fact?
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2948.834,2951.109,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2951.109,2952.802,Isn't 8.2 million a fact?
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2952.802,2954.574,It's a conclusory fact.
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2954.574,2955.299,"Well, it's a fact."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2957.231,2957.289,It's a conclusion.
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2957.289,2957.527,--All right.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,2964.296,2966.749,I would agree with Your Honor.
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3007.953,3010.156,Where -- where was that said about conclusory?
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3019.853,3022.931,"--The district court did both, Your Honor."
2014.13-719,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3058.805,3065.71,"Well, one thing we know is that they denied it upon careful consideration of the parties' submissions as well as the applicable law."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3068.161,3073.909,"The -- no, I don't think so, Your Honor."
2014.13-719,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3110.535,3116.533,Do I remember it wrong in -- in thinking that in your briefing you didn't raise this question?
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3137.118,3151.721,"Your Honor, I'm comfortable and have argued this case on the merits as -- as you know, but nonetheless, I think I'm duty bound, as all the parties are, to determine whether this Court has jurisdiction and what the extent of that jurisdiction is."
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3180.913,3187.442,"--Briefly, the Court has jurisdiction of cases in the court of appeals."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3187.442,3188.145,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3188.145,3188.597,All right.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3242.982,3245.308,"Well, then I won't take that position, Your Honor."
2014.13-719,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3245.308,3249.838,"Well, no, you -- I mean, I'm often wrong in these things."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3249.838,3258.929,But the position I would take is that there is a clear distinction in 1447(d) that addresses remand and has nothing to do with Hohn or Miller L or Nixon.
2014.13-719,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3275.234,3286.041,"Maybe you answered this before, but is it your position that under the Class Action Fairness Act the court of appeals has absolute discretion, unlimited discretion, to decide whether to take an appeal or not?"
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3286.041,3287.682,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-719,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3287.682,3289.307,Any reason whatsoever is okay?
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3289.307,3298.444,"Any reason whatsoever is okay, as long as -- I would guess, as I think Justice Scalia pointed out, as long as it's not a constitutional violation."
2014.13-719,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3298.444,3302.209,"So what if the court of appeals says, we are not taking this because we just don't like the Class Action Fairness Act."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3307.83,3312.063,"I don't know if that would be a constitutional violation, Your Honor."
2014.13-719,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3338.646,3353.079,"I was going say -- and this is not certainly true of the Tenth Circuit -- but suppose things change and we get to the point where each judge on the Tenth Circuit is sitting on ten cases a year, and so they can have a ten-month vacation."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3360.014,3370.102,"Again, I think it -- it's that line of what -- when the judge is doing his job, when he is not doing his job, and whether there's a constitutional violation."
2014.13-719,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3384.456,3390.142,"Well, all the Class Action Fairness Act says is, I believe, is that the court may take the case."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3395.656,3397.031,"--It doesn't, Your Honor."
2014.13-719,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3433.937,3446.181,"Outside of the Class Action Fairness Act, may a district court -- is a court of appeals barred from reviewing a decision of the district court to remand the case based on docket control?"
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3446.181,3449.258,"Not under Thermtron as it exists at this point, Your Honor."
2014.13-719,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3449.258,3457.724,Can we infer anything from that as to whether Congress thought that that would be a proper reason under the Class Action Fairness Act?
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3457.724,3459.879,"Your Honor, I see my time is up."
2014.13-719,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3459.879,3461.378,You can't escape that easily.
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3461.378,3465.8,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2014.13-719,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3489.961,3491.116,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-719,1,56110,rex_sharp,,3491.116,3491.46,Thank you.
2014.13-719,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3491.46,3493.069,"Mr. Berreth, you have three minutes remaining."
2014.13-719,2,56109,nowell_d_berreth,,3493.069,3513.655,It's -- it's simply improper to allow courts of appeals to insulate their decisions from review by not giving reasons for -- for their decisions.
2014.13-719,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3569.013,3570.01,"Thank you, counsel."
