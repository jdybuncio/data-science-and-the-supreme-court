2016.15-927,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.075,"We will hear argument next in Case 15-927, SCA Hygiene Products Aktiebolag v. First Quality Baby Products. Mr. Black."
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,10.075,31.795,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Petrella, the Court reaffirmed the principle that when Congress enacts a limitations period, that courts may not apply the doctrine of laches to shorten the statutory period. In patent law, Congress prescribed a six-year lookback period from the date of suit and a 20-year patent term."
2016.15-927,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,53.6,57.625,You don't dispute that equitable estoppel applies across the board?
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,57.625,66.91,"That's correct, Your Honor. Equitable estoppel applied has been part of the law, on the law side of the Court, since the mid-18th century, as the Court held in -- in Dickerson in 1879."
2016.15-927,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,80.209,97.56,"For this -- for this argument I'm not sure, because of course they dispute that, and they have a long list of cases, Alsterbach -- or what, Aukerman and so forth, going back into history. And they have the man who wrote the statute, and they have words in the statute."
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,148.555,150.29,"Your Honor, let me address --"
2016.15-927,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,150.29,158.34,"Is that right? I mean, that's how I'm approaching it, and I'm asking you to comment on that because I don't want to waste a lot of time reading cases I don't have to read."
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,158.34,158.74,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-927,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,162.59,167.9,"In the statute is the word ""enforcement."" And -- and when it is invalid, what's the word --"
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,167.9,167.97,"""Unenforceability."""
2016.15-927,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,167.97,178.23,"-- ""unenforceable."" And that could apply just to the -- the -- you know, monkeying around with the patent, doing bad things to the patent, or it could include laches."
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,186.255,187.77,"Your Honor, let's discuss unenforceability."
2016.15-927,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,241.51,247.12,They have some cases from us in other courts relating unenforceability to patents.
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,270.165,270.79,I believe --
2016.15-927,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,270.79,274.435,"And that's what -- that's what Federico -- Federico did, right?"
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,274.435,281.43,"Well, Mr. Federico -- Mr. Federico's -- I believe there's only one case that actually used ""unenforceability"" or ""unenforceable"" with laches."
2016.15-927,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,285.45,285.8,Their timing.
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,285.8,293.475,I take that -- I take that point. Let me address Mr. Federico's commentary. All he said was that laches was included.
2016.15-927,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,300.03,301.83,"Well, just to stop you there."
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,326.52,328.14,There -- there are words in between.
2016.15-927,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,383.97,386.535,But the clear language argument really doesn't help you at all.
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,396.795,408.58,"Respectfully disagree, Your Honor. Section 286 is entitled -- it is titled ""Time Limitation on Damages."" That is the timeliness rule that Congress selected for patent infringement cases in 1896."
2016.15-927,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,452.61,453.93,I have one question on that.
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,606.065,607.01,"Understood, Your Honor."
2016.15-927,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,609.35,622.33,"May -- may I just clarify? Petrella explained, in the context of that case, that it wasn't unscrupulous for this woman to wait to see whether there was anything in it for her."
2016.15-927,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,638.48,639.23,I accept that.
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,639.23,640.175,"That's my answer, Your Honor."
2016.15-927,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,640.175,640.46,No.
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,676.34,677.63,"That would be estoppel, Your Honor."
2016.15-927,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,678.61,679.42,I want to --
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,679.42,680.9,For all --
2016.15-927,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,680.9,693.93,"No, you -- please. I think that whether there is unscrupulous behavior or bad or unfair behavior is a function of whether an existing doctrine, laches, applies to the case."
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,705.87,706.145,Okay.
2016.15-927,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,706.145,708.78,"I'm sorry, but don't lose the estoppel argument there."
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,708.78,709.54,"I'm not going to, Your Honor. I'm --"
2016.15-927,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,709.54,710.79,I want to hear what you were going to say.
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,710.79,713.82,Lying in wait -- the lying -- it's the lying-in-wait question.
2016.15-927,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,714.44,714.79,"No, it's not."
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,764.81,765.925,Okay.
2016.15-927,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,805.59,806.15,"Wait, wait."
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,813.05,837.76,"Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor. What happened -- what happened below is summary judgment was granted on estoppel and laches. Went up to the court of appeals, they reversed on estoppel finding there was a genuine issue of material fact on whether or not the defendant actually relied on any -- on any conduct of the plaintiff, and sent it back down. But with respect to the laches, the court said, well, we have these presumptions that apply, and therefore, there is no -- there is nothing to try."
2016.15-927,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,837.76,842.17,So is estoppel an unenforceable -- unenforceable?
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,842.17,843.47,Estoppel -- it's --
2016.15-927,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,843.47,845.46,Render the patent unenforceable?
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,845.46,846.79,It's -- it's unclear.
2016.15-927,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,851.99,854.17,Just like here with laches.
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,854.17,854.61,"Laches, no."
2016.15-927,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,872.35,875.7,You've got two more points that you wanted to raise.
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,875.7,877.305,"Yes, Your Honor. Lying in wait."
2016.15-927,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,930.155,937.79,"But most of the things we are worried about, we are not worried about the lever or something, it's chips and things like that, and you can't mark those."
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,937.79,938.43,That's right.
2016.15-927,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1123.87,1148.045,"Can I go back a step, because you may have -- if I understand what you're saying, we have a case that would otherwise be laches. That is, every one agrees that Smith has Jones' patent. But Smith thinks that Jones has given him approval, a license, a very complex kind, and so he goes ahead and uses it."
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,1203.475,1215.72,"Not close, but let me just clarify one point to make sure we are on the same page here. If the patent -- let's say the defendant has -- or the infringer has a profit margin of 40 percent."
2016.15-927,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1382.31,1387.62,"No, I was thinking of the examples in the Dell brief, which undoubtedly you've read."
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,1387.62,1388.265,Yes.
2016.15-927,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1388.265,1391.11,Those are the examples in my mind.
2016.15-927,0,62762,martin_j_black,,1391.11,1393.01,"Sure, Your Honor. One of them was an estoppel case."
2016.15-927,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1520.315,1525.91,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1525.91,1539.475,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has repeatedly recognized that the 1952 Patent Act sought to retain and reflect patent law as it then existed."
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1554.97,1563.89,"Where is the codification? I don't see anything in that -- what is it? 2 -- 282? -- other than the word ""enforceable."""
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1563.89,1564.31,Right.
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1591.1,1595.17,"Well, how could it be when it doesn't make the patent unenforceable?"
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1595.17,1609.65,"It -- it does in exactly the same way, for example, Justice Ginsburg, that estoppel does; that is it is a defendant-specific defense, just as estoppel, which all concede is an unenforceability defense."
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1613.93,1617.125,I don't know -- I don't know if all would concede that.
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1630.175,1653.95,"Justice Ginsburg, in the 46 years since this Court decided Blonder-Tongue, we've become accustomed to the principle of non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel, that is that permits a party that wasn't a party to the prior suit to raise defenses that were successfully waged against another party."
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1692.63,1700.185,I do -- I do understand you mentioned the issue preclusion in -- in Blonder-Tongue is such a case.
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1706.18,1723.885,"So -- so, for example in -- in the first case, the claim for patent infringement is defeated on an argument of, you know, collateral -- inequitable -- equitable estoppel or inequitable conduct or patent misuse or prosecution laches."
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1733.7,1737.97,"Some of them -- some of them, misuse would go across the board -- board."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1746.955,1747.79,So --
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1747.79,1751.83,So I don't see how -- how issue preclusion would then work.
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1751.83,1761.47,"Justice Ginsburg, the question in this case is what Congress understood the patent law doctrine was in 1952."
2016.15-927,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1808.195,1811.11,"That mountain of cases were in equity, right?"
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1811.11,1816.7,"Well, in equity and in law. There were law cases that were applied and --"
2016.15-927,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1816.7,1838.54,"But that's where your mountain becomes a mole hill, right? I mean, the -- the cases in which laches was applied at law were -- is insignificant, certainly not enough to support a consensus that Congress could be understood to have adopted for the simple reason that -- that, as you point out, actions were brought in equity, because you could get both an injunction and damages."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1838.54,1838.98,That's right.
2016.15-927,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1843.55,1846.68,"Well, it's a little hard to talk about this mountain if they are all equity cases."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1846.68,1889.625,"Will, I don't -- I don't think so, but let me take my -- let me take my run at the mountain of your question. As you point out, almost all of the cases, 98 percent, according to Professor Lemley, were brought on the equity side, and they don't even have an argument that laches wasn't available as a defense to claims for damages which could be sought in equity courts beginning in 1870, and there are plenty of cases showing that. Now, there were, as Your Honor suggests, that some cases -- if I just may finish -- there were some cases that were brought at law, usually where the patent had expired and no equitable -- no injunctive relief could be sought."
2016.15-927,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1921.62,1932.745,"But you would -- you would concede that if you're just looking at those four cases, that's not enough of a well-accepted consensus that Congress could have considered to have adopted the rule in those cases."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1932.745,1942.86,"Well, I don't think that when Congress was -- was enacting the '52 law they were only looking at the pre-1938 cases."
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1944.69,1967.76,Maybe they were -- they were looking at what the statute of limitations -- what the -- the origin was that equity invented laches because there was no statute of limitation.
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2013.295,2018.8,"Justice Ginsburg, I will return to respond to -- to complete my previous answer."
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2060.55,2062.205,Does it support a time limitation?
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2062.205,2062.96,Excuse me --
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2062.96,2064.7,In support -- sorry.
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2064.7,2068.38,It is a -- it is a limitation on the damages.
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2210.6,2214.24,The question is not -- the question is not whether laches was available.
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2233.655,2238.715,"I -- I completely adopt your articulation, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2355.02,2366.685,What about the well-established understanding that laches cannot bar claims for the legal relief that have their own time limitation?
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2366.685,2370.18,"So, there is a maxim, and it clearly did apply."
2016.15-927,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2427.52,2444.075,"But speaking of the general maxim, Mr. Waxman, wouldn't we expect that if Congress wanted to make an exception for patent law or wanted to continue exception that existed as a result of the preexisting practice, that Congress actually would have said so?"
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2444.075,2451.38,I -- I think not in a context in which we are -- Congress is not enacting something new.
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2478.54,2486.53,"Did the senator that you just quoted, did he use unenforceability the -- the way you do?"
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2486.53,2533.77,"Well, he said we need to include unenforceability because of the -- and this is -- this is recited; I can't remember what the relevant language in our red brief -- we have to amend this to include unenforceability, because there are doctrines that are reported in the cases -- and these are all equitable doctrines, including laches -- that prevent the recovery of damages where -- even if a patent is determined to be valid and infringed. And that's why, he explained, there also had to be an amendment in what became Section 284 so that it didn't simply apply damages to patents that were valid and infringed but only in cases in which the plaintiff isn't otherwise entitled."
2016.15-927,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2533.77,2538.54,"But the problem with that argument that you're making is that, yes, that was said."
2016.15-927,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2552.43,2566.38,"I still don't see in the history where the people who were drafting at the time, not two years later or time later, really were thinking of this in the way you're speaking of."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2566.38,2607.87,"Justice Sotomayor, you are correct that in amending the statute to include an unenforceability defense, and again, I want to reiterate that even if you don't think unenforceability applies to the litany of equitable defenses that have long since been imported into substantive patent law on both sides, even if you don't agree with that, you still have to interpret 286, which they claim is the bar to the application of laches against a backdrop of uniform, very substantial case law from every circuit that considered the question, that recognized that laches was, in fact, such a defense. But you -- you are --"
2016.15-927,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2607.87,2616.255,"You won't get very far with me on that, because I don't know how to import something in that's not stated by Congress in any way."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2616.255,2640.92,"What is stated by Congress, and this Court has accepted repeatedly, is that Congress in 1952 intended to retain and reflect patent law as it existed, and that's why, for example, this Court found, even though there is no codification, that the doctrine of equivalence is still applicable after the 1952 Act, even though nothing was said about it."
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2641.45,2646.07,There is a whole series of decisions in the courts of appeal.
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2667.79,2714.015,"This Court is never estopped from anything that it doesn't think it's estopped from. But the legal -- the legal question in the case, Justice Ginsburg, is what did Congress in -- did Congress in -- in enacting the 1952 Act intend to retain and reflect the patent law, laches case law, as it intended to retain and reflect patent law in general? And there are -- I mean, I gave you the example, for example, to Justice Sotomayor's question of where was the -- you know, an express intent to include laches, I gave you the example of the doctrine of equivalence. There are many, many other doctrines that were continued and that this Court has found were continued."
2016.15-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2714.015,2735.94,"A weak point in your argument is all -- most of those prior cases were -- were equity cases, but the weak point's weakened because most of those equity cases after 1897 were under provisions that had a statute of limitations, and the reason you didn't have laches in equity is because it didn't have a statute of limitations."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2745.9,2747.68,I just want to strengthen it.
2016.15-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2747.68,2748.19,Okay.
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2760.385,2760.87,And this is --
2016.15-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2760.87,2792.21,"I was -- I was afraid of -- and I think I might have been well wrong to be afraid of it -- but moved in part by the Dell brief, I was afraid that a person with a patent or the transferee of that patent, in year 2, would have told the -- a licensee, go right ahead, go ahead, or not said anything when he could have or something like that, that would have given rise to laches."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2800.68,2802.24,Justice Breyer --
2016.15-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2802.24,2818.125,"And then in year 18, this person, now the transferee of the patent, sues him, and he is going to get six years worth of profits and nothing deducted."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2843.43,2843.63,Yep.
2016.15-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2843.63,2845.27,But I want to give you a chance.
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2845.27,2863.305,"Thank you. Justice Breyer, the Dell brief is one of a dozen briefs that addresses the very significant consequences to extending Petrella to the very, very different statutory and commercial context."
2016.15-927,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2895.42,2907.07,"Mr. Waxman, can you get to Justice Breyer's question? What is the economic consequence other than paying a reasonable royalty? Let's assume somebody waits till year 19."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2920.165,2924.79,"Well, the -- the economic -- of course we're now just talking about retrospective damages."
2016.15-927,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3021.995,3027.25,"Well, Mr. Waxman, to follow up on this point, Mr. Black made several -- made several points."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3046.485,3050.845,"Well, I don't know how often laches is asserted or not asserted."
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3088.92,3095.68,The Federal Circuit -- the Federal Circuit was the final word until this Court stepped in.
2016.15-927,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3095.68,3095.94,All right.
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3095.94,3098.66,And the Federal Circuit's position was clear.
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3098.66,3118.11,"That -- that's entirely right. The point here is that -- that the principle that laches applied to damages was so unexceptional, that it simply wasn't defended. Now, on the monetary damages, you have -- you can say, oh, yes, you know, perhaps the appropriate remedy is reasonable royalty."
2016.15-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3163.74,3168.575,"The part -- the part I'm missing in your argument, I've focused it -- look."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3193.965,3222.485,"Well, because, in the -- in the copyright context, since in order to even commit the tort of copyright infringement you have to know you're copying, and you can always choose some other form of expression. In the patent doctrine, where it is -- it is strict liability where independent invention is not a defense, there are many, many opportunities recounted in the amicus briefs in which there's every opportunity to design around a particular patent claim."
2016.15-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3222.485,3223.91,"""Locked in"" means you can't change."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3226.34,3250.51,"It's relevant you can't change because at the point -- at the later point in which the -- the plaintiff who unreasonably and without excuse comes in to your substantial prejudice and says, a-ha, I got you, you don't have the option of mitigating. You've built a $1 billion plant, or the -- you're using the patent to -- a -- a standards-essential patent --"
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3250.51,3254.135,How much do you have to pay? You have -- it's only six years.
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3270.9,3276.98,It is damages not less than a reasonable royalty.
2016.15-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3276.98,3286.345,"What does the judge usually charge -- now in many of these cases, at least one of the briefs said, are tried to a jury."
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3294.825,3313.65,"Oh, there are -- I mean, ordinarily, what plaintiffs will seek are the lost profits of the -- of the plaintiff, or another measure of damages, and the judge instructs the jury that as a safeguard, the floor is not less than a reasonable royalty."
2016.15-927,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3333.97,3334.23,Sure.
2016.15-927,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3334.23,3354.16,"In the event that there is a statute of limitations, whether you call the 1897 provision one or not, what is one to make of a laches defense? The case law and the commentators answered that question pellucidly for the 1952 Congress. Thank you."
2016.15-927,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3354.16,3358.04,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Black, you have four minutes remaining. Five minutes."
2016.15-927,2,62762,martin_j_black,,3358.545,3369.845,"Thank you, Your Honor. Patent law is an important branch of the law, but it is just a branch, and this Court's precedence is the trunk and the roots."
2016.15-927,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3530.03,3544.41,"Well, Mr. Black, I take it that Mr. Waxman's principal point is that what separates out the patent context is that laches was operating true in equity but with a statute of limitations, and that that just wasn't true in other places."
2016.15-927,2,62762,martin_j_black,,3553.77,3561.55,"Laches could bar the suit in equity, but -- and then the plaintiff was out of court but not on the law side."
2016.15-927,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3663.465,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
