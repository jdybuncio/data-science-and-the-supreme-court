1979.78-1756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.063,The case is submitted.
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,57.835,61.165,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,478.895,493.02,"Mr. Claiborne, in your brief you indicate one and only question is presented, but doesn't the question embrace at least two -- two questions?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,506.595,524.193,"Mr. Justice Stewart, in the context of this case, a case based entirely on an act of Congress within the terminology of the Tucker Act, we view those questions as the same, analytically different, but in practice, the same."
1979.78-1756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,524.426,528.774,"I suppose if Congress had a created a prior right of action, it would thereby waive the sovereign immunity."
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,528.774,530.102,"Exactly, exactly."
1979.78-1756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,530.102,533.288,"But nonetheless, aren't -- aren't there two questions?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,533.288,536.769,"Analytically, Mr. Justice Stewart, I think you're right."
1979.78-1756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.627,555.934,Against the United States?
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,555.934,564.622,"Against the United States, when a -- an alleged breach of trust duty is found."
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.622,577.745,"Well, the Court of Claims doesn't disagree with you does it on the fact that you must find some -- some kind of a substantive right in the -- in some statutes other than the jurisdictional statutes?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,577.745,579.07,"That is so, Mr. Justice White."
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.07,582.446,And so you did just differ on whether you do find that?
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,582.446,589.377,Our disagreement is with the ease with which they find such a relaxation of the rule.
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.377,595.486,"Mr. Claiborne, could you tell me where do you find the waiver of sovereign immunity in the ordinary contract case?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,609.214,615.332,"Mr. Justice White, I have some difficulty reconciling my answer with to look for words of the test in opinion."
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,615.332,616.769,Yes.
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,616.769,617.761,And so --
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.761,619.237,To go ahead and try.
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,619.237,629.299,It will -- I have to -- I have to read the Testan or perhaps less strictly than its words say.
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,646.366,651.396,"Well, you mean it -- do you mean that the Tucker Act actually contains the -- the waiver of sovereign immunity?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,651.396,662.41,"Well, the Tucker when one looks at its original language and when one reads the long list of cases in this Court must in some sense be viewed as a waiver of sovereign of immunity."
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,662.41,671.1,"So you -- so you look to that -- that contains the waiver of sovereign, but it's still doesn't get you home because you must have a -- implied right of action somewhere?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,671.1,671.188,Exactly so.
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.188,672.055,Or expressed.
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,672.055,676.977,"And in a contract case, it's set that the Tucker Act, it waives a sovereign immunity of the United States."
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,680.94,693.485,"So that you don't -- so that you don't when come around in finding out if there is a private cause of action, you aren't -- don't have the -- you don't approach it as you would a sovereign immunity question."
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,693.543,693.88,Well --
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.88,695.571,-- a very strict construction.
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,695.571,699.024,"Mr. Justice White, my answer is -- is the opposite."
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.024,699.202,That it was --
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,699.202,699.884,One does approach it.
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.884,702.498,"-- because it would expand the sovereign immunity, do we have a loose construction?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,702.498,703.302,Exactly.
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.255,773.421,"Or you would say then -- you would say then, if you were in a District Court in a -- in some kind of a case and then the question was an injunction, there wouldn't be any -- there wouldn't be a sovereign immunity case?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,773.421,774.611,Exactly so.
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.469,790.343,"And no -- so you -- even if you are in the Court of the Claims and the issue is a -- is a -- an injunction, the -- the party seeking the injunction might lose, but not because of sovereign immunity."
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,793.359,794.561,Exactly so.
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.557,871.544,"But if you find there are some statutes that you think clearly enough gives a substantive right to damages to a private individual, if you just post that kind of a statute, you can take it to the Court of Claims."
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,880.258,899.976,"Mr. Justice White, I think it's right that if one finds a statutory duty which clearly permits recovering damages for breach, the function of the Tucker Act in such a case is to permit you to join the United States in name."
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,899.976,909.176,"And even if you find the statute as very arguable and you file in a Court of Claims, the argument is not sovereign immunity, but the argument you're making here."
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,909.176,911.184,Exactly so.
1979.78-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.043,931.94,"Mr. Claiborne, before you -- before you leave that line of inquiry that Mr. Justice White raised I want to be sure I understand your response to his question about the ordinary breach of contract case, where the contractor claims the Government defaulted on an obligation and so forth."
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,939.659,959.011,"The Court -- Mr. Justice Stevens, I think one must say that the tradition that the remedy for breach of contract is money, is the source of the obligation of the United States, like any other contractor when breaching a contract to pay."
1979.78-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.207,978.357,"So that whatever -- whether we're talking here of the waiver of sovereign immunity or creation of cause of action, whatever we need in the way of statutory authority for the litigation to proceed, it's found in the Tucker Act?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,978.357,989.18,"If it -- but in a contract case, which of course is -- is not the category we're concerned with today, it is the law of contracts that provides the remedy in damages."
1979.78-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,989.204,992.123,Then why doesn't the law of trust provide the remedy here?
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,992.123,993.366,"Well, there is --"
1979.78-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,993.366,995.572,It's for the next question here.
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,997.569,1009.948,There isn't a reliance here on the law of trust or I can say the common law of trust because it's a doctrine of equity but the unwritten law of trust is not what is invoked in this case.
1979.78-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.301,1033.207,It may just be a stronger case to recovery.
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1033.207,1033.685,I'm sorry.
1979.78-1756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.685,1038.775,"So then, shouldn't this be a stronger case for recognizing the claim?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1038.775,1060.487,"When -- when reliance is placed on act of Congress, Mr. Justice Stevens, we say following the Testan that one must find in that act of Congress, a provision fairly read as mandating a recovery in damages against the Government."
1979.78-1756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1124.757,1141.518,"But does generically -- arguably, covered it says, “The Court of Claims shall jurisdiction to entertain a suit for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort and that would generically include the law of trust or any other law except tort."
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1142.065,1147.366,"Mr. Justice Stewart, commentators in courts have pondered over that last clause --"
1979.78-1756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1147.366,1148.997,I am -- I am now doing so too.
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1148.997,1154.442,-- and have usually answered that it simply cannot be read literally.
1979.78-1756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1157.333,1158.264,Everything else.
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1158.264,1159.522,It would be meaningless.
1979.78-1756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1183.165,1184.957,It's not permitted by the Tucker Act.
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1185.734,1185.961,No.
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.386,1283.183,"Do you plead -- do you think that the question of construing a statute in order to ascertain whether the Congress intended to give a cause of action for damages, you think that our -- our constructional problem is different than in say, cases like Cort against Ash? You would -- you would say those -- that -- that set of rules just doesn't apply here or not?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1283.183,1292.686,"I would, Mr. Justice White, say that some of those rules do apply as they were indeed (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1292.686,1304.84,"Well, maybe some of them, but you would just say -- you -- you wouldn't say, “Well, let's just approach this problem in the same as you would in determining whether under the Securities Law, Congress intended a private cause of action."
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1304.84,1324.727,"No, but, Mr. Justice White, to that extent I invoke the approach followed in Testan that is that one requires a very clear indication if not an expressed statement in the act of Congress relied on that the remedy for its breach shall be damages."
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1324.819,1327.455,"We must not only find the right, but the remedy --"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1327.455,1327.491,But the (Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.491,1328.809,in the (Voice Overlap) statute.
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1328.809,1330.631,Exactly so.
1979.78-1756,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1338.986,1346.261,"The point in the United States did not press the issue of jurisdiction in U.S. against Mason, did it?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1346.261,1370.702,"That is certainly true Mr. Justice Blackmun whether it was simply overlooked or whether it was thought that was an exceptional case in that, the very purpose of the General Allotment Act had been to exempt the allotted lands from state taxes."
1979.78-1756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1468.342,1470.953,When was the Tucker Act originally enacted?
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1470.953,1472.645,"1887, as well."
1979.78-1756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1472.645,1473.217,Same year?
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1473.217,1475.888,Same year.
1979.78-1756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1491.43,1493.148,(Voice Overlap) the Tucker Act laws in the (Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1493.148,1494.919,But not in this respect.
1979.78-1756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1507.358,1511.99,Did the Tucker Act add or fund any expressed or implied contract to the United States?
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1511.99,1513.531,As -- it's certainly not --
1979.78-1756,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1513.531,1514.387,(Inaudible)
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1514.387,1515.839,I think not.
1979.78-1756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1536.721,1566.933,"Mr. Claiborne, let me call your attention to the language from the General Allotment Act cited on page 3 of the Government's brief, the last sentence where it says, “And if any conveyance shall be made of the lands set apart and allotted as herein provided or any contract made touching the same, before the expiration of the time above mentioned, such conveyance or contract shall be absolutely null and void."""
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1572.46,1575.137,"I think probably both, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-1756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1575.137,1594.84,"Well, don't you have an expression unius argument to rely on there that the -- that the remedy against the Government, if it breached its trust under the General Allotment Act, was simply to declare the conveyance null and void?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1594.84,1596.047,I'm grateful to Your Honor.
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1613.578,1616.643,Was not available in the Court of Claims?
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1616.643,1619.593,"This remedy of course, would not be in the Court of Claims."
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.593,1632.521,"And -- but if in the District Court, how about the -- how about restitution as when you declare that the act -- the -- a contract void?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1637.778,1645.296,It may be that in the case of a -- an alienation which is wholly unauthorized --
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.296,1647.099,What about timber?
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1651.638,1651.809,"Well, not the --"
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1651.809,1658.427,And it's -- and it's a void contract and that the timber is gone and the U.S. has the money.

1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1660.242,1666.622,"Well, I think that would probably money wrongfully retained within the exception noted in Testan."
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.225,1690.353,And where do you get the -- and where do you get the -- the cause of action -- the implied cause of action -- the expressed cause of action as a constitutional claim?
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1690.353,1692.898,"From the Constitution itself, but of course, the Tucker Act does imply."
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1692.898,1695.567,"Mean that -- well, you don't read it in the Constitution."
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1695.567,1697.389,"Well, this Court has done it, precisely that."
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1697.389,1701.048,"Well, I know, but you -- you don't -- can you just find it there?"

1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.757,1713.56,-- that's -- that's the only clause in the Constitution for which there's a remedy against the United States?
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1713.56,1719.523,"Remedy in damages, so far as I'm aware, against the United States."
1979.78-1756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1719.523,1720.772,"So -- so yes, your answer is, yes?"
1979.78-1756,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1720.772,1722.71,Yes.
1979.78-1756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1724.473,1728.943,Very well.
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,1731.984,1736.473,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.78-1756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1772.448,1774.93,600 F.2d 1332?
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,1774.93,1778.329,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1826.512,1840.665,"When you say that you feel indignation Mr. Hobbs, isn't it the Government's responsibility to call to the court of any -- call the attention of any court of the United States an apparent lack of jurisdiction on its part?"

1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1845.267,1849.922,"Well, that may be attributable to a number of reasons."
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,1857.31,1858.789,No doubt.
1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1901.26,1912.741,"But we've had jurisdictional questions raise sua sponte in this Court, as to the jurisdiction of District Courts, because that's the law."
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,1912.741,1917.468,"Justice Rehnquist, I'm not saying that this Court cannot entertain the question of jurisdiction."
1979.78-1756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1970.25,1973.905,"In the Mason case, the plaintiffs were not an Indian tribe?"
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,1973.905,1974.234,No.
1979.78-1756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1975.608,1977.194,"So, it didn't involve 1505."
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,1978.642,1981.29,Correct.
1979.78-1756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2175.564,2181.045,Was this the position in the Court of Claim?
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2181.045,2182.72,It did not speak to that question.
1979.78-1756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2182.72,2183.093,No.
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2185.879,2191.701,There is the underlying knowledge that the land of the United States originally belonged to the Indians.
1979.78-1756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2191.701,2196.44,Did your words have position than its support on the Court of Claims' jurisdiction in the Court of Claims?
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2196.44,2197.216,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2197.216,2200.837,That is Indian cases are special cases?
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2200.837,2201.362,Yes.
1979.78-1756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2201.362,2201.712,You do.
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2201.712,2203.686,And we argue the rule of construction which is --
1979.78-1756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2203.686,2212.83,So I gather you feel like you -- you suggest that you can rely on that here even though the Court of Claims didn't justify its jurisdiction like I --
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2212.83,2222.964,"Justice Brennan, I -- I assume that we can urge any ground that we urge below in support of affirmance of the Court of Claims."
1979.78-1756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2224.64,2226.963,Even though the Court of Claims didn't rely on that ground.
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2230.178,2230.598,Yes.
1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2375.052,2380.498,It says nothing about damages or does it?
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2380.498,2381.854,The General Allotment Act?
1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2381.854,2382.567,Yes.
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2382.567,2383.395,No.
1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2398.318,2415.387,"What about the last language or the last sense quoted in the Government's brief where it says that, “If the Government makes a -- conveys in violation of the General Allotment Act, such contract shall be null and void.”"
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2424.654,2429.964,I could not see when you were in dialogue with Government counsel.
1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2537.519,2556.68,"But if the General Allotment Act contemplated only a skeletal type of trust to protect the Indians from the improvident conveyances and specified within it, its own remedy, then that would have a bearing on the outcome of this case."
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2556.68,2559.872,"Well, it might."
1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2577.239,2594.31,"Well, but then you're saying that it's the 1910 Act you're relying on, not the General Allotment Act because you say you don't have to get into the question of whether the General Allotment Act contemplated an elaborate timber management program."
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2594.31,2594.787,That's right.
1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2607.526,2611.767,But then are you relying on the 1910 Act?
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2611.767,2621.955,"I'm -- I'm citing the 1910 Act to you to show that when the question does come up of how wide the trust obligation is, the 1910 Act will help to find that."
1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2673.519,2691.823,"What if the General Allotment Act had said in exactly the same words imposed a trust on the United States, then said, “The exclusive remedy for a breach of this duty by the United States, shall be an action for a rescission.”"
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2691.823,2696.546,"Perhaps, that would govern to the exclusion of an action for damages."
1979.78-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.649,2703.296,"Although, the last sentence of Section 5 refers just to conveyances and contracts."
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2727.66,2728.149,Yes.
1979.78-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2728.149,2736.527,"And in any event, it refers only to contracts and conveyances and part of your claims for breach of trust had nothing to do with the conveyance wherein -- or in --"
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2736.527,2736.844,Well --
1979.78-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.844,2737.54,-- a contract --
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2737.54,2740.769,-- they have to do with the way the conveyance of the timber was carried out.
1979.78-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.769,2745.886,"Well, I know, but the -- the failure to pay interest hasn't got anything to do with that does it?"
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2745.886,2745.993,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.993,2750.6,Or the failure to -- to handle it on sustained-yield basis?
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2756.441,2760.435,The contract is the matrix in which these breaches of trust occurred.
1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2846.714,2851.699,Are all of the respondents here allottees?
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2851.699,2859.123,"They are allottees or successors of allottees, who have a claim that arose while the land was in trust status, yes."
1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2859.123,2863.739,So you don't have to rely on 1505 then?
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2863.739,2864.072,No.
1979.78-1756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3139.501,3147.487,I suppose the Bivens case and last term a Passman case also help you don't they?
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3147.487,3150.065,By holding implied rights of action in the Constitution?
1979.78-1756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3150.065,3150.45,Yes.
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3150.45,3152.328,"Yes, they do."
1979.78-1756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3163.662,3171.302,But you relied on the other case which held that the only jurisdiction was the Takings Clause of the Constitution.
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3171.302,3172.31,"Well, the Jacobs case."
1979.78-1756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3172.31,3172.69,Yes.
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3172.69,3173.99,"Yes, we did rely on that."
1979.78-1756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3173.99,3182.144,"I noticed that the two cases are mentioned, other provisions of the Constitution were held to confer private rights of action."
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3182.144,3190.253,"We also didn't argue the Cort case, C. O. R. T. because we thought our case was -- raise sharper issues."
1979.78-1756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3206.397,3211.981,"Because it's not a mine run, plain vanilla trust, is it?"
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3211.981,3212.207,No.
1979.78-1756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3214.247,3229.585,"Distinction uses the word, trust, but it also provides that there shall be an allotment to individual Indians and it's the individual Indians who have control of the property unlike a mine run trust, where the trust -- where the trustee does."
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3229.585,3232.454,"In the case of farmland, the Indian does have control of the property."
1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3237.813,3244.972,"don't you think that the allottees could insist that they be permitted to operate their own timberland, if they so desired?"
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3244.972,3246.809,"They tried, Your Honor, in 1941."
1979.78-1756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3278.612,3284.122,"That's a Ninth Circuit Case, that's not -- that's a -- a case in this Court is it?"
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3284.122,3286.658,"No, that's true."
1979.78-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3373.935,3379.007,Could I interrupt just a moment?
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3383.876,3383.939,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.78-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3383.939,3389.922,By the way Government puts it -- they say the Court of Claims jurisdictional statute reads right on it.
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3436.342,3437.305,That is so.
1979.78-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3437.305,3439.73,Was that a jurisdictional question or not?
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3439.73,3446.194,I have to confess considerable confusion over the question of whatever sovereign immunity and creation of a cause of action --
1979.78-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3446.194,3450.382,"In sovereign immunity, the Government concedes has been waived by the Tucker Act."
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3450.382,3452.728,"Well, that's not what this Court said in Testan."
1979.78-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3452.728,3456.755,"Well, I -- to Government, the -- well, I don't know."
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3459.772,3459.826,Well --
1979.78-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3459.826,3475.654,"And -- and the -- and I don't know that Testan is -- is any different in that regard, in the Government's argument here that the way that you construe whether the statute with respect to whether or not the cause of action has -- is -- has been granted."
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3493.6,3497.805,"Your Honor, I have a second argument that is just as solid as the first."
1979.78-1756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3499.503,3499.721,Go ahead.
1979.78-1756,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3499.721,3502.956,"-- to it now, and that is the legislative history."
1979.78-1756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3582.351,3586.756,"Mr. Claiborne, do you have something further?"
1979.78-1756,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3586.756,3594.577,"Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, I simply want to suggest that the proposition now put forward is a novel one."
1979.78-1756,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3633.939,3638.365,"Nothing -- nothing terribly unusable about that, is there?"
1979.78-1756,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3652.029,3686.848,"But Mr. Chief Justice, it happens, but it is unusual to discover 100 years later that the Tucker Act, if they're available, has and open to individual Indians, not tribes since then, has now, for the first time, provided a remedy of breach of trust because it happens, it might not have, that the allotment in this case was under the General Allotment Act, if it have been made under the very Treaty of Olympia involved in this case, it would not be a trust allotment, it would be a restricted allotment."
1979.78-1756,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3690.211,3710.251,"Assuming a breach of trust on the theory that the case was brought, what kind of an action -- what kind of remedy would there be for a -- in terms of an accounting?"
1979.78-1756,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3710.251,3723.653,"Mr. Chief Justice, with -- of course, my first answer is that there is a prospective remedy to enjoin the continuation of the breach by the Secretary of the Bureau of Indian Affairs or whoever is violating the statutory duty to --"
1979.78-1756,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3723.653,3728.317,Where would -- where would that be -- why would there be jurisdiction for that kind of action?
1979.78-1756,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3728.317,3744.443,"In -- in the District Courts, under 5 U.S.C. 702, to review and to correct the action of the administrator in violating the statute whether it's called trust or not, is mismanagement of the forest in violation of -- of the statute."
1979.78-1756,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3783.105,3784.693,Would that be restitution?
1979.78-1756,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3784.693,3790.443,"It would in effect, be restitution."
1979.78-1756,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3790.443,3798.586,"At 1 o'clock, we'll hear -- we begin with Boeing Company against Van Gemert."
