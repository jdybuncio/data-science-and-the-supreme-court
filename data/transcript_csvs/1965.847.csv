1965.847,1,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1215.778,1223.276,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.847,2,38875,rafael_hernandez_colon,,3543.28,3545.773,May it please the Court.
1965.847,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4104.116,4108.937,"Mr. Attorney General, what is an American flag school?"
1965.847,2,38875,rafael_hernandez_colon,,4108.937,4121.559,A school that is conducted anywhere where the American flag flies with jurisdiction over the particular area where the flag might fly.
1965.847,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4121.559,4124.138,Where --
1965.847,2,38875,rafael_hernandez_colon,,4124.138,4125.982,"For instance, Guam."
1965.847,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4132.491,4135.88,All -- are all Puerto Rican schools American flag schools?
1965.847,2,38875,rafael_hernandez_colon,,4135.88,4143.568,"Yes, they're all American flag schools because the American flag flies over Puerto Rico."
1965.847,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4143.568,4150.071,"That is not a matter of American money support, is it?"
1965.847,2,38875,rafael_hernandez_colon,,4150.071,4150.22,Not necessarily.
1965.847,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4150.22,4154.221,"For example your school system is supported locally, isn't it?"
1965.847,2,38875,rafael_hernandez_colon,,4154.221,4159.304,"Yes, it is supported locally though we get the grants from the Federal Government also."
1965.847,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4159.304,4161.385,Under the general grant made?
1965.847,2,38875,rafael_hernandez_colon,,4161.385,4161.696,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.847,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4161.696,4162.523,Which you double quote?
1965.847,2,38875,rafael_hernandez_colon,,4162.523,4166.037,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.847,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4457.128,4459.226,Mr. Navins or Avins whatever.
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,4459.226,4466.931,"Avins, Your Honor."
1965.847,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4852.976,4865.606,We'll recess now.
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,4868.67,4871.433,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1965.847,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4897.541,4900.505,You discussed the Treaty -- Treaty Clause to all?
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,4900.505,4901.24,"No, Your Honor."
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5546.665,5553.068,"Then -- I gather then, you would think that reapportionment cases are Washington Monument in that sense."
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,5553.068,5557.441,Well I'm not -- I think Your Honor that they are equal to the Washington Monument.
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5559.761,5563.005,Then Carrington and Rash at least were very comparable.
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,5563.005,5564.77,"I'm sorry I didn't quite understand, Your Honor."
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5564.77,5569.694,"Then Carrington against Rash to be very comparable, I suppose."
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,5569.694,5579.83,Well I -- I take the position of the original standing of the Fourteenth Amendment had nothing whatever to do with what were known in 1866 as political rights.
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5579.83,5583.151,And so Carrington against Rash couldn't be supported under the original --
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,5583.151,5585.608,"Under the original understanding, that is correct Your Honor."
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5585.608,5586.797,Nor the reapportionment cases.
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,5586.797,5588.607,"Nor those, there are others."
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5588.607,5589.792,Nor Classic?
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,5589.792,5590.701,"Pardon, sir?"
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5590.701,5593.087,Nor Classic?
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,5593.087,5613.095,"Well as far as that case is concerned Your Honor, as I understand it, it was an amount of more than one power that was also I believe that power under the -- the power to control Article 1, I believe, Section 2, federal power over the times, places and manners of holding election."
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5622.536,5623.876,Both of those cases.
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,5623.876,5632.348,"Yes Your Honor, let me -- if I may -- if I may raise one point which I don't -- which the Department of Justice raised in its brief but in a different way."
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5695.848,5701.695,Well what about other rights besides political rights that the Fourteenth Amendment excludes.
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,5702.985,5708.496,"Well Your Honor, I -- I want to get into that in terms of the original meaning of equal protection."
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5711.6,5712.062,Alright.
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,5712.062,5715.554,There are -- the Due Process Clause I don't think anybody considers to be relevant.
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6889.945,6897.699,What is your whole view of why they chose this particular form or words to get across this idea?
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,6897.699,6899.747,"Which words, the protection of privileges and immunities."
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6899.747,6901.191,Equal protection of the law.
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,6901.191,6909.716,Equal protection of the laws.Because it seems to me that what was originally intended was clearly protection.
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7010.622,7028.369,But if I take it you think the Equal Protection Clause that were only placed with the words that no states would deny any Christian his civil rights that you'd be expressing the meaning that you were -- that you think Congress intended.
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,7028.369,7031.488,I'm afraid to say that it's narrow even than that.
1965.847,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7152.214,7160.488,But the privileges and immunities were -- the clause was replaced by civil rights.
1965.847,3,15412,alfred_avins,,7165.934,7167.75,It would protect persons.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9017.082,9019.6,May it please the Court.
1965.847,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9544.426,9545.474,Since 1960?
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9545.474,9548.29,Since in 1960.
1965.847,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9552.139,9561.65,Would you -- would you mind stating again very briefly what the Court was -- the exact purpose was of the New York Act?
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9561.65,9575.265,"The New York Act's exact purpose was to promote the participation, the intelligent participation by immigrant groups in American life, both political and economic."
1965.847,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9592.603,9593.901,As of what date is this?
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9593.901,9598.77,"This was as of 1919, 1920, 1921."
1965.847,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9598.793,9606.653,"And at that time there was accompanying this English literacy provision, provision for adult education?"
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9606.653,9607.866,"Yes, there was, Your Honor."
1965.847,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9624.502,9633.358,I was wondering what you would with some of the -- some of the exceptions to the -- to the Act.Let me put it in this language.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9667.312,9671.171,"Well, first this is -- this is part of the argument of course that's been raised in Cardona."
1965.847,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9671.171,9671.626,I beg your pardon.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9671.626,9673.139,It's part of the argument that has been raised in the Cardona case.
1965.847,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9673.139,9679.136,Well I know it's part of the argument but you are defending the Act here.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9679.136,9681.366,I think of course as to the veteran himself.
1965.847,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9681.366,9681.916,I beg your pardon.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9681.916,9683.74,As to the veteran himself.
1965.847,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9709.176,9710.589,I beg your pardon.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9713.236,9714.228,"Yes sir, it's a written test."
1965.847,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9714.228,9714.773,It's a written test.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9714.773,9717.551,It's a written English test.
1965.847,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9772.229,9779.284,"I think that's clearly understandable but how about his wife, how about his parents, how about his children?"
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9779.284,9784.225,"Well, as to the -- as to the -- those were physically disabled --"
1965.847,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9784.225,9785.451,"No, I'm not talking about that."
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9792.979,9794.43,I think as to the wife --
1965.847,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9794.43,9795.101,I beg your pardon.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9795.101,9798.151,-- I think as -- I think I don't -- I'm not sure if it goes to the parents.
1965.847,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,9863.048,9865.036,I think that's federal law.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9865.036,9866.587,That's federal law.
1965.847,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9866.587,9867.732,Yes.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9869.747,9882.81,Our grandfather clause I think was -- is not a true grandfather clause in the first place because the true definition of a grandfather clause is a clause which gives to the grandchildren the rights possessed by the grandparents.
1965.847,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9952.157,9952.979,Yes.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9958.698,9966.631,This I think is what has been usually referred to as a grandfather clause as one which refers to the past.
1965.847,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9980.937,9998.718,"In other context, isn't it commonly called the grandfather clause to permit someone to continue as he has because he was continuing -- he was doing business at the time that the law was established."
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,9998.718,10000.367,Loosely this may be a term that is used.
1965.847,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,10000.376,10001.223,I beg your pardon.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10001.223,10003.123,Loosely this may be the term that is used.
1965.847,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,10259.004,10282.076,"Well, do you think you wouldn't -- are you saying that in the incentive that if the State limits voting rights in order to provide then incentive for some laudable purpose such as economic improvement that that is a violent reason for the limitation of the franchise?"
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10282.076,10301.652,I would say this that it is that the removal -- they do the Congress the removal of the English literacy test by the proponents of the Section 4 (e) in the Senate suggested that the removal of the English literacy test in New York would add an incentive to Puerto Ricans to learn English.
1965.847,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,10396.762,10406.177,The general addressing yourself -- addressing yourself to the theoretical considerations here.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10426.896,10430.181,I would have two answers to that based upon different assumptions.
1965.847,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,10512.152,10527.57,I wouldn't be very clear about this but a flow from that in your opinion that the Congress would have power on your second hypothesis to enact something like 4 (e).
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10527.57,10536.48,I would say it would be under the Fourteenth Amendment because it would be an unreasonable classification.
1965.847,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,10536.48,10539.338,"And therefore, Congress has the power to override it."
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10539.338,10540.348,Yes.
1965.847,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,10540.348,10546.249,It's not merely a matter of the law itself being unconstitutional.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10546.249,10550.019,"No, I think it's an -- it's an unreasonable classification under the law and that is why --"
1965.847,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10550.019,10565.508,"It would be -- it would be a correction, a legislative correction by the national legislative body on acting under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to correct an invidious discrimination imposed by state law, is that right?"
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10570.635,10571.566,Yes.
1965.847,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,10571.566,10589.95,"Well, Mrs. Coon, may I ask, do I correctly infer from what you've said then that there is an area of congressional determination of what constitutes invidious discrimination?"
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10589.95,10603.807,I would say that Congress may experiment in suggesting what Congress feels is an area of discrimination in violation of what is the Equal Protection Clause or of the denial of Privileges and Immunities.
1965.847,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,10611.548,10633.457,"Well that's -- that's to say, we start with the premise, I gather, that Congress makes a determination of a given requirement to adhere the English literacy requirement constitutes invidious discrimination against those who have only Spanish speaking education."
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10635.457,10644.294,Well I don't know that -- of course the preamble of 4 (e) here is that we don't know what Congress started with because there's no legislative history.
1965.847,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,10644.294,10648.16,This is just what I'm trying to get into.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10660.693,10669.032,Well I think I point out the distinction probably between this case and the rest of the Voting Rights Act which arose -- which this Court discussed in the South Carolina case.
1965.847,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,10687.946,10697.037,"Well, does that suggest the presumption against the -- against the determination that this does constitute as invidious discrimination?"
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10697.037,10709.434,"Well, I think that farther confusion here is the fact is -- that the Justice Department itself has based this argument most in the territorial powers and ignored the determination of Congress or the statement of Congress that was under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1965.847,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,10724.032,10728.854,By what -- by what standard do we -- do we review that congressional determination?
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10728.854,10743.261,I think reviewed by the same standard that this Court has applied in many other cases in the past where it is reviewed certain acts -- acts of the State themselves to determine whether or not they violate these provisions in the Constitution.
1965.847,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,10757.075,10758.828,Have we ever done this before?
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10758.828,10760.549,Congress has never done this before.
1965.847,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,10760.549,10764.72,"Well it has done some things like this in other area, doesn't it?"
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10764.72,10767.09,Congress has done it under the Fifteenth Amendment.
1965.847,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,10779.692,10783.405,Then you're suggesting that this case does pose problems I'm afraid they have not seen.
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10798.055,10804.639,I rather point out to this Court something that you said in the South Carolina case that -- which dealt with the Fifteenth Amendment rights.
1965.847,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,10837.532,10847.939,"Well, I think I can understand this if you had to reach the conclusion that this creates no equal protection problem at all, that's one thing."
1965.847,4,29612,jean_m_coon,,10862.119,10874.325,"Well, I think that if Your Honors please that our brief carries in a very definite degree that this is not an equal protection problem posed by this situation."
1965.847,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,10874.325,10876.346,Mr. Solicitor General.
