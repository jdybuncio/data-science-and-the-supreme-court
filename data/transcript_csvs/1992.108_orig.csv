1992.108_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.679,"We'll hear argument next in Number 108 Original, the State of Nebraska v. the States of Wyoming and Colorado."
1992.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,44.879,49.955,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.108_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,368.673,380.06,"Mr. Cook, do you plan to go through the various points seriatim?"
1992.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,392.128,394.569,"That's one issue, and I can get to that right away."
1992.108_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.569,402.113,"Yes, well, just whatever order you want, but it would help me if you could devote a little bit of attention to each one of the issues."
1992.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,402.113,402.574,Right.
1992.108_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,520.77,532.218,The Master's alternate ground for granting summary judgment for Nebraska on the Inland Lakes I think was that there had been a longstanding acquiescence by Wyoming.
1992.108_orig,0,20684,dennis_c_cook,,532.218,535.371,"That is his basis, or one basis."
1992.108_orig,1,25851,gale_norton,,1119.44,1120.983,"That's correct, yes."
1992.108_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1342.258,1343.82,--involved?
1992.108_orig,1,25851,gale_norton,,1343.82,1351.456,We currently have very specific reservation of water under the compact.
1992.108_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1360.364,1361.314,"This is on the Platte and the Laramie, both?"
1992.108_orig,1,25851,gale_norton,,1361.314,1404.601,"--We are concerned essentially here about just the Platte, although broadly speaking, if it were to reopen... there's absolutely no need to reopen the Laramie decree in this case, but we also have great interest on the South Platte as well, and because the Whooping Crane habitat and the habitat of the other endangered bird species is about 230 miles downstream into Nebraska, beyond the confluence of the North Platte and the South Platte, if that were to be opened up to determine what the water needs of Whooping Cranes are, then that would potentially endanger our rights on the South Platte as well."
1992.108_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1452.322,1456.626,Do you want us to deny all three of the additional counts that Nebraska wants to add?
1992.108_orig,1,25851,gale_norton,,1457.925,1467.532,"We would like to... if I understand your question, we would like to see that there is no modification to reopen the petition."
1992.108_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.18,1478.97,What is Nebraska to do about these grievances?
1992.108_orig,1,25851,gale_norton,,1484.413,1486.717,--If there is a--
1992.108_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1486.717,1488.597,"I mean, you can't run away from it entirely."
1992.108_orig,1,25851,gale_norton,,1492.77,1503.596,--It is not necessary at all for an interstate water decree to be adjusted because there are increased needs in one of the downstream States.
1992.108_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1505.717,1507.249,"Well, that's a merits question."
1992.108_orig,1,25851,gale_norton,,1518.176,1519.237,Yes.
1992.108_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1519.237,1523.169,"Now you're telling me not only should the amendments not be allowed, but these claims are not bringable."
1992.108_orig,1,25851,gale_norton,,1531.765,1548.526,"The proper way to address these issues, if they were to be addressed, would be through a modification of the decree through a petition by this Court meeting the standards for a new, equitable apportionment in front of this Court."
1992.108_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1631.08,1632.6,"Thank you, Ms. Norton."
1992.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,1634.932,1642.467,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1992.108_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1905.859,1909.551,How... this is what I don't understand.
1992.108_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,1926.404,1930.455,The decree apportioned the direct flows at Tri-State--
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2544.73,2555.7,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.108_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.159,2641.675,"Well, yes, but your first argument is that even if it had raised it, whenever, they should lose."
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2641.675,2643.836,"That's right, but even to the extent--"
1992.108_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.836,2645.056,"Well, I know, but what--"
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2645.056,2645.817,--That they might contest that--
1992.108_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2645.817,2659.575,--Don't pass over so quickly what you say is an inviolable right of the Bureau of Reclamation to put into this canal the nonirrigation system flows.
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2659.575,2661.988,"--Why, I certainly don't mean to pass over it too quickly."
1992.108_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.988,2663.549,"Well, you have pretty quickly."
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2674.996,2675.627,Yes.
1992.108_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.038,2677.297,"For which, what?"
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2677.297,2678.048,--When the project--
1992.108_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2678.048,2682.381,For which they had a permit from Wyoming.
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2682.381,2683.481,--That is correct.
1992.108_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2700.964,2702.775,When were the Inland Lakes constructed?
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2702.775,2706.378,They were constructed between 1904 and 1913.
1992.108_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.508,2725.181,"And did Wyoming ever say that if the Inland Lakes was actually part of the project, that the--"
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2725.181,2728.143,--They'd be covered by the permit... yes.
1992.108_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2756.84,2761.574,--The 1934 proceedings being those which led to the 1945 decree.
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2761.574,2762.185,That is correct.
1992.108_orig,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2774.534,2779.295,"Why do you think the early... or, decree never mentioned them at all?"
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2779.295,2782.438,"Well, the decree does not mention a good number of things."
1992.108_orig,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2812.277,2820.333,"Yes, but the other side says that it's not a matter of just being silent about it, that Article IV of the decree seemingly excludes it."
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2820.333,2826.176,"No, it certainly does not expressly exclude it, and Article IV of the decree does something quite different."
1992.108_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2951.299,2960.513,What about the provision in the 1955... was it '55 or '57 Laramie River decree?
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2960.513,2960.914,Yes.
1992.108_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2972.951,2975.074,"I understand that, but what did the 1955 decree say?"
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2975.074,2983.309,"--I believe it said, just in general terms, that all the water is divided between those two States, but that has to be read in light of this Court's decision in 1945."
1992.108_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2983.309,2984.07,"Well, what did that mean?"
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2994.616,2995.978,I don't think it said it in quite that broad of terms.
1992.108_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2998.54,2999.289,"Well, what did it say?"
1992.108_orig,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2999.289,3005.202,"--I don't have the exact words before me, but I think it could just as easily have been read to state that this is conditioned upon the--"
1992.108_orig,4,20684,dennis_c_cook,,3474.29,3478.365,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.108_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3531.658,3545.617,But he thinks the... he thinks the original decree contemplated that the Laramie would contribute to the flow of the North Platte.
1992.108_orig,4,20684,dennis_c_cook,,3545.617,3558.367,"--Well, he suggests that, Your Honor, but if there's no restriction on Wyoming's use, and no apportionment to Nebraska, then the trigger needs to be pulled and say there's no violation of the decree by those proposed uses."
1992.108_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3559.796,3567.92,So you think the upstream States... Wyoming and Colorado... are entitled to any of the water that is flowing in the Laramie River.
1992.108_orig,4,20684,dennis_c_cook,,3567.92,3579.778,"--Until Nebraska obtains an apportionment, and we suggest that if they try to do that they will be relitigating a factual matter that's already been put to rest in this case."
1992.108_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3584.914,3592.068,"Well, on that basis, the Deer Creek issue becomes moot."
1992.108_orig,4,20684,dennis_c_cook,,3592.068,3597.51,"--Well, that's our... the Laramie River issues are not the Deer Creek issue, Your Honor."
