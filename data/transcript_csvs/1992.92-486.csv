1992.92-486,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.887,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-486, United States and Federal Communications Commission v. the Edge Broadcasting Company."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,61.228,71.691,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-486,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.955,186.13,"Mr. Larkin, under a First Amendment analysis in commercial speech cases when we apply Central Hudson do we look case-by-case at an as-applied challenge or do we simply look to whether the Central Hudson test is met and it's a reasonable response to the overall problem?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,192.534,205.653,"Your Honor, the as-applied type of challenge that I think the court contemplated under the commercial speech basis is a challenge that would go to show that a particular broadcast in this case should not properly be treated as commercial speech."
1992.92-486,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,222.708,242.247,"But as applied here insofar as it addresses the problem of a commercial advertisement, do we look at some case-by-case approach and say well, look, in this case it's so close to the border it's ridiculous as applied to Edge?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,242.247,243.106,"No, Your Honor, you don't."
1992.92-486,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.369,253.712,"I'm not sure the precedent is all that clear, so I'm interested to hear your response."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,253.712,259.255,--In the case of Ward v. Rock Against Racism this Court addressed a similar argument.
1992.92-486,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,337.038,339.301,So we just apply Central Hudson?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,339.301,339.942,Correct.
1992.92-486,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,345.893,351.703,"Well, do we have to ask for instance whether there is a substantial Government interest in, in what?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,357.951,360.872,I wouldn't say it's from knowing about what goes on in Virginia.
1992.92-486,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.086,380.722,What is North Carolina's goal insofar as it deals with commercial speech about something going on lawfully in Virginia?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,380.722,384.675,--North Carolina's interest in not having its citizens participate in gambling.
1992.92-486,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.279,398.387,Even in another state where it's lawful?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,398.387,401.355,--Even in another state where it's lawful because they bring the problems back home.
1992.92-486,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,429.858,437.31,"But certainly the people in North Carolina can hear ads in a Virginia licensed station, can't they?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,437.31,449.117,"--If they are in a community that is close to the border and if the border state has a lottery, as it does here, and the broadcast airwaves cross state lines, as they do, that can happen."
1992.92-486,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,464.735,475.247,"Do we know how far these licenses typically allow, I mean how large a geographic area the broadcast reaches typically?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,475.247,484.118,"Well, I'm told by the FCC that on average there is a 50-mile radius for broadcast lottery, for broadcasters."
1992.92-486,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,489.444,495.567,Was it a condition of licensure that the transmitter be located in North Carolina?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,495.567,502.891,"No, it was not a condition, and in fact you can have your transmitter located in a different state."
1992.92-486,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,508.139,514.746,"Why do we know that this is a North Carolina station, because of where its principal office is located or where its transmitter is located?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,514.746,516.152,That's where it's licensed to.
1992.92-486,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,579.297,581.532,Just one more question of a preliminary nature.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,588.247,592.511,You can be licensed to serve an area that includes more than one state.
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,592.511,596.323,"I'm a little puzzled by that, Mr. Larkin."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,605.13,618.75,"Well, they have set up their transmitter north of Elizabeth City so that it is close, it is about, you could say midway on a map between Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Elizabeth City."
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,628.122,640.961,"But is it not true that... how much magic is there in the words licensed to Elizabeth City when, as I understand it, Elizabeth City represents only 4 or 5 percent of their total audience, of the total market?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,640.961,643.693,"I think the actual number is 8 percent, but I'm not going to quibble about the numbers."
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,643.693,645.568,"8 percent, whatever."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,645.568,645.787,If that--
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,645.787,649.379,Are they unlicensed to serve the 92 other percent of their audience?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,649.379,656.579,"--Well, if you want to put it that way it's fine because the way the scheme works is to focus on where you license the service."
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,661.92,665.138,In other words they are mandated to serve that Elizabeth City.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,676.992,677.758,--Yes.
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,677.758,679.288,It is totally irrelevant?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,679.288,679.945,Yes.
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,679.945,690.69,"Even though they have, I guess they have a First Amendment right to transmit it as long as there's no statutory objection to an audience that, you could pose to a lot of people who want to buy lottery tickets in Virginia."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,690.69,692.097,"Well, that's what we're here to decide."
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,706.077,714.103,"Well, that's not an unavoidable... I suppose the license restriction could say your signal shall be no stronger than is necessary to serve the area for which you're specifically licensed."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,737.329,740.171,"--Your Honor, the reason I disagree is you use the term authorized."
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,750.152,759.086,"But is it not true that if their broadcasting into Virginia interfered with the signals of other, of Virginia stations in Virginia they would then be subject to some kind of restriction from the FCC?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,759.086,759.992,Yes.
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,761.241,767.02,"So they are, they are authorized in the sense that the license allows them to do that without any Federal objection."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,767.02,768.505,"--Well, for different purposes."
1992.92-486,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,785.716,796.555,"Is the licensee, is the license conditioned on obeying governing Federal statutes relating to, such as the one we've got before us?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,796.555,797.133,Absolutely.
1992.92-486,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.101,807.129,"So this station clearly is not authorized to broadcast gambling information to, from where it is."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,807.129,807.737,--That's right.
1992.92-486,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,817.828,828.62,"Mr. Larkin, I didn't, I guess I knew but I had forgotten that you didn't have to have your transmitter located within the community that you're licensed to serve."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,883.707,888.299,"Yes, that's my understanding, that you could have a situation in the way you posit it."
1992.92-486,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,912.962,918.958,Is it often true that you're licensed to a community that contains only 4 to 5 percent of your listening audience?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,921.364,922.02,Often?
1992.92-486,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,957.725,958.317,Or vice versa.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,972.889,974.624,I think I have been through it but I haven't stopped off.
1992.92-486,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1066.666,1069.242,You don't even need to reach Central Hudson?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1069.242,1070.663,Correct.
1992.92-486,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.52,1077.91,Yes.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1077.91,1085.408,"You would say that this activity should be treated in the same way as illegal activity, and we know from the Pittsburgh Press case and Central Hudson that that wouldn't be protected."
1992.92-486,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1085.814,1094.654,"So, even if we didn't disagree with you on that, even if we didn't agree with you on that you would say Central Hudson is satisfied?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1094.654,1095.217,--Correct.
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.09,1105.12,"May I ask you about this lesser includes the, or greater includes the lesser?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1110.288,1113.802,"No, I don't think they can prohibit interstate travel in this region."
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.584,1117.503,Just can they prohibit them from buying lottery tickets?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1123.72,1125.017,"--Well, it depends whether they brought them back to North Carolina."
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.84,1140.246,Even by its own citizens?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1140.246,1141.199,By its own citizens.
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1141.199,1146.868,But then how does it get the authority to prevent its own citizens to hear about the lottery that's available in Virginia?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1146.868,1148.491,"Well, because they bring the harm back with them."
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.366,1149.694,No.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1149.694,1153.021,--If State A makes it a crime to drink alcohol and State B doesn't--
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1153.021,1154.646,But I'm just... let's talk about lotteries only.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1154.646,1155.083,--Okay.
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1155.083,1161.143,"What, how can North Carolina prevent its citizens from buying lottery tickets in Virginia?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1178.699,1185.102,"They can't prohibit them from travelling to North Carolina to purchase a ticket, excuse me, to Virginia to purchase a ticket--"
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1185.102,1188.568,But then how can they prohibit advertising designed to encourage them to travel to Virginia and buy them?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1188.568,1195.8,--Because North Carolina and Congress together can prohibit interstate transportation of lottery tickets and other items that would--
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1195.8,1198.643,"No, no, I'm not... my example doesn't involve any interstate transportation of lottery tickets."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1212.342,1218.417,"--Well, but Congress can prohibit the Virginia lottery from operating if it believes that the interests of a state like North--"
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1218.417,1218.73,But it hasn't.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1218.73,1221.291,"--But it can, and that's our argument."
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.835,1233.442,But can Congress prohibit North Carolina citizens from patronizing the Virginia lottery or say only Virginia citizens may patronize the Virginia lottery?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1233.442,1240.735,"--Well, I don't think Congress can achieve the greater in that way, but they can achieve the greater by prohibiting Virginia from having a lottery."
1992.92-486,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1249.42,1260.12,"And by the way, North Carolina doesn't purport to forbid its citizens from listening to lottery ads from Virginia stations."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1262.164,1263.226,They couldn't.
1992.92-486,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1263.226,1264.21,"--No, they couldn't."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1264.898,1265.601,They don't have that power.
1992.92-486,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1265.601,1270.785,--Its citizens can listen to lottery ads from Virginia stations all they want to.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1270.785,1273.629,"Well, that... North Carolina lacks that power."
1992.92-486,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1275.643,1280.282,"Well, I know, but North Carolina doesn't purport to keep its citizens from--"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1280.282,1280.767,That's right.
1992.92-486,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1291.763,1299.118,"--And under your submission, I take it, the Congress of the United States could forbid a North Carolina newspaper from running a Virginia lottery ad?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1299.118,1303.429,If it were sent through the mails.
1992.92-486,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1303.429,1305.255,"No, no."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1316.283,1326.7,"Well, I'm not sure that if you simply had a distribution that didn't affect interstate commerce in anyway--"
1992.92-486,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1326.7,1337.898,Just accept my hypo... I'm trying to explore whether or not your position is based on your powers over an FCC licensee as opposed to any other media of communication.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1337.898,1348.191,"--Well, what I'm... my argument from Congress' power is based on its combined powers to regulate interstate commerce dealing with the broadcast spectrum as well as the use of the mails."
1992.92-486,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1348.191,1348.644,All right.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1355.111,1364.59,"Well, the newspaper would not be in a different position than someone who just printed up his own handbill, and Congress wouldn't have the authority simply to say that you can't print up a handbill at--"
1992.92-486,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1364.59,1369.214,This is an interstate paper that buys its paper in interstate commerce.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1369.214,1379.46,"--Well, I don't think that you could prohibit someone from running general stories about what is a legal activity in another state."
1992.92-486,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1379.46,1380.506,My question was advertisements.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1380.506,1382.255,"Well, I'm not sure."
1992.92-486,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1383.661,1396.796,"You're not sure whether a state that prohibits prostitution, for example, can ban advertising of houses of prostitution across the border in another state?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1408.433,1411.26,"--Well, Congress certainly can."
1992.92-486,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.491,1418.006,"Oh, I see."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1425.145,1427.237,That's what I've been thinking about and trying to focus on.
1992.92-486,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.237,1427.581,I see.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1427.581,1436.343,"But turning to the First Amendment part of it, we think that the Central Hudson test, as I said, is sufficiently flexible that it allows this sort of approach that we have here to be undertaken."
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1438.217,1441.653,"Mr. Larkin, may I just pursue Justice Kennedy's point one step further to get it sharp?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1453.101,1457.74,--I think if it's illegal in North Carolina--
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.74,1463.145,"It's illegal in North Carolina, but it's not illegal for the citizens, as I understand you, to go across the border and buy the tickets."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1472.626,1473.079,--No.
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.374,1480.732,But it's advertising activity that's legal where it's performed.
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1480.732,1481.841,That's right.
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1481.841,1483.341,And you think they can--
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1483.341,1483.981,Yes.
1992.92-486,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1504.519,1504.878,--Why?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1507.987,1512.252,It's an activity that in a perfect world would not be conducted at all.
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.85,1576.771,"Mr. Larkin, how do we know it's reasonable as a general matter?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1583.722,1587.658,--It is reasonable because you are licensed to serve a community.
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1589.985,1593.749,"So we may assume that this is a typical station, and you would still defend it?"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1593.749,1595.654,"Well, if it were--"
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1595.654,1595.92,Is that right?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1595.92,1596.279,--Yes.
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.293,1601.276,"So this is characteristic of the program, and we can justify--"
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1601.276,1601.948,"No, no, that's not true."
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1603.791,1606.525,"--Why, how... you have not proved that it's not characteristic of a program."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1606.525,1607.744,--Nor have they.
1992.92-486,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1609.117,1613.022,And who... then the question comes who has the burden of showing this is or is not typical?
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1613.022,1616.349,"--Well, that question I don't think arises under Central Hudson."
1992.92-486,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1621.363,1623.736,"Well, all statutes are presumed to be constitutional."
1992.92-486,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1636.481,1640.245,--It is their burden to show that this is protected speech.
1992.92-486,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1645.353,1648.085,"Very well, Mr. Larkin."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1649.21,1665.314,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.501,1712.653,"Well, I take it that as applied to some other stations in North Carolina you wouldn't have any objection?"
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1712.653,1717.621,"We have not, we have challenged this statute only as applied to Edge."
1992.92-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1719.87,1726.46,I suppose that there are probably people who listen most of the time to the Edge station.
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1726.46,1730.349,"--Your Honor, the record does not establish that."
1992.92-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1730.349,1751.998,"Well, I would suppose it wouldn't be in business if it didn't have an audience, and if that, if the audience that listens to Edge stations, the station, can't hear lottery ads on that station, why it certainly to that extent serves the interest that the statute has in mind."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1751.998,1759.728,I would respectfully differ and note that what we established in the brief was that the dominant medium was television.
1992.92-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1772.77,1792.918,"Yes, but as long as somebody is listening to Edge, and if Edge is forbidden from carrying lottery ads, as long as somebody is listening to Edge station it is not going to hear lottery ads, and that would go for all stations in North Carolina."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1802.68,1814.285,--I would respectfully differ by saying that it doesn't serve the purpose of the statute if they're getting the same advertisements every day overwhelmingly through other dominant medium.
1992.92-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1814.285,1818.876,"Well, not if they don't listen to the Virginia stations, they won't get it."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1818.876,1821.236,"Well, that would be indeed a factual question."
1992.92-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1837.775,1845.834,"Nevertheless, as long as they're listening to North Carolina stations they're not going to be listening to ads."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1845.834,1851.847,"--Justice White, your point is well taken that as long as someone listens only to our station they would get no lottery--"
1992.92-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.847,1855.737,Or even while they're listening to those stations they are not listening to ads.
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1855.737,1857.439,"--Well, that would certainly be true."
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1898.095,1909.965,"Well, but by hypothesis, Mr. Shumadine, if lotteries are willing to advertise on the Edge station they must think they're going to get some added patronage from so advertising."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1909.965,1914.587,"--Your Honor, I don't know that there is any, that that--"
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1914.587,1917.289,"Well, why would they want to advertise otherwise?"
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1917.289,1928.191,--Generally... they certainly would want to spread their advertising over as many media as possible with the view that that gives them possibly some type of larger audience.
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1939.36,1951.276,"Almost by fourth grade addition, I would think, you could prove there would be a greater quantity of advertisements if one additional station is now permitted to carry advertisements that wasn't before."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1951.276,1958.101,"--That I would respectfully submit is not correct, Your Honor, because advertising budgets are traditionally fixed."
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1975.391,1983.514,"So if they, if they decide to advertise on the Edge broadcast because of effectiveness, obviously they are reaching some people that they wouldn't otherwise."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1983.514,1988.073,Whether they're reaching people they would not--
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1988.073,1989.978,"Well, you say that's what they set out to do."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1991.322,1992.306,--They would like to.
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1992.306,1992.885,--Wait a minute.
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,1994.836,1995.211,"Yes, sir."
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1995.211,2002.067,I think you said a moment ago that advertisers budget on the basis of effectiveness.
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2012.673,2017.202,"Your Honor, I think it's true they think they are getting something for their money."
1992.92-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.464,2029.15,Well why would they pay for it then?
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2029.15,2046.285,"--Well, the fact that they want to have as many stations as possible carry the message does not necessarily mean that more people are going to get the message in any real sense."
1992.92-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2058.388,2064.996,It's also not hard to imagine that there are a lot of law abiding citizens in North Carolina who don't believe in gambling.
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2095.264,2105.152,"Well, Your Honor, what's wrong with it is the fact that every other station is carrying exactly the same message."
1992.92-486,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2105.152,2106.447,But they are not licensed to that community.
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2133.359,2142.824,"Well, it's unreasonable because it does not, it's not effective in promoting any governmental interest if you just shut one person up."
1992.92-486,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.76,2152.928,"It meets the interest of making a licensee who is licensed to serve the particular needs of that community, as others are not, serve those needs."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2162.596,2187.025,"--Your Honor, I do not believe that simply by accepting an FCC license that we leave our First Amendment rights at the door or that we are prohibited from broadcasting that which everyone else is hearing and everyone else is carrying simply because we are licensed, especially where the economic effect is to deprive the station of the ability to really provide effective service."
1992.92-486,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2187.025,2188.617,"Well, Mr. Shumadine--"
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2188.617,2189.398,"Yes, ma'am."
1992.92-486,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2189.398,2192.6,--What test do we apply here?
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2193.786,2194.692,"Yes, ma'am."
1992.92-486,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2194.692,2205.578,And if we apply Central Hudson why do we care whether this particular community may broadcast to a lot of folks in Virginia?
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2221.025,2233.879,"Justice O'Connor, I believe that you look at it to directly advance... Central Hudson uses the term directly advance, which in my mind is an empirically-based test that does not relate to the nation."
1992.92-486,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2233.879,2238.065,"Well, I would think maybe it is."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2249.077,2250.592,There would be two.
1992.92-486,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2301.462,2316.018,How do you distinguish the Government's citation of Ward v. Rock Against Racism and its argument that the validity of the statute depends on the relation it bears to the overall problem the Government seeks to correct?
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2316.018,2325.578,"That was dealing with the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test which does have, where the Ward v. Rock Against Racism analysis has some meaning."
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2379.898,2384.007,"Well, Mr. Shumadine, in SUNY wasn't that a dormitory regulation?"
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2408.215,2419.79,"Well, Your Honor, it would seem to me plain that in reading SUNY, and that was what the district judge did because it came out immediately prior to our decision, he read it very carefully."
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2457.899,2462.303,You think the burden is on the Government to show that the scheme is effective?
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2462.303,2469.769,"--It seems to me if the, as this Court has said, the test is directly advanced."
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2493.181,2508.363,Then you're saying that the Government in every case where something is challenged on a First Amendment basis must offer empirical evidence that the statute is effective for its purpose?
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2508.363,2515.749,"--Yes, sir, I would believe that once you established that the speech is protected, that it is lawful, and that it--"
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2515.749,2526.668,What case do you think supports the proposition that the Government must offer empirical evidence so that you have an actual factual determination?
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2526.668,2543.051,"--Well, Your Honor, I would believe that if SUNY was sent back for factual findings, and it would seem to me that that is plainly a direction to the trial court to take evidence and to make the type of record we have in this case."
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2543.051,2545.816,You would say SUNY then supports the proposition?
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2545.816,2546.222,"Yes, sir."
1992.92-486,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2559.263,2571.04,"Mr. Shumadine, empiricism meaning if I'm doing no more harm than other people are doing you can't really discern my contribution to the harm being done, therefore you can't stop me?"
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2599.904,2606.042,"Well, it... I would not, I do not think I would be making that argument under those circumstances."
1992.92-486,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.042,2606.292,Why?
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2606.292,2635.109,"If you, let me just... the reason is, the difference is if you said everyone in Elizabeth City except one could advertise prostitution I would be here making the very same argument today, and especially if I demonstrated that by everybody but one advertising that the effect, that there was going to be no incremental effect to banning one speaker from saying that which every other speaker in the world was saying."
1992.92-486,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2651.118,2663.035,"So you would say the same thing if this case involved prostitution or drug use or anything else, so long as there were stations outside of North Carolina that can get that same message to the individuals?"
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2667.33,2690.056,--I would say that if in the area where the message was being received we were overlapped by every other station carrying the same message that there would be no constitutional interest in suppressing our station's speech because the governmental interest would not be directly advanced by shutting up one speaker.
1992.92-486,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2737.24,2737.959,Why do you say everybody else except one?
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2748.797,2756.434,"--I'm not aware of any other station that would have the type of overlap that we do, Your Honor."
1992.92-486,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2762.245,2764.322,Elizabeth City gets no other North Carolina station?
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2764.322,2769.914,--I'm sure they may... the other North Carolina stations may well cover areas that we do not cover--
1992.92-486,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.914,2770.523,"No, I understand that."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2780.159,2799.996,"--I would think so, although my expectation is in thinking about the market as I know it is these markets generally run around the big metropolitan areas, so that the Norfolk-Portsmouth-Virginia Beach market, which includes Edge, covers that area of North Carolina."
1992.92-486,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2805.714,2819.645,"But you're not really saying that you are the only, the only broadcast station that is in operation reaching Elizabeth City that cannot advertise lotteries?"
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2819.645,2821.487,"No, sir, I did not intend to say that."
1992.92-486,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2821.487,2826.283,"Mr. Shumadine, let me go back to Central Hudson if I may and make sure I understand your argument."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2834.17,2840.637,"We have not submitted based on the fourth prong, even though we have raised the fourth prong."
1992.92-486,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2863.018,2864.065,"Yes, I think I understand you."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2879.948,2892.412,"--Well, Your Honor, if I were going to argue that my position would be that any bright line test has a great deal of difficulty with being narrowly tailored, and that if you really were going to do it in a narrow tailoring fashion--"
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2892.412,2897.224,"We'll resume there at 1 o'clock, Mr. Shumadine."
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2897.224,2913.03,"Mr. Shumadine, you may resume."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2913.03,2934.286,"Justice Souter, as I remember your question it was asking about the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test, and I was starting to reply to say that it would obviously be more rational and more effective to utilize the audience served as opposed to the station of license."
1992.92-486,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2958.948,2966.507,"Well, that's true, but the fourth prong simply requires that the regulation not be more extensive."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,2968.632,2979.706,I think it is to the extent that it picks up stations like Edge where it has no effect or it doesn't accomplish any governmental purpose.
1992.92-486,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2979.706,2981.642,"Well, I think this gets back to Justice White's colloquy."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,3031.872,3054.832,"I have conceded that my primary argument is that it is ineffective, but if you were to, as I read the Discovery Network case that just came down 2 weeks ago, I believe even there that statute was effective as to about 100 out of the 3,000, or 169 out of the 3,000 new racks, and that still was a poor fit."
1992.92-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3060.58,3087.989,"Yes, but it's only marginal because you're just talking about Edge, and if you talk about all the stations in North Carolina that are not permitted to carry these ads, why surely there's quite a direct service to the Government interest in protecting the interests of North Carolina."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,3087.989,3102.421,"Your Honor, we have not challenged the application of the statute as it applies in other areas where you do not have the particular type of overlap that we are talking about here."
1992.92-486,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3108.341,3112.73,"Well, that gets you back to Justice O'Connor's earlier question."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,3115.729,3123.849,"I believe it is, Your Honor, and it's certainly the way that this Court has always approached constitutional questions."
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3169.238,3188.214,"But haven't we said, Mr. Shumadine, that when we're talking about commercial speech the legislature can enact a prophylactic rule which it couldn't in connection with straight First Amendment speech that may reach out a little more broadly than you could in First Amendment orthodox?"
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,3188.214,3193.089,In a facial challenge this Court has said that it defers to a legislative judgment.
1992.92-486,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.722,3226.059,"Do you think in a commercial speech case that if a plaintiff can show that there is one in his particular example, the thing does not satisfy the four prongs, even though it does in 99 percent of the other cases, that litigant can have that statute struck down as to him?"
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,3226.059,3227.964,"That would be my belief, yes."

1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,3280.911,3285.191,"--Your Honor, I don't know whether that type of test would work."
1992.92-486,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3288.61,3298.576,"Well, I thought your submission was that if the statute does not serve the interest in the particular case, that that particular litigant can challenge it."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,3298.576,3309.197,"--I did make that submission, and the only reason I did not endorse that example is that I think you would have to look at all of the facts in a record to see whether it was effective."
1992.92-486,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3333.452,3375.935,"Mr. Shumadine, it seems to me although you emphasize in answering Justice Kennedy's question the particularity of the exception that you're arguing for, at least in the context of FCC licensing if we accepted your argument it would be a very broad exception because you in effect would be saying that only, that this particular regulation would be enforceable only with respect to broadcasters over a geographical area which do not receive, as it were, the forbidden broadcasts from outside and which do not in turn broadcast to a substantial audience outside the area in which the activity is forbidden."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,3389.289,3392.242,"That is not our submission, Your Honor."
1992.92-486,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3404.455,3407.813,"Well, let's assume you've got 92 percent effectiveness."
1992.92-486,1,20158,conrad_moss_shumadine,,3412.374,3415.935,"--No, Your Honor, I don't concede 8 percent."

1992.92-486,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3424.666,3427.681,"Your Honor, I have nothing further to add unless the Court has any further questions."
1992.92-486,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3427.681,3450.031,"Is part of your submission, Mr. Larkin, that there is a waiver, an estoppel aspect to this case, to speak in loose terms, that this licensee really submitted itself to the jurisdiction of North Carolina and is stuck by its license, or does that drop out of the case and this is simply a case in which you win under Central Hudson?"
1992.92-486,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,3450.031,3453.78,We don't make an estoppel or a waiver type of argument.
