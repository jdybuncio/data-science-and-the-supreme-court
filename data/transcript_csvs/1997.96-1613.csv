1997.96-1613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.184,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-1613, United States v. The Estate of Francis Romani."
1997.96-1613,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,71.111,77.422,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,124.232,127.996,"Well, the statute is different in this respect."
1997.96-1613,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,166.481,174.602,When Congress enacted that provision in 1982 they said it was a formal change of language that was not intended to change the scope of the statute.
1997.96-1613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,174.602,176.337,But the language still is different.
1997.96-1613,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,176.337,177.071,The language is--
1997.96-1613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,177.071,178.367,"One is claim, and the other is debt."
1997.96-1613,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,178.367,183.319,"--The language is different, but Congress didn't intend it to have a different meaning, but moreover--"
1997.96-1613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,183.319,184.067,How do you know that?
1997.96-1613,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,184.067,185.801,--That's... the legislative history--
1997.96-1613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.801,189.346,"Well, but, you know we don't always pay a lot of attention to legislative history."
1997.96-1613,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,189.346,207.152,"--It's... you may not always pay a lot of attention to it, but in the context where a change has been made to words, and the question is whether that changed the meaning of the statute, it's appropriate to look to the legislative history, especially when Congress says in that history, we're not changing the meaning."
1997.96-1613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,209.449,211.197,A committee says in that regard.
1997.96-1613,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,211.197,211.572,--That's correct.
1997.96-1613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,234.187,241.56,"Well then, what's the point of 6321 and 6323(a), which deal specifically with tax liens?"
1997.96-1613,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,241.56,244.012,"Yes, that's indeed the ultimate question in the case."
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,1664.113,1667.22,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1613,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.428,1934.736,"Counsel, what's your best case for support of your position that the judgment lien comes before the Government's right under 3713?"
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,1936.829,1940.718,"--You mean ahead, Your Honor, in terms of whether the lien survives?"
1997.96-1613,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1958.93,1970.409,"Well, is the judgment lien situation different somehow from a mortgage or other type of secured interest where possession changes, or title, or--"
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,1970.409,1985.841,"I think not, Your Honor, and this Court itself in Rankin & Schatzell v. Scott said that a judgment lien has the same power as the mortgage to hold the land, and if we look at these early cases--"
1997.96-1613,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1985.841,1992.886,"--We... the court below didn't really get into the question of the nature of the judgment lien here, did it?"
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,1992.886,1993.37,"--No, it did not, Your Honor."
1997.96-1613,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1993.37,1997.039,So we don't actually know the nature of it here.
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,1997.039,2008.737,"Well, we know that it was a judgment lien that was definite with respect to the identity of the judgment creditor, the amount of the judgment, and that it was immediately enforceable."
1997.96-1613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2010.237,2012.939,Did it apply to all property in the State of Pennsylvania?
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2012.939,2013.486,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1997.96-1613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2013.486,2015.891,Did it apply to all property in the State of Pennsylvania--
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2015.891,2016.376,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-1613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2017.001,2018.203,--or just a particular county--
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2018.203,2031.557,"--only to property located within Cambria County, which is the county where the judgment was entered, indexed, and was immediately enforceable, and there was only one parcel of property in Cambria County which was owned by the debtor."
1997.96-1613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2031.557,2034.431,--But there was nothing to make it more specific than that.
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2036.509,2038.118,"There was nothing that need make it more specific than that, Your Honor."
1997.96-1613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2061.904,2079.085,"--Well, except the suggestion is that a mortgage is specific as to property, and that judgment liens are not, and whether or not this Court can get into State lien law as to what's specific and what's general is certainly problematic, but that's the suggestion."
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2079.085,2085.708,"--Well, Your Honor, when they say that the mortgage is more specific, are we looking at the nature of the mortgage, or are we talking just about parcels?"
1997.96-1613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2098.812,2099.171,"Well, but--"
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2099.171,2100.311,"--the amount of the lien, and the property."
1997.96-1613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2100.311,2103.919,--It seems to me unlikely we're going to base our holding on that.
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2111.931,2119.741,"No, Your Honor, it would not apply to any property located in other counties unless that judgment were taken to those counties and indexed."
1997.96-1613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2119.741,2125.786,"But under your submission if you file it in every county, then your lien is good in every county."
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2125.786,2137.797,"In every county... if you take that judgment and enter it according to State law, it is good in any county in which real property is located, and that lien has sufficient capacity to bind the land."
1997.96-1613,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.701,2237.226,"Mr. McCartan, if I understand your position correctly you're not asserting that just the entry of the judgment would have been sufficient to overcome the Government's claim here."
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2243.302,2243.849,That is correct.
1997.96-1613,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2243.849,2246.661,--by recording it in... as against particular property?
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2246.661,2247.677,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1613,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.677,2262.983,"In Arizona, where I practiced, if you got a judgment you would have to take a... get a certified copy of the judgment from the clerk of the court and take it to the county recorder, and the county recorder would record it the same way it would record a mortgage."
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2265.546,2277.541,"That's the way Pennsylvania works, Your Honor, and at that point, that lien is immediately enforceable without any further judicial proceedings of any kind, as was the case in United States/Texas, a case on which the Government relies here."
1997.96-1613,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2375.095,2385.715,"Well, we've applied, I think, a higher standard in justifying any displacement of section 3713."
1997.96-1613,1,38147,patrick_f_mccartan,,2394.774,2405.865,"Well, when you say a higher standard, Your Honor, I assume that you are referring to the test in United States v. Key, where the Court set forth a threepart test--"
1997.96-1613,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3386.765,3387.529,Thank you.
1997.96-1613,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3445.351,3449.772,"Mr. McCartan's point, as I recall, was that the lien in that case was not perfected."
1997.96-1613,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3452.082,3466.765,"He's confusing something that this Court has made clear shouldn't be confused, and that is the standards for specificity under the Federal Tax Lien Act, as contrasted with the standards for specificity under the absolute priority statute."
1997.96-1613,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3501.017,3502.329,"Well, why should they be different?"
1997.96-1613,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3502.329,3513.559,"--They are different because the statutes have different scopes and application, which this Court has clearly held in at least two cases this century."
1997.96-1613,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3513.559,3518.962,"Is it... was the distinction, or they're saying they're different based on the difference in language in the statutes?"
1997.96-1613,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3518.962,3522.821,"And the statute's objectives, yes."
1997.96-1613,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3618.656,3619.822,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
