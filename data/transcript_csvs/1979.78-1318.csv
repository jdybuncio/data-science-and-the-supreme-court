1979.78-1318,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.427,We will hear arguments first this morning in O'Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center.
1979.78-1318,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,16.564,19.979,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1318,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,317.812,321.001,And your client's predecessor did not appeal?
1979.78-1318,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,321.001,323.173,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.78-1318,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,355.713,361.215,"But it is a question that remains here, as to whether or not we have jurisdiction of your petition?"
1979.78-1318,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,361.215,362.403,That's correct.
1979.78-1318,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,406.168,410.983,"And the ruling of the Court of Appeals was in favor of the government, wasn't it, of the United States?"
1979.78-1318,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,410.983,412.217,"Well, it's a little confusing."
1979.78-1318,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,432.907,435.124,But the United States is a respondent in this court?
1979.78-1318,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,435.124,441.95,"Technically, the United States is a respondent; however, they have filed briefs in support of the position of the petitioner."
1979.78-1318,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,441.95,443.665,How about Town Court?
1979.78-1318,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,448.059,449.3,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-1318,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.065,460.841,And Town Court didn't petition this Court for certiorari?
1979.78-1318,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,460.841,463.51,Town Court did not seek certiorari.
1979.78-1318,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,463.51,465.6,So Town Court is not here?
1979.78-1318,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,465.6,471.403,"Town Court is here technically as a respondent, I would assume, inasmuch as they were a party in the Court of Appeals."
1979.78-1318,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,483.173,486.514,"Just on the Town Court point, they have not filed anything at all, have they?"
1979.78-1318,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,486.514,487.292,That's correct.
1979.78-1318,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,488.307,489.707,How about in the Court of Appeals?
1979.78-1318,0,37339,norman_j_watkins,,494.528,504.52,"Yes, they took a position in support of the patients, but the primary thrust of their assertion, and they were independently represented, was that Town Court itself had this right."
1979.78-1318,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,767.439,773.427,Mr. Allen.
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,773.427,776.436,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,812.79,824.964,"Mr. Allen, before you get into that, I notice in your reply brief, page 7, the statement, ""HEW intends to institute rulemaking with respect to patient participation."""
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,827.674,840.119,"My understanding is, Mr. Justice Brennan, that it is still under active consideration, and when I last checked, which was last week, they still intend to institute rulemaking."
1979.78-1318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,842.285,851.39,"But if they did and provide for patient participation, might we have a situation where we don't have to reach a constitutional --"
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,851.39,860.539,"Well, we can only speculate as to what the rulemaker would provide with respect to type of patient participation in this case."
1979.78-1318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,876.779,879.56,Has HEW fixed any timetable?
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,879.56,881.344,Not as yet.
1979.78-1318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,881.344,883.929,Would this be a protracted proceeding?
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,883.929,892.206,It would be in my view unlikely to be completed before this Court reached a decision on the question.
1979.78-1318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,893.758,895.266,"A matter of months, you mean?"
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,895.266,897.902,"Months, I would say."
1979.78-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.429,905.777,"You mean months after it began, or --"
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,905.777,910.809,"Well, I'm only speculating, but this is a question of considerable importance."
1979.78-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,929.418,931.425,And it hasn't begun yet?
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,931.425,932.179,It has not.
1979.78-1318,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,932.179,939.832,"You really wouldn't want to speculate that it would be completed before the end of this present term of the Court, would you?"
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,939.832,943.879,"I really -- my guess is as good as yours, Your Honor."
1979.78-1318,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,945.873,950.608,"And of course, Mr. Allen, neither you nor anybody else knows what the rule may turn out to be."
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,950.608,954.026,That's correct; that's correct.
1979.78-1318,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1027.875,1029.68,This home was in Philadelphia?
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1029.68,1032.412,"I believe it was; yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1318,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1032.412,1036.724,"I was just wondering, there were therefore alternative providers, qualified providers?"
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1036.724,1047.032,"Well, there is some dispute as to the extent of alternative space at the time this matter was before the District Court."
1979.78-1318,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1047.032,1049.112,"This home, in other words, was not in a small town where there was not --"
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1049.112,1050.276,It was not in a small town.
1979.78-1318,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1050.276,1051.475,-- was no other nursing home around?
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1051.475,1054.297,"No, there are other nursing homes in Philadelphia, very definitely."
1979.78-1318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1054.297,1057.046,How many patients were involved?
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1057.046,1064.844,"I believe the home has some 190 patients, 90 percent of whom are Medicaid patients."
1979.78-1318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1064.844,1069.601,This would mean termination would require their transfer to other --
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1069.601,1078.319,"In practical effect, it would mean that if the home were terminated, the patients would have to find another qualified nursing home in order to receive benefits under the statute."
1979.78-1318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1078.319,1081.324,"And that the burden would be on the patients to do this, would it?"
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1081.324,1094.666,"Well, the state and HEW have services intended -- and do -- the State of Pennsylvania has a very effective service to assist patients to relocate to other homes."
1979.78-1318,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1094.666,1097.41,"Is this a fairly large number, relatively?"
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1097.41,1098.225,190?
1979.78-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.225,1099.506,Yes.
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1099.506,1101.571,"I don't know that, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1979.78-1318,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.571,1108.47,"Mr. Allen, your brief states flatly on page 6 that it is in Philadelphia, 198 beds."
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1108.47,1111.926,"It is Philadelphia; yes, sir."
1979.78-1318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1339.859,1358.642,"I suppose if the Court of Appeals were right and a defendant were convicted of a crime and incarcerated but decided not to appeal, a second cousin whom he'd been sending $30 a month to would have a right to appeal his conviction?"
1979.78-1318,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1358.642,1364.308,"That is our submission, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, of the logical implications of the Court of Appeals decision."
1979.78-1318,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1468.293,1470.076,Very well.
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1473.734,1478.3,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1574.054,1577.077,Do you represent both Town Court and the patients?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1577.077,1585.831,"I represented Town Court in the original hearing; I represented the patients with permission of counsel for the patients, Mr. Coyle, who is seated in this courtroom."
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1585.831,1587.045,Who do you reprint here?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1587.045,1594.349,Here I represent only the patients at this time.
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1604.987,1614.506,"When you say you represent the patients, I take it you mean by that you represent each individual of the 190 more or less patients?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1614.506,1616.364,"I would like to think that, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.613,1624.832,At this stage?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1624.832,1630.146,"Not at this stage, but in the proceedings before the District Court which have not been completed."
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1632.417,1636.809,Has there been a certification or is there a motion pending to certify class?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1636.809,1662.443,"At this point nothing is before the court because during the course of the hearing, when the court was hearing evidence on our request for injunctive relief, an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals in the interruption of the evidence at that time, and I will refer to that in just a moment, sir, because that's what the Court of Appeals had in mind when it remanded the case to the lower court."
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1805.421,1808.345,"Now, HEW was a party in the Court of Appeals?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1808.345,1818.308,Only as respects Town Court in taking an appeal to the Court of Appeals and it was decided in its favor.
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1821.167,1825.222,"But a respondent can none the less petition for review, a respondent in the Court of --"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1825.222,1827.516,There were of course appeals for HEW and we took--
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1827.516,1829.485,"Yes, but now in this Court--"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1829.485,1830.48,In this court --
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1830.48,1832.782,The United States is technically a respondent.
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1832.782,1835.483,"I don't think so, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1848.849,1852.841,You think the United States is not a party at all?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1852.841,1854.539,"That's right, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1854.539,1859.562,"Well, it did petition, didn't it, for certiorari?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1859.562,1860.503,"Did not, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1860.503,1862.269,Did not.
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1862.269,1864.442,Only in the--
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1864.442,1866.118,Only the State Secretary did?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1866.118,1868.36,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1868.36,1878.054,"Is there, Mr. Posner, any possibility of incompatibility between the rights of the patients and the rights of the nursing home?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1878.054,1882.431,"If that occasion should arise, sir, right now their interests are parallel."
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1910.508,1919.934,Is there any incompatibility really between the position of HEW and the present position of the Secretary of the Commonwealth?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1919.934,1922.497,Incompatibility between --
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1922.497,1926.328,Aren't their interests basically the same?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1926.328,1930.512,"I would suppose to some extent the answer must be yes to that, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.631,1943.83,So that the -- the Third Circuit really had presented to it all the arguments by HEW that this Court is now being presented?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1943.83,1945.065,"No, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1956.089,1957.669,"Well, we're not concerned with the violation --"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1957.669,1964.805,"Well, that's the only problem that is before this Court today, as I see it."
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1964.805,1971.328,"Well, I thought it was your claim that the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were what conferred a property right."
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1971.328,1972.573,"That is right, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1972.573,1979.606,And the Constitution of the United States is what confers a due process rights not to be deprived of that property with a hearing.
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1979.606,1981.909,"That is right, infringement under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1981.909,1983.244,Isn't that your argument?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1983.244,1989.403,"That is correct, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1990.132,1993.574,"Yes, as far as I am concerned."
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,1993.574,2017.406,"The legal issues involved here are few but I think it resolves itself, if you please, as to whether or not these patients are entitled to a pre-termination hearing before they are removed from their present home to a non-designated place not yet selected by the authorities."
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2020.786,2028.522,Do the authorities in Pennsylvania have a legal obligation under their statute to tell them where to go?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2028.522,2031.713,"Well, sir, there's a real question about it."
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2037.935,2044.704,"Did these patients who are now in the home select this home, or were they mandated there by the state?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2044.704,2055.779,"To a large extent, sir, I would say to a great majority, they selected this home, either themselves or their relatives or by referral of physicians or by hospitals."
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2106.333,2114.013,"You don't have any doubt, do you, that it's none of our business how Pennsylvania construes its laws?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2114.013,2122.674,"I don't think it is any of your business, if Your Honor puts it that way, as to how Pennsylvania construes it, but if they construe it contrary to the law of the land --"
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.674,2123.442,"What do you meant, the law--"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2123.442,2128.344,"-- becomes a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause, then it becomes the business of this Court."
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2128.344,2147.293,"Then you are saying any time that this Court thinks that any state has construed a state statute pertaining to contracts, torts or anything else contrary to the way that statute should have been construed, it raises a Fourteenth Amendment question?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2147.293,2182.89,"I think anything, and I will not restrict it to contracts, sir, anything that involves, as I will argue, life, liberty, and property dealing with personal rights that is offended or affected by a state contrary to its own statutes therefore becomes a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and we have the right to request a Federal court to enjoin the commonwealths from acting contrary to the wishes of those people."
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2182.89,2193.806,What if the State of Pennsylvania had a statute of limitations provision applying a two-year statute to a certain type of cause of action.
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2208.265,2220.811,"I won't answer that question, if Your Honor pleases, because I am concerned now with something much more serious, the immediate removal from a home of people that regard this as the only home they have in the world."
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2220.811,2229.889,"Well, what about the claim of a widow who has missed a substantial negligence recovery because of the statute of limitations bar?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2232.045,2237.968,"I think it might be very serious, sir, and whether that is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, I don't know."
1979.78-1318,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2246.825,2253.887,"Mr. Posner, you mentioned that as a matter of Pennsylvania statutory law the patients have a right to a hearing before they're transferred to another facility?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2253.887,2255.449,"That is correct, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2255.449,2262.168,"Do you rely on that statute as giving them a right to, statutory right to participate in this proceeding?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2262.168,2264.419,"Statutory right to participate in this proceeding, sir?"
1979.78-1318,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2264.419,2265.011,Yes.
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2265.011,2267.317,When you say the matter before the Supreme Court?
1979.78-1318,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2267.317,2275.126,"Well, but I mean a hearing, to participate in a proceeding to determine whether or not the home shall be disqualified?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2275.126,2280.009,"Definitely, sir, pre-termination hearing so that they can offer --"
1979.78-1318,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2280.009,2285.979,"Really, one of your arguments then is it is a matter of Pennsylvania law, you're entitled to the hearing you seek?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2285.979,2287.319,"That is correct, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2291.496,2303.902,"What is to prevent, preclude, or hinder the home from calling, one at a time, every one of the patients as a witness in the proceeding to disqualify the home?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2306.479,2311.919,"If Your Honor pleases, in this very case, five witnesses were called."
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2390.937,2393.479,"The nursing home did have a hearing, did it not?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2393.479,2395.152,"Did not have a hearing, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2395.152,2396.228,No hearing of any kind?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2396.228,2396.723,No.
1979.78-1318,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2403.096,2407.787,"Well, you're not concerned with the deprival of Pennsylvania license in this case, are you?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2407.787,2409.734,"No, sir, but what I'm trying to say is--"
1979.78-1318,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.734,2412.656,"Well, maybe the federal standards are different from the state standards."
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2412.656,2413.117,Pardon me?
1979.78-1318,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.117,2415.872,"I say, maybe the federal standards are different from the state standards."
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2415.872,2421.358,"That may be, sir, but we are not trying to qualify under federal standards for these patients."
1979.78-1318,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.782,2424.687,"Well, you are to the extent that you want Medicare and Medicaid."
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2424.687,2426.488,"No, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.569,2473.187,By violating its own law?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2473.187,2475.866,By violating its own law?
1979.78-1318,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2513.301,2517.982,"Well, those are all a question of Pennsylvania law that we have nothing to do with."
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2517.982,2521.954,I submit to Your Honor you have nothing to do with the Pennsylvania law.
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.267,2539.802,"Well, that's just a jump to a conclusion, so far as I can see."
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2539.802,2542.436,Well --
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2542.436,2553.432,"Well, your point is that if a state construes its law, statutory or common law or state constitutional law, in a way that contravenes the Federal Constitution, then it becomes a matter for this Court?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2553.432,2555.011,"That is correct, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2555.011,2556.847,"I suppose that's your argument, isn't it?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2556.847,2558.129,"That is my argument, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2558.129,2575.316,"Now, going back to this hearing, the post hearing, what was to prevent in that hearing from having every one of the patients in the home come in and take part in it in the sense of justifying?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2575.316,2577.653,"That's just the situation, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2594.582,2597.919,Who do you say is responsible for not having completed that hearing?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2597.919,2599.326,The post hearings?
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2826.851,2832.258,"Does transfer trauma come, is it life, is it liberty, or is it property?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2832.258,2839.745,"I say transfer trauma, sir, to a large extent in the case of a seriously ill patient, can mean life."
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2871.106,2874.882,But I think the Court of Appeals said you had a property interest.
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2874.882,2875.685,"They did, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2875.685,2879.628,"So you say you have life, liberty, and property?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2879.628,2887.365,"Oh yes, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2938.479,2954.595,Is it not possible that the State of Pennsylvania and the Department of Health and Welfare has an obligation to see to it that adequate care is provided that will not bring on any of this train of circumstances?
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,2954.595,2960.083,"That is right, sir, and that a pretermination hearing is their obligation to demonstrate that."
1979.78-1318,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3080.137,3087.554,"But, of course, the state standards for licensing the place are quite different from HEW's standards for eligibility for Medicaide."
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,3087.554,3091.578,"No, sir, the code -- no, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.578,3093.273,"Well, they're not in --"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,3093.273,3106.688,"The code provided -- the Code of Federal Regulations, as stated by HEW, is to the effect that hearing shall be granted --"
1979.78-1318,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3106.688,3108.033,"No, no, I'm talking about the standards."
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,3109.021,3110.762,"Oh, the standards?"
1979.78-1318,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3114.46,3126.298,"They're not identical -- Standards for licensing under the state of Pennsylvania as a nursing home, I would presume, are at least somewhat different from the standards of eligibility for Medicaide?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,3126.298,3127.248,"No, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3127.465,3128.121,"They are identical, are they?"
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,3128.121,3142.278,"Eligibility for Medicaide is under the Pennsylvania statutes, and I would refer to it if I have enough time, sir, but it is under the Pennsylvania act, the determination of what is needy and who is medically ill is their determination, not HEW's under Title 19."
1979.78-1318,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3142.278,3146.56,I am talking about the quality of the provider.
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,3146.56,3148.116,"The provider agreement, as a matter of fact."
1979.78-1318,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3148.116,3153.56,"I am talking about the quality of the provider, the -- however, if you don't understand my question, you don't."
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,3153.56,3154.78,I do understand your question.
1979.78-1318,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3162.135,3162.608,I'm sure you do.
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,3162.608,3174.118,"The disqualification of a home, the decertification of a home, comes about if there's a violation of 18 and they then say you're disqualified under both 18 and 19."
1979.78-1318,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3182.357,3184.066,That's your basic argument; I understand it.
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,3184.066,3188.931,And that's the reason I hesitate in answering your question.
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3278.329,3280.089,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Posner."
1979.78-1318,2,37250,nathan_l_posner,,3280.089,3283.363,"I am so sorry, sir."
1979.78-1318,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3283.363,3287.067,Is there any rebuttal?
1979.78-1318,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,3292.91,3296.564,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1318,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3384.06,3386.712,What is the specific order against Pennsylvania?
1979.78-1318,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,3386.712,3396.657,The order against Pennsylvania and HEW is that Medicaide funding be continued until the patients are relocated.
1979.78-1318,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3396.657,3400.515,This is a prospective order to pay money?
1979.78-1318,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,3400.515,3402.082,Yes.
1979.78-1318,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3402.633,3403.63,Against the state?
1979.78-1318,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,3403.63,3406.23,Against the state and HEW.
1979.78-1318,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3434.574,3437.177,Was any Eleventh Amendment question ever raised?
1979.78-1318,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,3437.177,3442.666,"No, Mr. Justice White."
1979.78-1318,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3469.678,3470.987,"Well, I understand his argument."
1979.78-1318,3,37339,norman_j_watkins,,3481.522,3496.68,"That is what I assumed he was arguing until this morning, when I believe that he argued that it was net federal law that he was concerned about; he was concerned about provisions of state law which, if they existed, of course, would be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment."
1979.78-1318,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3556.738,3557.273,"Thank you, gentlemen."
