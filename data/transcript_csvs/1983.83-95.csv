1983.83-95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,60.289,"Mr. Bell, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1983.83-95,0,23589,f_cortez_bell_iii,,60.289,61.539,Thank you.
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,1842.314,1845.782,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1913.326,1915.943,"In what year, 1966?"
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,1915.943,1917.328,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1917.328,1920.08,And now you're trying the case four years later.
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,1920.08,1954.701,"Four years later these jurors now that are called before the same judge, the same courtroom, following the reversal of the conviction by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for Miranda violations, and who testify that a very high percentage of them, something like 98 percent, recall the facts of this case, have read about it, are familiar with it--"
1983.83-95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1954.701,1960.221,"When you say they recall the facts of the case, they recall that there was such a case is what you mean, isn't it?"
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,1960.221,1961.407,"--Correct, yes, sir."
1983.83-95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1961.407,1962.223,Not all the facts.
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,1962.223,1966.975,"No, there's no way of knowing because that was never in the voir dire."
1983.83-95,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.048,2125.777,"Mr. Schumacher, I think one of your opponent's positions is that if one takes Juror Hrin's various answers, as the first questioned by the defense, then by the prosecution, one gets several different versions of an answer to that question, that admittedly that answer was given, but also something that could be called contradictory to it."
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2131.598,2150.078,"This, Your Honor, we would submit is a mixed question of law and fact which, under Irvin, indicates the nature and strength of a venireman's opinion, is a mixed question of law and fact."
1983.83-95,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2150.078,2159.45,I don't see how that could possibly be under... after our decision in Sumner v. Mata and after Congress changed the statute in 1966.
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2171.658,2202.227,"The difficulty, Your Honor, in establishing that as clearly indicating an issue of credibility is how that issue of credibility was resolved adversely to Mr. Yount by the trial judge whereas the Circuit Court of Appeals, examining exactly the same record, came to the conclusion that it indicated that he was not an impartial juror."
1983.83-95,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2202.227,2205.362,"But, you're an experience trial lawyer, Mr. Schumacher."
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2228.878,2236.548,"Well, Your Honor, that is a very difficult question to require me, representing Mr. Yount to answer."
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2287.247,2299.122,"But if a juryman says the defense is going to have to shake me before I'll find him innocent, wouldn't he be challengeable for cause?"
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2299.122,2300.474,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.474,2301.207,Isn't that what this--
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2301.207,2301.924,And was so.
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.924,2304.959,--Isn't that what this man said?
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2304.959,2306.261,Yes.
1983.83-95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2306.261,2308.58,And you got rid of a great many of them that way.
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2308.58,2344.003,"Right, with similar type... not I, but my client did so, 72 percent of the jurors on this case, and as Irvin teaches, or at least there's some doubt raised when a situation exists in a community of this nature when 80 percent of the individuals that participate in the voir dire have opinions, as to their veracity in answering this questions of this nature."
1983.83-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2344.003,2359.012,"Well, is the test we employ one of whether the trial judge committed manifest error when he determined that the jurors ware impartial?"
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2360.995,2380.776,"Well, as I read Section 2254(d)(8), the determination must be made by the federal habeas corpus case... court as to whether or not the determination is fairly supported by the record."
1983.83-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2388.949,2406.843,"Well, as to Juror Hrin, you had him answering a question, for instance, by saying I would enter it, meaning the jury box, with an open mind."
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2441.664,2473.386,"When he answered that he had an opinion, that he had a fixed opinion, and he indicated that he would definitely require evidence before he could change that opinion and wouldn't change his mind until facts were presented, those are sufficient answers to alert this Court that the circuit court was correct in its determination that he could not sit as an impartial juror."
1983.83-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2473.386,2480.891,Did the district court on habeas specifically address the cause challenge to Juror Hrin?
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2480.891,2481.991,I don't believe so.
1983.83-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2481.991,2484.026,Why not?
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2484.026,2485.259,There were--
1983.83-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2485.259,2489.078,"Was it, was it specifically raised in the petition for habeas?"
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2489.078,2489.747,--Yes.
1983.83-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2489.747,2490.947,As to Hrin?
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2490.947,2492.113,Yes.
1983.83-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2492.113,2495.215,Where in the record does it show that?
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2495.215,2503.905,"The habeas corpus petition is in the record, and I cannot give you a page reference."
1983.83-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2503.905,2508.975,"If you have a chance before you are through, I would appreciate the page reference."
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2508.975,2538.194,"But as I recall, that was an issue early in the case, and the district court neither addressed specific matters pertaining to the... it did not address specific matters pertaining to the publicity, but it did specifically address the testimony of Juror Hrin in Judge Ziegler's opinion."
1983.83-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2554.756,2568.113,"Well, but don't you think in all fairness we have to look at the entire exchange on voir dire relating to Juror Hrin, at all points where that juror was questioned?"
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2568.113,2568.813,"Yes, I do."
1983.83-95,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2658.423,2665.177,If this challenge... was this challenge made in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania?
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2665.177,2666.863,Yes.
1983.83-95,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2670.498,2682.222,Was the argument which prevailed with the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that Juror Hrin's testimony on voir dire should have disqualified... was that challenge made in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania?
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2682.222,2682.922,--I don't know.
1983.83-95,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2686.257,2690.994,"If it wasn't made there, why wasn't it waived under Wainwright v. Sykes?"
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2690.994,2697.148,--But the general issue of jury impartiality was raised as to all the jurors.
1983.83-95,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2731.805,2747.065,But none of those sound like the same issue... those sound like kind of a bath of publicity over the community as a whole rather than focusing on one particular juror and saying from his transcript of voir dire we can tell he shouldn't have been seated.
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2749.517,2752.552,"Well, I don't want to beg your question; I want to answer it as directly as possible."
1983.83-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2763.357,2771.696,"In other words, you have examined the record and it doesn't tell us the answer to that question."
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2771.696,2774.165,That is correct.
1983.83-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2774.165,2782.671,"And you will let me know if you find where Juror Hrin was... that issue was raised before the district court, right?"
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,2782.671,2785.606,I will.
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3025.375,3028.477,"That's the way we pronounce it out in Minnesota, too, so you're all right."
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3033.048,3071.773,"--of obtaining a fair trial by impartial jurors, and obviously the most direct example of that, we submit, is Juror Hrin's testimony, and would stand on it, taking it as a whole, indicating that he testified that he had a fixed opinion that could not be set aside unless evidence was presented that would convince him to change his mind."
1983.83-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3128.307,3131.777,"Well, look at the paragraph following it at 302a."
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3147.487,3155.157,"Of the twelve seated jurors, nine stated they had read about the case."
1983.83-95,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3155.157,3155.891,It's the next sentence.
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3155.891,3157.776,Yes.
1983.83-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3157.776,3170.733,Wouldn't that reference more fairly be read as challenging Jurors No. 2 and 10 who expressed confusion over whether the defendant had to prove his innocence?
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3170.733,3176.535,"May I have a moment, please?"
1983.83-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3182.439,3188.778,"Wouldn't that refer, then, to Jurors 2 and 10 and not to Hrin, who was No. 6?"
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3188.778,3192.662,--Excuse me.
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.662,3204.637,"Did you have briefs, did you have briefs at the habeas corpus?"
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3207.339,3211.374,We filed briefs and had two hearings on the habeas--
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.374,3214.326,Did you mention this specific juror?
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3214.326,3216.095,"--Oh, I did, yes, sir."
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.328,3219.43,Regardless of what your petition said.
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3219.43,3225.201,"--Yes, and Judge Ziegler then, in response to our briefs, specifically referred--"
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3225.201,3230.304,How about the arguments in the state courts?
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3230.304,3234.073,--I did not represent Mr. Yount before the state courts.
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.073,3234.623,Were there briefs?
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3234.623,3236.108,There were briefs filed.
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3236.108,3239.91,Did they ever mention this particular juror by name in the briefs?
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3239.91,3242.945,My best recollection is that they did.
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3242.945,3243.662,Mm-hmm.
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3243.662,3253.051,"When I was appointed to represent him some three years ago, these briefs were made available to me and I read them, and I am going by my memory of reading them."
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3253.051,3257.103,"They aren't in the record here, I take it."
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3257.103,3259.538,I... I can't answer that question.
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3260.421,3264.007,"Well, we could call for them, I suppose."
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3269.494,3270.511,No.
1983.83-95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3291.34,3304.081,"If you prevail here, the case will go back and possibly a new trial, what, in 1984, and then an appeal from that if there's a similar verdict?"
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3321.359,3321.759,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-95,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3321.759,3324.411,"Mr. Schumacher, where has this man been all this time?"
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3324.411,3326.427,"He's in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania."
1983.83-95,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3326.427,3329.613,He has been incarcerated since 19... when?
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3329.613,3332.179,"Yes, sir, and that's the reason my answer would be--"
1983.83-95,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3332.179,3334.848,"So the delay really hasn't done him very much good, I guess."
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3334.848,3339.402,--He's been in jail for 17 years without a fair trial is my position.
1983.83-95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3339.402,3343.287,"So you think the longer the time, the greater the injustice?"
1983.83-95,1,26136,george_e_schumacher,,3343.287,3357.013,"Well, I think so, and the Commonwealth has indicates its willingness and ability to retry him and has never indicated there was any prejudice from the passage of time."
1983.83-95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3380.812,3383.931,Very well.
1983.83-95,2,23589,f_cortez_bell_iii,,3386.216,3389.068,"Not unless the Court has any specific questions, Your Honor."
1983.83-95,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3389.068,3389.818,"Thank you, gentlemen."
