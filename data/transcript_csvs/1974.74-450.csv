1974.74-450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,37.736,"We'll hear arguments next in 74-450, Federal Aviation Administration against Robertson."
1974.74-450,0,23482,freidman,,42.355,45.998,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,134.928,136.89,SWAP not SCRAP --
1974.74-450,0,23482,freidman,,136.89,139.361,"I'm sorry Mr. Justice, SWAP, I apologize."
1974.74-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,139.361,140.337,SCRAP is something else.
1974.74-450,0,23482,freidman,,140.337,143.267,"SCRAP is another case, yes."
1974.74-450,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,675.116,678.074,We have here only Exemption 3 under consideration.
1974.74-450,0,23482,freidman,,678.074,679.995,Only Exemption 3 Mr. Justice.
1974.74-450,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,679.995,686.537,And if you should not prevail on that when you still may -- when you're case underwent or any other of the exemptions.
1974.74-450,0,23482,freidman,,686.537,697.203,"We may Mr. Justice because the exemption sometimes overlap but we think on this issue, we think that we are entitled to prevail under Exemption 3."
1974.74-450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.425,1194.042,"Prior to the Freedom of Information Act to the 1966, the Federal Aviation Administrator could've withheld either under the standard of the old Freedom of Information Act or under the 1938 Statute, is that correct?"
1974.74-450,0,23482,freidman,,1194.042,1194.461,That is correct.
1974.74-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1231.502,1242.936,I think you're twisting your opponent's argument a little bit and the argument is that the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act is a whole cert to repeal 1104 and then Exemption 3 doesn't cover it.
1974.74-450,0,23482,freidman,,1242.936,1245.939,"Well, I don't think so Mr. Justice."
1974.74-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1250.769,1258.713,"Well that 1104 is not under any of the exemptions and explicitly not under Exemption 3 because, well you know the argument."
1974.74-450,0,23482,freidman,,1258.713,1259.271,Yeah.
1974.74-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1259.451,1263.323,If not the statute that is specific in saying what shall --
1974.74-450,0,23482,freidman,,1263.323,1282.308,"Yeah, but my only point was Mr. Justice if 1104 is not under Exemption 3 and if we don't know whether it would be covered by the other exemptions, the practical effect of that is that at least as far as 1104 is concerned, the administrator can no longer rely on that provision."
1974.74-450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1309.621,1311.007,Very well Mr. Freidman.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1317.991,1321.14,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1336.401,1347.717,"Mr. Morrison, was this inquiry prompted by some formal study of some sort I couldn't quite bring that --"
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1347.717,1383.573,"Mr. Robertson and Mr. Simonelli were both engaged in an ongoing study of the aviation as to Mr. Robertson as still engage and that Mr. Simonelli is a student and now and has left that particular study which we were just working on for that particular summer but they are engaged in the continuing ongoing surveillance through the Aviation Consumer Action Project of trying to find out whether all aspects of the aviation industry, that is the safety aspects which are handled by the FAA which is before us in this case and whether the economic aspects handled by the CAB or designed in the way and operated in the way to benefit the public and consumers at large."
1974.74-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1383.573,1386.306,Or in private did I see.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1386.306,1388.197,"That's correct Your Honor, that's correct."
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1388.197,1391.801,Would any citizen have the same right to bring their suit?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1391.801,1405.12,Absolutely Your Honor and that's one of the important aspects of the Freedom of Information Act and why it's different from the law before 1966 when Justice Rehnquist mentioned just a minute ago that regardless of whatever test it was Your Honor.
1974.74-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.11,1431.489,"Well, there were two changes really weren't there for probably more than that but one was to do a way with the so-called standing requirement."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1432.369,1433.551,Absolutely correct.
1974.74-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1433.551,1442.596,And the second was to do a way with the general right of -- in a Government official to say the public interest requires this to be classified in secret.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1442.596,1443.271,That's right.
1974.74-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1556.131,1560.582,Is that a right to appeal at on the Administrative Procedure Act?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1560.582,1569.075,"Well, Your Honor, the Government says that we could take an appeal on that order under 49 U.S.C. Section 1486."
1974.74-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.253,1597.441,"But if your quarrel is with the propriety of that particular determination rather than with the fact that however sound that determination, it can't prevail over the Freedom of Information Act."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1600.565,1600.915,That's right.
1974.74-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1646.857,1649.214,"Well, nobody promised you a rose garden."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1649.214,1652.592,"No, Your Honor, but at least I would like to now where I can take my client to Court."
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1759.498,1784.409,"Mr. Morrison, coming back to the question I ask you, you responded that any citizen would have the same right to sue, let's assume you win this case, would any citizen have to make any showing to be entitled to the documents or reports that you desire or would it suffice if he merely wrote a letter to the FAA and said, “please put me on your mailing list."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1790.281,1816.123,"Your Honor, in most cases, the Government agencies wants a final authoritative ruling by either this court or appropriate Court of Appeals has been issued has been following the Freedom of Information Act and has been adhering to the rule that's been annunciated and we would expect as it happened in this case Your Honor, once we were judged to be entitled to the MRRs, those are the Mechanical Reliability Reports that were not appeal by the Government."
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1836.779,1839.413,"You are offering to pay the cost yourself, aren't you?"
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1839.413,1840.732,"For copies, yes Your Honor."
1974.74-450,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1883.202,1885.897,What pages?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1885.897,1890.795,I think about page 40 but I'm not positive.
1974.74-450,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1902.412,1904.675,How did this get o the record incidentally?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1904.675,1910.996,"Your Honor, a copy of that was attached to the affidavit of the plaintiff Mr. Robertson."
1974.74-450,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1915.454,1916.732,About what kind of animal we're talking about.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1916.732,1917.93,That's exactly right Your Honor.
1974.74-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1918.42,1920.45,How did he obtain this?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1920.45,1927.19,"Your Honor, I was not counsel at the time that was put in, I do not know Your Honor."
1974.74-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2105.523,2116.409,We'll resume there at one o'clock.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2118.804,2121.559,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2280.46,2289.193,Doesn't the 1104 though rest on some additional finding about the adverse effect upon the interest of private parties?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2289.193,2289.786,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.972,2307.05,Isn't that that the public interest requires that -- that the public interest requires it to be remained secret but that the public interest -- that the interest and is not required -- disclosure is not required in the public interest.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2307.05,2308.733,There are both those phrases in there Your Honor.
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2308.733,2315.07,But they must find that the private interest would be adversely effective.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2315.07,2343.345,"Whatever the interest is of the requesting party and Your Honor as we read the statute indeed even another FAA official could make the request that the information not be disclosed, it simply says any person may make a request and there's nothing specifically limited in that but confining it to the question specifically that Your Honor as we view the adversely effect that simply as another side of the same public interest determination that really once someone has requested that a document be made available."
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.325,2380.337,I don't think you would argue that the board doesn't even have to find that the public interest requires that it be kept secret that it's a much even a lesser standard than that all it requires is that --
1974.74-450,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2380.337,2381.295,It's conjunctive though.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2381.295,2382.673,It's conjunctive yes.
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.278,2385.138,That's right.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2397.847,2399.763,That's right.
1974.74-450,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2420.847,2422.718,If it adversely affects somebody?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2422.718,2427.209,That's right and we say that that's all really partially subsumed in the same standard.
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.209,2441.76,"But that does narrow the area it seems to me of -- in terms of whether it's open-ended or not, somebody has to file something and say here as why and the board has to find that the adversity affects interest to somebody."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2447.988,2450.251,"Well, there is somebody that has to make that determination."
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.269,2459.826,"Well, it didn't hear anyway."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2459.826,2460.365,"No, Your Honor."
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2463.659,2471.97,"Well for example, wasn't 1104, I suppose one of the SWAP Reports spoke disparagingly of a particular mechanic."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2471.97,2472.21,That's right.
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2472.21,2472.972,By name?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2472.972,2473.571,"Yes, sir."
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2473.571,2478.182,"Now, was 1104 could he commend and ask of that SWAP Report."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2482.573,2483.352,He could.
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2483.352,2491.042,And then I gather the board has to make the further inquiry where there nevertheless the interest of the public would require this.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2491.042,2501.21,"But more importantly Your Honor, for the purpose of Freedom of Information Act, that mechanic would -- may well be protected under the six exemptions which prevent clearly unwanted invasions of personal privacy."
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.497,2517.531,"If it gets rather the example, you would say that that document is not exempt under this particular exemption."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2517.531,2518.489,That's correct.
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2518.489,2524.903,"And that despite this exemption, despite the adverse effect on it, that 1104 just has no application whatsoever."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2524.903,2526.679,"That's right, that's precisely our position."
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2526.679,2529.257,That it has been in effect repealed.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2529.257,2541.366,"Except Your Honor to this limited area, it provides a mechanism for persons who wish to have documents that are otherwise that the agency might release if it chose."
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2550.396,2568.466,"But well, I gather what you say that if you have something which would protect the mechanic, you would have to be under three others that have to be and explicit statute which said and no SWAP reports that involved a mechanic and may adversely affect him shall be published."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2568.466,2571.594,I think we can go make it a broader statute and that Your Honor for instance --
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2571.594,2572.461,How much broader?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2572.461,2575.695,"Well, let's take the area of the Veterans' Administration which would be not dissimilate."
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2575.695,2577.246,Does anybody named Jones?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2577.246,2593.626,"Anybody named Jones or mechanics -- the Veterans' Administration has a statute titled 38, Section 3301 which says that, “Any matter relating to any claim of a veteran under this chapter maybe with -- shall be withheld unless one of the following conditions.”"
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2595.731,2597.779,Any matter involving any mechanic.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2597.779,2598.043,That's right.
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2601.792,2604.084,"Unless it's like that, you say it doesn't come within --"
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2604.084,2604.563,Exemption 3.
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2604.563,2605.701,Within Exemption 3.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2605.701,2610.826,Because Exemption 3 uses some words that we believe are fairly narrow words.
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2622.182,2629.567,"Well, I know but if they are, that ambiguous I take it then the legislative history becomes quite important does it."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2629.567,2631.742,"The general legislative history does, yes Your Honor."
1974.74-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2680.376,2688.422,What is that that's protected if it is “specifically exempted from disclosure by statute?”
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2690.799,2702.336,That's right and that I think Your Honor means that portions of documents can be withheld whereas the whole -- the entire document may not be that's as I interpret it.
1974.74-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2728.923,2739.57,But the fact that the phrase is matters rather than documents may conceivably shed some light on the meaning of specifically exempted from disclosure by statute might not?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2739.57,2744.109,It might Your Honor but there is no legislative history and we've gone over every bit of it that we --
1974.74-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2744.109,2748.777,"Well, I was just thinking of the legislative language rather than the legislative history."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2748.777,2758.181,"Well, I would say this Your Honor, there's no indication that any place in the Congress, anyone focus on the words matters as oppose to documents, or particularized records."
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2772.286,2778.573,-- were certain true matters has boarder connotation for the document.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2778.573,2781.567,"Well, I would say --"
1974.74-450,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2781.567,2783.843,I mean literally.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2783.843,2793.831,"Yeah, that's right but in the context that matters in general might but in the context to the Freedom of Information Act where we are after our only talking about documents, records is the precise term of the act --"
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.831,2802.294,Have you ever -- any suggestion of legislative history that any of these statutes such as 1104 or intended to be repealed that might do.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2802.294,2803.432,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.432,2805.157,And of --
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2805.157,2806.941,We don't believe it was repealed.
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2813.588,2819.428,But your argument be the same if Congress today pass the statute like 1004?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2819.428,2826.853,"Your Honor, I was thinking about that before it came here today and the answer is I would suggest, yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2827.093,2828.901,But you didn't have too and you --
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2828.901,2834.435,"Well, I would suppose we would have a little legislative history at that point Your Honor and I think it probably could be --"
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.435,2841.669,"Well, were there any of the hundred statutes that or has Congress pass any statutes such as this since the Freedom of Information Act?"
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2841.669,2856.181,"Well, they have passed statutes that have in some respects, restricted access to documents but all of them have had either a standard as to the type of documents for instance the transportation board statute last year --"
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2856.181,2857.486,The mechanics type document.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2857.486,2870.48,"Well, I would say much broader than that Your Honor, it says “Documents connected it in connection with the safety investigations shall not be disclosed or may not be disclosed except in certain circumstances, there either tell us what kind of documents we're dealing with."
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.581,2901.535,When was the compilation of a hundred statutes made?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2901.535,2905.176,"Your Honor, I can't tell you when it was because I don't think there was one."
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.156,2916.58,But was it ever done by a legislative committee or by --
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2916.58,2925.401,"No, that was referred to -- it was actually put into a legislative formed committee print of the House of Representatives in 1960."
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2930.101,2932.077,When was the Federal Aviation Act passed?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2932.077,2933.994,1938 and then it was re --
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.994,2935.306,It was reenacted?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2935.306,2937.096,Reenacted 1958.
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2937.096,2938.222,With this section in it?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2938.222,2939.174,That's correct.
1974.74-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3003.961,3039.997,"Is there anything illogical or extraordinary about the fact that Congress in passing acts in such sweeping terms would not pause to try to identify all of the specific statutes which they had previously passed granting nondisclosure, the acts of Congress known it by some administrative decision, anything unusual about their saying as to all the matters on which we previously made a legislative judgment or going to preserve that privilege of non disclosure?"
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3039.997,3052.021,"No, I don't think there's anything necessarily illogical and we would simply say Your Honor that 1104 doesn't represent the kind of legislative judgment that we think is required before a statute comes within exemption 3."
1974.74-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3059.674,3066.908,How do you distinguish between -- it lost me there Mr. Morrison as to different kinds of legislative judgments.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3066.908,3067.555,"Well, we think --"
1974.74-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3067.555,3074.369,I thought the role about the same and although some good some bad but they're all on the same level in terms of how they do it aren't they?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3074.369,3085.058,"In the choice of how they do it Your Honor but the question of whether Congress has made a determination as to what lies in the public interest in terms of disclosure, legislative judgments in this sense."
1974.74-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3133.328,3141.819,"Well, in order to say that, wouldn't you have to include and then move forth well drawn statutes or some phrase like that?"
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3141.819,3143.256,"I'm sorry, I don't --"
1974.74-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3143.256,3156.23,"You say this, the one that's not properly drawn and didn't have legislative clog to it nor how do you classify it like that, how could Congress classify it?"
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3156.23,3161.905,"Well, I don't see there's anything wrong with the legislative technique in drawing -- in drafting 1104 Your Honor."
1974.74-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3170.111,3175.42,And whether a specific exemption for CAB and FAA both.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3175.42,3176.734,But it wasn't by the statute Your Honor.
1974.74-450,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3182.722,3184.459,It has to be more than authorizing statutes.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3184.459,3185.405,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1974.74-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3185.405,3190.435,It has to be more specific but 1104 didn't say that.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3190.435,3191.872,1104 didn't say anything about that.
1974.74-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3195.046,3197.908,"Exemption 3, doesn't say that as the point."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3197.908,3199.046,"Yes, sir."
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3199.046,3202.16,Was 1104 within existence before 58?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3202.16,3203.465,"Yes, it was 1938 Your Honor."
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3203.465,3207.417,But was it -- did they amend it in 58?
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3207.417,3213.525,I believe it was slightly -- the phrases where slightly modified that provision about national defense was turned around a little bit in the last --
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3213.525,3218.227,But it does say these documents shall be exempt from public disclosure.
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3218.227,3225.202,1104?
1974.74-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3225.202,3231.406,"It says the board of administrational order, the information withheld from public disclosure."
1974.74-450,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3231.406,3235.406,That's right.
1974.74-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3251.921,3252.939,Mr. Morrison.
1974.74-450,2,23482,freidman,,3254.017,3258.209,I just like to say one think in rebuttal.
1974.74-450,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3287.699,3295.304,I gather Mr. Friedman that's really that if the subject is non disclosure no matter what the form it takes that's within Exemption 3.
1974.74-450,2,23482,freidman,,3295.304,3321.196,"That is precisely it Mr. Justice and the reason, the reason for this we think is that when Congress came to deal with the problem of what to do with prior statutes that provided for non disclosure, it decided to leave the situation as it was and in this statute 1104 represents a particularized congressional treatment of this problem."
1974.74-450,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3353.24,3354.078,Thank you gentlemen.
