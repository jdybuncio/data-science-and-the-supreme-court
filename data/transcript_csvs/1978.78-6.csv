1978.78-6,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.176,"We will hear arguments next in Moore against Sims, Mr. Young; you may proceed when you are ready."
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,10.176,12.157,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.78-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,164.01,171.426,It is possibly to briefly state what the court below --
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,171.426,182.955,"I hope so, I want to try, I think it's difficult and I certainly don't want to use that part of my time doing it."
1978.78-6,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,555.263,558.883,On March '71.
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,558.883,559.749,I beg your pardon.
1978.78-6,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,559.749,565.349,On March ‘71 they went to the judge for the modifying the -- .
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,565.349,577.649,"No, Your Honor there is, according to the deposition of Judge Lowy, which I will discuss; they did attempt apparently to file a motion to modify."
1978.78-6,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,597.721,601.699,This is not the only point that's not clear.
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,601.699,608.392,"That's right, that's why I am taking some time to go through it in the first place."
1978.78-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,644.76,647.622,"You said habeas action, a state habeas action?"
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,647.622,650.245,Yes.
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,653.448,656.614,Was the initial order which was a state court order was it not?
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,656.614,657.372,Yes.
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,657.372,664.658,Was that entered in any pending proceeding which actually had been brought?
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,664.658,676.08,"Yes, the proceeding -- there were two state court proceedings before the Federal Court hearing on this."
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,676.08,677.81,Briefly can you tell us what those--?
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,677.81,683.778,"Yes, the first one was the one that I mentioned on the 27th."
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,683.778,685.111,Brought by whom.
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,685.111,696.883,"Brought by the state, I've forgotten the name of the individual, who signed the complaint but it was brought by the state, this is a day after the children were picked up at school."
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,696.97,700.51,So it was a state agency -- a proceeding brought by a State agency?
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,700.51,701.153,Yes.
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,701.153,703.055,And who were the defendants or the respondents?
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,703.055,707.022,"It were the Sims, the parents, yes."
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,707.022,707.66,Now that's one--
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,707.66,729.199,"That's one, the next one was as a result of this hearing on the 5th in Judge Lowy's court wherein the motion for habeas was pending, also that was on the 9th or the 10th day I forgot which of this 10 day order."
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,732.898,735.278,Well who brought the second proceeding?
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,735.278,745.506,"This, the second proceeding was brought during a continuance of this hearing."
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,779.465,781.156,In the same county or different?
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,781.156,782.84,"In Harris County, the same county."
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,782.84,783.77,The same county.
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,783.77,787.223,And as a result of that second suit—
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,787.223,788.712,Naming again the Sims as --?
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,788.712,808.685,"Yes, as a result of the second suit, the Judge took an official cognizance if you will of the venue issue, transferred that second suit to Montgomery County and transferred with it the habeas action on which no action had been taken."
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,808.685,810.65,Who brought the habeas action?
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,810.65,811.249,The Sims.
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,811.249,814.95,The Sims.
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,822.099,842.586,"You could even say four if you wanted because at some point the Sims also brought -- attempted to bring an original habeas action I believe in the Court of Civil Appeals which is an intermediate court, which they refused to take, there having been no decisions below."
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,842.586,843.637,They didn't succeed.
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,843.637,844.784,They didn't succeed.
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,846.563,855.822,"No, well I am trying to get the actual pending state proceedings, were the two brought by state agency, both in Harris County one transferred to some other—"
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,855.822,856.729,Montgomery County.
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,856.729,864.875,"Montgomery County and the habeas proceeding brought by the Sims in Harris County also transferred to Montgomery, is that it?"
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,864.875,865.555,That's right.
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,865.555,869.408,Now the initial order was entered in that first State agency proceeding was it?
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,869.408,870.135,Yes.
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,870.135,870.541,I see.
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,870.541,882.376,That order pursuant to chapter 17 was good for only 10 days and this subsequent hearing that we are talking about not an ex-parte hearing it's the first that had been -- when the order was obtained.
1978.78-6,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,882.376,885.618,Was it on the 9th?
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,885.618,896.393,"It was on the fifth so it would be the 9th day I think yes, which is why I think he said, he gave him till 5 o'clock to get whatever additional pleadings, motions they would have."
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,904.88,910.669,"The proceeding in which that order was entered did not terminate with the expiration of the order, did it?"
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,910.669,927.624,"Well, that's a very close question and I think that's why the second proceeding was filed seeking temporary conservatorship and why it's that proceeding that was transferred along with the habeas to Montgomery County."
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,927.624,929.992,Well let me put it to you this way.
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,936.117,944.106,"We relied this to chapter 17, was filed before any proceedings of substance on the merits in Federal Court."
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,944.106,945.963,I am confused with these numbers.
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,945.963,947.472,I am sorry I said I tried not to do it.
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,947.472,949.242,Which state proceedings—
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,949.242,953.244,The emergency proceeding filed the day after the child was picked up.
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,953.244,959.596,That was pending you say when the federal suit was brought.
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,960.022,966.95,"We argue that it's a question of definition of what the -- there was no order, there was order in effect by the county."
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,966.95,975.058,"In any event, you say the second state agency proceeding which they brought in Harris, transferred to Montgomery that certainly was a pending proceeding—"
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,975.058,976.366,Without question as was the habeas.
1978.78-6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,976.366,979.139,"As was the habeas, yes."
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,979.139,981.919,At least probably three.
1978.78-6,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.919,985.028,Montgomery County had joined Harris on the north.
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,985.028,994.17,"Yes, it's immediately to the north, I don't believe there are any counties in between, if you can't tell one from the other it's all urban."
1978.78-6,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,994.17,1009.323,"Is it perfectly clear the second proceeding was pending because the order was entered as I, in my notice showing April 6, and wasn't till April 19th that the federal case was filed and there's a more than a 10 day gap and had anything -- it was not another 10 day order that expired by its terms?"
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,1009.323,1015.581,"That gets to, that's what it was subsequently interpreted to be by the Federal Court."
1978.78-6,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1020.585,1021.193,So if you didn't –
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,1021.193,1025.157,"They didn't believe it would expire after 10 days, but we are not appealing that aspect."
1978.78-6,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.157,1031.227,"If you so view it that would no more have been pending in the first one, they'd be precisely of the same standard."
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,1031.227,1036.9,"Oh, yes because I distinguish between a pending law suit and an order that's in effect."
1978.78-6,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1043.808,1053.017,Well couldn't the other side argue that after the 10 days it ran on till April 16th that you retained custody of the children without any legal support for what you are doing?
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,1053.017,1098.714,"Oh they did and that's what they did argue on April 5th in the hearing in Federal Court, whereupon we said accepting that we didn't use these words, but accepting that as a given then can we go file another lawsuit in Montgomery County and get all those cleared up, and it was our understanding that managing judge said, yes, whereupon we did on April, on May the 14th, whereupon the Sims is absenting themselves from anywhere where they could be served with a writ of attachment that went with that case but somehow mysteriously they must have learned about it because they returned to Federal Court on the 21st seeking a temporary restraining order against this, against the attachment."
1978.78-6,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.347,1132.145,"But, if you rely on the May 14th action, the new suit brought then that is a good -- almost a month after the federal case had been filed."
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,1132.145,1157.021,"That's right and it's that aspect of the confusion why in our abstention argument, we put it under several different sections and dealt with the Hicks against Miranda kind of an issue whether a federal case has -- whether a State court proceeding has to be pending before there are substantial proceedings on the merit and in Federal Court as a separate issue."
1978.78-6,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1160.222,1164.692,The temporary restraining order you were -- but you were notified after it was granted.
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,1164.692,1170.577,"Oh sure yes, without question."
1978.78-6,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1305.509,1308.844,"Mr. Young, you've only got a couple of minutes left."
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,1308.844,1309.946,I know.
1978.78-6,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1309.946,1311.928,We have to get to the heart of your case.
1978.78-6,0,21735,david_h_young,,1311.928,1322.67,Okay.
1978.78-6,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1402.348,1405.132,Very well.
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1432.811,1433.515,Yes sir.
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1433.515,1440.419,"What happened when was this child picked up, why, and then how soon after that were these proceedings begun?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1440.419,1441.357,All right sir.
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1455.703,1458.17,And you concede this was an emergency?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1458.17,1484.306,"No sir, I do not concede that this is an emergency, what we concede to sir is that there's an interest here on the part of the state that if in fact there were any children at any particular time now or even then in danger of any harm that that state has an interest in being able to take those children into custody."
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1484.306,1488.383,And primarily that's a matter for the State Court says it not?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1488.383,1498.346,"That particular yes sir is, what we are concerned about is what happened after the children were taken into custody."
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1498.346,1500.855,Why was this particular child picked up?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1500.855,1501.554,Right sir.
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1535.76,1540.675,How soon after they were taken into custody was there a medical examination?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1540.675,1547.609,"Sir, there was the child -- the children were taken to the hospital that very day."
1978.78-6,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1547.609,1553.57,Are these pictures in the appendix or those are the pictures were they taken that very day?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1553.57,1556.98,"Your Honor, I do not know when those pictures were taken."
1978.78-6,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1570.764,1574.017,Was this about one child or all three in inspection?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1574.017,1577.507,"Sir, I believe that those pictures are only of one child."
1978.78-6,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1589.322,1594.065,"Well, they are rather telling aren't they, exhibits of child abuse?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1594.065,1595.851,Yes sir.
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1595.851,1606.113,"Were they not buttressed also by the doctor's examination, which said that there had clearly been a case of child abuse?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1606.113,1610.689,"Your Honor, they were buttressed by an affidavit by the doctor."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1693.743,1696.138,What if the judge wasn't there?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1696.138,1705.252,"Sir, in the request for admission, it states and admits that the motion was stamped by the clerk."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1716.833,1718.919,Is that clear?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1718.919,1723.388,I believe sir that it is clear from the request for admissions that are in the --
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1723.388,1728.05,That they weren't permitted to file --
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1728.05,1730.581,"It is not clear sir from any testimony, it's just --"
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1730.581,1732.377,The court house was open.
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1732.377,1733.398,Yes sir.
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1733.398,1738.222,And if they tended the paper with the right fees couldn't they file any paper?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1738.222,1740.466,"Supposedly sir, they were supposed to be able to file --"
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1740.466,1744.644,"What do you mean supposedly, it's either permissible or not."
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1744.644,1747.003,"Yes sir, they should have been able to file it however --"
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1747.003,1748.246,But were they.
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1748.246,1749.493,"No, sir they will not commit to that file."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1749.493,1752.429,"No, why were they denied the right to file."
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1752.429,1755.054,"I do not know sir, the judge, he was not there."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1755.054,1761.824,"Do I have to accept, is there anything in the record that shows that they were denied the right to file."
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1761.824,1762.369,No sir.
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1763.088,1766.4,"Well, how can we take your word for it, if it is not in the record?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1766.4,1767.902,Let me see this thing sir.
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1822.535,1825.368,"Put it straight away, the one that you didn't file?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1825.368,1831.479,"The one sir, of March 31st that the judge refused to act on sir."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1831.479,1834.686,"Well, how could you do that then and filed?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1834.686,1836.005,No sir.
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1837.4,1839.037,You see what confuses me?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1846.105,1846.644,Yes sir.
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1848.541,1849.412,Thank you.
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1849.412,1864.838,"The March 31st order was not a writ of habeas corpus, that motion was a motion to modify the March 26 Ex Parte Order where the judge took custody of the children for the ten-day period."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1990.388,1993.166,It couldn't have been in Montgomery court?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,1993.166,1997.527,"Sir, there was no action although it was transferred."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2006.359,2009.541,Could you have asked for it?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2009.541,2018.018,"Your Honor, as far as I know and from the record, they made attempts to ask for a hearing."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2018.018,2020.557,Where do we find that in the record?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2020.557,2023.623,It's purely speculative sir.
1978.78-6,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2035.956,2039.622,Where those Ex Parte Orders appealable?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2039.622,2040.146,No sir.
1978.78-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.005,2088.617,You mean there is no court in Texas that would entertain a claim that the children were unconstitutionally seized and retained by the state?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2088.617,2134.912,"Your Honor, the only thing that they would have been able to do and they would not had been able to raise their constitutional questions or the issues of constitutional law in either a writ of mandamus or a writ of habeas corpus, which are the two things because the writ of mandamus sir, would have dealt with whether or not the release sought, or whether or not the there was an abuse of discretion, say if a writ of mandamus had been filed for the clerk not receiving the motion to modify, or for the judge not to have any hearing on the motion to modify."
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2140.369,2145.084,Well isn't that -- wouldn't that have been a sufficient remedy at that point?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2158.6,2161.873,Let me state this sir.
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2178.035,2183.361,Under Texas law you filed your original writs in the Court of Appeals?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2183.361,2184.661,Yes sir.
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2186.696,2187.114,Why?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2189.278,2190.81,"Yes sir, it is."
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2190.81,2193.338,Could it not be filed in Montgomery?
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2193.338,2195.634,I thought you filed it in a district court.
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2195.634,2210.466,They did attempt sir to file it in the district court in the Harris County District Court and that was where His Honor refused to even rule on the writ because of lack of jurisdiction because the family were residents of Montgomery County.
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2210.466,2216.196,"They could have gone with the Montgomery County, couldn't you?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2223.408,2227.941,"If sir, there was any pending proceeding."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2227.941,2241.335,"In this particular case, could you have not file the petition that you filed in the Court of Appeals, couldn't you have filed it into Montgomery County Court?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2241.335,2242.976,"Your Honor, they had the choice."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2242.976,2244.023,Couldn't you?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2244.023,2244.349,Yes.
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2246.134,2248.955,And why didn't you?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2248.955,2263.907,"Because sir, as the statute permits, they chose to file the writ of habeas corpus with the Court of Civil Appeals, which had jurisdiction over the Montgomery County Court, since they were all in the same area."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2263.907,2266.881,Do you have jurisdiction over that case?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2269.459,2269.899,No sir.
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2272.392,2274.886,"Well, what did Court of Civil Appeals do to your petition?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2274.886,2280.244,The Court of Civil Appeals refused to even let them file it.
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.244,2282.183,Because it didn't have jurisdictions?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2282.183,2289.675,"Your Honor, no reasons were given for the refusal to file."
1978.78-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.516,2389.679,"Ms Porter like did Justice Marshall, I don't understand why nobody on behalf of the parents, when the children are out of their custody all this of period ran into the --- why didn't they go to the Montgomery County Court and say, hey, I want our children back."
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2389.679,2396.516,"Apparently sir, and this is just information, this is not in the record."
1978.78-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2436.946,2446.881,"And when it wasn't and all after 10 days, it seemed to be an open and shut case to go and say we want our children back, and they were not being held with any lawful authority at that point."
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2446.881,2454.965,That's when the decision was sir to go to the Court of Civil Appeals.
1978.78-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2454.965,2462.183,"When I spoke to the Judge on the Court of Civil Appeals, said well why they don't go into the County Court in Montgomery County, I would have thought."
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2462.183,2466.922,"Your Honor, no reason was given for that refusal to let them file that writ."
1978.78-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2480.599,2490.009,Counsel is your petition for habeas corpus in the record?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2490.009,2494.627,Your Honor it is on the docket.
1978.78-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2494.627,2502.466,"But the –- what were your allegations in your habeas corpus petition, do you remember?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2505.876,2507.24,"No, sir."
1978.78-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2513.939,2517.107,Have you ever read the habeas corpus petition?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2517.107,2536.28,"Yes, sir, it just states briefly that, that the children were wrongfully in the custody of the Harris County Child Welfare, the constitutional issues are not raised, and I would think sir that --"
1978.78-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2536.28,2542.97,"And they could have been though, I suppose right there, it might have been denied but you could have raised, you could have alleged them I suppose."
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2542.97,2543.777,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.067,2547.355,And if it had been denied you could have appealed.
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2547.355,2559.212,"They could have been raised, however sir, general as far as writs of habeas corpus are concerned it just deals with custody and he has the right to --"
1978.78-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2559.212,2576.241,"I know, I know, but one ground for alleging as the Chief Justice suggested to you, one ground for claiming illegal custody would be that the state was violating the constitution by holding the children."
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2576.241,2586.341,"Yes sir, except that at that point and even at the point of the Court of Civil Appeals writ, there was no pending state proceeding both of the --"
1978.78-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.341,2588.047,Except that one.
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2588.047,2600.714,"Both, the first one, but on May 4th when they filed in the Court of Civil Appeals."
1978.78-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.362,2683.3,"Ms. Porter I understood your opponent to say that although the Court held that aspect of the statue unconstitutional they are not appealing that holding, is that right?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2683.3,2698.6,"I understood sir, that and it could be that I misunderstood him, I thought sir that he was saying that they were not appealing that section of Chapter 34, which that deals with."
1978.78-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.6,2700.128,Failure to give notice to the parents.
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2700.128,2724.67,"The failure to give notice to the parents, but that failure to give notice to the parents sir that he is referring to is the failure to give notice to the parents when say child welfare is going in and requesting an order, which could issue without notice and without a hearing to have either the children or the parents examined."
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2754.824,2768.261,"Well up to now you haven't given me any linkling of why this matter could not have been settled in the State Courts where custody of children is normally, the kind of problems that are settled there."
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2774.579,2787.809,"Your Honor, the reasons are because there was, there was no pending action, both of the orders had expired."
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2826.804,2844.584,"Well I confess I can't escape the feeling on this record including the reading of the opinion of the United States District Court, that some people were more interested in a constitutional case than in trying to do something to take care of these children."
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2844.584,2869.151,"I do not have any knowledge, sir of whether or not that is true, it just appears to me that the state with all of it's resources were putting the burden on the appellant, the appellees to raise or to find ways of having a hearing."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2889.712,2897.645,"From that moment on, did you ever go to the Court House in Montgomery County for any purpose?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2897.645,2902.05,"Your Honor, I will just state what has been relayed to me."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2920.557,2922.79,But that doesn't answer my question.
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2942.536,2949.064,"Your Honor, I cannot say specifically from my own knowledge that happened in respect to the parents."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2959.241,2960.794,The answer is nobody.
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2960.794,2961.763,"No, sir."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2961.763,2962.177,Well --
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2962.177,2963.463,Not as to the parents.
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2963.463,2969.183,"Well you're saying all these, well I don't know about who didn't go, I want to know who did go?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2969.183,2972.024,"As far as I know, no one sir."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2997.516,2998.376,Didn't the parents come and get it there?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,2998.376,2999.716,"Yes sir, except that here –-"
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2999.716,3004.318,"So they could have gone, the case would have gone to Montgomery County."
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,3004.318,3006.646,They could have sir.
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3006.646,3008.382,Where are these children now?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,3008.382,3017.235,"The children sir, were ordered, returned to their parents by the Federal court."
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3017.235,3021.781,I suppose -- how long were they in the custody of the State approximately.
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,3021.781,3024.918,They were in the custody of the State for 42 days.
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3024.918,3025.67,42 days?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,3025.67,3027.004,Yes sir.
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3027.004,3034.481,By that time they probably were healed of the very serious wounds that are shown in these photographs.
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,3034.481,3050.177,"Your Honor, I would like to point out that in the district court's opinion that the court does state that there was never any evidence to show as to whether or not there was any abuse by the parents."
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3140.263,3141.862,In Federal court or State court.
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,3141.862,3146.923,In State Court sir.
1978.78-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3310.803,3315.213,"Well the court below held the same day, isn't it?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,3315.213,3326.865,"Your Honor if I may, there were two judgments and yes they did hold sir the same day."
1978.78-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3367.207,3373.617,"Suppose they picked up on Saturday night, when should the hearing be held?"
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,3373.617,3378.448,"Your Honor, there are two answers to that question."
1978.78-6,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3406.838,3409.583,While your time --
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,3409.583,3410.374,I beg your pardon sir.
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3410.374,3412.635,Conroe is where Montgomery County is?
1978.78-6,1,45905,windell_porter,,3412.635,3417.72,"Yes sir, Conroe is a city in Montgomery County."
1978.78-6,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3425.5,3428.412,Do you have anything further Ms. Porter?
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3428.412,3431.371,Yeah.
1978.78-6,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3431.371,3441.766,"Before you start, do we by chance have any of the State Court appealing today, the State court proceedings in the file here?"
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3441.766,3453.281,"Not that I recall, I recall that the docket sheets are something were entered into evidence at the first Federal court hearing but I don't recall that the pleadings themselves were entered."
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.281,3463.628,I would have thought that might have been quite relevant to abstention issues to what the pleadings in the State courts were.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3472.419,3475.21,Not that I recall.
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3475.21,3477.116,I suppose they are available.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3477.116,3478.502,"Oh, certainly."
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3478.502,3486.382,And I suppose you have copies in your own files of the pleadings in the state cases that were filed by the State.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3486.382,3491.662,I have a five door file cabinet full of the things and I am sure it's in there.
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3491.662,3497.156,And you were probably served with the petition for habeas corpus too.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3497.156,3499.857,I don't believe so.
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3505.461,3508.527,So you have ways apparently.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3511.633,3515.466,We could obtain them some how and submit them to the court.
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3515.466,3518.049,"I think it'll be very good, it was an inquiry."
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3518.049,3519.289,I like the –
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3519.289,3521.4,Well would you undertake to get them.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3521.4,3522.322,I will.
1978.78-6,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3522.322,3525.005,The entire file.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3525.005,3527.142,Or files as the case maybe.
1978.78-6,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3528.268,3529.926,Not your files.
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3535.107,3547.837,"I am interested -- for myself, I am interested in the State's pleadings, and any answers to them in the State cases and in the petition for habeas corpus that was filed."
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3547.837,3550.74,State's pleadings are in the record.
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3550.74,3551.672,In this record.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3551.672,3552.771,I believe so.
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3552.771,3554.615,Well not in the printed one --
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3554.615,3559.404,"Not in the appendix but they are in the record, I understood the entire record is in there."
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3559.404,3562.006,Well the entire record of the Three Judge court is here.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3562.006,3566.059,"Yes, I believe the State's pleadings are there, I just do not specifically recall that the habeas --"
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3566.059,3570.236,But you don't make the Federal habeas petition is here.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3570.236,3576.876,"I just now have, I am just reluctant to say this because I can't specifically remember like I do remember the State's pleadings."

1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3585.907,3593.213,Perhaps we should examine the record here and then perhaps request from counsel copies what we need.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3593.213,3598.4,Whichever be satisfied.
1978.78-6,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3620.019,3621.397,But not in the Court of Civil Appeal.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3621.397,3641.796,"But not in the Court of Civil Appeal, likewise a mandamus action for instance against a clerk would be brought in the District Court against a judge, it can be brought in the Supreme Court with original jurisdiction, you just have to get in the right place."
1978.78-6,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3670.074,3686.718,"Mr. Young Section 10 of the judgment says that Section 3408 is unconstitutional on its face and so far as it fails required reports and records of child abuse and neglect and so forth, he made available to the parents the subject of investigation, do I correctly understand you are not appealing from that."
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3686.718,3692.189,That is correct we are not appealing that.
1978.78-6,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3846.014,3847.581,What is REW?
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3847.581,3856.003,"REW is the State Court version of the Woods case, which was temporarily consolidated with this one and is now no longer consolidated."
1978.78-6,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3877.604,3879.857,(Inaudible)
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3879.857,3893.637,"I suggest it should and that's the place to resolve it and like this court one of the ways to get to the Texas Supreme Court is when there is a split in the circuit so to speak, that's where that issue should be resolved."
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3945.641,3948.089,Could I ask you.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3961.399,3974.599,"No, the normal course in Texas is if someone files a petition asking for relief they go to the judge to the clerk and get a hearing on it, and the Sims filed that petition and never asked for a hearing as far as the --"
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3974.599,3976.111,So it's still sitting there.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3976.111,3977.353,It is still there.
1978.78-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3977.353,3981.474,Of course if the children were ultimately returned anyway.
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3981.474,3985.326,And they were returned so long ago that it's problematic whether we could do anything about it.
1978.78-6,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3985.326,3987.327,"Well, that is moot now, isn't it?"
1978.78-6,2,21735,david_h_young,,3987.327,3990.231,"That's one of our contentions, yes."
