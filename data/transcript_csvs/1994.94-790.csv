1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,65.653,69.897,"I am told, though I don't think it is in the record, that he is--"
1994.94-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,69.897,70.768,Is he in custody?
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,70.768,77.24,"--He is on bail in... living in the State of New York, I believe, Justice O'Connor."
1994.94-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,77.24,80.082,Some kind of supervised release status?
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,80.082,82.536,Bail status.
1994.94-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.977,106.449,What would be the effect of our ruling if it were in your favor?
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,106.449,107.881,He would--
1994.94-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.881,110.373,Would he have more time to serve?
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,110.373,110.844,"--Yes, he would."
1994.94-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.016,244.061,Did the Bureau of Prisons have a different interpretation under its 1979 program statement?
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,244.061,247.965,The contention is that it did.
1994.94-790,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,285.027,286.748,If it was jail-like conditions of bail.
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,288.14,303.611,"Well, the use... the policy actually used not the word ""conditions"" but ""jail-like facilities"", and I am told by the Bureau that it was never interpreted in the way that the Third Circuit thought it might be interpreted."
1994.94-790,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,324.334,329.387,"--Mr.... in that case, Mr. Estrada, was it... it was in a jail."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,332.128,345.476,"--The facts that gave rise to the narrow exception, Justice Ginsburg, were that he was required to go back to the jail during the nights and weekends, I believe."
1994.94-790,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,345.476,347.679,--But was out during the day.
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,347.679,348.269,That's correct.
1994.94-790,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.269,353.102,One other question I had about the background of this.
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,361.607,362.579,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-790,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,362.579,366.41,Did he get... he remained in the halfway house at that time.
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,367.662,368.002,No.
1994.94-790,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,368.002,370.723,"That 4 weeks, too, didn't count?"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,370.723,371.024,No.
1994.94-790,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,371.024,372.364,Even though it was postsentence.
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,372.364,395.698,"That's right, because the statute splits up the world into not the... based on the time when the sentence starts, not when the sentence is imposed, and under subsection (a), the sentence starts when usually he shows up at the jail where he is to serve that sentence."
1994.94-790,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,395.698,399.081,Is the claim here being made for those 4 weeks as well as--
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,399.081,399.512,That's correct.
1994.94-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,401.374,401.643,--So--
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,401.643,406.376,"--And under our view, none of that is warranting of credit under the statute."
1994.94-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,431.231,439.289,"--Was there any statutory basis for that change, or was it just a decision of the Bureau of Prisons to change the language?"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,439.289,449.535,"There is no record as to why, when the Bureau republished the 1993 version, it took out the old Waldorf exception."
1994.94-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,449.535,452.736,Does the Bureau of Prisons have rulemaking authority?
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,452.736,454.499,Not as to these matters.
1994.94-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,454.499,459.191,"Then what deference do we owe to the Bureau of Prison's interpretation, do you think?"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,459.191,468.528,"Well, the same deference that you would owe to any other agency's reasonable interpretation of a statute that you have found it is charged with administering."
1994.94-790,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,594.779,611.119,"I can understand... the part that... I understand your fallback argument, because I can understand saying the States have so many different varying programs and these may or may not resemble each other, and it would be a total nightmare to find an absolute rule."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,613.853,615.183,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
1994.94-790,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,615.183,615.553,"Yes, all right."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,673.66,674.191,Well--
1994.94-790,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,674.191,679.434,"If they use the word ""bail"", then it isn't, even if you put them in, like, Marion, during--"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,679.434,679.654,--No--
1994.94-790,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,679.654,685.057,"--or if you do use the word ""bail"" and you don't use... how does that work, that third one?"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,685.057,697.676,"--Our basic contention here, Justice Breyer, is that the word 1984 is evidence of what is usually understood--"
1994.94-790,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,697.676,701.71,"My problem is, suppose the State doesn't use the word ""bail""?"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,701.71,712.837,"--Well, the point I was going to make is that the plain meaning of the word looks to the consequences of the bail decision, not to the label that the State attaches to it, which is to say--"
1994.94-790,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,712.837,715.198,"So then, what is the result in the example I gave?"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,715.198,720.881,"--The result is that if you are in the custody of State prison officials, you're entitled to credit, and--"
1994.94-790,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,720.881,721.111,Fine.
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,724.754,725.435,"--No, it is not."
1994.94-790,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,725.435,727.656,"No, I'm imagining a case."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,745.999,748.551,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
1994.94-790,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,748.551,749.642,"Now, what is the result?"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,749.642,771.645,"The result is that person gets no credit, because if the person is not in that house, as I understand your hypothetical, under the custody and under the control of State prison officials who may take him out without going to the court to ask for authority, and who may do to him many of the things that are done to both convicted prisoners and--"
1994.94-790,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,771.645,778.591,"And then if the judge happens to say, I'm not giving you bail, I'm keeping you confined."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,784.344,808.69,"--I think I understand your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, and the answer is that under our view of the statute the word ""detention"" connotes... the word ""detention"" as used in the credit statute connotes custody by State prison authorities, the old bars example, and it doesn't matter what the State court calls it, it doesn't matter what the prisoner calls it."
1994.94-790,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,809.339,813.553,"Does it matter, Mr. Estrada, whether the prisoner has any notice of the difference?"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,849.176,852.228,--Let me take that in two answers.
1994.94-790,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,897.836,899.889,"Mr. Estrada, this is my concern."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,938.304,940.445,"Well, maybe yes and maybe no."
1994.94-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,947.969,961.369,"Well, I was going to ask, Mr. Estrada, under at least the Federal system, is it open to the prisoner to say that he wants to start serving his time immediately in a detention facility?"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,961.369,973.687,"--It is open to the prisoner to waive his right to bail, and the court of appeals in making the notice argument that Justice Ginsburg was just referring to in effect said that."
1994.94-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,973.687,984.984,"Well, suppose the court said, we don't have room for you in the jail, we're going to put you in a concrete house at 14th Street, where you're not under the supervision of correctional officials, until we have room for you."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,985.425,985.746,Well--
1994.94-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,985.746,986.595,--Could he object to that?
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,986.595,991.44,"--As with all... well, let me take the question in two parts."
1994.94-790,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1018.655,1028.343,"Well, do you think in a case, I assume it would be where there's a short sentence, that if the prisoner wants to get it over with, he can tell the judge, I want to begin serving my time now, and the judge is bound by that?"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1028.343,1028.973,--No.
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.25,1062.496,"Could I ask you, before you go back to that, Mr. Estrada, I want to follow up on Justice Breyer's question."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1088.612,1114.149,"--Yes, but let me explain that as to the second hypothetical, the legal consequence under the bail statute of the court saying bail is denied is that he must be confined into the custody of the Attorney General, so therefore the Court doesn't really have the authority under the bail statute, I don't think, to sort of say, bail is denied, and I'm going--"
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.149,1114.63,"Well, say he does it--"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1114.63,1115.401,--to confine you--
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1115.401,1119.921,"--confined to the custody of the Attorney General, and that custody shall be carried out in the following manner."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1120.933,1121.822,"--No, I don't think he can do that."
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.822,1126.477,But what if the Attorney General then followed up by doing exactly what this judge ordered?
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1126.477,1128.317,That would be a--
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.317,1130.169,Then he'd get credit.
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1130.169,1137.504,"--That's right, Justice Stevens, and it is not our view that the statute would--"
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.504,1143.507,"I gather, then, in both cases there's detention that's only official detention if the Attorney General makes the decision."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1146.58,1152.163,"--In both cases there is detention in some sense of the English word, ""detention""."
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.417,1159.61,It's official if the Attorney General orders it; it's not if the court orders it.
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1159.61,1167.453,"Well, in essence, yes, but let me make two points in response to that, Justice Stevens, because I agree with you that it is a troubling hypothetical."
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.682,1216.775,"I suppose there would be credit even if the Attorney General decided to let the person be free on his or her own recognizance, too."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1218.557,1220.498,--Yes.
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.371,1244.063,"The Attorney General might be curious to find out what surveillance, what a person would do if he was out on his own."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1246.965,1247.686,--Maybe.
1994.94-790,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1280.609,1288.322,"Well, what language of the statute do you rely on in giving credit for time spent in State custody?"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1292.245,1309.958,"Once again, let me make the first answer to that question by emphasizing the answer that I gave to Justice Breyer, which is that it is not our contention that the credit statute incorporates in high verba the definitions of the Bail Reform Act."
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.361,1395.863,May I ask one other question?
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1402.907,1414.965,"We place those in the category of detention, Justice Stevens, and the reason for that is that the Bail Reform Act uses the word ""detention"" not only to refer to the type of--"
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.965,1422.761,"Well, that category of cases, then, the Attorney General would not necessarily be irresponsible to let a person who cannot afford bail free on his own recognizance, would he?"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1422.761,1425.343,"--I'm sorry, Justice Stevens."
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.343,1438.521,"You suggested earlier that it would be irresponsible for a judge to let a person who is remanded to the custody of the Attorney General free on his or her recognizance, because there would necessarily have been a finding of danger to the community or risk of flight."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1438.521,1438.911,That's right.
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1438.911,1442.193,But supposing a person could not make bail and there was no such finding.
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1442.193,1442.824,Well--
1994.94-790,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.824,1445.044,"Then it would not be irresponsible to turn him loose, would it?"
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1445.044,1448.337,"--That is not right, Justice Stevens, for the following reason."
1994.94-790,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1491.634,1492.095,Can I--
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1492.095,1493.036,--to reserve the remainder of my time.
1994.94-790,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1493.036,1495.458,--I want to see if I can get one additional.
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1522.486,1522.937,"I haven't, Justice Breyer."
1994.94-790,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1522.937,1540.898,"Well, but there are a whole range of things called intermediate punishments, and so it's easy for me to think of this wide range of different degrees of confinement, et cetera, and to ask how your clear statement meaning works in that context."
1994.94-790,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1575.94,1598.446,"Our system is based on the notion that most of the States have an authority that puts people in jail and keeps them there, and therefore that is the authority who, if they had custody legally over the defendant, they get the defendant credit, and if that does not happen, then the defendant does not get credit."
1994.94-790,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.026,1602.298,"Yes, very well, Mr. Estrada."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1604.169,1613.034,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-790,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1712.1,1720.145,"Could Mr. Koray have said, when he was acquainted with the terms of his bail, if that's bail, I don't want it?"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1726.908,1728.44,"That's not... I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-790,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1728.44,1732.663,--Could he have withdrawn the request once he heard the terms of the bail?
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1732.663,1734.734,I think he could have withdrawn the request.
1994.94-790,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1795.603,1801.848,So there's no showing... you say that he even requested a change from his jail confinement to his--
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1801.848,1812.405,"That is... the record is not clear, and I'm suggesting to the Court that a chronology of events makes it unlikely that he requested it or that if he requested it he got what he wanted."
1994.94-790,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1838.052,1841.274,--But you just suggested he wouldn't have had a choice anyway--
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1841.274,1842.594,It's--
1994.94-790,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1842.594,1844.146,--that he may not have even asked for bail.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1844.146,1844.667,--It's possible.
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.906,1879.809,"Mr. Rochman, I'm concerned that our recording is not going to be able to get what you're saying--"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1879.809,1880.25,"Thank you, sir."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.25,1881.359,--if you don't stand near the microphone.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1881.359,1882.291,To continue--
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.291,1883.661,It's not a walk-around mike.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1883.661,1886.383,"--I hope I've answered your question, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.383,1886.703,Yes.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1886.703,1891.627,"To continue with my hypothetical, the anomalous result that would occur--"
1994.94-790,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.627,1895.009,"Tell us again, what was it that Mr. Koray had signed?"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1895.009,1903.544,--He signed... there is a portion of the release on conditions order which specifies the conditions of the release.
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.278,1927.571,And that is jail-like.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1927.571,1930.343,"It's hard to imagine it's anything but, sir."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.343,1930.721,Okay.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1958.14,1959.482,That is not jail type confinement.
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.482,1959.782,That is not jail-like.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1967.887,1976.721,"It is not jail-type confinement, sir, because the language of the statute now is ""official detention""."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1984.676,1988.429,I don't see what this has to do with what's jail-like.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1989.779,1990.54,I... I'm sorry.
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1993.292,1994.885,When does it become jail-like?
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,1994.885,1995.583,It becomes--
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.583,2002.699,"A private party, so long as you're remanded to the custody of a private party, related or unrelated, it doesn't matter, right?"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2002.699,2003.029,--Correct.
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.029,2012.015,"Even if this private... you have to report evenings, you have to stay there at night, and if you don't, we'll send a marshall out to bring you back."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2012.015,2019.03,The reason I was beginning to discuss the language of the statute and its history was in an attempt to be responsive to your question.
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2028.735,2029.546,It doesn't help me.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2032.449,2034.659,--Sorry?
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.659,2040.143,"So... I mean, if that makes it easier, let's say, when does it become equivalent to incarceration?"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2040.143,2047.268,"When the person is totally confined, or where there are serious restrictions on the person's liberty and the facility--"
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.268,2051.482,And being at a particular house every night and weekends is not a serious restriction on a person's liberty?
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2051.482,2054.752,"--It could be, but it is not incarceration."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.752,2056.494,It is not incarceration.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2063.407,2067.17,The standard of the criterion that we're looking for is one of jail-type confinement.
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.17,2070.723,"If it's in a private house it's not a jail, and that's okay, then?"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2070.723,2072.303,I'm attempting to answer.
1994.94-790,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.908,2097.811,What are jail-type rules?
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2108.247,2118.364,"Mr. Chief Justice, jail-type rules I think are best exemplified by the allegations Mr. Koray made as to the rules that prevailed at the halfway house that he was at."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2141.421,2143.053,"Well, I know some cases are easy."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2170.779,2173.01,"Well, if Your Honor would be kind enough to give me an example."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2223.804,2224.154,Why not?
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2231.88,2263.491,"--The reason, I think, that incarceration is something that merits sentence credit, or confinement that's equivalent to incarceration is something that merits sentence credit and home confinement and residing in a halfway house but being permitted to go on work release and being referred to a drug treatment facility are not the basis for sentence credit... this is in essence a kind of fairness argument."
1994.94-790,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2309.91,2320.248,"But what about the drug treatment center, where it seems to me, as Justice Scalia suggested, you could be subject to what you have previously called jail--"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2320.248,2320.539,Yes.
1994.94-790,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2320.539,2321.851,--Wait till I finish my question--
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2321.851,2322.031,I'm sorry.
1994.94-790,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2322.322,2322.943,--if you please.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2322.943,2323.644,"I'm sorry, sir."
1994.94-790,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2323.644,2338.792,"You could be subjected to jail... the sort of jail-like conditions you previously mentioned, urine tests, monitoring several times a day, so how do you distinguish that from what you would call incarceration?"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2338.792,2339.863,"Forgive me for interrupting you, sir."
1994.94-790,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2383.791,2384.322,Well then--
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2384.322,2385.664,If the person is there... I'm sorry.
1994.94-790,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2385.664,2397.479,"--this is an exception, then, to your more general rule that if you have jail-like conditions it is incarceration, but it's not if it comes under this other section?"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2397.479,2402.594,"I don't think, Mr. Chief Justice, that I'm suggesting it's an exception."
1994.94-790,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2409.978,2412.48,"Well, is that still another qualification, then?"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2422.217,2441.19,"I have been arguing basically what Judge Sloviter suggested would not be considered incarceration, and I think she is correct simply because, as I said, the statute, 3563, indicates that that kind of confine... if you want to call it... I don't call it confinement."
1994.94-790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2451.325,2475.15,"Well then, why don't we let the statute be the criterion across the board, and Mr. Estrada says the easiest way to do that is to identify the State official who customarily has the legal custody of those who are committed to jails and prisons, and if, during the time in question, the individual is committed to that official's custody, it's detention, if not to that custody, it's not detention."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2481.425,2496.466,"Because the statute, sir, that we are interpreting, unlike 3563, is not clear, and although we say it has a clear... there's a plain meaning to be found, but the words ""official detention""--"
1994.94-790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2496.466,2501.208,"Well, if you construe it the way Mr. Estrada argues, it probably is pretty clear."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2513.226,2544.949,"--It's certainly true that the one virtue that the Bureau of Prisons' position has is that it offers a bright line test, but what we respectfully submit is that the test that can also be proposed, although it may not be a bright line test, still has considerable wattage, and that is simply that the notion of incarceration, defined, again... I don't want to repeat... defined as I have defined it provides a clear standard for courts."
1994.94-790,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2569.713,2575.577,How does this play out if it were in a State... wholly in a State system?
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2588.366,2606.678,"When Your Honor asks, is it any different, the 3585(b)(2) has language broad enough to permit credit, sentence credit for presentence custody by State courts, or in State facilities."
1994.94-790,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2606.678,2610.359,I'm just asking if you had this kind of case wholly within the State court--
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2610.359,2610.659,Yes.
1994.94-790,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2610.659,2621.819,"--where the State court judge had said, release on bail under these conditions, would that or would that not count against... for credit against sentence?"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2621.819,2623.789,Under our interpretation?
1994.94-790,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2623.789,2624.929,No.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2642.509,2644.352,Not that I'm aware.
1994.94-790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2727.987,2736.412,"But do you... I was actually not... I was being slightly dim, because you think, too, they have a clear, bright line test."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2742.878,2743.015,--That's what--
1994.94-790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2743.015,2746.308,--Because the words in the Federal order say custody by the Attorney General.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2749.429,2750.611,"--As well as the Federal, yes."
1994.94-790,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2750.611,2754.684,"Right, so is there, if you try... you have to apply this to the States."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2758.836,2772.514,"I think the answer is no, and the fact that that test doesn't work for State custody it seems to me is yet an additional argument that it is an unreasonable reading of the statute."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2772.514,2773.806,Why doesn't it work for State custody?
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2785.394,2786.726,They may--
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2786.726,2788.316,I thought every State had somebody like that.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2788.316,2792.209,"--They may well have, Justice Scalia, but that is not the Solicitor's test."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.771,2799.502,"No, I thought--"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2804.557,2805.556,Well--
1994.94-790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2805.556,2814.583,Mr. Estrada I thought answered the question saying each State identifies some official as the one to have custody of those who are denied bail.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2814.583,2827.121,"--Well, that may be what Mr. Estrada said today, but that may fall into the category of a post hoc rationalization of a Government lawyer for a position that's not the actual position--"
1994.94-790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2827.121,2829.214,"Well, let's assume that we want to consider that position."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2831.885,2850.068,"--I don't think it would be necessarily difficult to apply, because again, there is probably some officer within the State, but I think it would do violence to the language of the statute based on the Government's interpretation."
1994.94-790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2851.908,2854.779,"Well, but you're rejecting the hypoth... I mean, you're rejecting the position."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2884.55,2887.983,"--It may well be, but it can result in the same anomalous harsh--"
1994.94-790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2887.983,2897.199,It can result in a situation in which there are going to be two cases in which the conditions seem to be about the same but one is on one side of the line and one is on the other.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2901.75,2912.138,--And I think that that potential for resulting unfairness is particularly significant in construing this statute.
1994.94-790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2923.455,2923.836,Well--
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2923.836,2925.076,--against the sentence.
1994.94-790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2925.076,2934.021,"--But don't we also have to accept the fact that even under your own argument, and under any argument I can imagine you making, there isn't going to be complete fairness in sentencing."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2963.062,2967.905,"I think that... I'm not so sure that I agree, sir, that that is an unfairness."
1994.94-790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2969.675,2973.368,"--But I mean, the actual conditions are exactly the same in each case."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2973.368,2980.523,"Well, they are except that when a sentenced prisoner is given home confinement, or is given--"
1994.94-790,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2980.523,2981.793,Halfway house--
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,2981.793,2983.956,"--Halfway house confinement, but it's not confinement."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2994.432,2999.986,"--Well, now, we're not talking about fairness here, we're talking about the word, the phrase, ""official detention""."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,3036.88,3046.746,"But I think in order to work with the phrase, ""initial detention"", one has to consider where the phrase came from, and that brings us to the legislative history of the statute."
1994.94-790,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3162.942,3177.932,"Does that mean, just so I have your position clear, that if in this very facility the order had provided that the inmate, if you want to call him that, could have gone out during the day and attended to his work but had to spend the nights and weekends in the facility, that would not be total confinement?"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,3177.932,3184.815,"I think that's clear from Judge Sloviter's opinion, and that would not be... that would not be total incarceration and therefore would not be official detention."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3184.815,3188.007,"Mr. Rochman, why do you say official detention means custody?"
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,3189.369,3190.231,"Again, sir... I'm sorry."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3198.265,3200.817,--But this was before the Bail Reform Act.
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,3210.922,3211.993,"That... pardon me, sir."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3302.852,3307.887,"Excuse me, I thought the predecessor statute didn't use the term ""official detention"" but it used the term ""custody""."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,3307.887,3308.756,"Yes, sir."
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3309.347,3321.785,"I thought you were saying that the predecessor... I thought you said that the phrase ""official detention"" did not come full-blown at the time that the Bail Reform Act was enacted, but that it had a long history."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,3321.785,3322.166,Yes.
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3322.166,3325.358,"What had a long history is a statute with the word ""custody"" in it."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,3325.358,3326.328,"Yes, sir, but in--"
1994.94-790,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3326.328,3329.099,"Not a statute with the word ""official detention"" in it."
1994.94-790,1,28664,irwin_rochman,,3329.099,3360.651,"--That is correct, but what I said was that in the legislative history, starting in 1973, there were various attempts to amend or revise the statute, and in those suggested revisions of the statute over the years, from 1973 up until 1984, the various Congresses used interchangeably the phrases ""custody"", ""official custody"", ""detention"", and ""official detention""."
1994.94-790,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3360.651,3362.341,"Thank you, Mr. Rochman."

1994.94-790,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3419.93,3420.658,But you don't care about that.
1994.94-790,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3424.391,3424.892,Well--
