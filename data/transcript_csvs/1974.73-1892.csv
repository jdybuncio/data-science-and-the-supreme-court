1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.859,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1892, Weinberger against Wiesenfeld."
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,37.81,40.714,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,537.928,542.144,How do you account for the existing disparity?
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,542.144,553.486,"I think, in large part the disparity flows from the fact that women have longer life expectancies and that their retirement benefits are spread out over a longer period of time."
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1162.06,1162.631,Mr. Jones --
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1162.631,1162.729,Yes.
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1162.729,1179.311,"Do they remain in this Act any differentials based upon gender as to age, another basic one as eliminated in 1972?"
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1179.311,1182.152,That was the only one that I am aware of.
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1208.139,1209.291,Without regard the children?
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1209.291,1211.528,"Without regard to children, that's right."
1974.73-1892,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1218.415,1233.885,"Well, apart from widows and widowers is there another distinction that women beneficiaries on retirement that there is computed -- may retire at age 62 for as on male is at age 65?"
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1233.885,1237.395,This was the difference that was eliminated in the 1972 Act.
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1237.395,1238.434,Who did that?
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1238.434,1239.337,The Congress.
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1239.337,1241.182,"It's on page 15 of your appendix, under the --"
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1241.182,1241.722,That's correct.
1974.73-1892,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1243.637,1248.649,"Well, it might be but haven't you brought a case here and that we having for pending cert?"
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1248.649,1251.575,"Well, we have moved to affirm the judgment of the three judges from the Court."
1974.73-1892,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1251.575,1253.737,"I know but there is such a case here, isn't it?"
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1253.737,1254.384,That's correct.
1974.73-1892,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1259.843,1264.078,Before the -- the 1972 Amendment has now become effective until this year?
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1264.078,1265.316,They're not retroactive.
1974.73-1892,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1265.75,1267.188,And it may become effective in 1975?
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1267.188,1269.867,I think they were phased in over a period of time.
1974.73-1892,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1269.867,1275.136,This rather petition this morning and what you tell us there is that it become effective this year.
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1275.136,1283.545,"Now, let's say a new provision will become effective starting January 1973 and will be fully effective in January 1975."
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1283.545,1283.799,Yes.
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1289.003,1299.339,The Congress there elected to ignore the difference in longevity of women over men?
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1299.339,1304.218,"Well, in fact men were disfavored under the old law and --"
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1304.218,1310.544,"But the point is, they ignored the fact that women as category live longer than men?"
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1310.544,1311.134,That's correct.
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1311.134,1314.821,"And that's within their legislative discussion, I supposed you would say --"
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1314.821,1314.903,Yes.
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1314.903,1317.237,They can ignore it or they act on it?
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1317.237,1318.685,That's right Mr. Chief Justice Burger.
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1332.897,1339.179,Through the old -- the old law was more commensurate with the idea that men lived longer than women.
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1339.179,1343.188,"Yes, an assumption which, if ever true, is no longer --"
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1343.188,1347.732,"Well, that isn't supported that the American experience table of mortality or never has been, is it?"
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1347.732,1349.115,Not that I know of.
1974.73-1892,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1349.115,1360.278,"Well, what was it the basis that they argued the distinction between 62 and 65 under the old law is to favor compensated disfavored class?"
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1360.278,1362.883,It did have the effect of providing women --
1974.73-1892,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1362.883,1364.108,Was it that the Government's argument?
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1364.108,1367.241,Congressional theory?
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1367.241,1372.86,I'm not sure exactly what the Government's argue was in the motion to -- we maybe speaking of different cases.
1974.73-1892,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1377.304,1380.751,I remember it by name.
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1380.751,1387.623,"But of course, Congress doesn't have to locked into favoring disadvantaged classes."
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1390.076,1392.464,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1398.889,1403.128,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2255.311,2258.361,You say the appellant has taken these inconsistent positions.
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2262.938,2263.142,He was --
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2263.142,2268.079,"-- promulgating that for private pension schemes, but that he was carrying out his understanding of a federal statute?"
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2268.079,2271.697,He was carrying out inconsistent congressional commands.
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2276.762,2277.071,Right.
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2277.071,2284.303,-- forbid recipients of federal money from making distinctions of this kind.
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2395.975,2400.697,"Are you familiar, Mrs. Ginsburg with the little of chart on the top of page 15 on the appendix?"
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2400.697,2402.306,"Yes, I am."
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2402.306,2407.81,Could you tell us which one of these are we talking about?
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2407.81,2410.722,We are talking about --
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2410.722,2413.796,Which number?
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2413.796,2414.955,Three.
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2414.955,2415.85,Three?
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2415.85,2418.159,"We are talking about three, that's right."
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2422.952,2423.334,$20 million.
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2423.334,2428.447,"$20 million, right and that is the only one we're talking about in this case."
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2428.447,2431.952,And the -- well --
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2431.952,2453.671,"Of course, there is someone in consistent argument made and that is that the bulk of widowed fathers would not qualify for child and care benefits in any event according to appellant because unlike Stephen Wiesenfeld, they would not devote themselves to child care, but rather to gainful employment."
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2455.041,2457.479,"And the children have to be under what, 18?"
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2457.479,2459.486,Yes.
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2466.63,2468.83,Which means among other things that he is under 18?
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2468.83,2472.556,Yes.
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2498.527,2515.351,"What is the justification for benefits with respect to children, persons under age 18 as distinguished from having a line at 21 or 24 or some other age?"
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2515.351,2521.817,"I don't know why the age line was set, but it's for all benefit purposes under the Social Security Act."
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2528.72,2531.321,But you don't need a baby sitter for --
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2531.321,2531.839,"No, you certainly don't."
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2531.839,2534.356,"While at 14, 16, and 18 year old people, do you?"
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2534.356,2534.959,That's right.
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2553.122,2565.029,"Well, is there any possibility that the reasoning for his claim depends somewhat on this age factor?"
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2565.029,2565.698,The reasoning for --
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2565.698,2570.185,The justification?
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2576.031,2600.32,"Presumably, the greatest need is for very young children, preschools children, and in many cases, the sole surviving parent, male or female, may not avail herself as the statute now stands of this benefit once the child gets beyond preschool age or school age."
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2625.465,2633.661,I suppose we're not confronted with that each problem unless a 19 year old brings at equal protection benefit sometime?
1974.73-1892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2633.661,2656.63,"Well, but 18 years as the voting age now, I think that that is probably unlikely, but in any event, comparing the cost analysis here with the New Jersey Welfare Rights Organization case, that case involved a wholly state funded program for aid to families of the working poor."
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2967.088,2967.996,"Thank you, Mrs. Ginsburg."
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2969.783,2974.504,"Yes, thank you Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3058.321,3060.661,"The thought of a third party beneficiary, you mean?"
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,3060.661,3061.273,That's right.
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3061.273,3066.839,"You mean the purpose of giving benefits to the parent is so that he can stay home and take care of the child, right?"
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,3066.839,3071.272,"Well, I don't think that this legislative history backs that up necessarily that legislative --"
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3071.272,3072.332,What is its purpose then?
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,3072.332,3084.667,"Well, legislative history shows that the purpose of the statute was to distribute benefits in accordance with the probable new of beneficiaries and was made on the individual and not on the family basis."
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3094.916,3099.415,"Yes, but this doesn't unless I can -- if there were no children?"
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,3099.415,3100.54,If there were no children there --
1974.73-1892,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3100.54,3105.046,"At those -- those conditions, those presumptive conditions would still prevail, wouldn't they?"
1974.73-1892,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,3105.046,3106.64,If there are no children.
1974.73-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3128.409,3129.672,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
