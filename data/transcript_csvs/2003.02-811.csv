2003.02-811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.538,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 02-811, Jeff Groh v. John... Joseph R. Ramirez."
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,10.774,13.996,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,58.495,63.984,"Mr. Cordray, what does the Constitution provide specifically about this?"
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,63.984,78.119,"--The Constitution provides that individuals will not be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures and that warrants will not issue except upon probable cause, and stating with particularity the items to... place to be searched, items to be seized."
2003.02-811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,78.119,81.157,"With regard to that last phrase, why don't we just apply it?"
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,81.157,85.327,I think you do apply it in this case and this warrant here--
2003.02-811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,85.327,86.813,But the warrant refers to the house.
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,86.813,87.928,--Yes.
2003.02-811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,87.928,91.166,It doesn't list anything that they were searching for.
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,91.166,98.785,"The warrant itself... and if we turn to the petition for certiorari appendix, page 26a, specifically references the affidavit."
2003.02-811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,108.833,109.809,Who prepared the warrant?
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,109.809,114.184,--The draft of the warrant form itself was done initially by Agent Groh.
2003.02-811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.558,123.842,"Well, but on its face it referred to the house, not the items being looked for."
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,123.842,126.731,"It did, and that's the mistaken description on the face of the warrant."
2003.02-811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.467,132.183,"Well, you know, why not just apply the constitutional provision?"
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,137.012,138.953,"--Well, I... I think there's two questions there."
2003.02-811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.408,150.72,But the affidavit was not attached to the warrant.
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,150.72,157.074,"--It was attached to the warrant, accompanied the warrant when... when the materials went to the magistrate for approval... it was--"
2003.02-811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.074,160.379,"Yeah, but not... not when it was taken to be executed."
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,160.379,164.837,--It... it also accompanied the warrant when the officers were briefed on the nature of the search.
2003.02-811,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,175.694,204.301,"It... it... it seems to me that at... at some point in this analysis of... and specifically on the point that you're addressing with Justice O'Connor... that you have to confront the language in... in Leon in which the Court said, depending on the circumstances of the particular case, a warrant may be facially... so facially deficient that it cannot comply with the Leon rule."
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,229.481,231.793,"--Yes, although this Court has--"
2003.02-811,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,231.793,234.273,"And it might be that the Sheppard case is what helps you, but--"
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,234.273,235.592,"--I think it does, Your Honor."
2003.02-811,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,256.851,257.882,--Mr. Cordray--
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,263.64,266.716,They were on all fours in two respects.
2003.02-811,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,274.435,276.171,"Right, almost as bad as the mistake here."
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,276.171,280.091,"Yeah, in... in some ways worse, because it specified the search for different evidence."
2003.02-811,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,285.831,291.237,But did the Massachusetts case have a cross-reference to an affidavit even though the affidavit wasn't appended?
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,291.237,300.979,"--It did not, in fact, and the Court said that if it had contained some sort of cross-reference, then you could inform the contents of the warrant from the contents of the affidavit."
2003.02-811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,302.178,307.379,But doesn't it make sense to assume that the cross-reference has to be capable of informing of what is left out?
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,319.183,320.381,--I think that's--
2003.02-811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,320.381,323.065,And once again I guess I go back to Justice O'Connor's question.
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,332.148,335.78,--I... I think that that's not true in the important respects under the Fourth Amendment.
2003.02-811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,340.693,347.502,"The Fourth Amendment says it's the warrant that is supposed to particularly describe, not documents given to a magistrate."
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,347.502,352.582,--What I'm saying is there are three different potential times that matter here.
2003.02-811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,379.991,394.852,"Whether... whether the homeowner has the right or whether the point is to make sure that the officers executing the warrant can check what's in front of them and find out how far to go, the fact remains that the Fourth Amendment says the warrant is supposed to particularly describe."
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,398.688,400.136,"--That's not correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,406.656,410.0,"It may refer to it, but if it's not there, nobody can figure out what it says."
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,410.0,416.521,"--Well, they can, in fact, because the documented record before the magistrate allows posterior judicial oversight of how the search--"
2003.02-811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,416.521,418.09,Not when the police are at the scene they can't.
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,418.09,418.629,--That is correct.
2003.02-811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,425.688,430.146,It doesn't have to make that assumption in... in order to apply the Fourth Amendment as written.
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,439.146,439.556,--Correct.
2003.02-811,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.496,450.58,"But there's some might not... some might not have been like the officer here, like Officer Groh, might not have even seen the attached affidavit."
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,481.62,484.138,--This was a subject of discussion in Sheppard.
2003.02-811,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.992,503.79,"So that... that case doesn't answer the question, was there a Fourth Amendment violation?"
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,503.79,504.737,--I would agree with you that--
2003.02-811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,504.737,505.769,And why do you have to ask that question?
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,505.769,506.595,--Beg your pardon?
2003.02-811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,506.595,508.081,Why do you have to ask that question?
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,525.748,526.37,Well--
2003.02-811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,526.37,537.803,"If... if I disagree with you that there... that there is a Fourth Amendment violation, do I have to find that it was proper as a remedy for that violation to hold... to hold this agent liable?"
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,537.803,550.147,"--Certainly not, Your Honor, and I do agree with Justice Ginsburg's point that Sheppard is probably more germane to the qualified immunity inquiry here than perhaps to the Fourth Amendment inquiry, given that the Court did not explicitly decide the Fourth Amendment issue in Sheppard."
2003.02-811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,608.597,612.562,"Well, you... you say, the Ninth Circuit said they couldn't inform the homeowner?"
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,612.562,616.11,--Said that that would not be sufficient to... to correct--
2003.02-811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,616.11,624.755,"Yeah, it didn't say that they couldn't have, but it's... it's... the Ninth Circuit said that the homeowner had a right to be shown the warrant, I take it, did it not?"
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,624.755,639.227,"--Didn't specifically hold that, but certainly seemed to presume it, that the... not only the warrant but all the supporting materials so that the homeowner could exercise some self-help right at the scene, block the officers, and attempt to interfere with their execution of--"
2003.02-811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,639.227,639.683,The Ninth--
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,648.144,661.353,"--Criminal Rule 41, which this Court has said incorporates or is certainly consistent with Fourth Amendment principles, says that a warrant needs to be left at the scene after a search is completed if property is taken along with an inventory of the property."
2003.02-811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,667.668,671.466,Doesn't it talk... or correct me if I'm wrong... about serving the warrant?
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,671.466,674.688,--It... it talks about a number of things.
2003.02-811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,693.674,696.358,Where is that in the papers?
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,696.358,699.042,--It's not in the documents here.
2003.02-811,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.451,733.071,"You mentioned the later documentation, but isn't there an interest in letting the homeowner know that the man has authority to make the search?"
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,733.071,734.707,"--Yes, which Agent Groh--"
2003.02-811,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.707,737.308,"So, shouldn't... shouldn't he have to display it if... if requested?"
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,737.308,744.078,"--I believe that if... if he's asked for the warrant before he can enter, what would be reasonable in the circumstances would be to show the warrant."
2003.02-811,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,744.078,745.443,And he'd have a duty to do that?
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,745.443,751.137,"I... I believe that in many cases that would be the most reasonable thing, and therefore perhaps the Constitution would have required it."
2003.02-811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,751.137,751.425,That's not my question.
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,752.168,756.505,"I'm not certain of that, but I think it would be better practice and reasonable conduct."
2003.02-811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,756.505,757.081,Go back--
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,761.168,761.622,Sure.
2003.02-811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,761.622,764.429,I thought that this was a very simple case.
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,781.276,783.049,"Yeah, except that before printing the affidavit--"
2003.02-811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,783.049,783.505,Nobody.
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,841.462,841.917,--Sure.
2003.02-811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,861.858,879.773,"Now... now tell me why, because as I've made my point, it sounds to me that this man did not behave sensibly, because if he just looked at the piece of paper he would have seen in 3 seconds it says, seize the house, and we're not out here to seize the house, we're out to seize some guns."
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,879.773,880.721,--The magistrate--
2003.02-811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,880.721,883.116,"So it wasn't like a minor, common mistake--"
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,883.116,883.693,--The magistrate--
2003.02-811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,883.693,884.436,--so why was that reasonable?
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,884.436,887.408,--The magistrate also looked at this piece of paper and failed to notice the error.
2003.02-811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,888.401,888.994,So two people--
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,890.918,893.064,--Because he signed the piece of paper.
2003.02-811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,893.064,906.234,"Any magistrate who looked at that piece of paper would say your warrant... your warrant application or the form you've given me does not indicate what you're searching for, unless you really are going to put the house up on a flatbed truck and take it away, which we know you're not."
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,931.042,935.334,It's hard for me to know exactly what happened subject with the magistrate.
2003.02-811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.077,945.548,Maybe he should be liable too.
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,955.025,958.33,"Let me bore in on the qualified immunity issue, if I may, on both counts."
2003.02-811,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,958.906,960.681,"Before you do that, just one preliminary question."
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,975.253,978.409,"--That's how we read the Court's cases, at least to the last 6 or 7 years."
2003.02-811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,980.078,981.647,"That may well be, but you don't have to argue it."
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,982.557,983.3,That's fine.
2003.02-811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.3,984.165,--didn't have to argue it--
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,984.165,984.448,That's fine.
2003.02-811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.448,985.734,--not that we don't have to decide it.
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,985.734,986.272,That's fine.
2003.02-811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1007.199,1009.14,He didn't have a bad motive?
2003.02-811,0,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1009.14,1014.712,"No, I mean that he... he acted in good faith, objectively, reasonably on the course of the record."
2003.02-811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1089.348,1090.63,"Very well, Mr. Cordray."
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1092.32,1098.636,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-811,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1135.09,1137.403,So do you say this is just a technical mistake?
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1148.177,1153.128,"And it... the question in that case, Your Honor, would be, is it clear what the magistrate authorized?"
2003.02-811,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.037,1154.426,"No, it isn't clear."
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1155.152,1158.595,"--In... in that case, if it is not clear, then there is a violation of the particularity requirement--"
2003.02-811,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1158.595,1162.788,"But you're saying here it's clear because the affidavit said it, but the affidavit's locked away somewhere and nobody can look at it."
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1162.788,1181.735,"--No, it's... it... is... in fact it was unsealed, and typically when warrants are put... when applications are placed under seal, there's a provision for unsealing the application upon the indictment or after a period of time, or a motion to unseal can be brought, which could have been done in this case, but in fact, the motion was brought by the Government in the... in the first place."
2003.02-811,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1181.735,1189.331,"So, in fact, what a homeowner's supposed to do is if the warrant... he looks at it, by the way, it's blank, it's blank."
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1205.307,1214.529,"The Fourth Amendment does not protect, contrary to the Ninth Circuit's belief, the Fourth Amendment does not protect the... a supposed interest in reviewing the warrant during the search."
2003.02-811,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1234.491,1250.838,"Well, I don't want... the... the court of appeals seemed to envision some sort of a collaborative proceeding where there's a conversation between the officers executing the warrant and the homeowner and... and that... that seemed to me without foundation."
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1257.403,1264.767,"--Under Rule 41, the right attaches when property is seized, as part of the receipt for the property that's seized."
2003.02-811,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1265.881,1269.951,"Well, I... I know, but there's a knock on the door and the policeman says, I have a warrant."
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1274.493,1281.652,"--No, again that would be analyzed under the law of knock and announce, and it may be reasonable under the circumstances--"
2003.02-811,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1281.652,1284.524,"If they have a warrant, do I have a right to read the warrant?"
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1284.524,1287.33,--And the question would be--
2003.02-811,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1287.33,1287.951,The homeowner.
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1287.951,1296.329,"--If... if the homeowner denied entry until a copy of the warrant is provided, the officer would be faced with the question, is this a constructive denial of entry?"
2003.02-811,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1300.5,1308.878,"No, there... no, there... there's no exigency because there's only one person there and he's at the door and that person says, I'd like to read this warrant."
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1311.85,1326.135,"--If there were no exigencies, then ordinarily the reasonableness principle probably would require that, but the purpose of the particularity requirement, it's very clear, is to ensure that the search is conducted in accordance with what the magistrate authorized."
2003.02-811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1326.135,1331.269,Why isn't that in our rule if... if you're willing to concede that that's a constitutional requirement?
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1331.269,1333.026,We... we are not conceding it's a constitutional requirement.
2003.02-811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1334.241,1338.494,"Well, that... you say... you say it's part of the reasonableness requirement to show it to the homeowner if he demands it."
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1338.494,1343.9,--Under... under circumstances where there is no exigency where the request to see the warrant--

2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1353.81,1363.674,"--If... if the choice... if the homeowner denies entry, there's no exigency, and the officer's faced with the choice of break down the door or show the warrant, then reasonableness may require showing the warrant."
2003.02-811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.73,1379.445,Your... your point about electronic surveillance seems to me quite... quite forceful.

2003.02-811,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1408.051,1417.255,"But you... but you are saying that in... in circumstances, you gave an example, the reasonableness requirement would result in an obligation to show the warrant."

2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1469.452,1474.198,--The... the question... the question in that case would be whether the search was conducted within the scope of the warrant.
2003.02-811,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1476.327,1482.727,"The question is whether it's a reasonable search, and that includes an... an issue about the manner in which the warrant is executed."
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1482.727,1488.094,--A... a search would not be rendered unreasonable by virtue of a discussion between the officers and the citizen.
2003.02-811,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1491.355,1502.046,"Well, I... I suppose that the officer doesn't have to take the word of the homeowner either that I'm getting you exactly what you want, you know, if the guy's charged with some sort of fraud, maybe he's going to continue."
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1502.046,1511.705,"--That... that's true and, of course, the things that are seized may not conform to the warrant because of the plain view rule that the officer may seize things that aren't covered in the rest of the warrant."
2003.02-811,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1511.705,1512.16,But--
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1512.16,1513.563,"Now, under the law of qualified immunity--"
2003.02-811,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1513.563,1523.966,"--Mr. Schlick, as far as the rule is concerned, the rule... the heading is receipt, so the rule... rule doesn't address this problem."
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1547.826,1551.913,--The only requirement to providing the warrant is if property is taken away.
2003.02-811,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1585.349,1596.866,"But if he had been on the way to the residence and 3 minutes before he got there, the residents say, oh, this is a terrible mistake here, would he have the obligation to turn around and go back or have somebody bring him the affidavit out?"
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1596.866,1601.325,"Under Steele, the question would be whether it was sufficiently clear what the magistrate authorized."
2003.02-811,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1613.092,1618.293,"So... so that... so that even if he sees the mistake before he makes the entry on the premises, he can... he can proceed?"
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1618.293,1620.894,"--If it's sufficiently clear under Steele, yes."
2003.02-811,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1620.894,1621.97,And under these facts?
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1621.97,1622.835,"Yes, yes."
2003.02-811,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1647.066,1649.501,"Well, but... but then... but then you're saying this warrant is sufficient?"
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1649.501,1650.244,--Yes.
2003.02-811,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1651.07,1657.181,So... so... you want us to write an opinion to say that we can have warrants like this all the time and there's no problem.
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1657.181,1666.219,"--Again, that's the constitutional rule, but as a practical matter, officers are not going to take risks when they're... when they don't face an exigent circumstance--"
2003.02-811,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1666.219,1673.611,Talking about a constitutional minimum... you say that a constitutional minimum... this warrant would... is... is adequate under the Fourth Amendment in all circumstances?
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1673.611,1688.389,"--Under these circumstances, which include particularly the references in the warrant, Agent Groh's application and affidavit, which include the clear lift... list... in his application and the magistrate's signature on the warrant without making any edits."
2003.02-811,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1704.38,1704.857,I did see it.
2003.02-811,1,16899,austin_c_schlick,,1713.402,1715.593,"--And... and in this case, if Agent Groh had glanced--"
2003.02-811,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.593,1718.769,"Thank you, Mr. Schlick."
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,1724.798,1729.628,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.831,1758.4,Where... where do... where do we say that?
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,1760.562,1767.855,"--Yes, Your Honor, you say that in... it was actually quoted in the McGrew case."

2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,1826.1,1831.468,"With... with respect to a wiretap, you have some exigent circumstances there."

2003.02-811,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1865.193,1866.801,Why are you taking that position then?
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,1884.595,1887.484,"--Your... Your Honor, that... that is correct."
2003.02-811,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1970.826,1977.763,"Why, when McGrew didn't issue until 6 months after the conduct in question?"
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,1996.832,2005.006,"Your Honor, McGrew was decided 6 months after the search in this case."
2003.02-811,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2013.262,2020.793,"But what made the law clear in the Ninth Circuit was not the timing of the McGrew search, but the ruling of the Ninth Circuit."
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2020.793,2054.418,"--The... the McGrew decision said that it was clearly established at... through their... their prior decisions of the requirement that the warrant refer to and either have attached to or accompany the affidavit if you wanted to... to use it as a basis to meet the particularity requirement, and it... it looked at other cases besides just that one."
2003.02-811,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2058.588,2064.243,"I see that there is a serious question, I think, underlying what you're saying."
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2128.062,2141.315,Because it's a... not to have that warrant or the supporting documentation to the warrant present to meet the particularity requirement is an opportunity for abuse.
2003.02-811,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2141.315,2144.697,What kind of abuse?
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2144.697,2167.897,"To be abuse to... to the... that the officer can come to the home, say I'm planning... I'm planning to search for... for something, ransack the house, find nothing, leave no warrant, and the person has no idea of the legal authority of... of why the officer was there, what he was doing there."
2003.02-811,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2178.012,2183.585,"But he didn't, and that goes back to a question that Justice Scalia raised earlier."
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2209.607,2211.282,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-811,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2232.004,2245.379,"But the damages here, nothing happened here that would not have happened if the right portion of the application had been copied into the warrant."

2003.02-811,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2280.096,2282.902,"Well, but we're asking what the general requirement is."
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2311.509,2312.214,"--Well, you're--"
2003.02-811,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2312.214,2314.11,Let's assume that that's done.
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2322.738,2340.282,"--Yes, Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit said that and, in fact, in the Gant case, which was cited in... in McGrew, they said that there's a... a duty of the officer under the rule to provide the homeowner with the warrant prior to leaving the scene."
2003.02-811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2340.282,2342.057,"Under the rule, they said?"
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2344.658,2346.144,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2346.144,2347.053,"That's not true, is it?"
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2350.868,2351.289,No.
2003.02-811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.289,2352.997,"--but it doesn't appear in the rule at all, does it?"
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2352.997,2386.351,"The... the Gant decision that referred to the... to the rule was looking at the... the argument was made in that case by the Government that the rule only required it, and said that since the... the Katz decision says that it... the rule does not invariably require it to... the Government to serve the warrant, that it must usually require that it be done."
2003.02-811,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2386.351,2393.205,Doesn't say anything at all about warrant when no property is taken.
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2408.809,2430.479,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that's the... the real problem in this... in this case, when if... if there is no duty to leave a warrant, as suggested by the... the United States in their... their brief when no property is taken, then it's the invitation to abuse that I... I talked about earlier."
2003.02-811,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2430.479,2434.277,"Well, but do you... do you have to... do you have to maintain that position to win your case?"
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2440.593,2441.253,No.
2003.02-811,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2452.11,2457.311,Can we get back to the question I think that you hadn't completed your answer to before?
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2483.113,2500.407,The damage is the fact that their constitutional right to have a... a properly executed and a properly written warrant prior to the invasion of the home.
2003.02-811,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2500.407,2503.091,So--
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2517.209,2518.407,Correct.
2003.02-811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.407,2532.153,"And then it goes on to say, and any warrants, you know, where you need a warrant shall particularly describe the... the person or place to be searched and the items to be seized."
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2559.662,2590.398,"Because there was no effort on the part of Agent Groh to comply with that particular requirement, and that leads to the opportunity for abuse because he... there is no evidence in the... in the record to show that he had any... did anything to comply... to see that he had a warrant that met the particularity requirement."
2003.02-811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.398,2604.144,"But... but there's nothing in the Fourth Amendment that requires a warrant, even for the entry into a home, and as you know of, many entries into homes are done without a warrant when there are exigent circumstances."
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2648.893,2654.133,It does not require a warrant all the time if there are exigent circumstances.
2003.02-811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2656.612,2658.303,"Well, that's not the only exception."
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2680.966,2699.337,"Because I think the... that would trivialize the... the requirement of the particularity clause, because particularity as well as probable cause weigh into the... the general warrant situation and--"
2003.02-811,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2699.337,2702.764,Are you... you suggesting that maybe it was unreasonable?
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2721.09,2735.512,"--That... that's correct, and he... he should have done that, because the... the problem here is that there was... it was plain for everyone to see."
2003.02-811,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2748.749,2766.332,"With respect to Leon, Mr. Cordray urged that if you would meet the good-faith exception, in any case where the good-faith exception would apply so the evidence isn't suppressed, the officer would have qualified immunity."

2003.02-811,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2828.709,2829.368,"--All right, fine."
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2857.52,2863.26,We're seeking money damages that a... a jury would--

2003.02-811,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2870.03,2872.714,What have you asked for in the complaint?
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2872.714,2876.225,--We didn't put... specify a dollar amount in the complaint.
2003.02-811,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2876.225,2879.773,Is there any way it could be more than a dollar?
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2885.263,2897.234,"Yes, it is... yes, it is, Your Honor, because the trauma... the traumatization that Mrs. Ramirez went through by agents coming into her home and saying, we have a warrant to search for explosives--"
2003.02-811,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2897.234,2899.669,--Is different from what it would have happened an hour later?
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2902.353,2902.974,"--Yes, yes."
2003.02-811,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2902.974,2906.356,--would have happened if they'd corrected the error and gone back and done the same thing--
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2906.356,2906.811,That... that's correct--
2003.02-811,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2906.811,2907.554,--because?
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2907.554,2924.272,"--Because there was that time frame, and in this case it was a continue of a time frame that she was under... under the fright of people being in her home, searching it, ransacking it, going... going through it."
2003.02-811,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2936.344,2948.709,But I... I thought the facts say that they correctly... at least in the petitioner's brief... they say that they correctly notified the homeowner about the purpose and objects of the search.
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2948.709,2956.677,"--That would be an oral notification, and there is no assurance given to the... through oral notification, he could make up anything he wants."
2003.02-811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2956.677,2967.534,"You think when the Fourth Amendment was adopted or when the English tradition that underlaid the Fourth Amendment was... was formed, most people could read a warrant?"
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,2967.534,2972.652,"I don't know, Your Honor."
2003.02-811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.652,2982.478,Then... then do you think the homeowners would have the right to exclude the constable until he could get somebody who was literate to read the warrant that the constable presented to him?
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3013.769,3021.404,"Well, that makes an assumption of what took place there."
2003.02-811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3025.12,3028.918,"Well, we might... we... maybe we should add that requirement to the Fourth Amendment."
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3059.216,3063.386,--If the... the--
2003.02-811,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3063.386,3068.504,Are you really... is it really a fight about attorneys' fees because it's taken so long to get up here?
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3068.504,3070.983,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.02-811,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3070.983,3071.438,No?
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3071.438,3073.129,No.
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3077.421,3079.733,I assume it will.
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3117.339,3120.311,"Yes, they did go to search the entire ranch."
2003.02-811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3120.311,3120.867,"Oh, they did?"
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3120.867,3126.234,And they did look in various other buildings.
2003.02-811,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3139.443,3139.897,I see.
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3152.612,3154.264,"--Yes, that's--"
2003.02-811,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3154.264,3155.296,I see.
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3155.296,3155.834,--That's correct.
2003.02-811,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3165.222,3179.24,"This would be... no, I wouldn't... you wouldn't obviously be searching for the blue house, but you might read this as having confined the search to the blue house as opposed to the entire ranch, which is described... but you... but that... that wasn't done."
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3179.24,3179.999,--No.
2003.02-811,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3179.999,3183.614,So then it is really nonsensical on its face.
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3183.614,3186.67,That's the position that we've taken all along.
2003.02-811,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3186.67,3210.197,"Well, so far as damages are concerned, I suppose your claim is analogous to a common law trespass, that someone has come on the... come on your property without any right to do so, and so you... you could analogize that to whatever damages you could get for a trespass."
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3210.197,3213.131,"That would be correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-811,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3229.682,3234.718,But I thought you did make some kind of enumeration.
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3245.37,3247.244,"Yes, that's correct."
2003.02-811,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3250.776,3263.862,"Oh, yes, the reputation to the... the reputation in the neighborhood, but that would have been affected just the same if the police came there with an entirely proper warrant."
2003.02-811,2,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3263.862,3269.723,--That's... that damage would have been the... been the same.
2003.02-811,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3355.627,3358.024,"Thank you, Mr. Kozakiewicz."
2003.02-811,3,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3360.746,3371.891,"Your Honor, on the qualified immunity point, there is plain language in the Constitution as to what the Fourth Amendment says, but this Court said in Anderson v. Creighton, that is not the correct approach."
2003.02-811,3,38933,richard_a_cordray,,3504.114,3508.822,Would they have had a duty to turn around if they'd noticed the error 5 minutes before they'd come to the property?
2003.02-811,4,43626,vincent_j_kozakiewicz,,3508.822,3510.224,That is a debatable question.
2003.02-811,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3543.373,3545.064,"Thank you, Mr. Cordray."
