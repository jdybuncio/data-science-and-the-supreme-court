1987.87-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.982,"We will hear argument next in Number 87-157, Allied Tube and Conduit Corporation versus Indian Head, Inc.--"
1987.87-157,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,63.224,113.095,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Court's writ in this case to the second circuit brings up for review questions relating to the scope and meaning of the so-called Noerr, Pennington doctrine, a doctrine which, as this Court knows, made clear that the Sherman Act is not applicable to combinations of businessmen associated together for the purpose of attempting to influence or for the purpose of seeking legislation beneficial to themselves in association and unfavorable to their competitors."
1987.87-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,530.004,533.424,"Mr. Frankel, the case was submitted to the jury on interrogatories?"
1987.87-157,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,533.424,544.278,"Yes, Your Honor, and the answers to those interrogatories will be found at Pages 23, 4, and 5 of this slender joint appendix."
1987.87-157,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,870.211,875.069,"Mr. Frankel, what does the Court's holding in Noerr rest on?"
1987.87-157,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,880.286,897.95,"--No, I think strictly, Justice O'Connor, Noerr rests on a construction of the Sherman strictly, that whatever else you might say about that reprehensible conduct, it was not conduct at which the Sherman Act was aimed."
1987.87-157,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,898.59,907.087,"Well, is that interpretation of the Sherman Act required because of some constitutional provision, do you suppose?"
1987.87-157,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,907.087,938.589,"--Well, I would say, to try my best to report Justicue Black's opinion accurately, that after saying that this is not Sherman Act conduct, he went on to say in that many words that if we were to rule otherwise, we would run into serious concerns under the First Amendment because we would be cutting into or we might be cutting into the right of association and the right through association to petition the government."
1987.87-157,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1092.433,1100.508,"Well, I suppose in a sense it is direct insofar as Members of Congress are also members of the public."
1987.87-157,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1100.508,1115.346,"In that sense, Justice O'Connor, it is direct, but I don't think there is a word in the Noerr opinion that describes directness in any such sense."
1987.87-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.767,1167.013,"Judge Frankel, it is true that it goes directly into the statute books but only after the various legislatures decide to put it in the statute books."
1987.87-157,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1167.013,1188.536,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is correct, and similarly, whatever public influence was exerted by that vicious publicity campaign in Noerr only eventuated in the legislative conduct that the railroads sought when the legislators took the action that is for them to take."
1987.87-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1188.536,1200.718,"And your position is, Mr. Frankel, that because of Noerr, Pennington the defendants here could act unreasonably in influencing that Code."
1987.87-157,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1200.718,1203.561,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1371.04,1378.161,"Mr. Frankel, I thought it was not really undisputed that the adoption of the Code was automatic."
1987.87-157,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1387.11,1389.173,"--Yes, I said in a number of states."
1987.87-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1389.173,1390.328,"Oh, I am sorry."
1987.87-157,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1390.328,1466.064,"Actually, in Judge Lombard's opinion, I believe it may be the first footnote, you will find him saving that this is the most widely adopted Code, and if I just find his first footnote rather than mine I might be able to read to Your Honor, and he cites specifics from an affidavit on our behalf, that is, that 26 states adopted verbatim, 19 adopted with amendments, and if you pursue that it appears that maybe ten or eleven of the 114 articles in this Code tend to be amended, and the municipalities, which are very important in this regard, also widely adopt it, and it says here, and I think the survey was of municipalities of over 100,000 population, 232 adopted this Code exactly as written, 256 adopted it and made changes on average changing only eleven articles, but compare--"
1987.87-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1466.064,1468.078,"Mr. Frankel, could you clarify that?"
1987.87-157,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1495.521,1499.737,"--Your Honor, the Code comes out every three years, but I am stalling just a bit."
1987.87-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1508.061,1512.841,"It would be much more impressive, of course, if it is automatic and if you know when you get an amendment to this it will automatically go into the law."
1987.87-157,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1512.841,1534.973,--I would in ignorance settle for its not being automatic and for the legislators looking at it every three years and looking at these 700 pages and deciding that they can do no better or other than adopt this Code as it is written.
1987.87-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1589.467,1590.777,Mr. Frankel--
1987.87-157,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1590.777,1591.856,--Your Honor.
1987.87-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1591.856,1616.503,"--if we find that the jury was properly instructed, and if we find that the evidence supports the verdict on liability, do we still have before us here the question of damages, or is your case then concluded against--"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,1711.168,1724.804,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, let me begin by turning directly to Noerr."
1987.87-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1900.374,1916.54,"Mr. Yerman, just by way of clarification, do you concede that your client is not entitled to damages flowing from any governmental agency's decision to adopt the National Electrical Code?"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,1916.54,1918.272,"For purposes of this case, I am, Justice O'Connor."
1987.87-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1922.928,1928.504,"Just the independent marketplace injury, for example, in states that didn't adopt the Code?"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,1928.504,1930.659,"--That is all we are talking about, exactly."
1987.87-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1936.344,1941.233,And you didn't put evidence in of damages in states that adopted the code.
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,1941.936,1942.576,--Right.
1987.87-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.981,2147.616,"Mr. Yerman, you state as sort of a given that this would be an anti-trust violation absent the legislative involvement at the end of it all."
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2147.616,2147.898,Yes.
1987.87-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.898,2151.225,Is that entirely clear?
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2188.07,2193.192,"Justice Scalia, I am really glad to asked that question, because I think it goes to the heart of why Noerr doesn't apply here."
1987.87-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2209.765,2211.577,"I am not asking about Noerr, you understand."
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2211.577,2218.277,"Well, I do understand, and I think in this respect both the rule of reason and Noerr in a way come together, because I think I can answer your question two ways."
1987.87-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.175,2243.204,"What if they were evilly motivated, that they gave their views but their intent was to suppress competition?"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2243.204,2245.422,--I think at that point I would have a problem.
1987.87-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.851,0.0,"Oh, no, but correct data."
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2264.148,2265.725,--Then I have no problem at all.
1987.87-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.725,2274.425,"Even though they talk with one another, and of course to say that they are not motivated by anti-competitive considerations is absurd."
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2288.733,2289.295,Absolutely.
1987.87-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2291.373,2293.637,Even if they get together and publish a pamphlet?
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2293.637,2294.059,Yes.
1987.87-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2294.059,2295.292,Jointly?
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2295.292,2295.777,Yes.
1987.87-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2295.777,2298.103,"To present, to express their views?"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2298.103,2302.836,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, that goes on every day in private standard-making, and I have no problem with that."
1987.87-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2302.836,2303.616,So does stacking meetings.
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2321.891,2323.656,That's the root of the issue.
1987.87-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.363,2430.253,How does that constitute an anti-trust violation?
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2464.77,2469.674,"--The jury was instructed on this as well, and it is the same way you do any rule of reason analysis."
1987.87-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.898,2574.492,Excuse me.
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2647.493,2653.241,"In this case, corruption in this case was in effect the dilution of the votes, of all--"
1987.87-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2653.241,2656.302,But there was no rule against dilution of votes.
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2656.302,2659.208,--There was no specific rule that said that.
1987.87-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2674.935,2681.074,"Well, is it just a question then the jury decides on all the evidence whether something was ""corrupt"" or not?"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2681.074,2683.057,"In this case, in effect, yes."
1987.87-157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.915,2699.052,"xxx any question, or is there any issue here before us as to the correctness of the legal rules the District Court applied?"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2699.052,2701.378,--The charge was never objected to.
1987.87-157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2703.142,2707.938,So the issue is just whether any jury could have found under these instructions--
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2707.938,2709.593,"That is not an issue either, Justice White."
1987.87-157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2714.341,2719.902,--What question about the Sherman Act is involved here?
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2719.902,2726.304,I think that they argue that there is no rule of reason violation here based upon the evidence as a matter of law.
1987.87-157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.304,2732.364,"All right, then the question is, is there enough evidence to support the jury's verdict?"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2732.364,2738.738,"Well, I mean, I really don't think that's the question, because I think that the jury sufficiency issue is already resolved."
1987.87-157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.672,2760.541,"Well, I take it your brief, this red brief, the second question you listed is, if petitioner's conspiracy was not immunized by the Noerr doctrine, was there evidence to support the jury's determination that the conspiracy in question unreasonably restrained trade?"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2760.541,2761.181,I think--
1987.87-157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.181,2764.43,"Now, that is... I just asked you if that is in issue."
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2764.43,2764.774,--Fair enough.
1987.87-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2773.786,2777.003,I think it was put more felicitously in the petition.
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2791.137,2792.793,Fair enough.
1987.87-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2906.887,2910.073,"Was the word ""consensus"" in the organization's bylaws?"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2910.073,2910.964,"Oh, absolutely."
1987.87-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2916.508,2919.148,"Mr. Yerman, just let me ask before we get off--"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2919.148,2919.304,--Yes.
1987.87-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.304,2939.092,"--Suppose they hadn't gotten new members within the 30... you know, before the 30-day deadline, but had simply called up all of the people, all of their steel-making conduit buddies and said it is an important vote, we think this stuff is unsafe, but more important, it is really going to hurt our business."
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2946.34,2952.212,"Well, you know, it is kind of hard to answer that, because the issue of that wasn't necessarily raised."
1987.87-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2955.962,2957.133,"But you see, that is my difficulty."
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,2970.096,2972.361,"--And I agree, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3018.515,3024.651,How can you tell that it was so far outside of what was considered acceptable behavior?
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,3024.651,3039.146,"--Chief Justice Rehnquist, you tell that by submitting to the jury, as Allied did, a history of what went on in that organization, of what kinds of things were being done, of what people understood was permissible and what people understood was not permissible."
1987.87-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3041.13,3044.551,Even though not based on any rule of the organization?
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,3044.551,3047.706,"--Well, I know there was no rule that said--"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,3047.706,3048.205,Just a minute.
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,3048.205,3048.689,"--Yes, sir."
1987.87-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3048.689,3049.268,I asked you a question.
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,3049.268,3049.58,Yes.
1987.87-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3049.58,3053.095,Was it or was it not based on any rule of the organization?
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,3053.095,3056.03,"It was based... it was not based on a specific rule, as I say."
1987.87-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3056.03,3058.216,"Well, was it based on an unspecific rule?"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,3058.216,3068.962,"Yes, it was based upon a standard that everyone understood in that organization, that you are not supposed to achieve a result on a vote in that organization by dominating the meeting with a commercial interest."
1987.87-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3100.199,3104.088,How do you know whether you are changing what the vote would otherwise have been?
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,3104.088,3117.692,"You know it when you bring in 220 people, you pay their expenses, they are know-nothing voters, they don't know what they are voting on, they are not participating in the debate, they have nothing to say about anything other than they were trucked up to Boston to vote no on the product."
1987.87-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3121.426,3125.33,"No expenses had ever been paid before, of anyone had ever been paid before?"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,3125.33,3127.018,--Not for 220 people.
1987.87-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3127.018,3128.626,"Well, what is the cutoff?"
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,3128.626,3133.639,There were 300... the vote turned out to be 394 to 390.
1987.87-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3141.245,3151.398,"So every one of these questions then goes to the jury, because there is no such thing as a summary judgment for a defense because it is always a question of degree that has to be answered by the jury."
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,3151.398,3159.239,"Well, let me turn it around for just a second, Justice Rehnquist, because I don't suggest that this is that easy a question, but let's think about the alternative for a second."
1987.87-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3198.004,3198.52,Not quite.
1987.87-157,1,24817,fredric_w_yerman,,3224.133,3237.956,"The answer to that, I think, Justice Scalia, is that the point made in Professional Engineers about safety was that people can't dictate what goes on the market or not because they think it is safe or not safe."
1987.87-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3454.603,3455.571,"Thank you, Mr. Yerman."
1987.87-157,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,3457.993,3461.039,"In two minutes I just be blunt, if the Court please."
1987.87-157,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3515.766,3516.735,"Mr. Frankel, may I ask you a question?"
1987.87-157,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,3519.468,3520.03,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-157,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3520.03,3530.292,Would it apply equally if in this case they had adopted a rule giving the steel conduit people a veto over any change in specifications?
1987.87-157,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,3530.292,3532.791,If the NFPA had such a rule?
1987.87-157,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3532.791,3538.335,"By reason of, say, lobbying, the steel conduit people, instead of lobbying about this, got such a rule adopted."
1987.87-157,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,3538.335,3540.162,In the NFPA?
