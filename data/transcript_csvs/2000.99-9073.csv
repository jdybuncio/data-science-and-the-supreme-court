2000.99-9073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.8,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-9073, Paula Buford v. The United States."
2000.99-9073,0,21560,dean_a_strang,,37.591,41.152,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-9073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,114.922,133.747,"Well, Mr. Strang, isn't there one, perhaps, factor that cuts against your argument the fact that district courts probably see this kind of case... kind of an argument in connection with sentencing, a typical district judge, much more often than a typical judge of a court of appeals?"
2000.99-9073,0,21560,dean_a_strang,,133.747,156.646,"--It is true, Your... Mr. Chief Justice that but a fraction of sentences ever are appealed on any ground, but there is no reason to assume that the district judge would be reviewing the act of a State court in his own district or her own district or of any court familiar to that district judge."
2000.99-9073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,165.958,168.703,"That's where the Federal judge sits, is it not?"
2000.99-9073,0,21560,dean_a_strang,,168.703,168.887,Yes.
2000.99-9073,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,168.887,169.933,In Milwaukee County?
2000.99-9073,0,21560,dean_a_strang,,169.933,172.668,"Yes, and that's an accident of the facts here."
2000.99-9073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,181.035,206.772,"Let me ask you another question. I guess that the guidelines provide that sentences are related where the offenses occurred on the same occasion, or were part of a common scheme or plan, and those questions seem to involve certain factual determinations."
2000.99-9073,0,21560,dean_a_strang,,212.763,219.274,"--Never of historical facts, regardless which path one takes to relatedness."
2000.99-9073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,227.254,227.254,How about mixed questions of fact and law?
2000.99-9073,0,21560,dean_a_strang,,227.254,237.053,"The particular mixed question of consolidation, which is the third prong of the definition here, yes."
2000.99-9073,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.053,237.053,"Well, in the example that I gave you of common scheme or plan there might be mixed questions of fact or law, and would there be de novo review there?"
2000.99-9073,0,21560,dean_a_strang,,237.053,261.706,"There may well be mixed questions, and I think the common scheme or plan is the application here that next to consolidation most calls or most invites de novo review."
2000.99-9073,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,279.362,293.166,"I mean, technically I think you're right in saying the words which come out of an application note in a guideline about, that you could deem a thing consolidated when it's... what is the exact word +/?"
2000.99-9073,0,21560,dean_a_strang,,372.908,375.109,"Sir, I understand the concern."
2000.99-9073,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,431.031,450.714,"--What I'm thinking is that the words, joint sentencing, are words that every trial judge in the United States would understand reasonably well, and they're words that I as an appellate court judge would have a very crude understanding, and therefore I'd like to know what the trial judge thinks about it rather than what I think about it."
2000.99-9073,0,21560,dean_a_strang,,450.714,456.431,--I don't know that Your Honor's understanding would be any cruder.
2000.99-9073,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,456.431,458.178,I haven't done joint sentencing.
2000.99-9073,0,21560,dean_a_strang,,459.741,472.853,"But the determination is one that I think peculiarly is made here on court documents... transcripts, pleadings, orders, at least in the ordinary case."
2000.99-9073,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1678.452,1683.923,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-9073,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1718.681,1726.879,"Suppose, as in Justice Ginsburg's example, a district court said there is no consolidation, in my view, unless there's a formal order of consolidation."
2000.99-9073,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1745.319,1748.015,"Justice Kennedy, I think I agree with you."
2000.99-9073,2,21560,dean_a_strang,,3486.5,3489.547,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
