2014.13-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.02,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 13-1211, Hana Financial v. Hana Bank."
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,8.939,11.991,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1211,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,111.67,114.205,"But infringement is a question for the jury, right?"
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,114.205,117.407,"--Your Honor, there is a circuit split on that question."
2014.13-1211,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,123.894,126.68,"If it is, then why wouldn't tacking be in the same category?"
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,139.673,140.706,"I think there are a couple of reasons, Your Honor."
2014.13-1211,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,176.279,182.433,"So -- so under your view, a district court's finding that are reviewed in the court of appeals de novo?"
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,182.433,183.617,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1211,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,190.288,193.824,"In this case, the key issue would be reviewed de novo."
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,193.824,194.624,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,194.624,204.563,So isn't the key issue the commercial impression of -- and meaning how these marks were used and the commercial impression?
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,204.563,206.515,"Your Honor, I don't think that's the ultimate inquiry."
2014.13-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,308.23,308.58,I'm sorry.
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,312.015,318.186,"--Well, Your Honor, my submission is that a jury looking at these two marks, if instructed, just do they have the same consumer impression?"
2014.13-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,325.742,331.929,Is the jury going to be instructed in any way on what you just told us was the reason we should view those as differently?
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,331.929,333.448,"--I don't think it would, Your Honor."
2014.13-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,345.523,352.526,"Wouldn't there be evidence or instruction on, you know, consumer impression, you have to take into account what happened between these two marks?"
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,352.526,358.93,"--Well, I suppose, Your Honor, that an opponent's attacking could try to introduce evidence to that effect."
2014.13-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,363.234,366.186,It seems to me that it's rather critical to the contrast you draw.
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,392.084,396.971,"--Well, Your Honor, I -- I think the nature of the inquiry, if it's put to a court, is different than just saying do these marks look alike."
2014.13-1211,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.723,409.779,"Well, why doesn't the -- it seems to me the question for the jury is -- is not whether they look alike, but whether they create the same commercial impression."
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,438.714,449.42,"--Well, Your Honor, I think what a jury is not doing in that circumstance is it's not taking the prospective evaluation of the earlier mark against the later mark in figuring out just how much of a difference, of a change there was."
2014.13-1211,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,449.42,458.193,"Well, but suppose that an important part of the case was that when American Paging came along for a few years everybody in the United States knew that."
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,475.404,476.67,"Well, there are a few things about that, Your Honor."
2014.13-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,518.995,520.528,If it's viewed as a question of fact?
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,520.528,522.03,"--Yes, Your Honor, my apologies."
2014.13-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,524.482,531.553,"Are there any facts that you think a jury could determine here or should determine in this kind of a case, in a tacking case?"
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,531.553,532.37,"No, Your Honor."
2014.13-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,543.778,549.848,"How is the judge supposed to know that, what a consumer's impression would be generally?"
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,549.848,550.882,"--Well, you know, I think what--"
2014.13-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,550.882,552.565,Just to figure it out?
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,552.565,552.998,--Well--
2014.13-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,552.998,555.684,"Some evidence would have to be presented to him or her, right?"
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,555.684,563.021,"--It -- it's possible, but I think that similar to what -- how a -- a judge in the context of claim construction would understand what one skilled in the art would would be."
2014.13-1211,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,572.694,580.947,"I thought the Court said if we're trying to type these things, claim construction is construction of a written instrument."
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,581.799,582.582,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1211,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,582.582,586.767,--that judges do all the time.
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,604.913,614.103,"Well, Your Honor, I think my response to that is that our fundamental contention is that inquiry, just what if -- the impression of consumers, is not the decisive or ultimate determination here."
2014.13-1211,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,614.986,620.007,It's almost every hornbook statement of it -- is quotes that language.
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,633.765,634.767,"--Well, that is right, Your Honor."
2014.13-1211,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,646.742,651.877,"Well, aural or visual appearance, shouldn't that also -- aural and visual to whom?"
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,656.613,677.277,"--Well, Your Honor, I think what both of these factors are showing is that these are -- are proxy ways the courts are looking to determine if we can view these same -- these two marks as legally equivalent such that we can use this legal fiction of tacking that provides a very valuable benefit to the proponent of tacking that they can effectively go back in time and -- and alter their marks after the point."
2014.13-1211,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,710.931,718.77,"As I understand your brief, you say, no, the test really isn't same continuing commercial impression to consumers."
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,734.796,735.246,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1211,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,735.246,750.139,"But if the answer to that is that of course you can't; if you are saying that the old one was the first use, then whatever the scope of the old one is, is it, and you can't add to it because of what you did later."
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,750.139,752.424,"Well, I think that's -- that's -- that's right, Your Honor."
2014.13-1211,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,791.632,793.065,"Well, why -- wait."
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,822.651,823.267,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1211,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,823.267,831.257,"And if the answer is that the new mark can't go beyond the scope of the old, that's the -- that's the end of that inquiry."
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,831.257,832.959,"Well, and I think -- I think that's right, Your Honor."
2014.13-1211,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,843.515,852.603,But what I -- what I was trying to suggest is you would never get to what the second mark scope is because the scope of the first one is determinative.
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,852.603,856.255,"Well, and I think as we put it, Your Honor, that the scopes have to be virtually identical."
2014.13-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,968.412,976.1,"Again, if I could just -- what is it that you think a jury could not be instructed on in addressing that same consideration?"
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,976.1,987.308,"What I think a jury would not be able to do the way that a court can, is a jury cannot understand what the legal significance of Service Master compared to the legal significance of Master Clean."
2014.13-1211,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1050.316,1057.637,Do you think consistency appears in the -- in the judicial opinions that have treated this as a question of law?
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1066.758,1067.694,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1090.96,1101.748,"Well, I guess the stare decisis point is -- is minimized, though, if you appreciate the fact that these marks are -- each one is sort of sui generis."
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1122.595,1124.097,"Well, I think it's significant in two ways."
2014.13-1211,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1149.931,1165.524,"Even -- even the ones you -- you point us to do -- do not impress me as establishing any kind of -- look on page 50, dolphin to dolphin, and the second dolphin is stylized in -- in cursive writing, right?"
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1190.672,1191.924,"--Well, Your Honor, I think one of the--"
2014.13-1211,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.924,1194.793,And I'd much rather blame it on the jury than on the court.
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1195.21,1208.384,"--Well, Your Honor, I think what -- what happens in this presentation, one -- one thing I'd point the Court to is that in 1989, the American Mobile Phone case that we -- we began discussing set forth just how narrow this tacking doctrine is."
2014.13-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1290.286,1300.827,The problem there for you which is although those older cases were at a time when equity and law were separated and there were no rights to jury trials in equity.
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1308.583,1310.816,Not all of the cases.
2014.13-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1317.27,1320.641,--And you don't know how many of those cases the parties agreed to a bench trial.
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1320.641,1322.957,"That's right, Your Honor, we do not know."
2014.13-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1349.191,1358.014,"Well, I doubt very much those -- in those earlier cases that lawyers were thinking of consumer reports and pictures and videos and all the other things they present today."
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1358.564,1359.349,--Right.
2014.13-1211,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1359.349,1362.134,So the cases were simple by their nature back then.
2014.13-1211,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1362.134,1367.186,"But, Your Honor, in court -- the courts today consider this a question of law apply that same kind of analysis."
2014.13-1211,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1428.989,1429.858,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,1436.079,1439.447,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1211,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1461.026,1470.066,Why don't you deal with the example that the Chief Justice presented of the American Packing Company where that was discussed earlier.
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,1473.101,1483.14,"--One critical consideration in the American Mobile Phone paging case is that in that case, the two marks that were sought to be tacked were, in fact, used on -- on -- very different products."
2014.13-1211,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.039,1537.641,So it can be taken away from the jury you're saying?
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,1544.995,1546.43,"--Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1211,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1582.62,1589.79,"Of course you -- you need some predictability for a judge for disallow a jury verdict as a matter of law, right."
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,1589.79,1591.124,"--Yes, that is correct."
2014.13-1211,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1591.124,1593.39,"I mean, you've got to admit there is some predictability."
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,1593.39,1599.378,"There is always some predictability, but it's -- it's very challenging, still, in in tacking cases."
2014.13-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1599.378,1609.336,"Well, you emphasize that the consumer perspective is what's important, but there are other aspects of tacking as well that seem more suited to a court than to a jury."
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,1609.336,1615.589,"Well, the -- the critical test, again, is commercial impression which is a consumer standard."
2014.13-1211,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1682.634,1696.458,"If we when we write this opinion, will we have to have in the back of our minds what effect it will have on likelihood of confusion, the likelihood of confusion issue?"
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,1703.88,1709.701,"Justice Kennedy, the the likelihood of confusion issue is not part of the question presented, but as a practical--"
2014.13-1211,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1709.701,1710.634,I -- I recognize that.
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,1710.634,1713.669,"--As a practical matter, I think that practitioners--"
2014.13-1211,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1713.669,1715.169,Is it the elephant in the room or something like that?
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,1715.855,1716.738,--Quite possibly.
2014.13-1211,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1716.738,1717.305,--metaphor it--
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,1717.305,1730.447,"Well, if -- if you look at the circuits that have adopted tacking as a matter of law, they've only done so this -- is the Federal Circuit and the Sixth Circuit because they also treated likelihood of confusion as a as a matter of law."
2014.13-1211,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1773.191,1785.615,What about the point that the question really is what was the scope of each what was the scope of the original mark and the later one?
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,1785.615,1791.336,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the preemptive scope argument is one that did not arise until the reply papers."
2014.13-1211,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1909.912,1912.098,What about obviousness in patent law?
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,1917.335,1920.637,"--Obviousness is a factual issue, is my understanding."
2014.13-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2036.262,2044.268,Are there any of the features that your friend says have to go to the court that you think could not be addressed in jury instructions?
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,2044.268,2049.253,I -- I -- I think certainly all of these elements could be addressed in jury instructions.
2014.13-1211,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.223,2108.525,"Would you repeat what you said about the -- the other defenses, laches and what else?"
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,2108.525,2110.21,Laches and unclean hands.
2014.13-1211,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2110.21,2113.095,And those are still available on -- on remand?
2014.13-1211,1,56060,carlo_f_van_den_bosch,,2113.095,2114.495,"Potentially so, yes."
2014.13-1211,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2139.596,2140.046,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1211,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2149.435,2151.637,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1211,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2233.188,2238.609,You're saying essentially that legally equivalent just means equivalent for the purpose of deciding this legal question?
2014.13-1211,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2238.609,2243.161,"That's right, but that doesn't tell you what question you need to ask to find out if they are legally equivalent."
2014.13-1211,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2259.606,2272.847,I'm a little confused about that because there is a plethora of quotations from the case law that tacking should be a limited thing and not expansive and the -- his scope point.
2014.13-1211,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2272.847,2273.932,--Absolutely.
2014.13-1211,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2273.932,2291.477,"And how do you communicate that to the jury, because by nature the evidence the jury is going to see is the changed product, and the question in terms of are they going to be confused by it, they're not, because they're going to know it's the same manufacturer."
2014.13-1211,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2291.477,2292.711,Right.
2014.13-1211,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2315.859,2319.661,That almost suggests to me that a lot of these older cases were decided wrong.
2014.13-1211,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2323.948,2329.852,And certainly the jury will know that because they will be instructed about when tacking is appropriate.
2014.13-1211,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2350.449,2377.767,"What part does the judge in setting the boundaries by deciding the question either on summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law, that -- I -- my thought was that a judge would not let -- that the bounds of the doctrine were decided by the judge when he puts the question to the jury."
2014.13-1211,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2377.767,2378.767,That's right.
