2007.06-1463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.237,"We'll hear argument next in Case 06-1463, Preston v. Ferrer."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,9.753,22.597,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's been a little less than two years since this Court handed down the decision in Buckeye Check Cashing Service v. Cardegna."
2007.06-1463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,88.105,89.389,"Well, It wouldn't eliminate it."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,96.628,102.465,"Well, the assertion that we get to arbitrate de novo is new in this Court."
2007.06-1463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,131.901,139.372,"Well, I guess I could let him answer, but I suppose he would say you go to that court, and you get a motion to compel arbitration."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,139.372,144.942,"Well, we have brought a motion to compel arbitration, which was denied based on 1700.44."
2007.06-1463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,144.942,157.183,"I couldn't find the order that the court... in the record it says that the order would be... the court granted a preliminary injunction, the superior court, and then it said, according to an order to be entered by the clerk."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,166.405,178.296,"The injunction states... and I'm implying this, because it doesn't actually state how long it lasts... the injunction was requested and it was granted with just the word ""grant""."
2007.06-1463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,200.559,214.052,"Did the Respondent at any point indicate that after the Labor Commission, Labor Commissioner, made a determination that they would not go to superior court for de novo review?"
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,214.052,219.104,"Well, they actually had in a sense an opportunity to do exactly that and chose not to."
2007.06-1463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,271.638,278.392,"Well, you may have a right to go to arbitration under this context, to proceed at once to arbitration."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,300.492,315.417,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that if the motion to compel arbitration had been granted... remember there were two motions pending, my motion to compel arbitration and the Respondent's motion for an injunction to stop the arbitration."
2007.06-1463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,325.29,343.704,"I would have thought you would... you would say that when you have a contract which says that any disputes under this shall be arbitrated pursuant to the rules of the AAA or whatever, that that does automatically exclude a parallel proceeding."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,348.239,354.059,"Justice Scalia, I would certainly agree that it's a breach of the contract to file a parallel proceeding."
2007.06-1463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,357.261,373.954,"What do you... what do you make, in answering Justice Scalia's question, what do you make of the fact that this contract included, I guess, a choice of law provision to the effect that California law applies, and if California law comes in so does the jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner?"
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,385.661,389.732,"Well, Justice Souter, I have two responses to that."
2007.06-1463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,449.021,457.341,Do you agree that the question of implicit option of California law is at issue in the case as it gets to us?
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,457.341,460.16,--I don't believe that Volt is properly in the case.
2007.06-1463,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,481.742,484.777,"Why isn't that an issue in the case, unless you're waiving the issue?"
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,498.552,500.554,I that that Volt should be rejected.
2007.06-1463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,517.496,521.383,"Counsel, I have to confess I've never understood these choice of alaw provisions."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,533.108,543.481,"Well, I think lawyers do it reflexively because out of fear that somehow the law in some other State that they don't know is going to wind up being the conflict of law--"
2007.06-1463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,543.481,548.201,"When you say California law applies, you don't mean to the exclusion of Federal law?"
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,548.201,548.801,--Of course not.
2007.06-1463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.689,560.425,Nor do you mean that California applies even when it contradicts the express provisions of your agreement?
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,562.96,564.494,Absolutely.
2007.06-1463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,572.416,579.654,I must say that the Volt case is written in rather sweeping language that's not particularly helpful to you.
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,592.73,593.214,Certainly.
2007.06-1463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,622.333,632.455,"Counsel, would you have any problem with a California law that said you can arbitrate but the arbitrator must allow the Labor Commissioner to file an amicus brief?"
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,632.455,635.641,I don't know the Labor Commissioner has ever attempted that.
2007.06-1463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,638.559,644.929,"What if it goes on and says, and you must allow the Labor Commissioner to appear at the arbitration?"
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,644.929,650.15,"--Well, that is what 1700.45 says for talent agents."
2007.06-1463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,669.962,678.3,"So, what if it says you've got to wait for 30 days to allow the Labor Commissioner to consider whether or not to intervene?"
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,678.3,688.525,"--I'm not sure... I certainly... personally, in this case no problem with that."
2007.06-1463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,706.884,714.989,Does the Labor Commissioner have authority to commence proceedings on his own motion or her own motion?
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,714.989,717.425,It's a little bit complicated.
2007.06-1463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,717.425,720.877,"Well, I'm sorry that I asked already."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,720.877,724.329,I have an answer for you.
2007.06-1463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,813.134,832.197,"Could the arbitrator decide, I know I'm not required to do this but the Labor Commissioner is the expert and I'd rather wait until the Labor Commissioner acted before I proceed with the arbitration?"
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,832.197,837.166,"Well, in a sense, under the gun of the injunction hearing the next day, that's what the arbitrator did."
2007.06-1463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,837.166,837.768,Take out the exception.
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,851.026,861.384,"I would certainly protest, but the arbitrator undoubtedly has the power to wait for the Labor Commissioner to render an advisory decision."
2007.06-1463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,870.739,873.607,How was the arbitrator chosen?
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,876.559,877.143,Yes.
2007.06-1463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,900.592,910.531,"If you go to the superior court for de novo review, can you ask the superior court for an order enforcing its decision?"
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,910.531,913.166,Enforcing the Labor Commissioner's decision?
2007.06-1463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,913.166,916.984,"Well, you get de novo review."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,926.326,932.23,"Well, that is what Judge Ferrer asked the superior court to do, was first send this to the Labor Commissioner."
2007.06-1463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,944.204,956.945,"So do you think it would be within the authority of the superior court to say this is a judgment binding on the parties and the arbitration will not proceed, or must proceed consistently with my order?"
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,956.945,962.165,"Well, absent... our position is that that's preemptive, of course."
2007.06-1463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,966.117,966.634,Yes.
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,972.871,975.823,If the Respondent prevails in the Labor Commissioner?
2007.06-1463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,975.823,987.365,"If Respondent prevails in this case, don't you think that the superior court can then say that its declaration is final and the arbitration shall not proceed?"
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,987.365,1002.074,"The position I've taken from the beginning, including in my briefs to the court of appeals was yes, that if the decision is correct, if this Court affirms the court of appeals, that the de novo would go to the superior court."
2007.06-1463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1019.769,1022.804,"What is it... I should know this, but I don't."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,1069.768,1074.153,"Well, the Federal Arbitration Act and the California Arbitration--"
2007.06-1463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1074.153,1078.957,The Federal... the Federal Arbitration Act says what that makes it clear he can't do that?
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,1078.957,1079.357,--Well--
2007.06-1463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1079.357,1084.194,"I mean, I grant you if he can do it you might as well tear up the Federal Arbitration Act and throw it out the window."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,1089.448,1096.585,"--Well, I think in Section 3 would... there should be a stay of the judicial proceedings so that the arbitration can proceed."
2007.06-1463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.585,1098.371,But that's not positive Federal law.
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,1108.41,1109.077,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1112.462,1113.48,So even though it's not--
2007.06-1463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1113.48,1122.152,"When we say we'll arbitrate all disputes under this contract, it means we'll arbitrate all disputes under this contract; neither one of us will go to court."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,1122.152,1129.156,"I think that's doubly so if you incorporate the rules of the American Arbitration Association, which provides you with the maximum breadth."
2007.06-1463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1129.156,1142.233,"--Well, but that... that's what I'm driving at, and I think that's interesting, that there's an implicit... because it doesn't say it explicitly... there's an implicit promise not to undermine this contract by running off to court."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,1142.233,1144.933,I think it's a covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
2007.06-1463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1147.218,1147.535,All right.
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,1153.256,1155.707,I think there are a couple--
2007.06-1463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1155.707,1159.592,"--I agree, I don't see how they could, but I just want to get to the bottom of it."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,1159.592,1168.565,--I think this entire area of jurisprudence involves pre dispute arbitration agreements and then some party decides it's not to my advantage and they run to court.
2007.06-1463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1170.498,1173.1,Okay.
2007.06-1463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.1,1181.206,"I used to teach contract law, and I am sure that when you say you'll arbitrate, it means you won't litigate."
2007.06-1463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1187.777,1197.798,"I thought Buckeye was... was such a case, going to court despite the arbitration agreement."
2007.06-1463,0,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,1197.798,1203.136,"At... at the time we were in the superior court, Buckeye had not yet been decided."
2007.06-1463,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1247.915,1249.767,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1263.627,1273.132,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The California Talent Agencies Act does not invalidate the arbitration agreement between Mr. Preston and Judge Ferrer."
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1275.834,1276.8,"Well, the question is obvious."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1303.735,1305.02,--The Labor Commissioner--
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1305.02,1306.47,--who happens to be an administrative agency?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1307.472,1314.125,"--I think to answer your question, Justice Breyer, it's helpful just to delineate the procedure of how it's supposed to work."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.223,1363.808,Did you take a position below?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1368.177,1369.546,"--It's not brand new, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1370.996,1373.598,"Did you take that position below, was the question."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1373.598,1377.55,"We never took that position below because we never got that far, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1386.339,1388.524,The arbitrator already agreed to do that.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1390.626,1397.613,"--Well, the motion for the injunction was filed because the arbitrator initially denied a stay of arbitration."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1407.219,1425.816,"Well... but if your position is that we have to preserve the integrity of the State system, the Labor expert and so forth and the State builds in to that procedure, de novo review Superior Court, it seems to me rather difficult for you to now just say oh, well, the Superior Court doesn't make any difference."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1425.816,1430.768,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I think that it is important... this goes back to Justice Breyer's question."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1451.597,1453.866,Why would you want this to happen?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1469.775,1471.01,"On average 8 months, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1471.01,1471.627,Eight months.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1472.81,1473.929,"She, Your Honor."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.929,1475.196,--She.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1482.552,1484.518,"Well, there are valid reasons."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1507.849,1509.534,This person is not a talent agent.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1509.534,1511.653,"--The is person is a talent agent, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1519.573,1524.693,Normally we say that those types of disputes are for the arbitrator to decide.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1536.018,1543.372,"Chief Justice Roberts, there are other things that the Labor Commissioner is invested with jurisdiction to do."
2007.06-1463,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1567.453,1574.393,"Well, that may be great as a means of informing the Labor Commissioner, but it virtually destroys the value of arbitration--"
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1574.393,1575.009,"--No, but the--"
2007.06-1463,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1575.009,1581.23,--because the expeditiousness of arbitration is gone once you start down the California procedural road.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1585.784,1587.701,"--No, Justice Souter, it's actually enhanced."
2007.06-1463,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1598.775,1604.845,"Then they probably shouldn't have agreed to arbitrate, but they did agree to arbitrate, and they want to arbitrate now."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1611.599,1613.965,"--But, Justice Souter, this is what they bargained for."
2007.06-1463,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1616.484,1626.775,"Did you make that argument below, that implicitly they have imported the California labor scheme in as a... in effect, as a condition precedent to the arbitration?"
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1626.775,1630.227,"--Yes, Justice Souter, we cited the Volt case before the California court of appeal."
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1631.411,1634.796,"It sounds as if you made the argument... well, you say we cited a case."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1634.796,1638.417,"--But, Justice Breyer, they did not raise the pre emption argument at all."
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1638.417,1638.75,Okay.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1642.002,1644.07,We did by responding to their argument.
2007.06-1463,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1645.403,1648.438,But you didn't go further than to cite that case.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1649.088,1650.574,"--We did not go further than to cite Volt, but let me--"
2007.06-1463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1650.574,1655.709,Volt involves a third party who is not party to the arbitration agreement.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1680.843,1689.132,"--Because Volt simply was about... a case about postponing arbitration in favor of litigation going forward, which has actually had a greater impact--"
2007.06-1463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1689.132,1694.501,Litigation involving a person who couldn't be brought into the arbitration.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1694.501,1695.851,"--True, but--"
2007.06-1463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1695.851,1705.14,It makes sense to say that piece of it involving a party who can't be before the arbitrator should be... should be... go first.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1712.061,1719.016,--Except the Labor Commissioner herself who is supposed to do these administrative procedures for all kinds of validate and compelling State court... State law reasons.
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.016,1721.668,Judgment involved would have been binding--
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1721.668,1722.734,Yes.
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.734,1724.536,--on the third parties.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1736.244,1737.411,"She is, Your Honor."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1737.411,1740.796,"--Well, I imagine that's highly debatable."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1751.604,1756.056,"But, Justice Scalia, in Volt, the State court litigation went forward, the related litigation."
2007.06-1463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1761.793,1765.161,"You said something about that in your brief, and I think that you got it wrong."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1799.084,1804.988,"--True, Justice Ginsburg, but at least it can bind one of the parties and therefore tie the hands of the arbitrator in the subsequent proceeding."
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1811.142,1812.578,Could California law do this?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1861.775,1864.527,"Well, if that's what parties bargained for, that was their agreement."
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1865.194,1868.079,"I've read the agreement, and I don't quite find their... here--"
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1868.079,1869.915,--But I understand your hypothetical--
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1869.915,1875.902,--In my mind is what they do is they have the same standard arbitration clause.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1880.203,1882.338,"--No, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1882.338,1882.788,No.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1900.984,1903.769,Because here what the Labor Commissioner does is not what a court does.
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1921.03,1921.447,No.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1928.786,1929.186,"--Well, that would be--"
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.186,1933.255,"Just get, you know, a knowledgeable person's input."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1933.255,1937.142,"--But, Justice Scalia, that would be inconsistent with the arbitration clause itself."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.194,1943.896,This contract said the same thing.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1947.048,1947.365,Right.
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.365,1951.485,Would it suck up this provision that says you have to go to the Superior Court?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1951.485,1952.102,No.
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.102,1953.002,No.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1953.935,1959.489,"But here it would, yes, because California law requires you to go to the Labor Commissioner first, not to--"
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1959.489,1961.34,"Well, I guess that would be a question for the arbitrator."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1961.34,1963.024,I just want to understand your position.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1975.617,1986.825,--Under California law... it is California law... you must go to the labor commissioner first before you go either to court or the arbitrator.
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1988.308,1992.477,My question was: You go to the labor commissioner.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1995.229,1996.431,That is correct.
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1996.431,1998.314,Suppose the labor commissioner said something absolutely silly.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2001.917,2004.317,Either side... either side can go to the superior court.
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2004.317,2011.54,And it would make no sense to do that and... and not to also stay the arbitration.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2011.54,2019.713,"Justice Kennedy, I think the problem I'm having with your question is that I think you are assuming that there's an arbitration in place while the labor commissioner is going forward."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2019.713,2019.796,No.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2022.313,2022.665,We do.
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2022.665,2023.781,The arbitrator is waiting.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2030.752,2031.152,Correct.
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2031.152,2033.287,The labor commissioner does something silly.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2042.392,2044.578,"No, Justice Kennedy, because once--"
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2044.578,2047.446,Have you taken that position consistently in this litigation?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2047.446,2049.096,"--We never got there, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2049.715,2051.498,You have taken no position on it either way?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2051.498,2063.473,"--We took the position that the superior court should stay the arbitration because you have to exhaust the administrative remedies first; and, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, Section 2, there might be grounds for invalidating this Arbitration Act."
2007.06-1463,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2063.473,2066.442,Is there any California case that says that this works this way?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2074.031,2075.547,"Specifically, Justice Alito, no."
2007.06-1463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2079.501,2082.036,A de novo right in Superior Court?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2082.036,2082.485,--Yes.
2007.06-1463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2102.7,2105.25,"Right, so you at least have that additional step."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2127.665,2130.617,"Well, the parties could voluntarily do that."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.556,2140.023,Excuse me.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2148.578,2149.128,"No, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.951,2157.267,Right.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2157.267,2166.207,"And once you get to the California Superior Court, then, under Section 1281, you have a right to move to compel for arbitration, just as under the Federal Arbitration Act."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2166.207,2166.54,But--
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2166.54,2173.611,"If do you not do those things, if you do not take the appeal, then the labor commissioner's... by default, her ruling becomes binding."
2007.06-1463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2175.829,2183.749,"And if you... and if you are successful and get from the superior court an order to compel arbitration, your opponent can then appeal it, I assume."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2183.749,2190.672,"Your opponent can appeal the decision compelling the arbitration if it were improperly granted, yes."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2190.672,2204.746,"Are you telling us that under no circumstance, if you prevail in this case, would you go to the superior court for de novo review and... and, as part of that, stay the arbitration?"
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2204.746,2209.233,"Justice Kennedy, if the arbitration clause is valid and applicable, we will go to arbitration."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2214.035,2214.987,All right.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2218.072,2219.772,"--Yes, we will go to arbitration."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2219.772,2224.86,Even though in this case you have assumed that that arbitration has to be stayed for the labor commissioner.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2229.564,2230.714,Labor commissioner goes first.
2007.06-1463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2244.573,2249.627,"Mr. Brunstad, I'm looking at the point in which you said this in your brief."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2275.693,2284.064,"--Under First Options here, were it not unmistakably clear that the parties said that the arbitrator should decide arbitrability, that would be for the court to decide."
2007.06-1463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2284.064,2286.333,"Well, we know... this is not a mystery in this contract."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2310.682,2332.281,"And what I meant in that language, Justice Ginsburg, is simply this: For example, if the arbitration clause were invalid because the arbitration clause, itself, were, say, fraudulent or... for something, then it would not be validate and applicable; or if the scope of the arbitration clause were limited in some way, then the scope issue, the arbitrability issue, is for the court to decide as this Court decided in First Options."
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2342.887,2347.457,"Right, this is... this is... actually now we are getting to the bottom of something here, I think."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2355.545,2356.547,"--Yes, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2356.547,2357.047,All right.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2377.06,2377.643,Correct.
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2377.643,2385.832,"Therefore, it seems to me that the question here concerns the meaning of this contract, and that's where we started."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2385.832,2386.382,Yes.
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2386.382,2397.74,"Does this contract mean that the parties who entered have promised, one, not themselves to go to court?"
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2398.84,2399.79,Yes.
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2399.79,2407.745,"Two, not themselves to bring a proceeding before this administrative agency?"
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2410.797,2411.497,No.
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2411.497,2419.653,"And then is the proper resolution of that to say: Well, you can raise that, too, before the arbitrator?"
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2419.653,2420.839,"No, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2420.839,2421.305,Why not?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2421.305,2425.19,And this goes to the Chief Justice's initial question which I have been trying to get to.
2007.06-1463,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2442.134,2444.551,Isn't that a question of contract interpretation--
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2444.551,2444.92,Yes.
2007.06-1463,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2444.92,2445.67,--for the arbitrator?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2445.67,2446.636,No.
2007.06-1463,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2446.636,2447.603,Why not?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2447.603,2452.59,Because that goes... because I think that this Court held that it to be no in Volt.
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2463.479,2468.1,"--Well, I don't understand... so you incorporate California law."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2507.825,2516.933,"Two reasons, Justice Scalia: First, in the Buckeye case, for example, the parties specifically selected as their choice of law the Federal Arbitration Act."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.768,2523.136,Let me... I want to understand that answer.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2529.006,2549.904,"--In Volt, Your Honor, the specific law that was... the Court said was selected was Section 1281 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which applies in a California court favoring a court proceeding because California has this rule that says if you have arbitration and related litigation, you can stay--"
2007.06-1463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2549.904,2555.391,Related litigation with someone other than the parties that you bound yourself to arbitrate with.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2570.15,2571.1,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1463,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2597.835,2605.239,"How can we decide this case on the assumption that this is simply an arbitration postponing rule when there's no California case that says that, do you acknowledge?"
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2634.324,2643.347,"It is inconceivable, Justice Alito, that the California court would say that arbitration is not permissible in this case."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2677.187,2685.908,"So the California Supreme Court would construct a system in which you get the advice of this expert, the Labor Commissioner."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2702.152,2703.087,"No, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2703.087,2703.52,No?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2703.52,2704.487,No.
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2704.487,2706.272,It is stupider than the Labor Commissioner.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2706.922,2707.822,"No, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2713.776,2714.16,All right.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2737.891,2738.493,--Justice Scalia--
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.493,2743.679,And that is the scheme that the California Supreme Court is going to embed in California law?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2743.679,2750.618,"--Justice Scalia, bankruptcy courts cannot enter final decisions, yet we know that they're expert in bankruptcy law, even though they're subject to de novo review in the district court."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2750.618,2763.126,"In this case, the Court of Appeals, the majority said the fact that the losing party will have a right to de novo hearing, involving additional time and money, does not excuse the Defendant from the legal requirement to exhaust his remedy."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2771.464,2774.166,"But that's the case in every Federal Arbitration Act case, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2774.166,2786.957,"So that, it seems to me, makes incorrect your statement in your brief that, oh, this is just for eight months, so that there's very little additional time involved because of the de novo hearing."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2786.957,2787.924,"No, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2787.924,2793.544,Don't you think that your statement at page 34 of the brief has to be qualified in that respect?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2793.544,2806.97,"Justice Kennedy, if we get to the Superior Court... the Labor Commissioner does her work, and if the parties are not satisfied with it, either of them has the right to go to the Superior Court for a de novo hearing and file a motion to compel arbitration."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2811.939,2818.259,But you also have the right to challenge what... the accuracy of the Labor Department's finding.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2835.888,2836.156,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2836.922,2839.608,--That does require some qualification there.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2839.608,2842.66,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy, that is... that is factually accurate."
2007.06-1463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2845.512,2846.062,"Counsel, do you--"
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2846.062,2846.612,All right.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2865.939,2870.065,"Justice Kennedy, we never got to an evidentiary hearing in this case."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2870.065,2871.875,"I know you didn't, and that's why I'm questioning why you put it in your brief."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2873.43,2877.164,"It is not in the record, Justice Kennedy, because there is no factual record in this case--"
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2877.164,2881.535,"Therefore, don't make factual averments here for the first time."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2881.535,2883.47,"--It's not for the first time, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2890.307,2896.045,"Do you think, in the briefs to this Court, you can make factual statements that are not in the record?"
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2896.045,2900.413,"Well, Justice Kennedy, that would mean we could make no factual statements to give the Court any background at all."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2903.032,2906.651,I think they do say that it is disputed.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2913.407,2920.326,"It's undisputed, that Mr. Preston went and arranged the meeting with Judge Ferrer initially with the folks at ABC."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2920.326,2924.445,But they said it is... they dispute that it is to procure employment.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2924.445,2930.432,"I think, Justice Kennedy, I will concede that it is not a matter of evidence, so that qualification... I will accept that qualification--"
2007.06-1463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2930.432,2946.228,"In that light, on page 43, you say in this case, it is undisputed that Preston was an unlicensed talent agent and that the contract he drafted did not meet the requirements of Section 1700."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2959.368,2962.903,"--It is undisputed, Justice Ginsburg, that Mr. Preston never had a license."
2007.06-1463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2962.903,2964.555,But that's not what you said here.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2971.945,2980.282,"Our argument, Justice Ginsburg, is that he was unlicensed but he was operating as a talent agent under section... under the California Talent Agencies Act."
2007.06-1463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2980.282,2981.467,The latter is disputed.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2983.401,2984.586,"That is disputed, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2992.859,2997.677,Could I ask one question that I just want to be sure I understand your position?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3006.516,3008.301,Ruled against us?
2007.06-1463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3010.32,3011.67,To the court?
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3011.67,3012.503,"--To the court, correct."
2007.06-1463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3015.988,3022.461,That seems to me completely inconsistent with your argument that additional time is minimal.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3040.256,3040.889,"--No, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3047.009,3051.044,"What I just read you, this one, you said it isn't."
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3061.519,3063.602,"I'm sorry, forgive me, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3067.073,3069.523,But that's not what you represented.
2007.06-1463,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3069.523,3072.644,It is disputed whether he was acting as a talent agent or not.
2007.06-1463,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3075.596,3080.898,"--Mr. Schleimer, you have nine minutes remaining."
2007.06-1463,2,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,3080.898,3090.253,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-1463,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3155.445,3164.334,Regardless of the... I now understand better than I did what I take as a pretty strong argument.
2007.06-1463,2,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,3266.218,3271.872,I certainly think that the arbitrator had jurisdiction to arbitrate arbitrability.
2007.06-1463,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3299.523,3300.875,"Well, I... I accept that."
2007.06-1463,2,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,3323.221,3324.139,Assuming Volt--
2007.06-1463,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3324.139,3326.34,"Now, I'm just saying I have to write."
2007.06-1463,2,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,3345.154,3355.01,"--Because in Volt the contract was silent, and the Federal Arbitration Act was silent on the issue that was presented, and State law supplied the answer."
2007.06-1463,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3357.545,3360.08,But that's always the case.
2007.06-1463,2,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,3373.154,3381.26,"--The contract here, I would submit, Justice Kennedy, is not quiet because it says that validity or legality shall be arbitrated."
2007.06-1463,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3389.43,3392.551,I'm not sure that Volt would have been different.
2007.06-1463,2,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,3398.955,3413.215,"Volt was written under the California Arbitration Act, and speaking as a California practitioner that had had a lot of cases, you might notice that the same section in Volt was the basis for my motion to compel arbitration."
2007.06-1463,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3433.878,3442.565,"You think Volt would have come out the same way if... if in fact, all of the parties in this other litigation had agreed to arbitration?"
2007.06-1463,2,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,3443.584,3445.684,"I think it would have come out the other way, yes."
2007.06-1463,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3445.684,3446.084,--Yeah.
2007.06-1463,2,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,3446.786,3448.919,"That's what Volt was all about, was the fact that--"
2007.06-1463,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3448.919,3451.938,"Writing broadly is known as dictum, isn't it?"
2007.06-1463,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3454.956,3472.417,"I suppose if we write the case your way, we have to talk about what happens if this Labor Commissioner had enforcement powers, that they had the sua sponte right to invoke, and that they did?"
2007.06-1463,2,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,3472.417,3474.453,--I think the Labor Commissioner probably does.
2007.06-1463,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3481.857,3487.027,But this is not a proceeding brought by the administrative agency.
2007.06-1463,2,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,3487.027,3487.727,No.
2007.06-1463,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3487.727,3491.315,An agency like the EEOC Waffle House.
2007.06-1463,2,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,3491.315,3497.419,This is... this is an... this is an administrative agency providing an adjudicatory forum.
2007.06-1463,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3497.419,3511.478,"This is somebody who's bound by arbitration invoking whatever authority the Labor Commissioner has, quite different from the Labor Commissioner commencing a proceeding."
2007.06-1463,2,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,3511.478,3515.88,Waffle House was all about the prosecutorial or administrative power.
2007.06-1463,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3518.215,3534.408,"Well, your friend says that this agency has exactly that power, and the reason you required these things to go before her, is that she knows what's going on in the area and, if appropriate, can take the supervisory authority or whatever the equivalent of prosecutorial action is."
2007.06-1463,2,32845,joseph_d_schleimer,,3534.408,3544.55,"--I think I pointed out in my papers that nothing stops Judge Ferrer from putting a dime in the phone, calling the Labor Commissioner and complaining, saying there's been illegality here."
2007.06-1463,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3593.378,3594.028,"Thank you, Counsel."
