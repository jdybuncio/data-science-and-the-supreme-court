1984.83-859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,88.974,You may proceed whenever you are ready.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,88.974,92.776,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,211.687,215.822,How long was this vehicle on the parking lot?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,215.822,220.107,"The record does not show how long it was there, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,239.504,241.354,Does the record tell us the character of the parking lot?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,245.408,247.024,The record doesn't specifically say that.
1984.83-859,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,256.28,258.132,It wasn't a trailer parking lot?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,258.132,259.949,"No, it was not, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,271.29,275.677,"And this mobile home was not a tractor-drawn, was it?"
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,275.677,276.36,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1984.83-859,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,276.36,279.729,This mobile home was not a tractor-drawn motor home?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,279.729,280.279,"No, it was not."
1984.83-859,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,286.633,291.937,"And not tied up to any water or electric facilities, or anything like that?"
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,291.937,295.172,"That's correct, in this particular instance."
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,404.993,407.776,What ever happened to the charge of the sexual charge?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,407.776,408.878,"That was dropped, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,502.821,506.539,Would you buy the guideline of wheels?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,506.539,508.325,As the sole limitation?
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,508.325,514.229,"That if the vehicle has wheels on it, it's not a home."
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,514.229,518.597,"If the vehicle has wheels on it, I think that that makes it mobile and it would be subject to the exception."
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,518.597,522.984,Would you be satisfied with that guideline?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,522.984,525.436,"I think I would, Your Honor, yes."
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,532.106,534.056,You want to cloud it up now.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,534.056,534.508,Not at all.
1984.83-859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,546.1,551.152,Did this vehicle have a motor vehicle license on it issued by the State of California?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,551.152,563.042,"Yes, it did, Your Honor, and that was one of the ways that Agent Williams identified this particular vehicle as the one that was referred to in the WETIP information sheet that was provided."
1984.83-859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,584.039,585.825,You mean something like a truck driver's license.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,585.825,586.375,That's correct.
1984.83-859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,586.375,588.177,But not quite that high?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,588.177,594.747,I didn't read the entire section on the licensing of Class III to determine if truck drivers were involved.
1984.83-859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,600.835,628.152,"Mr. Hanoian, the Solicitor General has filed an amicus brief in the case and suggests apparently a somewhat different approach than you are urging, and an approach that would suggest that under some circumstances a mobile home could result in an expectation of privacy that could be respected."
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,629.854,631.204,"Not in total, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,645.362,653.717,"Well, what if the vehicle is in one of these mobile home parks and hooked up to water and electricity but still has its wheels on?"
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,653.717,659.352,"--If it still has its wheels and it still has its engine, it is capable of movement and it is capable of movement very quickly."
1984.83-859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,659.352,666.625,"Even though the people are living in it as a home and are paying rent for the trailer space, and so forth?"
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,666.625,676.713,"Well, I'm not certain that we're talking about the same thing, then, Justice O'Connor, because the mobile home parks that I envision are prevalent all across the country."
1984.83-859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,682.884,688.454,"Well, there are places where people can plug into water, and electricity, and do."
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,702.531,707.852,"--Well, I am not suggesting that there is no expectation of privacy in those circumstances, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,724.646,731.733,"Well, it just seemed to me that your approach and that offered by the Solicitor General were rather different in that area."
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,731.733,732.267,--Yes.
1984.83-859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.371,744.375,You prefer a single rationale for the exception to the warrant requirement.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,753.814,758.034,"Well, I think there is more than one, and I think they're independent of one another, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.034,769.175,"Well, anyway, you certainly would differ with the Solicitor General as to the application of the exception in a park, in a mobile home park?"
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,769.175,772.044,"Under the circumstances that's been presented, yes, I would."
1984.83-859,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,772.044,774.829,"Of course that isn't the issue here, is it?"
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,776.862,777.698,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,807.8,824.66,"Well, the inquiry there might be, did it come in in the afternoon and hock up with the electricity and so forth, but leave the following morning if there was drug activity, drug sales activity suspected."
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,833.683,834.451,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,913.135,915.503,"May I inquire, just so I understand your position?"
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,922.073,927.977,"No, I don't think it would, Your Honor, because it would be more or less like the suitcase."
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.977,929.827,I'm sorry?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,933.145,942.417,Our position is that if the officer looks at this conveyance and determines that it has the objective indicia of mobility--
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,942.417,944.317,Now does that mean self-propelled?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,944.317,944.953,--Self-propelled.
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,944.953,946.386,It has to be self-propelled?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,946.386,946.853,Yes.
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.503,950.005,So you wouldn't apply your thought to a trailer park?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,950.005,951.189,"Not when it's parked, no."
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.974,958.693,But when what about a self-propelled vehicle that's plugged into the plumbing and the electricity?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,958.693,962.747,--I think that that would be covered under the exception that we proposed.
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.747,963.214,Be covered?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,965.882,967.366,They could search it without a warrant--
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.366,967.799,I see.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,967.799,970.584,--because the same reasons are available in that instance.
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.584,970.968,Okay.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,970.968,975.305,"That particular vehicle is capable of movement, and it is capable of movement very quickly."
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.305,979.607,"And you would apply it, even if it had been parked there three months or so, because your officer wouldn't really know how long it had been parked?"
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,979.607,980.057,That's correct.
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,980.057,981.809,Thank you.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,990.296,992.248,"The motor home would be subject to search, but then the tent--"
1984.83-859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,992.248,992.965,But not the tent.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,992.965,995.717,"--Not the tent, not under this particular exception."
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.542,1013.011,May I just ask why... Justice O'Connor's question intrigues me.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1021.884,1022.267,That's right.
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.267,1023.636,I didn't hear that.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1023.636,1024.969,It doesn't have wheels.
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1026.604,1028.254,But you can surely move it just the same.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1029.29,1030.006,It is moveable.
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.006,1031.34,And I should think your reasoning would apply.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1032.408,1034.125,"Well, I think the reasoning does apply."
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.559,1070.783,"But your analysis... and maybe you're right... but you entirely omit any consideration of the magnitude of the privacy interest, the fact that somebody lives in it, like a tent, wouldn't make any difference."
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1070.783,1078.954,"We asked that the officers not be required to make that evaluation, because we don't think that they're equipped to do it, for one."
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1084.357,1094.165,"Well, the thing I'm puzzled about is, I understand the value of a bright line test certainly, but I'm not sure that... the California court may be wrong, but it's test is also a bright line test, too, isn't it?"
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1094.165,1094.982,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.982,1100.469,So that arguing for a bright line test really doesn't help us decide which test is the best one.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1100.469,1101.186,That's correct.
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1222.681,1229.335,But you can't really argue that it doesn't matter whether the probable cause determination comes before or after the search.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1231.821,1232.806,Certainly we are.
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1232.806,1235.223,"And if you have it before, presumably the search won't take place."
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1235.223,1236.941,"And it is certainly preferable, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1307.437,1310.473,What would you do with a houseboat?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1310.473,1311.506,A houseboat?
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1314.108,1314.875,It has wheels?
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1314.875,1322.546,"--No, it's a vessel, and it is covered by the same rule."
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1334.104,1337.79,"Well, I want to be more specific."
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1359.656,1360.372,That's correct.
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1366.575,1368.594,But the automobile has a motor in it--
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1368.594,1368.994,That's correct.
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1368.994,1369.944,--and the houseboat does not.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1369.944,1370.344,No.
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1375.248,1377.181,"There ""may be""."
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1383.352,1384.104,As have I.
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1386.287,1387.906,You've got to get more than that.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1387.906,1388.672,Certainly.
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1400.814,1402.249,"Well, let me add one more thing."
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1407.2,1413.371,"If the officer doesn't know that, I don't see why he should be called to that particular knowledge."
1984.83-859,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1415.821,1418.256,"The moral is, don't live in a houseboat."
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1418.256,1421.191,--People choose to live where they want to live.
1984.83-859,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1461.018,1480.413,"Well, Mr. Hanoian, I guess we didn't authorize... the Court didn't authorize that in Coolidge v. New Hampshire where Justice Stewart, writing for the Court, said we attach no constitutional significance to the mobility of the vehicle."
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1484.115,1487.169,"Well, I would suggest that perhaps there's not."
1984.83-859,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1518.938,1519.421,Yes.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1520.69,1522.073,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1528.227,1530.479,"Well, in Ross the car wasn't parked in the driveway."
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1530.479,1531.964,"--That's true, it was not."
1984.83-859,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.964,1533.664,So the facts are different.
1984.83-859,0,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,1533.664,1538.518,But the analysis of Ross stands in stark contrast to Coolidge.
1984.83-859,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1582.631,1585.749,You may.
1984.83-859,1,42801,thomas_f_homann,,1587.249,1589.718,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-859,2,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,3171.544,3173.846,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3306.25,3308.452,But the California court did rely on the statutory definition.
1984.83-859,2,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,3320.775,3321.242,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3321.242,3325.413,"--So they did have, it seems to me, a legislative determination of the kind of vehicle they had in mind."
1984.83-859,2,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,3325.413,3326.196,"Well, the vehicle--"
1984.83-859,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3326.196,3326.629,And it's licensed.
1984.83-859,2,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,3329.131,3329.448,--Right.
1984.83-859,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3433.027,3433.91,"Your time has expired, counsel."
1984.83-859,2,34555,louis_r_hanoian,,3433.91,3434.727,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1984.83-859,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3434.727,3435.629,The case is submitted.
