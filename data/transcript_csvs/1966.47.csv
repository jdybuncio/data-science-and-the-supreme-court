1966.47,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,18.897,"Number 47, United States appellant versus Anthony L. Fabrizio."
1966.47,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,20.215,22.232,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1966.47,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,28.644,41.243,He may be admitted for that purpose.
1966.47,1,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,42.346,44.849,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,3909.573,3911.404,May it please the Court.
1966.47,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4069.419,4076.986,Mrs. Friedlander the printed record does not include a motion for bill of particulars.
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4087.75,4093.979,The motion -- the request -- the demands of the bill of particulars is as follows:
1966.47,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4116.808,4118.107,Is that the only --
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4118.107,4131.774,"The -- paragraph two set forth any and all violations of any state laws, ordinances or rules that the United States of America will claim the defendant violated."
1966.47,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4131.774,4132.609,And that's all unless --
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4132.609,4139.562,And that is all.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4283.896,4305.53,Is it though -- isn't that -- hasn't it been a great activity of organized criminals for instance to try to use the bookmaking operations of one state in which it's legal all over the United States and the states have done nothing to prevent that.
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4305.53,4305.997,Well because --
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4305.997,4312.496,"Now, why would it be fantastic to think that the same thing could develop in this situation?"
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4312.496,4330.42,I believe what Your Honor is pointing out is a situation where a legal event has been misused by organized racketeers that they could take the trappings of the New Hampshire sweepstakes and carry on perhaps some illegal related activity in another state.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4345.417,4371.124,"But suppose this -- suppose this man had set up a business in New York whereby he invited people to come there and he would act as a broker for them to participate in the New Hampshire sweepstakes and he did a big business, it can be done you know."
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4373.389,4373.651,Yes.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4373.651,4374.922,Let me just finish it.
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4374.922,4375.426,Yes.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4375.426,4385.852,And then as an incident of that business he used these certificates that are in this case.
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4413.368,4413.6,Your Honor --
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4413.6,4416.684,Or what would be the distinction between those two operations?
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4416.684,4422.737,There is no distinction between an illegal use of legal state gambling paraphernalia.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4422.737,4423.167,Yes.
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4423.167,4433.857,Anybody can take what is legal in one state and misuse it in some way to his own profit in another state in violation of the laws of the state.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4433.857,4434.203,Yes.
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4434.203,4439.294,But also in misuse of the paraphernalia of the state.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4451.325,4451.537,Yes.
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4451.537,4463.809,And this pattern of statute was definitely designed to cover the situation where you are talking about illegal organized criminal kind of gambling conduct.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4471.885,4500.822,"Well, if this man entered into a business, brokers business in New York and carried these certificates back into New York to convince his -- these people that he had invested their money in the sweepstakes and that they would therefore get their money if they want, wouldn't that be the same as carrying the gambling operation in Nevada into another state?"
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4500.822,4534.517,"Well, Your Honor as I say I think it would be and I think an indictment which alleged specifically enough to inform the defendant of what he's being charged with that he carried paraphernalia to Nevada, or New Hampshire or whatever it may be in interstate commerce to be used in the manner in which you are suggesting not only he can be covered under other federal statutes of related statutes such as 1952, which is any travel in interstate commerce to in furtherance of an illegal business activity such as gambling."
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4541.924,4560.196,"Well, but this -- the indictment does say that he's carried these certificates into New York to be used and adapted, devised and designed for use in a wagering pool with respect to a sporting event."
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4569.037,4569.188,The --
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4569.188,4582.278,"Maybe he'd be convicted and it would have to be reversed because there was no evidence but under that allegation why couldn't, why couldn't the Government prove that this man did want to do that?"
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4582.278,4584.721,I would say that the Government couldn't prove it why.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4584.721,4586.363,"Well, that's your judgment but that's --"
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4586.363,4590.918,"Yes Your Honor, because it's based on rules of procedure."
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4618.004,4621.972,You didn't ask for that information on your request for a bill of particulars.
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4626.625,4639.47,And we asked if any violation of state law was being charged and the Government said that there was no violation of state law charged and of course what you're suggesting is a violation of --
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4639.47,4640.255,It would only be so --
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4640.255,4640.925,-- New York law.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4640.925,4645.91,It would only be so if this Act applied.
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4645.91,4649.281,"Well, that's the ultimate question, that's true."
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4649.281,4649.682,(Inaudible)
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4649.682,4652.292,When we talk about what you have to prove --
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4652.292,4653.073,Yes.
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4653.073,4667.562,I think the rules of indictments and proof of trial demand that the defense counsel and that the defendant be given an opportunity to know what he is going to be faced with.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4785.215,4808.593,But do I understand you then that to say that even if the Government showed that this man was taking these certificates into New York for the purpose of illegally conducting a brokerage in New York based upon this sweepstakes that there would be no crime?
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4808.593,4820.135,They would not Your Honor because a brokerage or selling for profit is not a wagering pool and it is not a bookmaking and it is not numbers policy of the leader.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4829.44,4848.88,"Well, I don't want to take too much of your time but just one more question, is it then your position that the carrying of the -- taking these certificates into another state cannot be illegal regardless of the use that they're put to in the other state?"
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4848.88,4869.045,It is out position that the New Hampshire sweepstakes are not within the statute and that the mere carriage in interstate commerce of New Hampshire sweepstakes to be used in the New Hampshire event does not violate the statute if New Hampshire isn't within the statute.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4921.486,4937.637,And is -- it is your position that it is within the statute because it is illegal -- of legal advance in New Hampshire and that therefore the statute does not apply to New Hampshire at all?
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4937.637,4937.772,That --
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4937.772,4939.181,(Inaudible)
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4939.181,4944.091,But more than being legal in New Hampshire it is conducted by the State of New Hampshire.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4949.803,4980.152,"Well, do you get down to the question then that under no circumstances whether its in organized crime or not that the person in the position of Mr. Fabrizio is in that under no circumstances can this statute be applied to the sweepstakes of New Hampshire because it is legal in New Hampshire and New Hampshire is one of the sovereign states, is that your position?"
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,4980.152,4984.346,Your Honor I believe that it doesn't state our position exclusively.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5127.429,5145.6,"And I suppose then the same reasoning it would not apply to the Irish sweepstakes or to the Puerto Rico sweepstakes or the sweepstakes of any foreign country that wanted to come in here in that manner if, if there, the sweepstakes was legal at home?"
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,5145.6,5148.241,"Oh, Your Honor I -- we do not take that position."
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5148.241,5154.674,What is the difference between the Puerto Rican sweepstakes and this one?
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,5154.674,5160.361,There is a difference between the state and the union and a -- the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5216.504,5218.448,You put that on Tenth Amendment?
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,5218.448,5219.16,Pardon?
1966.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5219.16,5220.261,You put that on the Tenth Amendment?
1966.47,2,17615,betty_d_friedlander,,5220.261,5230.374,Well this would be one objection if Congress did intend to reach that conduct but I think it's not required that we get to any constitutional principle for it.
1966.47,3,31742,joseph_a_millimet,,5572.832,5576.548,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7445.487,7446.635,Yes.
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7446.635,7449.78,-- will you try to straight this out by -- and give us one answer to that.
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7449.78,7450.852,I would do the best I can.
1966.47,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7530.363,7533.1,I don't think -- I don't think its quite it.
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7564.246,7566.147,No to either one or to two.
1966.47,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7566.147,7568.304,"So the -- no, okay."
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7590.509,7593.985,"Yes that is correct, but I think --"
1966.47,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7593.985,7594.656,(Inaudible)
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7594.656,7597.092,-- but two qualifications should be put forth.
1966.47,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7607.865,7609.985,"No, no, no."
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7612.46,7612.533,Yes.
1966.47,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7612.533,7614.221,-- for what it is in New Hampshire.
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7614.221,7614.909,Yes.
1966.47,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7614.909,7618.019,And my questions stands in your -- in another (Voice Overlap) --
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7618.019,7628.279,"Right, but the answer is, the answer is yes that an indictment drafted in those terms could be brought against that individual."
1966.47,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7664.768,7667.432,"That's totally irrelevant, isn't it?"
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7667.432,7673.388,As far as the meaning of the statute is concerned as I indicated I believe that's correct.I think the point should be made.
1966.47,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7674.804,7677.748,I beg to differ with you but I guess that's irrelevant too.
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7677.748,7693.322,Well -- this is of course the fact but also as I try to indicate for the fact that border line cases may arise under this quite broad statute.
1966.47,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7695.083,7714.56,Why then -- why didn't -- why does this indictment say something more when Mr. Fabrizio is not a tourist and if he is engaged in running a pool inside of New York State or buying this for somebody else.
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7724.121,7724.279,The reason is they --
1966.47,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7724.279,7741.418,"-- for not stating the more conservative view of the statute, more conservative theory of the statute in an indictment if the facts spit the more conservative view except to facilitate proof?"
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7741.418,7745.008,"I don't think that -- with two differences, Justice Fortas."
1966.47,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7835.683,7839.489,May I ask you one question with reference to my Brother Fortas' question?
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7839.489,7840.678,Yes sir.
1966.47,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7840.678,7852.288,"He asked you if 1/3 bought one ticket, would it make any difference whether 200 or the 1/3 bought 200 tickets and took them out?"
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7852.288,7860.638,"Well, I can say this is in terms of what was in the mind of Congress when they enacted the statute."
1966.47,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7886.611,7888.648,I wasn't suggesting I was asking.
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7888.648,7889.193,I understand.
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7924.056,7937.727,"Just a matter of curiosity, are there any prosecutions for violation of the same -- the same law under the Irish sweepstakes?"
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7937.727,7938.829,I know of none -- person but --
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7938.829,7940.774,I wonder why.
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7940.774,7944.798,Well that's -- I'm afraid I'm not equipped to satisfy you on that particular --
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7944.798,7973.656,"Because counsel just told us about how its publish in the papers that they're -- I think you 4,000 people in this country who are winners in a certain drawing of the Irish sweepstakes that must mean that there maybe millions of those things sold in this country by -- why wouldn't the Government be interested in that as well as in this drawing or lottery or sweepstakes of New Hampshire?"
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7973.656,7979.622,"I think it -- it is clear, it was made clear in the hearings on this case that the Government is interested in that."
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7979.622,7979.827,Then why didn't they--
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7979.827,7980.344,In the lotteries of
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7980.344,7981.629,--talk about it?
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7981.629,7985.163,"Well, as I say I' m not prepared to say that -- and nothing happened."
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7987.222,7995.429,It's been going on for year long before the New Hampshire affair.
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,7995.429,7995.755,Oh!
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7996.561,8014.047,"This is very strange that it a -- have this one prosecution for a fellow with 75 tickets and the newspaper show that 4,000 winners in one drawing of the Irish sweepstakes in this (Inaudible) --"
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,8014.047,8014.113,Well --
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8014.113,8015.138,-- and no concern on the (Voice Overlap) --
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,8015.138,8025.19,Mr. Chief Justice I don't mean and I hope I'm not leaving the impression that that there is no interest in that of the Government I just -- and I just do not have at hand the information to direct to that question.
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8049.561,8067.854,Would you mind sending us a little memorandum in the next day or so as to how many prosecutions there have been in -- by the Government in the last lets say in the last five years on Irish sweepstakes.
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,8067.854,8069.94,I'll do my very best to provide that information --
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8069.94,8071.922,"Oh, I don't think it's going to be that difficult to find out."
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,8071.922,8078.236,"And -- yes, I would, yes we shall provide that information."
1966.47,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8085.444,8085.844,"Oh, no no --"
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,8085.844,8086.645,-- what the statute means.
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8086.645,8089.154,"No, no, or would be interesting."
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,8089.154,8095.325,"Yes, let me -- may I -- may I in conclusion make the three points well I believe at least in my understanding of the operation --"
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8095.325,8099.68,But you have to be very brief because your time is up and we have extended quite a bit.
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,8099.68,8106.287,"Well, yes, I under -- directing to the statements that Mr. Millimet made which I -- as I understand them are in -- are inaccurate."
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8106.287,8108.236,Alright state them briefly then.
1966.47,4,29470,jerome_i_chapman,,8108.236,8114.739,"One, that you can only -- that the only way you can get more than 10 New Hampshire sweepstakes tickets is to go the commission and buy a bulk order."
1966.47,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,8157.946,8161.659,"Thank you, very well."
