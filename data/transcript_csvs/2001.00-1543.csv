2001.00-1543,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.774,"We'll hear argument now in No. 00-1543, Festo Corporation v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki."
2001.00-1543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1394.379,1397.89,"I do not, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.00-1543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1483.932,1486.804,How does one figure that out?
2001.00-1543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1503.03,1508.435,A simple example would be in Warner-Jenkinson itself.
2001.00-1543,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1565.855,1576.879,"But the idea of estoppel, as I understand it, is that a person is prevented from taking contrary positions, and it seems to me in your example that it's not necessarily a contrary position."
2001.00-1543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1576.879,1588.518,"Well, it's contrary in the sense of what fair inferences can be drawn by the public from the record of the prosecution history."
2001.00-1543,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1649.613,1650.894,Is there... is there a way of doing this?
2001.00-1543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1678.22,1682.39,"Well, I... I think so."
2001.00-1543,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1803.71,1819.703,"Mr. Wallace, the Government is proposing a change, a backing off from what the CAFC did, but proposing some new formulation or test."
2001.00-1543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1828.769,1833.97,"Well, I think they take... they start from what--"
2001.00-1543,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1833.97,1837.89,They... they key it into foreseeability somehow.
2001.00-1543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1837.89,1844.577,"--Yes, but they start by assuming the validity of the flexible bar rule and trying to tighten it a little bit."
2001.00-1543,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1848.004,1849.219,And so do you apparently.
2001.00-1543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1849.219,1865.921,"Well, we... we think the court of appeals was right in saying that the way the... it has been applying the flexible bar rule did not properly recognize what had been surrendered in the course of the prosecution history estoppel."
2001.00-1543,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1953.971,1971.554,"Mr. Wallace, with respect to that, your second possibility, the second kind of escape hatch for the patentholder, as I understand it, relates to a case in which, in effect, it was impossible to be any more precise, to exclude any more precisely than they did."
2001.00-1543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1986.786,1989.015,"--Well, we're quite worried about that."
2001.00-1543,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2009.986,2011.079,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
2001.00-1543,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2014.323,2026.954,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: First, I'd like to direct a response to Justice Breyer's question concerning that section of the statute that... that you were looking for."
2001.00-1543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2136.014,2137.517,But may I just interrupt with this--
2001.00-1543,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2137.517,2137.872,--Yes.
2001.00-1543,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2137.872,2138.615,--this observation?
2001.00-1543,2,16655,arthur_i_neustadt,,2156.736,2157.108,That is correct.
2001.00-1543,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2208.915,2208.915,This is scarcely an encouraging view.
