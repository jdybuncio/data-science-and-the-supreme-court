1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.946,"We'll hear argument first in No. 92-8346, Terry Lee Shannon v. the United States."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,10.428,13.12,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,141.307,150.5,"Mr. Trout, when you say Congress modeled it closely on the District of Columbia Act, what do you mean, that they looked to the District of Columbia Act only?"
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,150.5,157.666,"There's no evidence from the legislative history that I can find, Your Honor, that they looked anywhere else."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,157.666,162.539,Is there evidence is the legislative history that they did look at the District of Columbia Act?
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,162.539,164.943,"Yes, there's quite a bit of evidence that they did."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.175,276.607,"What holding in the Crutchfield case, Mr. Trout?"
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,276.607,285.794,The holding that the IDRA was closely modeled on 24-301.
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.794,291.43,"Not the question involved in this case, but the question of the derivation of the IDRA."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,291.43,293.15,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-8346,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.976,414.291,"Was it the case that the D.C. courts that imposed this requirement under the IDRA purported to be imposing it because the statute required it, or was it simply a part of their own supervision of the D.C. courts?"
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,414.291,428.992,"Well, the Lyles case in 1955 was decided under 24-301."
1993.92-8346,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.163,440.918,Does it say that this requirement of informing a jury is a statutory requirement?
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,440.918,442.42,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,442.42,456.589,"Ordinarily, you wouldn't expect the legislative body that is enacting a provision governing a criminal... something to do with a criminal to say, you know, what sort of instructions would be given, would you?"
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,458.872,460.602,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-8346,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,485.261,497.109,"But that's what you're urging here, are you not, Mr. Trout, that you get this requirement that the trial judge instruct the jury from the statute?"
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,499.692,502.134,"--No, I'm not making any constitutional argument."
1993.92-8346,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,502.134,510.65,"So you... you're pinning your position about what the judge must charge to this IDRA statute, is that right?"
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,510.65,516.774,Or to the supervisory power of this Court to impose a... the best rule.
1993.92-8346,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,535.745,548.364,"Well, if you do... if you're talking about just some general supervisory power notion, then wouldn't your reasoning apply as well to telling the jury about a mandatory minimum sentence in a case."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,548.364,548.955,No.
1993.92-8346,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,548.955,550.955,So they'll know the defendant's exposure.
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,550.955,551.646,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-8346,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,551.646,552.697,Distinguish--
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,552.697,557.04,"The diff... I don't mean to interrupt you, but--"
1993.92-8346,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,557.04,561.994,"--Yes, distinguish the two, if it's a question of the jury making an informed decision."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,561.994,565.466,"--Well, the difference is this."
1993.92-8346,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,686.617,708.011,"If the judge... if the judge told the jury, now, there is a requirement, if you return a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, that this person go to mental institutions... a mental institution, but it is possible that he could be released within 40 days, that would be... you would have no objection to such an instruction."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,708.011,720.33,"Well, I think that instruction is... I do object to that instruction, Your Honor, because I don't think it solves the problem that I am urging the Court to correct."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,755.415,774.058,"Well, that's the good side from the point of view of your client, but if we're interested in giving the truth a totally... the jury a totally truthful, accurate picture, why wouldn't one add what Justice Ginsburg said, that there cold be a hearing in 40 days and he might first... that that would be his first opportunity to be released."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,774.058,791.81,"Mr. Chief Justice, we're not trying to get the jury... I'm not trying to get the jury involved in what's going to happen to this man down the road... or woman... other than to say, other than to assuage whatever fears they have that they're going to release this man."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.81,797.155,"Well, buy they're... if he could be released in 40 days, maybe some of those fears are justified."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,797.155,809.214,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Act is so severe that--"
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,809.214,810.053,"Well what do you mean, severe?"
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,810.053,818.451,--I mean severe with regard to the ability of an accused found not guilty solely by reason of insanity to be released.
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.5,837.351,But you don't deny it's possible.
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,837.351,838.473,--It's possible.
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,838.473,846.207,"Well, it seems to me that you're just picking and choosing the parts of the effect of this verdict that would make a jury favor your client."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,846.207,874.176,"Your Honor, I... what I'm trying to do is honor the time honored principle that the jury has no role in the disposition of the accused, at the same time that the jury is put on an equal footing that they're already on with regard to the guilty and not guilty verdicts."
1993.92-8346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,920.368,928.283,"Mr. Trout, is there a... the D.C. Circuit decision you refer to is back about 30 or 40 years ago, I think, in the Lyles case."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,930.944,931.905,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-8346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,931.905,940.921,"You... why did you read us the one from the Sixth Circuit rather than that one, because the Federal Government, I guess, is always a party in the D.C. Circuit cases."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,942.543,950.007,"Your Honor, I did include the D.C. Circuit Pattern Instruction in the appendix to my brief, and--"
1993.92-8346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,950.007,953.781,"How long has that pattern instruction been given, do you know?"
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,953.781,957.974,"--It's... I've got two of them, both of them in here."
1993.92-8346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,976.517,983.934,"Is it a discretionary instruction that the district judge gives, or is it always given if the defendant asks for it, in the D.C. Circuit?"
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,983.934,993.748,"--In the D.C. Circuit it is always given if the defendant asks for it, but if the defendant does not want the instruction given, it is not given."
1993.92-8346,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,993.748,1008.928,"Suppose the trial judge instructs the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you are not to speculate upon the disposition of the... or custody of the defendant in the event you find him not guilty by reason of insanity; the law has addressed that subject and it is not your concern."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1008.928,1016.815,"Well, similar instructions are given, Justice Kennedy, I... in every case, I believe."
1993.92-8346,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1060.235,1063.458,"Well, the trial judge tells the jury the law has addressed this subject."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1067.568,1079.597,"Well, I think that surveys indicate... many surveys do indicate that the public at large is very suspicious of the insanity verdict."
1993.92-8346,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.227,1099.903,And you think that's wrong and that a particular position should be taken in telling the jury about it.
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1099.903,1101.482,"Well, I think it has to be wrong."
1993.92-8346,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1104.446,1114.992,"Well, I mean, the public may think that people at the 40-day hearing are simply judged too leniently and that therefore they get out after 40 days when they shouldn't get out after 40 days."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1135.576,1165.375,"--Justice Scalia, the reason to give the instruction, as I see it, is to have the jury concentrate on the law and the evidence in the case, and to... and to bring in the 40-day requirement is a... there is some danger."
1993.92-8346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1165.375,1165.655,Mr. Trout.
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1165.655,1165.916,Yes.
1993.92-8346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1165.916,1170.861,I'm really puzzled by your argument because on the one hand you ask us to follow the example of the D.C. Circuit.
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1170.861,1171.161,Yes.
1993.92-8346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.161,1174.403,And the D.C. Circuit Pattern Instruction has the 40-day provision in it.
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1174.403,1175.343,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-8346,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1175.343,1180.047,It seems to me you've got to... ought to take one position or the other on whether we should look to the D.C. Circuit for guidance.
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1180.047,1200.65,"Well, I think I have it in my brief, Your Honor, that if the... the doctrine that I am asking the Court to follow is the incorporation of the settled judicial construction which was placed on the D.C. statute."
1993.92-8346,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1200.65,1202.561,"Well, you said it wasn't."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1206.484,1207.245,"No, sir, I did not acknowledge that."
1993.92-8346,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1208.527,1210.858,"Well, it's not a construction of any text in the statute, is it?"
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1210.858,1215.372,"--No, sir, but it is a... it's a settled construction of the statute."
1993.92-8346,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1215.372,1228.52,"Well, it's a settled practice in D.C. when administering the statute, but as I understood your answer, the D.C. Circuit did not purport to be construing any language in the statute when it laid down the instructional rule that you're asking for."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1228.52,1230.313,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1311.046,1312.705,Mr. Trout.
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1312.705,1313.015,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1313.015,1321.391,"In your Appendix E, starting on 37a of your brief, there's an Alternative A."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1321.391,1322.662,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1322.662,1324.093,And then an Alternative B.
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1324.093,1324.463,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1324.463,1331.428,"And then on 41a we have Alternative A, Superior Court, which I take it is the D.C. Superior Court."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1331.428,1331.739,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.739,1334.62,"And then Alternative B, District Court."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1334.62,1334.971,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1334.971,1347.06,"Are all... is Alternative A on page 37a and Alternative B on 39a and Alternative B on 41a, are all of those given in the District Court of the District of Columbia?"
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1347.06,1348.242,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1381.774,1392.913,Is there... do more than one of the various instructions I've mentioned apply when the prosecution is under... is governed by the IDRA?
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1392.913,1396.153,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, I didn't understand the question."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1396.153,1409.763,"Well, there are... we have an instruction on page 37a and an instruction on page 39a and an instruction on page 41a; which of those are used when the IDRA governs?"
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1409.763,1420.43,"I have to stop a minute, Your Honor, and remember."
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.43,1424.043,"Well, don't take a lot of time from your argument."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1425.376,1426.376,All right.
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1445.081,1446.924,And where is that in your brief?
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1446.924,1448.334,That's on page 36a.
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1448.334,1451.855,And then what are... what are the alternatives?
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1455.348,1466.505,"Well, no, they define the... they define insanity and give the substantive nature of the defense."
1993.92-8346,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1484.627,1517.099,"Mr. Trout, if I didn't agree with you as to whether this requirement is brought along by the statute, if I don't think it's a matter of statutory construction, but I do think that there's a question as to what the Federal courts should provide under their supervisory power and if I think that they should provide this instruction, why shouldn't I think that they would also have to provide the instruction, for example, in a case where there have been multiple crimes committed by a particular individual and he's been convicted of one of them already?"
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1533.54,1557.616,"It's different because in that case that you pose, the defendant is on trial for a crime, and the jury knows that if they convict him he is subject to punishment, and that's all they... that's all they need to know."
1993.92-8346,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.269,1564.492,"But you say they should also know that if they release him, he's not going to be turned loose on the public."
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1569.207,1583.555,"--It's important in the insanity context simply because they... there's a void there and they don't have any knowledge, or they may not have any knowledge, or they may have erroneous knowledge."
1993.92-8346,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1610.156,1620.881,Was there anything in particular in this case that might have led the jury to believe that the defendant would be release immediately?
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1620.881,1626.086,"Your Honor, there was nothing in the case that--"
1993.92-8346,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1626.086,1629.988,Or not treated at all?
1993.92-8346,0,43388,thomas_r_trout,,1629.988,1634.532,--There was nothing in the case that would have caused them to believe that.
1993.92-8346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.696,1688.168,"Thank you, Mr. Trout."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1691.581,1701.065,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-8346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1784.991,1787.274,"Ms. Wax, can I ask you just kind of a basic question?"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1799.024,1799.272,Right.
1993.92-8346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.272,1805.356,Are you asking us to decide the case in a way that will require the D.C. Circuit to change its practice?
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1805.356,1817.615,"We are asking this Court to lay down a supervisory principle, just setting aside the whole issue of statutory construction."
1993.92-8346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1840.31,1840.95,I understand that's your position--
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1840.95,1843.981,"So, in a way I'm saying, yes, we are asking--"
1993.92-8346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.981,1848.576,"--Yes, you do understand... you, in effect, are saying that that practice has been erroneous for the last 20 years or so."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1848.576,1853.819,"--As a rigid, inflexible, blanket rule, yes, but not as a matter of instruction."
1993.92-8346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1853.819,1858.523,Has it been the Government's practice regularly to object to the giving of the instruction in the District of Columbia?

1993.92-8346,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1869.108,1870.979,"It wouldn't affect, though, the D.C. Superior Court--"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1870.979,1871.169,--No.
1993.92-8346,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1871.169,1873.4,--Where there's the same prosecutor but a different code.
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1873.4,1874.401,Exactly.
1993.92-8346,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1906.085,1918.073,"Ms. Wax, would... you are now urging us to instate a supervisory rule that would go together with the IDRA."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1918.073,1920.276,--With Federal--
1993.92-8346,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1920.276,1933.945,"Suppose the jury sends a note to the judge that says if we return an NGI verdict, will the defendant walk."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1943.361,1968.776,"--Well, I think under those circumstances the judge could reasonably conclude that the jury was tempted to abandon its responsibility or its oath, that their... that the system, so to speak, was not functioning properly; that the jury was focused on something that they weren't supposed to be focused on, even to the point where they may harbor a misconception about what would happen."
1993.92-8346,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1988.5,1995.133,"Could the judge say, no, he won't, because I'm obliged to send him to an institution where he will be examined?"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1995.133,1997.864,"Yes, he could."
1993.92-8346,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2007.872,2013.005,"I'm not sure I understand, Ms. Wax, the basis for your answer to Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2017.76,2018.542,--Right.
1993.92-8346,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2018.542,2020.354,"But then if he wanted, he could add the instruction."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2043.063,2060.984,"Well, no, if the jury says will the defendant walk, will he be instantly released, that... I think the judge can think that that's somehow equivalent to a prosecutor making the statement, and, by the way, this defendant's going to walk, because it means that there is this notion in their mind which is inaccurate."
1993.92-8346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.965,2073.074,"Well, let me--"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2101.956,2117.057,"--Well, my understanding from Justice Ginsburg's question... and maybe I misheard it... is that they actually asked, will this individual be instantly freed, implying that they had a misimpression because, in fact, he's not going to be instantly freed necessarily."
1993.92-8346,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2118.998,2122.781,"The question is if we return an NGI verdict, will the defendant walk."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2123.222,2124.183,--Right.
1993.92-8346,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2125.142,2129.235,"--And you said that, yes, the judge could tell... could respond no to that question."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2129.235,2129.626,"--Well, no, he--"
1993.92-8346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.626,2136.842,"Justice Ginsburg did not say that the question was if we return a DWI verdict, the defendant will walk, won't he."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2144.987,2145.358,"--Well, now we're getting into subtleties."
1993.92-8346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2192.091,2209.654,"Ms. Wax, do you take the position that in our supervisory power we should insist that every jury be told that they should not concern themselves with what happens to the defendant following their verdict, whatever it is?"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2209.654,2218.48,"Well, it probably isn't necessary to insist on it, since I believe that it is generally practice in most Federal jurisdictions, at least it was--"
1993.92-8346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2218.48,2219.8,That instruction was given here.
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2219.8,2222.222,"--Yes, it was, on page A-8 of the Joint Appendix."
1993.92-8346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2222.222,2227.544,"And you are satisfied that it is always given, so we don't have to concern ourselves with it."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2227.544,2233.237,"I'm not going to say with absolute certainty that it's always given, because I haven't reviewed the instructions of each circuit, but--"
1993.92-8346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2233.237,2238.843,"But in any event, this Court has never handed down some decision saying that it must be given."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2238.843,2240.523,--Not to my knowledge.
1993.92-8346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2240.523,2248.387,"But presumably if that's given, what additional instruction or rule is required by us?"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2259.277,2269.123,"Well, we do think that the judge should have a great deal of discretion, but we also believe that there can be such a think as abuse of discretion in this instance."
1993.92-8346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2283.551,2283.731,Well--
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2283.731,2290.846,--There are other instances in which the judge could equally be allowed discretion to give instructions about mandatory minimums--
1993.92-8346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2290.846,2310.401,"--Do you say that it would be an abuse of discretion for a trial judge to give a truthful instruction, such as that given in the D.C. courts, on what happens as a... following a not guilty by reason of insanity verdict?"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2317.886,2329.504,"--Well, I'm not sure that it would ever come to appeal, necessarily, but I think we would take the position that the judge should not be doing that, and--"
1993.92-8346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2329.504,2335.118,"The district court which felt otherwise could so instruct, I suppose."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2337.779,2338.64,--Exactly.
1993.92-8346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2338.64,2341.583,"--If there's an acquittal, and they'd have no interest in raising it if there's a conviction."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2341.583,2342.123,Exactly.
1993.92-8346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2350.23,2354.944,"But as a matter of principle, you take the view that's an abuse of discretion to give it."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2354.944,2395.409,"--Well, I think it would be... I think this Court should indicate that it would be improper because it would not be in keeping with the general principles that govern our system, which is that we don't ordinarily have trial judges instructing juries about consequences of verdicts, not just in the insanity context but in a million other contexts in which the jury could well be interested in what's going to happen, could well be interested in probation, issues of parole, mandatory minimum-maximum sentences, whether they can make a recommendation of leniency as the Rogers case exemplifies."
1993.92-8346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.884,2405.837,Has this slippery slope in the District of Columbia caused any people to slide downhill?
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2420.006,2420.808,"--Well, no."
1993.92-8346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2428.685,2428.865,"Not ""those sorts""."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2437.46,2449.698,"--But, Your Honor, there's really no way to distinguish between that sort of instruction which opens the door to the jury speculating about the consequences of the verdict... and it's not as if this doesn't come at a price."
1993.92-8346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2457.515,2458.316,"Well, of course, that's why he has a lawyer."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2475.068,2487.687,"Well, it's just our view that this is not a necessary rule, and in that sense we shouldn't have the rule, which is just another opportunity for error on the part of the judge; that it's not a desireable rule--"
1993.92-8346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2487.687,2491.057,"Well, it wouldn't be error if you had a regular rule that you give the pattern instruction when it's asked for."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2497.852,2510.081,"--Well, the problem is, of course... well, let me just say that the instruction that petitioner wants, the instruction that he's requesting, is not really a terribly accurate or helpful instruction."
1993.92-8346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2511.363,2514.435,"No, but would you not agree that the D.C. Circuit's instruction is accurate?"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2514.435,2516.515,"--It is accurate, Your Honor."
1993.92-8346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.515,2517.787,"It has the 40 days in it, and it has--"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2517.787,2541.703,"Well, it does, but our position is that any jury that is going to be... is going to be swayed by its fear of what's going to happen to the defendant instead of adhering to its oath and looking only to evidence is not going to be influenced by this instruction because this instruction provides no... very little reassurance to any jury that an individual who might be dangerous is not going to be released."
1993.92-8346,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2562.307,2565.569,"--Well, I suppose that's the defendant's choice to make if he has the option to ask for the instruction."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2565.569,2585.922,"--But it's this Court's responsibility to decide whether, in fact, it makes any sense to add yet another requirement, another instruction, when that instruction is out of keeping with the general... our paradigm, which is that juries look to the evidence, and is just of marginal utility and in some cases may backfire."
1993.92-8346,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2603.836,2609.478,"But as long as the defense... it's the defendant's option, why should we be concerned about that aspect of it?"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2644.375,2652.559,"Well, I mean, that law review article has yet to be produced."
1993.92-8346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2674.835,2686.623,"Well, Ms. Wax, all that we have to do in this case, I suppose, to satisfy your concern immediately, is to say the statute doesn't require the court to give the instruction."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2686.623,2690.256,"Right, that is one... certainly one--"
1993.92-8346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2690.256,2707.246,"We don't have a case here where the judge has given an instruction and there's some objection made, and perhaps we never will, but to decide this case we only need to answer that one question, does the statute require it, isn't that so?"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2707.246,2717.784,"--That's certainly correct based on the argument that petitioner has made, but we have made the additional argument and we think that guidance might be useful, although certainly not mandatory."
1993.92-8346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2725.839,2729.612,"Ms. Wax, the first question presented for review in the..."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2745.873,2771.008,"It certainly can, Your Honor, and that's why we have made a separate argument both in our brief and are attempting to make one here, which is that certainly even if the statute doesn't require this instruction... and certainly it doesn't require it... that there still is a further question of whether, as a supervisory matter, this Court ought to have a certain rule about what lower courts should do."
1993.92-8346,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2780.435,2794.735,"Ms. Wax, if we reach that issue, would it be your position that the instruction should sometimes be given not only at a defendant's request, in the case that you gave in your hypothesis, but at the State's request as well?"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2794.735,2797.717,"--Yes, under appropriate circumstances."
1993.92-8346,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2797.717,2800.899,What would the circumstances be in which the State would be entitled to it?
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2800.899,2805.925,"Well, I'm having trouble thinking of one... I'm having trouble thinking of circumstances."
1993.92-8346,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2805.925,2826.167,"Well, what if we had Justice Ginsburg's law review article on the bench again, wouldn't the prosecutor be free to make the argument, Judge, the... most jurors don't know what NGI means and I want them to know that anyone found NGI can walk in 40 days."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2830.298,2836.292,"Under our... under our theory, I don't think the prosecutor would be entitled to the instruction."
1993.92-8346,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2836.292,2836.513,Why not?
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2836.513,2844.089,"Because our view is that in the absence of a particular indication that this jury, in this case--"
1993.92-8346,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2844.089,2846.3,In other words the law review article wouldn't be enough.
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2846.3,2846.56,--No.
1993.92-8346,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2848.082,2858.828,"If the judge is giving the instructions on not guilty by reason of insanity and the jurors are shaking their heads and rolling their eyes, at that point he can exercise discretion and tell them more?"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2858.828,2865.203,If there... our view is that we presume that the system is functioning properly in the sense that the jury--
1993.92-8346,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2865.203,2868.154,"Well, do you presume that if they're shaking their heads and rolling their eyes."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2868.154,2870.206,"--Well, no, that's a particularized set of circumstances."
1993.92-8346,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2870.206,2872.146,"Okay, now they shake their heads and they roll their eyes."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2879.141,2884.455,I think... I wouldn't say no to that.
1993.92-8346,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2885.236,2885.967,Would you say yes?
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2890.001,2898.246,"--Well, I think that that is very different from this case, and I haven't really thought through what the State would be entitled to."
1993.92-8346,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2898.246,2898.436,It is.
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2898.436,2898.816,Yeah.
1993.92-8346,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2912.856,2929.416,"Yeah, but we're now concerned with supervisory authority, and if our criterion for exercising supervisory authority is that the jury ought to have an accurate sense of the consequences that will follow upon the return of a given verdict, why doesn't the prosecutor have just as good an argument for saying"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2936.231,2936.822,Right.
1993.92-8346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.379,2962.288,"What if a jury in a criminal case that has a number of counts, first degree murder, second degree murder, manslaughter; there's some indication that the jury thinks that manslaughter, the punishment for manslaughter is that you're going to lose your driving... driver's license; must that be corrected?"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2972.236,2979.172,"Well, you mean, if the jury says... sends back a note and says we want to know what's going to happen to this person's driver's license."
1993.92-8346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2979.172,2979.923,Right.
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2979.923,2983.196,"Yeah, we're very concerned about this person's driver's license."
1993.92-8346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.196,2992.382,"We have no idea what the consequences of first degree versus second degree versus manslaughter, we have no idea what the consequences are, please tell us how long does this person spend in prison, if any time at all?"
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2992.382,2992.452,Okay.
1993.92-8346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2992.452,2994.686,Must the court respond to that?
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2994.686,2994.866,Right.
1993.92-8346,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3004.731,3007.422,"I don't think a court must, and I don't see any reason why that's different from this case."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3009.095,3012.136,"--Well, I think a line has to be drawn somewhere."
1993.92-8346,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3012.136,3026.946,"But it seems to me very odd, Ms. Wax, that if you reserve this instruction for the jury that is transgressing its authority, then they have the advantage or the disadvantage of knowing the extra information."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3046.719,3047.369,Well.
1993.92-8346,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3047.369,3056.385,"It seems to me this is a very odd calculus you're asking us to accept, that the one time we give this instruction is when the jury's about ready to go off in the wrong direction."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3056.385,3063.38,"Well, once again, Your Honor, it really depends on the circumstances, as with all curative instructions, as with all cases in which--"
1993.92-8346,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3063.38,3067.001,"Well, but I'm... we're trying to give some guidance to the district judges as to what those circumstances are."
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3067.001,3084.242,"--As in all cases where juries send back notes asking specific questions or saying we're concerned about this and they're not supposed to be concerned, or we harbor this misconception that just simply isn't true, the judge is going to have to make a judgment about how much they need to tell the jury to get them back on track."
1993.92-8346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3099.495,3101.087,May I go back to raise one question with you again.
1993.92-8346,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3111.185,3116.499,The practice has been that the instruction is given unless the defendant objects.
1993.92-8346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3117.951,3118.161,I see.
