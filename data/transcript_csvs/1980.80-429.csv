1980.80-429,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.309,We will hear arguments next in County of Washington v. Gunther.
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,93.245,99.477,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-429,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,291.774,309.297,"Mr. Derr, one thing that bothers me about this case is the extent to which we are talking about kind of an abstract distinction which may not boil down to too much when it comes to actual application."
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,316.545,328.118,Comparable work is simply the tip of the iceberg of an open-ended interpretation of Title VII in the area of sex discrimination.
1980.80-429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,380.754,394.638,"In that area you could... I'm sure your sister will disagree with this, or the extent of this, but in the extreme logic of it you could compare the wage rights of truck drivers with that of secretaries, for example."
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,394.638,395.56,--Very definitely.
1980.80-429,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,464.579,480.166,"I was just going to ask Mr. Derr, I gather on the Equal Pay Act where we deal, I suppose, with something like identical jobs in the sense, for example, of an airline steward, it doesn't matter whether they are male or female, they do exactly the same thing."
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,491.054,492.162,--That's correct.
1980.80-429,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,493.396,502.376,"To that extent there's no identity of duty between the male and female jobs here, as there would be in my hypothetical of the airline steward?"
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,502.376,503.064,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-429,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,505.625,507.64,"That was a finding of the district court, was it not?"
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,507.64,509.748,--And that was uphold by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
1980.80-429,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,509.748,510.42,And the Court of Appeals did not change it.
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,510.42,512.059,And that's not contested by respondents.
1980.80-429,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.059,519.76,"And the claim isn't that women are put in these jobs, and men put in these, discriminatorily?"
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,522.165,523.321,That's correct.
1980.80-429,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,544.624,559.681,"And your position would be that even if you didn't have to rely on inference to prove intention, even if they had the employer cold, so to speak, that there would be no Title VII liability?"
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,559.681,564.289,"No, that hypothetical was raised by the 9th Circuit."
1980.80-429,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,584.249,592.637,"Well, isn't it your position now, Mr. Derr, that unless the guards have a case under the Equal Pay Act, they have none under Title VII?"
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,592.887,595.417,--For wage-based sex discrimination.
1980.80-429,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.417,599.416,"For anything, whether intentional or not."
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,599.416,602.929,The Equal Pay Act is an intentional act.
1980.80-429,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.864,616.268,"I know, but the case doesn't get off the ground unless the jobs are identical?"
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,616.268,617.628,--That's correct.
1980.80-429,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,617.628,623.923,Unless they're like my hypothetical of the airline steward's job?
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,623.923,624.486,That's correct.
1980.80-429,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,624.486,630.905,"Unless it's like that... and since the finding here by two courts is, it's not, you say there's no Title VII claim?"
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,630.905,639.978,"That's correct, Your Honor, but if I may respond to the hypothetical, there are remedies and one of them is an improper interpretation of the Equal Pay Act."
1980.80-429,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,669.936,673.248,Even though your current force is 100 percent female?
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,673.248,673.793,--That's right.
1980.80-429,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,730.676,741.609,"Is it true, then, Mr. Derr, that the problem presented by this case only affects those job categories that are bona fide gender-based classifications?"
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,752.152,761.461,"I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I understand the relationship of bona fide qualification, Your Honor."
1980.80-429,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,761.461,774.189,"--Well, the problem that you're addressing in this case is one in which there's a separate female category of jobs and a separate male category of jobs, entirely separate, and then... you assume it won't be changed in the future, and it's always been that way, in both categories?"
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,778.345,779.657,"Yes, definitely."
1980.80-429,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.657,784.327,"Well, at least the category that we're talking about here is an exclusively female category?"
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,785.233,790.731,The matron's job was an exclusively female category of job.
1980.80-429,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,794.449,799.946,You mean the matrons might have had access to the males' jobs?
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,799.946,800.368,That's correct.
1980.80-429,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,800.368,801.553,Of superintending male prisoners?
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,801.553,802.162,Yes.
1980.80-429,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.162,803.63,Are there any?
1980.80-429,0,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,803.63,808.973,"The jobs do not exist... well, the matrons' jobs do not exist."
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,1909.221,1912.487,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-429,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1980.505,1983.223,Did you make a proffer of what you were going to prove?
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,1983.223,1984.301,"--No, I did not, Your Honor."
1980.80-429,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1985.753,1988.877,"That's usually the best way to preserve a point like that, isn't it?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,1988.877,1990.674,--That is certainly true.
1980.80-429,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2058.849,2083.588,"Mrs. Hewitt, in a case where the employer has established a system of pay and set a certain rate for secretaries and a certain rate for outside salesmen and the outside salesmen's rate is higher or at any rate their gross income is higher, do you think that could be attacked under Title VII?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2083.588,2092.866,"It could be attacked if there were some reason to indicate that there were sex factors being taken into account in setting the wage rate, not--"
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2092.866,2095.724,"Well, let's say all the salesmen were men and all the secretaries were women."
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2095.724,2102.737,--I don't think that that in itself establishes any kind of intent because we have that situation in this case.
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2121.777,2125.962,"These are clearly different jobs, secretary and salesmen."
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2126.384,2126.728,That is correct.
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2137.426,2140.55,--But your point is that there can be discrimination even though the jobs are quite different?
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2140.55,2140.784,--Certainly.
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2155.247,2155.981,They equal.
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2158.901,2159.62,That's correct.
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2163.978,2176.848,"It pays the jobs differently, even though... and it turns out that in one job category 100 percent of the occupants are female and in the other 100 percent are male."
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2179.925,2180.941,"--Yes, but--"
1980.80-429,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.941,2193.403,But you would be here if half the corrections officers were women and half men if your claim still was that the exclusively female category was paid on a discriminatory basis?
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2193.403,2194.106,--That's correct.
1980.80-429,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2219.767,2237.697,"Well, what if you take a situation which I think has arisen in connection with the airlines where you have male flight attendants and female stewardesses... I guess they're all called attendants now."
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2276.245,2296.206,"My view of that is that that fact alone would not state a prima facie case, because what Title VII prohibits is discrimination because of sex, and the mere fact that the plaintiff is a woman and she's comparing herself to a man doesn't create any inference that there's discrimination on the basis of sex."
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2299.158,2306.435,"But your argument says, tells us, that there could be a case of a discrimination even though the jobs are quite different."
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2307.872,2308.419,There certainly could be.
1980.80-429,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2310.418,2312.901,"And how much you have to prove is really not here, is it?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2312.901,2313.323,--Yes; that's correct.
1980.80-429,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2314.463,2317.76,But what would be a hypothetical example?
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2319.665,2321.038,Of a prima facie case?
1980.80-429,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2321.038,2321.492,Yes.
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2325.115,2328.333,All right.
1980.80-429,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2421.248,2435.931,"Are you saying that here, for example, they priced the corrections officer, a male job, at $500 a month; they priced the women's, matron's job at $400 a month, but then they paid the corrections officers five but the women 350?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2435.931,2436.476,--Exactly.
1980.80-429,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2436.476,2437.851,That's what you say this case is?
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2437.851,2438.57,That's exactly correct.
1980.80-429,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2455.578,2456.874,In a prima facie case?
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2456.874,2457.546,Yes.
1980.80-429,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2457.546,2459.515,You mean to rebut the prima facie case?
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2461.389,2462.014,No.
1980.80-429,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2464.512,2487.674,"What if both the matrons' guard force were made up of both men and women and paid equally, and the deputy sheriff force were made up of men and women, and paid at a higher rate, but paid equally?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2498.827,2508.089,"I think the system is challengeable but they're going to have to show something that would lead you to believe, even on a prima facie case, that discrimination was involved."
1980.80-429,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.464,2520.77,"Well, you answered me a while ago that the matron could certainly make out a case on that basis, if you... and that you could make your proffer of proof and make a prima facie case."
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2520.77,2533.297,"--Well, as I understand the difference in the situation, in the matron situation we have two factors: one, it's totally sex-segregated, and two, you have a level of pay which is then determined and then the women are paid less, so that's determined."
1980.80-429,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2539.31,2540.014,Right.
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2542.747,2553.899,--I think it's more questionable whether you have a prima facie case when you have a mix of males and females and you're paying that particular job category less.
1980.80-429,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.221,2578.154,"But the matrons in my brother Rehnquist's example would have as strong a case there as they do here, if they exclusively?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2578.154,2579.513,That's correct.
1980.80-429,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2579.513,2580.185,Yes.
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2580.185,2590.618,There is nothing magical about a pay case under Title VII as compared to any other kind of a discrimination case under it.
1980.80-429,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2608.453,2617.45,But you do reject the argument of your brother that there can't be a Title VII case unless you can prove an equal pay violation?
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2617.45,2618.091,--Absolutely.
1980.80-429,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2718.035,2726.282,"Well, then, is your position that the Bennett Act... rather, that the Equal Pay Act, in effect, authorized nothing?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2726.282,2741.697,"I think the Equal Pay Act authorized the payment of different wages for the same job in four instances which are the four affirmative defenses, seniority system, merit system, productivity and quantity or any factor other than sex."
1980.80-429,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2742.916,2749.476,"What's your response, then, to your opponent's argument that that was already in the Act?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2749.476,2759.41,"The first three, the seniority system and the merit system, and the quantity or quality of production, are already in Section 703(h) of Title VII."
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2770.937,2776.933,"Well, it wouldn't be a violation of Title VII if the alleged discrimination was based on a factor other than sex... race or--"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2776.933,2779.039,That's correct.
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2779.039,2780.042,--Any other statutory criterion.
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2780.042,2787.524,It's interesting that the defense of any factor other than sex came out of the Equal Pay Act and the Equal Pay Act says the same thing.
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2793.522,2794.599,"It's surplusage in those cases, is the argument."
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2794.599,2798.004,"--So they obviously thought it meant something, and it must mean the same thing--"
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2798.004,2798.707,What do you think it means?
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2798.707,2801.332,"--And it has been... well, it has been used--"
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2801.332,2802.268,What do you think it means if it says
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2805.549,2830.492,"--Well, I think it's been interpreted to bear on the burden of going forward for the parties, and the inference of sex being a factor created in a prima facie case can be rebutted by showing that it's some factor other than sex, under either Title VII or under the Equal Pay Act."
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2830.492,2835.272,And that would be true whether or not that statutory provision were there or not.
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2835.272,2853.061,"But, I agree... I think that in the drafting of both statutes that there are some words that may not have needed to be there, but I don't think that there's anything that indicates that Congress intended the wholesale change of Title VII which the petitioners' construction would have."
1980.80-429,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2887.188,2900.949,Do you attach any significance to the fact that the provision banning discrimination on the basis of sex in Title VII was introduced by Congressman Howard Smith from Virginia?
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2900.949,2917.285,"I subscribe fully to the theory that he had in mind that he wanted the bill not to be enacted because sex was included, but that isn't what happened, and I don't think that too much can be put for that now at this time."
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2925.079,2932.64,"Well, except that women, you concede, are the only group protected by Title VII, where, for whom there's a BFOQ?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2932.64,2933.67,That's correct.
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2933.67,2952.787,"And also, I think, since I've already interrupted you, as I understand your colleague's argument, it is that the Equal Pay Act is the sole criterion only when the claim is a differential in compensation, not where the claim is something else, a promotion, or hiring, or whatever?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2952.787,2953.63,That's correct.
1980.80-429,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2957.488,2976.683,"And your colleague's argument, even at its broadest extent, would tell us that the Title VII is satisfied if the Equal Pay Act is satisfied in a claim devoted exclusively to differentials in compensation?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,2976.683,2977.652,That's correct.
1980.80-429,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2994.129,3002.204,"Incidentally, Mrs. Hewitt, I thought you... did you not say earlier, there's not ever been a female in the corrections officer's job?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,3011.888,3013.98,Our contention is that access is illusory.
1980.80-429,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3021.415,3026.163,"Well, is there any finding by either of the lower courts that there is access to the corrections officer's?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,3026.163,3030.662,"--It was noted, yes, in the court, that the corrections officer's position was open to women."
1980.80-429,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3030.662,3031.287,As a finding?
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,3031.287,3031.817,As a finding.
1980.80-429,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3031.817,3032.88,"By whom, the district court?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,3032.88,3034.269,By the district court.
1980.80-429,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.206,3040.641,"And there have been, or are, women deputy sheriffs?"
1980.80-429,1,19086,carol_a_hewitt,,3040.641,3046.686,"There are women deputy sheriffs, but now that the deputy sheriffs for a time were in the jail doing the corrections officers' job."
1980.80-429,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3149.301,3161.187,Mr. Sullivan.
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3161.187,3166.56,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.80-429,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3188.8,3205.855,"Well, really, I agree with you, and the only reason I raised that was to qualify the claim that women are treated exactly like every other protected group under Title VII."
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3214.166,3225.051,"--Well, I believe it's also applicable to members of religious groups, and I think that the rationale is that there are some legitimate purposes that Congress--"
1980.80-429,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3225.051,3225.317,--Right.
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3226.097,3226.597,"--wanted to protect, as there--"
1980.80-429,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3226.597,3227.863,"--Statutorily, for the other groups protected."
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3227.863,3228.816,--such as pay discrimination.
1980.80-429,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3292.243,3294.352,Because it would not violate the Equal Pay Act?
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3294.352,3295.009,--That's correct.
1980.80-429,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3295.009,3298.178,"And why wouldn't it violate the Equal Pay Act, that latter example?"
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3298.178,3307.957,"Well, it would violate the Equal Pay Act only in those circumstances in which a male and a female were doing exactly the same job--"
1980.80-429,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3307.957,3308.472,Exactly.
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3308.472,3309.41,--within the definition.
1980.80-429,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3311.252,3311.439,Exactly.
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3318.03,3318.779,--That's right.
1980.80-429,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3328.806,3329.697,Right.
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3329.697,3340.411,--then the point is that a good deal of discrimination could be allowed to occur simply because the jobs were not equal under the Equal Pay Act.
1980.80-429,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3362.106,3399.496,"Mr. Sullivan, as I understand Mrs. Hewitt's argument, she says that for her purposes she is taking the scale, wage scale, already set by the county and simply seeking to show that there has been discrimination on the basis of sex under Title VII in it; and that that would not require the courts to evaluate the relative worth of the flight attendant's job versus the pilot's job, and that sort of thing."
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3416.083,3422.676,"Well, the Government has not taken a position as to that question in our brief."
1980.80-429,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3433.982,3435.247,"Well, what if we don't either?"
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3437.481,3448.554,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the theory of our brief does not depend on the comparability issue."
1980.80-429,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3476.856,3480.073,"To prove intentional sex discrimination, is that it?"
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3480.073,3485.868,To prove sex discrimination within the meaning of Section 703(a) of Title VII.
1980.80-429,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3485.868,3498.035,"And really, your argument is simply that there can be a violation of Title VII with respect to compensation even though there's no violation of the Equal Pay Act?"
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3498.035,3499.081,That's correct.
1980.80-429,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3499.081,3501.799,"And that's really the broad issue, isn't it?"
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3501.799,3502.502,That's correct.
1980.80-429,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3502.502,3505.251,Are you defending the Court of Appeals' opinion?
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3508.047,3509.391,That's correct.
1980.80-429,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3551.997,3562.368,Well there's one that we don't understand at this moment what purpose much further discussion would serve since nobody seems to understand what would be involved.
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3562.368,3566.491,--I'm not sure I understand the comment--
1980.80-429,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3566.491,3569.599,"Well, that's... the real issue is the one you stated, isn't it?"
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3593.024,3593.994,--I think that's the issue that's... that's correct.
1980.80-429,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3615.921,3620.562,But you want us to leave it to further development in the district courts and the courts of appeals?
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3620.562,3621.451,That's correct.
1980.80-429,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3621.451,3623.704,But is that what this Court ordinarily does?
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3634.528,3657.674,"Well, I think that in the Teamsters decision the Court said that despite all of the work that gone into McDonnell-Douglas, that McDonnell-Douglas was simply one paradigm for proving a prima facie case of discrimination, and that there were other ways of proving a prima facie case of discrimination."
1980.80-429,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3683.492,3687.476,"Well, didn't we limit the grant in this case to just the one question?"
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3696.408,3698.08,--I think that is correct.
1980.80-429,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3698.782,3711.418,"That is the issue, and if we decide against you the case is over, if we disagree with your version of the Bennett Amendment."
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3711.418,3715.308,--I believe that would be correct.
1980.80-429,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3715.308,3721.415,"But if we agree with you we don't reach any other question, do we?"
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3721.415,3722.961,No.
1980.80-429,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3730.847,3737.813,"Is it your view that the term ""comparable work"" is the same as ""equal work""?"
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3737.813,3741.703,No.
1980.80-429,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3742.968,3749.074,I got the impression that that was your view being advanced at some time here.
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3752.324,3756.51,"I think, ordinarily, they don't."
1980.80-429,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3762.148,3770.942,"Well, in a law firm, the young lawyers do work that's comparable to what the senior partners do, but they don't do equal work and they surely don't get equal pay."
1980.80-429,2,18062,barry_sullivan,,3772.799,3774.767,I have been personally aware of that.
1980.80-429,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3774.767,3779.312,We will resume there at one o'clock.
1980.80-429,3,36805,mister_taggart,,3802.227,3803.74,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-429,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3803.74,3805.6,"Do you have anything further, counsel?"
1980.80-429,4,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,3807.13,3811.113,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-429,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3869.106,3878.835,"Mr. Derr, could I ask you, just to be sure I have your legal position, what about their hypothetical about a cost-of-living increase for the male category but no such increase for the females?"
1980.80-429,4,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,3878.835,3882.725,--A cost-of-living increase for the males only?
1980.80-429,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3882.725,3884.912,"Yes, or a bonus for them of, say, ten percent at the end of the year?"
1980.80-429,4,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,3884.912,3891.144,"If it comes within one of the other protected areas of Title VII, it obviously is a violation."
1980.80-429,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3907.652,3909.855,"Specifically, in this case, it would not violate either statute?"
1980.80-429,4,34354,lawrence_r_derr,,3909.855,3912.241,That's correct.
1980.80-429,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3936.61,3939.184,"Thank you, counsel."
