1977.76-5729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.738,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 76-5729, Oliphant against the Suquamish Indian Tribe."
1977.76-5729,0,38127,philip_p_malone,,21.584,25.021,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-5729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,75.717,80.11,Counsel what basis do you rely on for Federal Jurisdiction in this case?
1977.76-5729,0,38127,philip_p_malone,,80.11,87.542,"The federal jurisdictions in this case, in federal district court constitution, habeas corpus."
1977.76-5729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,87.542,95.521,Of what particular statutory grants of jurisdiction for the federal district courts do you rely on?
1977.76-5729,0,38127,philip_p_malone,,95.521,105.354,"Indian Civil Rights Act, excuse me,Your Honor Indian Civil Rights Act."
1977.76-5729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,105.354,108.142,I do not mean neither statute so it is the Indian Civil Rights Act?
1977.76-5729,0,38127,philip_p_malone,,108.142,111.7,"Indian Civil Rights Act, primarily."
1977.76-5729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,111.7,114.064,"When you say primarily, is there something else that is secondary?"
1977.76-5729,0,38127,philip_p_malone,,114.064,124.977,"Well also, that main, not secondarily, but there is a right from the United States constitution for petition of writ of habeas corpus which --"
1977.76-5729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,124.977,135.251,And to whom may that be. Do you not have to be in custody either in a federal or state commitment in order to rely on that?
1977.76-5729,0,38127,philip_p_malone,,135.251,137.351,"Yes, that is correct."
1977.76-5729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,137.351,145.378,You contend that your client was in custody under either federal or state commitment in this situation?
1977.76-5729,0,38127,philip_p_malone,,145.378,153.156,"He was for a period of time, then he was released on his personal recognizance."
1977.76-5729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,153.156,158.666,When he was detained by the Indians is it your contention that it was the same as if he had been detained by the Federal Government?
1977.76-5729,0,38127,philip_p_malone,,158.666,167.732,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.76-5729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,254.441,259.017,"These days, is there any termination date on the trust property?"
1977.76-5729,0,38127,philip_p_malone,,259.017,260.891,"No, there is not."
1977.76-5729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,260.891,261.868,There used to be.
1977.76-5729,0,38127,philip_p_malone,,261.868,262.553,There used to be.
1977.76-5729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,268.149,269.049,Indefinitely.
1977.76-5729,0,38127,philip_p_malone,,269.049,273.593,Indefinitely.
1977.76-5729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,613.774,626.899,"So the offense really, he was charged with an altercation between himself and the Indian tribal policeman?"
1977.76-5729,0,38127,philip_p_malone,,626.899,630.981,He was charged with resisting an arrest and assaulting one of those police officers.
1977.76-5729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.981,633.822,Who was an Indian tribal policeman?
1977.76-5729,0,38127,philip_p_malone,,633.822,637.491,Yes.
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1455.773,1458.637,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-5729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1475.798,1478.773,And would be the same if they had been arrested by FBI agent?
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1478.773,1480.34,Yes sir.
1977.76-5729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1509.344,1512.639,There is nothing really unique about that is there Mr. Attorney General?
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1512.639,1513.313,I believe --
1977.76-5729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1513.313,1519.533,"If he crossed the line into the next state, he will be subject to some laws that he has no part in making?"
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1519.533,1523.517,"Yes, on a residential basis Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.76-5729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1533.512,1537.185,I am speaking of a man who just going over to a fair or a football game in the next state?
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1537.185,1545.657,"That is true, but these two persons are both residents of the reservation over which the tribal jurisdiction was asserted."
1977.76-5729,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1564.443,1570.179,"What do we, Mr. Attorney General, I suppose you are going to tell us, but where do we turn to answer that question?"
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1570.179,1572.047,That is exactly where I propose --
1977.76-5729,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1572.047,1575.58,Is it some statute or just some case law?
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1575.58,1578.689,It is a statute or a treaty.
1977.76-5729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1609.976,1613.008,"Well, has it ever held that it could not be found some place else?"
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1613.008,1620.651,It has always been very careful to avoid basing the finding on sovereignty.
1977.76-5729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.651,1622.047,Then I guess your answer is no.
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1622.047,1625.238,"Yes, my answer is no."
1977.76-5729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.172,1681.292,The Chickasaws are who won the five civilized choice?
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1681.292,1685.217,"Yes, this was Oklahoma while it was Indian Territory."
1977.76-5729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.512,1809.556,So are submitting that -- is your submission that Congress has in effect past the statute or several of them that says there is no such thing as retain power?
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1809.556,1821.063,It is our position that the law of the United States is that the Indian tribes must show their right to try non-Indians either in a treaty (Voice Overlaps).
1977.76-5729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.063,1823.162,I understand your position.
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1845.474,1856.645,I am stating that the Congress has stated that there is no Indian power to try the non-Indians in these cases. (Voice Overlap).
1977.76-5729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.645,1866.974,You are not just suggesting that Congress has said that there is a law some place that some constitutional principle or what?
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1866.974,1877.878,I am stating two separate propositions that this Court consistently has held that the Indian powers over non-Indians must be found in treaty or statute.
1977.76-5729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.015,1908.082,Do you say the same thing about that tribal sovereignty over Indians?
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1908.082,1915.826,That Mr. Justice White is a very interesting question which of course is not directly involved in this case.
1977.76-5729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.826,1926.248,"But can you just answer yes or no, do the cases or the Congress recognized some sort of retained inherent power of the tribe over Indians?"
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1926.248,1941.13,There is only one case in which this Court has even remotely based its decision on the retained tribal jurisdiction even over tribe or members in Talton v. Mayes.
1977.76-5729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.925,1999.903,"Well, your responses to Mr. Justice White’s question all depend on implication, do they not, that Congress saw fit to confer particular jurisdiction on Federal Courts in certain situations, then on Indian tribes in other situations and if that had existed independently of Congressional action, Congress would have not gone ahead and done it?"
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1999.903,2015.136,"Exactly and in addition there is another statutory scheme in connection with these reservations in the State of Washington which I suspect, but do not know, is paralleled in most other western states."
1977.76-5729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2273.675,2284.694,How about the -- most of your argument as I have understood it would lead to the conclusion that the government does have jurisdiction over these people.
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2306.286,2307.979,Precisely Mr. Justice Stewart.
1977.76-5729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2308.141,2317.509,"The amicus brief as you know, suggests that we even defer argument in this case until we decide whether or not we are going to take the Yakama case?"
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2317.509,2319.923,But I do not believe that you need to do that.
1977.76-5729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.728,2346.754,Mr. Attorney General (Voice Overlap)
1977.76-5729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2346.754,2347.637,Then your submission is --
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2347.637,2349.25,Absent Public Law 280 --
1977.76-5729,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2349.25,2355.355,We do not need to decide in order to decide in your favor who does have jurisdiction?
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2355.355,2357.234,"No, you do not."
1977.76-5729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2357.234,2359.714,I think I misunderstood you.
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2365.017,2370.14,The Congress at least has to try before they can validly assert it.
1977.76-5729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2375.966,2377.307,And you would concede that?
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2377.307,2379.989,I do not concede that.
1977.76-5729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2391.513,2395.27,Let me ask you one question General Gorton.
1977.76-5729,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2411.969,2416.038,It would have a very substantial impact on that situation.
1977.76-5729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2448.416,2452.07,Mr. Ernstoff.
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2452.07,2455.079,Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.
1977.76-5729,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2502.989,2508.631,"Well, the ones in the Sixth Circuit are not crazy about prosecuting a black lung cases either I take it?[Laughter]"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2508.631,2516.612,"I would presume so Your Honor, but the question, I think is a serious question in the matter of federal judicial policy aside from the legal issues that are involved."
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2516.612,2520.514,And what do you do about all the army camps?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2520.514,2526.009,"With the army camps sir, my understanding is there is a system of military justice as well as the federal courts."
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2526.009,2527.663,Some Federal Magistrate is there?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2527.663,2529.279,A Federal Magistrates is used.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2529.279,2531.36,For the Federal Magistrate here?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2531.36,2534.584,"Well, perhaps but thus far I can tell you at least in Seattle."
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2543.351,2545.576,"But none of this would settle this case, will they?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2545.576,2547.134,That is correct Your Honor.
1977.76-5729,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2723.012,2725.714,"You do not think this is an Act of Congress, do you?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2725.714,2726.213,No.
1977.76-5729,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2733.366,2740.399,But the fundamental difference between you and your opponent is who has the burden of proof with Congress as I understand it.
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2754.827,2755.719,It does not.
1977.76-5729,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2774.317,2777.653,"But this case is here now, not five years from now?"
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2777.653,2781.534,That all could have been handled by not arresting these men?[Laughter]
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2781.534,2785.025,That brings up the problem of the facts Mr. Justice Marshall.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2785.025,2808.928,"Well, before we move on, this is not just a matter of legislative solution, if there is anything in the constitutional claims made by your opponent because even though your position were clear as a matter of legislation or treaty, we still then would have the constitutional claims to deal with would we not?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2808.928,2809.769,That is correct.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2809.769,2814.826,With Fifth Amendment claims and for example a jury trial?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2814.826,2817.475,There is a right to a jury trial under the Indian Civil Rights Act.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2817.475,2819.987,And for these offenses?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2819.987,2821.506,For these offenses.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2821.506,2825.534,And how many eligible jurors are there?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2825.534,2829.621,"At this point, the numbers of eligible jurors are the members of the tribe."
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2829.621,2830.887,"Well, not even all members of the tribe."
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2832.989,2833.717,That is correct.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2833.717,2835.78,"So how many, a couple of dozen eligible jurors?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2835.78,2837.952,I think Your Honor these points out a very important point and that is --
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2837.952,2839.015,"Well, in which sense would you answer the question?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2839.015,2849.868,"When these problems come up, the answer to the question is it is very possible for instance that the lack of non-Indians under the near to be selected for the jury is in fact impermissible under the Indian Civil Rights Act."
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2849.868,2853.608,"You would have about the same jury in every case, would you not?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2853.608,2855.631,The point I am making is that that is exactly (Voice Overlap).
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2855.631,2856.924,Would you answer my question?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2856.924,2857.965,The answer is yes.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2859.909,2864.947,And none of the jurors would be of the same ethnic background as any of this defense?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2864.947,2867.734,That is correct and it may be impermissible under the Indian Civil Rights Act.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2887.581,2892.362,"Yes, those are statutory rights, but American Citizens have constitutional rights, do they not?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2892.362,2900.383,"American Citizens have constitutional rights, but most constitutional rights of the first 10 amendments are rights against the state government and against the federal government."
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2906.899,2915.092,"Exactly, and therefore, these defendants are deprived of their constitutional rights that are accorded to most American Citizens, if not all others?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2915.092,2915.885,It is a matter of definition.
1977.76-5729,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2920.652,2929.729,"Well, if you remember of moose latch and a grand master latch up in a men’s room overnight you are not being deprive of any constitutional right, are you?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,2929.729,2933.427,No.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3007.28,3014.058,Are not those constitutional rights were individual and did not depend on how many people exercised it?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3014.058,3015.947,"Not at all, I am merely pointing out as matter of policy."
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3015.947,3016.855,Do you agree with that?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3016.855,3017.944,I do agree with that.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3018.685,3021.274,What do we have to do with policy?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3021.274,3042.928,"Well, the attorney general has raised the questions of what I consider to be policy on what way the misdemeanor jurisdiction should be decided and what is going to happen to the citizens, the residents of these reservations and I am really countering that to show that in fact nothing serious has really happened to cause any federal court anywhere to come down on Indian Tribe that is exercising that jurisdiction."
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3042.928,3053.571,Do you think that somewhere in the federal law system you will find some authority for the Indian Tribe to exercise the jurisdiction that you claim they have?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3053.571,3054.48,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3054.48,3056.904,And where do you find it?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3056.904,3069.67,"Mr. Gorton attempted to say that this Court has never decided this decision before and the answer is yes, if you had, we would not be here today, but this Court has decided other cases that come close to the issue or deal with analytical matters that would come under that issue."
1977.76-5729,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3122.72,3130.669,"But to say that a tribe possesses an attribute of sovereignty, does not necessarily possesses all attributes itself?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3130.669,3131.893,That is correct.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3170.672,3176.427,"I think, what the attorney general said you either look to a statute or treaty or a decision of this Court?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3176.427,3177.701,That is correct.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3177.701,3179.608,And you are now about decision of the Court?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3179.608,3183.653,I am saying that in Morris v. Hitchcock in 1905 there was no previous decision of this Court.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3183.653,3187.539,"What is it, is it just sort of federal common law?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3196.14,3197.844,It is the law of the cases of this Court.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3199.566,3202.311,Not based on the constitution or a statute or --?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3202.311,3208.386,"It is based under the constitution because the constitution gave the United States, the Congress the power to enter into treaties with the Indian tribes."
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3216.484,3223.931,"So, do you think that the Indian tribes in exercising this power are exercising part of the sovereignty of the United States as well as that of the Indian Tribe?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3223.931,3224.845,I do not think so.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3262.928,3273.497,"So your piggyback argument is that where we want to something without power, we are therefore authorized to continue to act without power?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3273.497,3275.422,When you say “we are” you mean the tribe or --?
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3275.422,3278.098,The Supreme Court of the United States?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3278.098,3278.912,I am not saying that.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3278.912,3279.648,Is that what you are arguing?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3279.648,3295.845,"I am arguing that the Court’s analysis under those cases that Indian Tribes must retain whatever it was they were except that which expressly been taken away by Congress, by treaty or in analysis of this Court has to be viable because if it is not, then Indian Tribes really posses almost no power."
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3295.845,3305.743,And you also admit that there is no decision of this Court that says that an Indian Tribe has authority to punish a misdemeanor who is not an Indian?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3305.743,3306.641,There is no question in this.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3307.393,3309.673,"But you do want us to extend, do you not?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3309.673,3311.446,I do Your Honor if there had been a decision of the Court we would not be here today.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3311.446,3318.974,"Well we would keep on arguing that we did not have power to do what we did, how can you argue we have power to do more?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3318.974,3330.994,"What I am saying is that your analysis which was correct that one does not have to look for an express treaty or statutory enactment in order to find that in Indian Tribe has a power, that that is the correct analysis that this Court has used over the years --"
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3330.994,3334.244,Now what do you point to?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3334.244,3339.851,I point to Mazurie which talks about tribes having independent authority to some extent over these matters.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3339.851,3343.161,What do you point to other than an opinion of this Court?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3343.161,3344.863,It is impossible to point --
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3344.863,3345.711,Then the answer is you do not have anything?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3345.711,3347.582,"Yes, the answer is that Congress has never --"
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3347.582,3348.898,Your answer is you do not have anything?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3348.898,3352.256,That is correct because Your Honor it is very difficult to prove a negative.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3401.071,3406.03,I think what you point to a constitution provision is that there is difference between civil and criminal?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3406.03,3410.205,"I agree Your Honor. Again, if case had been decided in Williams v. Lee we would not be here."
1977.76-5729,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3413.963,3419.204,Can I ask you a question about your basic theory about where the jurisdiction all comes from?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3440.644,3441.915,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1977.76-5729,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3441.915,3443.327,"That is critical to your cases, is it not?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3443.327,3445.675,Yes it is.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3543.23,3553.281,"Well what we have here is not the 1834 Act, but the amendment of 1854 which pre-dated the conclusion of this treaty?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3553.281,3554.376,That is correct.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3554.376,3584.805,And that 1854 statute said that the United States should have federal criminal jurisdiction within any Indian Reservation with three exceptions and the third exception which is the only one applicable here is any case where by treaty stipulations the exclusive jurisdiction over such offenses is or may be secured by the Indian Tribes respectively?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3584.805,3585.124,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3585.124,3609.309,"And certainly, the negotiators for the United States of America knew of the enactment of that statute in 1854 when they concluded this treaty in 1855 and they realized that in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, the tribe under the 1854 Act simply would not have criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians."
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3613.957,3638.435,"I do not believe so Your Honor because one has to remember, again, we are examining pre-dated time of which we have a little record, but it was well after the 1854 enactment that the Secretary to the Commission, before they actually went out on this trip to negotiate treaties put a provision in not give the tribe exclusive jurisdiction, but they took it away. After the 1854 Act it was not necessary to take away tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians had the 1854 enactment actually done that."
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3638.435,3643.09,"There had to be treaty stipulation to the contrary, otherwise the statute took it away?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3643.09,3649.738,That is exactly correct and there are no treaties -- I do not take position by the way that we are talking about the third exception.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3768.221,3770.059,How about the state?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3770.059,3772.736,The state on the Oliphant case was on (Voice Overlap)
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3772.736,3773.679,(Voice Overlap)
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3773.679,3778.894,Under our strange partial jurisdiction statute there would be no jurisdiction over Oliphant.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3791.148,3794.949,What happens after the state refuses to prosecute a felony?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3801.508,3802.303,That is correct.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3802.303,3805.47,"Well, then why do you say that it is so difficult with a misdemeanor?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3811.408,3813.966,"That is correct Your Honor, but we have never had the problem."
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3828.167,3832.771,Was this man driving down the road aiming at Indians only?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3832.771,3834.412,He was aiming at everyone.[Laughter]
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3834.412,3834.983,Sir?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3834.983,3836.054,He was aiming at everyone.
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3836.054,3837.019,Oh! I thought so.
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3837.019,3838.235,He was aiming at everyone.
1977.76-5729,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3859.853,3875.561,"Mr. Ernstoff, is there any way of distinguishing your case from a civil jurisdiction of the tribe, so that the Court could enter principal way will say there was criminal jurisdiction here, but not civil jurisdiction?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,3875.561,3877.854,That is an interesting question Your Honor.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4007.194,4009.775,What do you mean with the members of the reservation?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,4012.618,4015.138,"That is right Your Honor, all the residents of the reservation."
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4023.701,4024.872,And then where does that money go?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,4024.872,4029.481,That money then goes to the tribe which then has to account for them in terms of the programs that revenue sharing money is used for.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4029.481,4030.853,And what are the programs?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,4030.853,4036.462,"Kinds of programs that are involved are, first of all, a good deal of the money is used for law enforcement because that is the major problem there."
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4038.86,4039.562,By the tribe?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,4039.562,4043.365,By the tribe because that is considered from the Federal Government as the Local Government of the Reservation.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4043.365,4046.505,"Well, they get money based upon the number of people on the reservation?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,4046.505,4046.754,That is correct.
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4046.754,4049.748,The money goes to the tribe for the tribal users and that is just a --
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,4049.748,4057.127,"For the tribal use for all residents of the reservation, law enforcement on the reservation, the Tribal Police Officers and there are 10 not three."
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4085.588,4090.115,"May I ask again, does that apply to felonies too?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,4090.115,4091.856,"The situation would apply to felonies too, but the tribe --"
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4091.856,4095.771,"I can see that, you make these arguments, when you realize that?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,4095.771,4102.188,"The situation would apply to felonies also, but as to felonies, the tribe basically has not been involved in any kind of prosecution."
1977.76-5729,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4167.777,4171.728,"It would be more difficult for a place to live for a non-Indian, if you are right?"
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,4171.728,4190.843,"That you Honor would depend on the supposition that non-Indians will not receive justice in Indian tribal courts, and I would venture to say that the justice that is given out in Indian tribal courts is equal to or surpasses the justice given out in the most JP Courts, Justice of the Peace Courts through out this country, talking about most part of minor offenses and misdemeanors."
1977.76-5729,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4193.457,4199.094,You are citing what to back that up other than you are here?
1977.76-5729,2,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,4199.094,4200.335,That is correct Your Honor.
1977.76-5729,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4201.125,4202.066,I cannot use that.
1977.76-5729,4,17591,barry_d_ernstoff,,4202.066,4210.182,I cannot -- but -- I can cite the American-Indian Policy Review Commission Report which I think the Court should address itself to because that is what it says what the situation is.
1977.76-5729,5,18958,chestnut_h_bartow_farr_iii,,4362.416,4365.65,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-5729,6,41407,slade_gorton,,5288.755,5291.605,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-5729,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5315.788,5329.372,"Well, Mr. Gorton before 1868, the State of Washington could have hanged an Indian or a white man without offering him any constitutional rights at all, could they not, because there was no Fourteenth Amendment?"
1977.76-5729,6,41407,slade_gorton,,5329.372,5332.889,"Before 1868 sir, that may be correct."
1977.76-5729,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5439.36,5444.234,Does the 280 question -- that question relate to non-Indians and Indians.
1977.76-5729,6,41407,slade_gorton,,5446.431,5454.776,"No, the question relates primarily to jurisdiction over Indians."
1977.76-5729,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5454.776,5462.769,"Now, I take it you do not object, you do not say now that the Indian tribe does not have power to try Indians?"
1977.76-5729,6,41407,slade_gorton,,5462.769,5465.57,I do not.
1977.76-5729,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5465.57,5467.571,Do you say the state does?
1977.76-5729,6,41407,slade_gorton,,5467.571,5468.517,I am sorry?
1977.76-5729,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5468.517,5471.504,Do you say the state has concurrent power to try Indians?
1977.76-5729,6,41407,slade_gorton,,5471.504,5479.642,Whether the state power has concurrent power to try Indians depends on the validity of public law 280 and that is a separate case which we have--
1977.76-5729,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5479.642,5481.335,And that is in the Yakama case?
1977.76-5729,6,41407,slade_gorton,,5483.156,5483.839,We do not.
1977.76-5729,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5483.839,5485.767,You do not?
1977.76-5729,6,41407,slade_gorton,,5485.767,5486.979,That is quite correct.
1977.76-5729,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5618.111,5629.682,Can I ask you Mr. Attorney General is the Suquamish Reservation part of the historic area in which the tribe lived or is it different?
1977.76-5729,6,41407,slade_gorton,,5629.682,5642.328,The answer to that question is clearly no because the Suquamish Tribe did not exist until Governor Stevens came out there and organized it as a political unit in order to sign a treaty with it.
1977.76-5729,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5642.328,5648.598,So that the reservation area is one is --
1977.76-5729,6,41407,slade_gorton,,5648.598,5650.525,Arbitrarily selected by the Governor Stevens.
1977.76-5729,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5650.525,5655.604,And it is not one as to which the tribe had any Indian Title originally?
1977.76-5729,6,41407,slade_gorton,,5655.604,5663.253,"Well, there was no tribe before Stevens created it in order to sign this treaty."
1977.76-5729,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5668.717,5669.503,That is what I want to know.
1977.76-5729,6,41407,slade_gorton,,5671.105,5671.917,They may have.
1977.76-5729,6,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5673.494,5674.491,Thanks.
1977.76-5729,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5674.491,5675.202,Thank you gentlemen.
