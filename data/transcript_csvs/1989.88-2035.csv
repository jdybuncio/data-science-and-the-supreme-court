1989.88-2035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.641,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-2035, Adams Fruit Company v. Ramsford Barrett."
1989.88-2035,0,17790,bonita_l_kneeland,,18.623,21.364,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2035,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.44,238.751,Miss Kneeland--
1989.88-2035,0,17790,bonita_l_kneeland,,238.751,239.262,--Yes?
1989.88-2035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,239.262,249.069,--are you saying there should be some sort of a set-off for recovery in the other procedure or just that one completely precludes the other insofar as damages?
1989.88-2035,0,17790,bonita_l_kneeland,,249.069,273.125,"What we are saying, as far as bodily injury claims alone... these are claims for medicals, and lost wages and that... that which is in the field of bodily injury or actual damages... that is taken care of by the alternate remedy which is included in the statute of workers' compensation."
1989.88-2035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.125,279.82,What... you... you mean... the workmen... that Florida workmen's compensation is included in... in AWPA?
1989.88-2035,0,17790,bonita_l_kneeland,,279.82,280.692,"Yes, it is."
1989.88-2035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,284.776,285.337,What do you mean?
1989.88-2035,0,17790,bonita_l_kneeland,,285.567,287.59,"It just says state, any state."
1989.88-2035,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.823,306.012,--Where do we find that?
1989.88-2035,0,17790,bonita_l_kneeland,,307.424,310.577,"--1841(c), in--"
1989.88-2035,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.577,312.757,--Is there a brief where we--
1989.88-2035,0,17790,bonita_l_kneeland,,312.757,313.278,--Yes.
1989.88-2035,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,313.278,314.427,--can refer to it?
1989.88-2035,0,17790,bonita_l_kneeland,,314.427,315.348,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2035,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,327.697,329.707,It's page 32(a) of the Appendix?
1989.88-2035,0,17790,bonita_l_kneeland,,329.707,331.83,32(a) in the Appendix?
1989.88-2035,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,331.83,333.731,31(a)... it begins at 31(a).
1989.88-2035,0,17790,bonita_l_kneeland,,336.793,339.207,"Yes, the Petition for Writ of Certiorari."
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1854.357,1860.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2035,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1909.507,1918.754,"Well, Mr. Tribe, why... why do you think Congress adopted this insurance liability provision?"
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1918.894,1919.515,--In 1983?
1989.88-2035,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1919.515,1919.605,--Yes.
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1924.81,1925.72,"Let me turn to that then, Justice O'Connor."
1989.88-2035,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.284,1983.626,"Mr. Tribe, could I ask about that?"
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1989.261,1990.33,"--But it isn't, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-2035,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.652,2003.802,What shall conform with it?
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2004.641,2005.302,--The insurance shall.
1989.88-2035,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.302,2005.943,So that--
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2005.943,2019.133,"It's... it's quite possible, Justice Scalia, that if that had become the law, they would have then argued that that was enough for Congress to achieve its purpose, and I think then Congress would have, perhaps, made a mistake."
1989.88-2035,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.861,2033.544,"--Well, I... I think that's significant, that every... I'm sorry, you haven't answered Justice O'Connor."
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2035.384,2035.524,--Okay.
1989.88-2035,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2312.033,2322.621,"Mr. Tribe, it is true, though, is it not, that the available... if you get workmen's compensation coverage, you don't have to have any insurance coverage?"
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2322.621,2324.302,--That's... that's correct.
1989.88-2035,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.302,2333.268,Even though the Federal workmen's compensation coverage in a particular case might provide a recovery of much less than the limits the Secretary would otherwise provide?
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2333.268,2335.762,"Would otherwise... and that really is an anomaly, I think, Justice Stevens."
1989.88-2035,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.525,2342.667,"At least at that extent, the availability of the state remedy cuts back on some of the Federal protection."
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2342.667,2348.521,"And to that extent, Congress might have been aware that that was part of what would happen from this statute."
1989.88-2035,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2390.04,2393.513,"No, but it is part of the Secretary's responsibility to decide how much insurance people have to carry."
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2393.513,2396.417,--That's part of his responsibility under 1841.
1989.88-2035,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.417,2396.906,Right.
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2396.906,2402.98,But deciding how much insurance they have to carry does not involve regulating the courts in their remedial jurisdiction.
1989.88-2035,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.965,2439.276,"No, but I think... isn't also true that the Secretary has to confront the fact that a lot of farmers may not be solvent enough to pay these very large judgments, and that it really in term... practical terms is trying to figure out how best to get the money to the injured people, and that figuring in the normal case, insurance coverage would be... would be the answer or workmen's comp.--"
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2439.276,2450.826,"But unlike the Black Lung law, Justice Stevens, the Secretary's responsibility here is not to assure that the economic welfare of these workers is adequately cared for."
1989.88-2035,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.813,2531.299,"--Mr. Tribe, you... you must admit the result that's produced is counterintuitive at a minimum."
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2565.245,2572.399,"Of course, the ability to go into Federal courts in these circumstances and have a lawyer appointed for you is quite extraordinary."
1989.88-2035,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.546,2583.799,We... we don't care about the resident farm hands?
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2583.799,2585.942,"Well, Congress may not have cared about them quite as much."
1989.88-2035,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2585.942,2588.956,Workmen's comp is okay for them but the... but the migrants have--
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2588.956,2589.515,There are--
1989.88-2035,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2589.515,2591.518,--This Cadillac treatment in Federal courts.
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2592.056,2594.359,"--Well, I wouldn't call it... maybe... maybe Chevrolet, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-2035,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.428,2731.194,"--Excuse me, you... you don't get the... if... if there's an... that accident you began your presentation with, was that an accident that had occurred on a farm or was that an accident that--"
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2731.194,2731.604,--No... no.
1989.88-2035,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2733.687,2734.008,--Right.
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2735.147,2735.297,On the farm--
1989.88-2035,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.297,2737.56,"By a crew leader, not by a private farmer."
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2748.659,2752.761,"--The... the crew leader drove one of those trucks where those kids drowned, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-2035,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2803.12,2805.832,"Well, what about an offset, Mr. Tribe?"
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2805.832,2807.634,We think an offset would make perfect sense.
1989.88-2035,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2912.069,2918.441,"Well, there's this... when you say rewriting what Congress did, of course, the question is what did... what did Congress do."
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2943.2,2945.141,But he could certainly buy both.
1989.88-2035,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2947.364,2949.324,"Yeah, but they don't want to have spend any more money than they have to, obviously."
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2960.493,2968.72,"--That Congress perhaps entrapped farmers into buying too little insurance and that, therefore, this Court should find some way in the language of this statute--"
1989.88-2035,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2968.72,2971.32,We don't like to construe--
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2971.32,2971.851,--to do what Congress knows how to do--
1989.88-2035,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2971.851,2976.896,--We do not like to construe the statutes as traps for people who didn't really fully understand them.
1989.88-2035,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2976.896,2979.147,"--But I don't... I think to be... to be honest, Justice Stevens--"
