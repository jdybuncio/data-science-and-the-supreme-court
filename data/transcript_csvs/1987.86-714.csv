1987.86-714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.34,"We'll hear argument now in No. 86-714, Rodney P. Westfall versus William T. Erwin."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,11.84,14.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,52.198,56.587,This is the Barr against Matteo and Howard against Lyons line of cases?
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,56.587,57.166,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,57.166,60.977,"Mr. Ayer, what's the source of that immunity do you suppose?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,60.977,64.943,"Apart from this Court's cases, you mean, going back?"
1987.86-714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,64.943,65.536,Yes.
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,70.488,84.107,"Well, the source, I think, is the priority of protecting the ability of the Federal government to function and perform the duties and tasks that it has ultimately under the Constitution."
1987.86-714,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,146.175,148.784,"This is not a constitutional principle, though, right."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,155.266,155.625,"That is certainly true, yes."
1987.86-714,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,155.625,160.154,So it's sort of like a negative commerce clause kind of?
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,160.154,196.78,"Well, I think what we're talking about is maybe a sort of an assumption or a presumption that it is intended that the Federal government be able, intended in the Constitution, absent some action by Congress indicating otherwise, that it be able to go forward with its activities as authorized by Congress, and the disruption that would result by the regular interaction of State law principles interfering with the performance of those functions I think is what it's designed to protect."
1987.86-714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.481,208.745,So you are proposing a sort of dormant commerce clause analysis in effect?
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,208.745,212.431,"I think that's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.431,216.71,"Our cases have never discussed the theory, have they?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,221.63,222.661,That's right.
1987.86-714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,222.661,227.891,"Action and was discussed in terms of privilege, not immunity at all."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,227.891,237.67,"Well, it was clearly discussed by reference to the decision in Gregoire v. Biddle and the need to protect the Federal functioning."
1987.86-714,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,243.933,254.616,"Federal instrumentalities from State taxes, what's the basis of that immunity?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,254.616,263.988,It may well be somewhat analogous to this situation.
1987.86-714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.726,297.771,"Well, isn't there some analogy here to Clearfield Trust?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,327.29,331.163,"I will agree with that as well, Your Honor."
1987.86-714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,402.337,422.391,"Well, Mr. Ayer, if what we are trying to do is to determine what Congress would do if it had thought about it, should we analogize then to the Federal Tort Claims Act for our guidance in determining discretionary acts for which there might be immunity?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,422.391,423.969,"I think not, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,465.953,481.524,"Well, nonetheless, that's a line Congress has drawn, and wouldn't most Tort claimants be suing both the employee and the Federal Government if they had a State tort action, so you would be determining that question anyway, wouldn't we?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,481.524,483.508,"--Well, that's possible that they would be."
1987.86-714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,556.79,564.834,"Mr. Ayer, is there anything in the Federal Tort Claims Act that substitutes the liability of the United States for the liability of the individual actor as a defendant?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,564.834,565.334,"Yes, there is."
1987.86-714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,718.63,723.004,"Well, why doesn't the plaintiff in a case like that just sue the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,723.004,729.641,"In this case, they cannot sue the United States because they have a remedy under the Federal Employees Compensation Act."
1987.86-714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,729.641,739.513,"So it's like when you're covered by Workmen's Compensation, a private employee, you try to find some other person to sue so that you can get a tort recovery rather than a Workmen's Compensation?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,739.513,741.184,"Well, I would think many plaintiffs do do that."
1987.86-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,761.8,762.894,"May I, before you leave the other?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,772.015,785.167,--The Federal Employees Compensation Act does not state whether or not an employee who recovers may sue a co-employee.
1987.86-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,791.32,798.302,"And most other compensation schemes do have such an express provision, or has it been read into some of those statutes?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,808.22,813.343,"Well, I think it is clearly not, and this is something that we certainly looked into in preparing our briefs in this case."
1987.86-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,836.551,850.686,"Why isn't it reasonable to assume that if Congress promptly reacted to the medical malpractice situation the way they did and also reacted to the drivers' liability the way they did, seeing a problem there, that they would do precisely the same thing here, if there's such a simple solution?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,856.591,869.085,"Well, I think there is a very good argument to be made for the Court's continuing to do the lawmaking which rests initially on the fact that the this Court has been doing the lawmaking in this area for a very long time."
1987.86-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.085,883.407,"And apparently, when they did the lawmaking, the found a basis for liability against doctors and a basis for liability who would... I mean, Congress would have thought there would have been liability against drivers, why not against people who store whatever this product was in a negligent manner?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,883.407,891.857,"Well, as to the doctors, I think there is serious doubt as to whether anybody thought that that was an appropriate thing to have happen."
1987.86-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.124,932.747,"Well, supposing a maintenance worker on this building, why should he be under different rules than maintenance workers on a district building?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,932.747,937.432,"Well, two answers, I guess."
1987.86-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.326,973.387,"No, I'm not thinking of it from the point of view of the defendant, but the plaintiff."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,981.493,985.32,I think you have to look at the defendant in order to answer that question.
1987.86-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1029.521,1033.455,I don't understand why that's different than driving a car.
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1042.03,1072.003,"I think the best answer to that is the answer that was given both by Judge Learned Hand and by this Court in Barr v. Matteo, which is that if we could know in advance which individual government employees were acting improperly before a suit was brought, and we could single them out and say we're going to allow actions but only against the bad guys, only against the ones that do something wrong because we want those people to be accountable and we want them to stop it, and we want to make them pay."
1987.86-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1075.127,1076.767,"You can't do it with careless drivers, either."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1076.767,1085.357,"Well, the driving situation, Justice Stevens, I think is different because of the nature of the rules and the relationship."
1987.86-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.714,1094.01,"Negligent driving, there's a difference between negligent driving and negligent workmanship?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1094.01,1095.493,I think there is.
1987.86-714,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.818,1151.659,You're confusing me when you begin to talk about State rules as opposed to negligence liability.
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1167.214,1171.775,"Well, we think that the answer to that question is a very complicated answer."
1987.86-714,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.598,1198.297,"Is your contention that simply because he has a discretion in what paint to use, which he surely does, that he can use a lead-based paint, when you have a State statute that says they won't be used?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1198.297,1203.809,"In terms of whether he can be sued for personal liability, our position is that--"
1987.86-714,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1203.809,1204.199,"No, no."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1205.699,1208.119,--Whether in fact it's proper for him to?
1987.86-714,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.119,1210.166,Does the State law apply to him?
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1210.166,1223.145,"Well, in that situation my own sense would be not having researched the Federal Statutes saying what a particular painter should do or what a particular agency painting should do, my sense is that probably the State law would apply."
1987.86-714,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1223.145,1224.879,"That's my feel, too."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1224.879,1225.878,"Well, I would think so."
1987.86-714,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.878,1229.83,But you say no personal liability for his doing it?
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1229.83,1230.815,"Right, that's right."
1987.86-714,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1230.815,1242.888,"Well, what if the painter drops the can of paint on somebody because he doesn't like them and he just does it, and it's intentional."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1242.888,1243.606,He does it maliciously.
1987.86-714,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1243.606,1245.56,"Yes, intentional."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1245.56,1246.699,"Well, I think--"
1987.86-714,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1246.699,1249.167,Absolute immunity?
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1249.167,1251.759,--Our position in this case is--
1987.86-714,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1251.759,1254.774,Isn't that what Judge Learned Hand said?
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1258.32,1259.93,"--I think that's exactly right, Justice Marshall."
1987.86-714,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1259.93,1260.695,That's what he said.
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1260.695,1261.615,I think that's what he said.
1987.86-714,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.128,1271.018,"Well, after all, it was pretty intentional in Barr."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1271.018,1272.002,--That's right.
1987.86-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.415,1332.696,"But counsel, why is that any different from an employee working for General Motors, for example."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1332.696,1340.491,--I think you would have to look and see what the indemnification arrangements were for the General Motors employee.
1987.86-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1340.491,1345.128,You certainly can't rule out the possibility the Federal Government would see the need for indemnification or insurance.
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1345.128,1347.893,But does the Federal Government have to indemnify its employees?
1987.86-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.893,1348.799,"Well, General Motors doesn't, either."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1354.093,1364.558,"Well, the difference I think is that the business of the Government is not to be equated with the business of a private corporation."
1987.86-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.558,1367.556,"--When they're engaged in activities like painting buildings, why not?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1367.556,1385.174,"Well, because the reasons I would give you are that it's going to inhibit in a general way and in a very specific way, it's going to inhibit employees from wanting to take the jobs and/or to do the things that may create the greatest exposure."
1987.86-714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1385.174,1390.906,"If you are talking about Mr. Barr in Barr v. Matteo, I think what you say makes a great deal of sense."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1397.169,1401.856,"Well, we think the painting of the building is one case."
1987.86-714,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1403.949,1408.336,"Mr. Ayer, in any event, do you extend this immunity to every Federal employee?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1417.084,1432.389,"--Well, that's what this case is all about, Justice Brennan, is whether the policy and planning rule that was enunciated by the Eleventh Circuit, not in this specific case but in a later case as their Circuit's rule, whether that is what should govern."
1987.86-714,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1433.936,1436.279,Their rule is a limiting rule?
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1436.279,1437.31,--Very limiting rule.
1987.86-714,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1439.06,1441.372,They went to high policy makers did they?
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1441.372,1443.043,They called it policy and planning.
1987.86-714,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1443.043,1444.604,Policy and planning makers.
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1449.258,1462.347,"I want to make two points about that: number one, we do very strongly believe that an absolute immunity is appropriate whenever a Federal employee acts within the scope of his duty, within the outer perimeter of his duties."
1987.86-714,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1463.753,1465.408,Has that ever been held?
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1465.408,1467.829,"--Well, I think that's a reasonable reading."
1987.86-714,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1467.829,1468.672,Of what?
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1468.672,1473.233,Of the Court's decisions in Barr and the Court's decision in Spalding.
1987.86-714,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1473.233,1475.483,"I don't think I thought so in Barr, did I?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1475.483,1476.669,I don't think you did.
1987.86-714,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1476.669,1477.075,No.
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1477.075,1488.853,"But in response to that, I'd just like to say that there is a discussion in Barr in the plurality opinion relating to the exercise of discretion."
1987.86-714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1499.972,1508.843,"Mr. Ayer, focusing on the facts of this case, where is the discretion exercised, and what is it?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1512.373,1546.157,"Well, we are applying the discretion test which is in footnote 14 of this Court's decision in Davis v. Scherer that says that when a particular task is not specifically defined, when it isn't prescribed what an employee must do, he is exercising discretion, and the discretion that is involved here is in the performance that three defendants are supervisors at this Army depot, and they oversee the work of the depot which includes the letting off of materiel, the repackaging, the moving around and sending out of materiel, and the storage."
1987.86-714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1546.157,1553.935,"My next question is, aren't they going to do exactly the same thing whether we have a rule of immunity or not?"
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1553.935,1580.08,"I think if we don't have a rule of immunity there is a significant for any job that involves risks that someone may be hurt and therefore may want to sue, we're creating a situation where the cost of doing that job increases to the government, where individual employees if they have any discretion are likely to shade that discretion and make decisions in a way that is not necessarily in the interest of the Federal Government."
1987.86-714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1580.08,1584.329,Discretion here in the way the bags of soda ash were piled?
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1584.329,1594.465,"In the way the work was done, in where they were put when they were brought in, in who was assigned to do it and whether safety equipment was used, if any was necessary, in how the job was done."
1987.86-714,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1601.869,1615.973,"My only point is that the fact of discretion as you have defined it is certainly going to be carried out whether there is a rule of immunity or not, and therefore one of the reasons for Barr v. Matteo is inapplicable to the fact situation here."
1987.86-714,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1615.973,1626.624,"I think there is a real question in any case where there's any discretion how that discretion's going to be exercised, and which way, how are we going to do the job."
1987.86-714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1635.714,1638.432,"Thank you, Mr. Ayer."
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,1640.213,1643.992,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.845,1784.654,"Well, how would the sufficiency of the Federal Workers' Compensation provision preclude or not preclude suit?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,1784.654,1790.714,It should not unless there's a specific statute addressing that simply because of the due process issues.
1987.86-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1812.236,1824.997,"But I thought your argument was based on the idea that here the workmen's compensation award was somehow inadequate and if it had been more adequate, then perhaps the suit against the co-employee would be barred."
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,1827.527,1827.793,"No, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.196,1841.069,For a Court extending immunity?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,1841.069,1841.788,"No, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1914.463,1914.759,I understand that.
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,1919.617,1920.382,"No, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.382,1926.365,"We want to be sure we have really terrific impartial Federal policies but we don't really care how they're implemented, is that it?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,1926.365,1926.442,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1952.213,1965.55,"Well, Mr. Alspaugh, if the supervisors in this case had made an explicit policy that they were going to store the bags in the manner in which they stored the bags here, then under your theory, no suit could be brought."
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,1966.69,1967.456,"No, ma'am."
1987.86-714,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1974.765,1980.669,"Well, we're not talking about just making policy, we're talking about certain kinds of policies, then--"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,1980.669,1982.044,"--That's right, yes, ma'am, I think so."
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1987.729,1992.571,--Are you proposing the kind of distinction that used to exist for purposes of municipal immunity from suit?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2001.458,2002.864,"--No, sir, not really."
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.206,2008.768,I hope not because that is a very confusing doctrine.
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2010.518,2011.893,--The case law does not say that.
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.1,2039.693,"Well, it's easy to say, but what do you mean by, affects governing?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2046.41,2047.082,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2085.018,2087.706,So it has to be the type of activity that only government can do?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2087.706,2089.391,I think so.
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.391,2093.485,That's the old proprietary governmental distinction.
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2097.467,2097.904,Sir?
1987.86-714,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2097.904,2100.81,Why are you so afraid to endorse the proprietary governmental distinction?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2103.855,2109.196,Proprietary has so many meanings just as discretionary has.
1987.86-714,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2116.366,2119.083,You agree with the Government that this is a job that we should be doing?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2119.083,2119.724,--Sir?
1987.86-714,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.724,2123.363,"This is a law making job that the Court should do rather than Congress, you agree with that?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2123.363,2123.567,"No, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2144.48,2152.305,"Well, do we really have to do anything more than to say whether or not piling these bags or whatever they were amounts to discretion or doesn't?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2154.272,2155.662,"No, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.363,2164.878,"But you don't care about that if you win this case, do you?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2164.878,2166.222,"That's exactly right, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.512,2186.573,So your submission is a case by case analysis?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2186.573,2187.259,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2187.259,2204.206,"In every single case you go through this routine of inquiry which you think Doe against McMillan indicated, and so can we set down some rules here that would govern your other case?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2204.206,2205.408,"Well,--"
1987.86-714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.408,2206.533,"You would hope so, I suppose?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2206.533,2207.08,--I would hope so.
1987.86-714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.268,2250.359,"Well, I suppose that a lot of the reason for any immunity at all is that Government employees shouldn't be afraid to do their duty."
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2250.359,2251.999,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2251.999,2264.571,And I suppose being afraid to do some kinds of duties is just more significant than being afraid to do other kinds of duties?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2264.571,2267.102,I think that that clearly is what this Court has held.
1987.86-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.344,2297.058,"Well, didn't the Court in the majority in Dalehite v. United States hold that the stacking of the fertilizer on the depot down in Texas was a discretionary function?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2297.058,2299.806,"Yes, sir, they did in that instance and that was an FTCA case."
1987.86-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2299.806,2305.992,Is there any reason why that same sort of discretionary analysis shouldn't be applied here?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2305.992,2310.444,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2320.878,2326.454,You don't quarrel then with the Dalehite majority's principle as a guide in this area.
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2329.312,2331.544,"--Yes, sir, could be, could be."
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2333.497,2335.699,"That's different from what you are arguing in your brief, then."
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2347.491,2347.882,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2362.219,2364.656,But that includes a plan for the stacking of bags of fertilizer.
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2370.091,2378.994,"It's the execution of that plan, how it's carried out, not necessarily only stacking it up, but also what information do you impart relative to the stacking up of it."
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2378.994,2379.994,Then it becomes governmental?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2379.994,2383.274,"No, sir, it was governmental when they made the decision to stack it up."
1987.86-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2383.274,2386.711,"You mean, just because it was the government doing it."
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2394.096,2395.018,That was what was decided.
1987.86-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2395.018,2396.971,I never read that that way.
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2396.971,2399.86,I think that's what was decided in the case.
1987.86-714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.86,2410.794,"If you are right about absolute immunity, you nevertheless would say that there's a qualified immunity, wouldn't you?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2410.794,2411.684,"Yes, sir, I do."
1987.86-714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.684,2416.417,"And except for what, except for ministerial acts?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2418.088,2419.556,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
1987.86-714,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.474,2472.879,"And I suppose you say just by definition, a negligent act couldn't qualify?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2472.879,2482.748,It could qualify if you applied the quote unquote existing law to be the State law that applies.
1987.86-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2495.525,2501.07,"Well, what was the State law of Alabama that governed this case at the time these defendants acted?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2501.07,2509.426,"Alabama has a workmen's compensation law just like most other States, provides compensation if you're hurt on the job."
1987.86-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2509.426,2512.753,But that wasn't something that would have governed the conduct of these defendants.
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2517.608,2519.702,"Due care, pure due care."
1987.86-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.702,2523.513,And so the question of qualified immunity is whether you knew that was the law or not?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2523.513,2524.669,It would be in that instance.
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.81,2610.729,Do I understand you to say that you are willing to accept for the application to these cases the same discretionary function test that's used in the FTCA cases?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2610.729,2614.024,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.024,2614.93,You're willing to do that?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2614.93,2615.492,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2615.492,2616.867,You think it's the same line?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2616.867,2618.522,"Yes, sir, I am."
1987.86-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2618.522,2620.647,And you're sure that that would give you a victory here?
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2620.647,2625.911,"As I understand the facts in this case, I do, yes, sir."
1987.86-714,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2643.684,2655.867,"Let me ask this, if the discretion line is the same under the tort claims and under your understanding of the immunity doctrine, are all these other cases that are pending, at least in your circuit, suits by co-employees?"
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2655.867,2659.366,"All with the exception of one, and that is one that I have."
1987.86-714,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.88,2674.813,"Because it seems to me if they're not co-employee suits, that then there would always be a suit against the government in the case where the employee is immune."
1987.86-714,1,35371,m_clay_alspaugh,,2674.813,2677.39,Except in instances where the FTCA does not apply.
1987.86-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2741.551,2744.004,"Thank you, Mr. Alspaugh."
1987.86-714,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2746.034,2755.797,The point I'd like to emphasize more than any other is that immunity only has any useful effect if there is some measure of certainty for the employees who are protected by it.
1987.86-714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.412,2786.002,But your principal argument here as you described at the outset is that you want immunity where there is some measure of discretion.
1987.86-714,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2789.22,2790.735,"Some meaning, any, Justice White."
1987.86-714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2815.536,2825.033,"So if the law says, please pile this soda ash in paper sacks ten sacks high, that wouldn't be detailed enough."
1987.86-714,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2826.611,2831.312,"If the law says don't let any employees stack soda ash without wearing gloves,--"
1987.86-714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2831.312,2833.545,So you're about as close to your per se rule as you can get.
1987.86-714,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2833.545,2835.764,--We're pretty close to a per se rule.
1987.86-714,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.764,2840.027,Of any government employee acting within the perimeter of his duties?
1987.86-714,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2840.027,2846.478,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I think that's terribly important, because it's the operational level where the conflict comes."
1987.86-714,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2849.352,2853.007,How much lower is it than somebody stacking sacks?
1987.86-714,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2853.007,2854.349,Excuse me?
1987.86-714,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2854.349,2855.818,How much lower do you get?
1987.86-714,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2855.818,2863.095,"Well, there could be regulations if indeed soda ash were a dangerous substance, which it is not."
1987.86-714,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2863.095,2864.892,"But I mean, is there anything lower than that?"
1987.86-714,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2864.892,2867.36,"Well, there could be regulations that say--"
1987.86-714,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2867.36,2873.53,"Could there be regulations that what is lower than that, or could you answer it?"
1987.86-714,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2873.53,2874.186,--That is lower than that?
1987.86-714,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2874.186,2875.2,Yes.
1987.86-714,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2875.2,2886.977,"Well, I think that there are activities that are non-discretionary such as a file clerk in a government office who stamps deeds or documents--"
1987.86-714,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2886.977,2891.522,That's lower than handling sacks of garbage?
1987.86-714,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2891.522,2893.146,"--It's less discretionary, we think."
1987.86-714,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2908.749,2910.109,"Thank you, Mr. Ayer."
