1985.84-871,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.468,We will hear arguments next in Louisiana Public Service Commission against the Federal Communications Commission and related cases.
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,9.768,14.77,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a consolidated case."
1985.84-871,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,209.319,211.95,That is straight line depreciation.
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,211.95,214.152,"That is straight line depreciation, Your Honor."
1985.84-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,359.527,365.17,"Mr. Malone, what kind of physical plant or equipment are we talking about?"
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,367.601,377.739,"--It could be telephone poles, Your Honor, telephone lines, all of the plant which really goes into... the vast majority of the plant which goes into the provision of telephone service."
1985.84-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,395.09,402.774,And jointly used plant means plant whether it is telephones or lines or both that are used for both intrastate and interstate?
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,402.774,404.176,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,544.597,561.727,"Well, Mr. Malone, one section you rely rather heavily on, I guess, is 152(b), and that talks about prohibiting Commission jurisdiction over charges, classifications, at cetera, in connection with interstate communications service."
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,580.35,592.437,"Yes, Your Honor, but I think Congress has always recognized, Your Honor, that if you have a telephone pole in Lake Tahoe, it is subject to a very different climate than a telephone pole in Lake Placid, and it is--"
1985.84-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,592.437,594.709,"Are either one of them on dry land, I presume?"
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,594.709,595.57,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,627.232,636.817,Did the Commission then allow the states or did it follow the states' methods when it came to depreciating for interstate communications service?
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,636.817,648.356,"Well, for interstate communications services, the Commission eventually grew into a position where it was able to develop its own depreciation charges with respect to the costs that were separated to it."
1985.84-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,669.979,676.253,So the allocation is between a percentage of value of a single physical entity.
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,676.253,677.225,"That's right, Your Honor."
1985.84-871,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.721,1085.936,I think the thrust of your argument is that there just isn't any room under the Act for any kind of an implied preemption.
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,1088.069,1089.118,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
1985.84-871,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.03,1139.691,"I take it you would be making the same argument even if you accepted, which I gather you don't, that dual regulation permitting the states to set depreciation rates for interstate, intrastate equipment would frustrate the FCC's powers."
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,1139.691,1141.513,"--We would make the same argument, Your Honor--"
1985.84-871,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.513,1141.992,Yes.
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,1141.992,1148.106,"--and you are right, we do not accept that assumption which is the basis for the FCC's action."
1985.84-871,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1238.146,1243.259,"I've got a little bit of confusion over one of your figures of speech, your analogies."
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,1253.998,1264.253,"No, Your Honor, because what that analogy refers to is the fact that... let me explain what the analogy meant, and then why I don't think it cuts against us at all."
1985.84-871,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1366.188,1373.925,"Mr. Malone, if you should not prevail here, how much of a disaster really is it to the state?"
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,1373.925,1377.206,"Well, Your Honor, I think there would be disasters in two forms."
1985.84-871,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1387.492,1389.613,Because of accelerated depreciation?
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,1389.613,1394.398,"--Because of the ELG and the remaining life concepts, which would be forced onto states by the FCC."
1985.84-871,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.128,1396.969,Countrywide?
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,1396.969,1397.93,--Yes.
1985.84-871,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1507.362,1518.98,"Of course, a good bit of it, that is, the federal system will... on your approach will increase rates, too, does increase rates."
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,1518.98,1521.351,If the FCC takes action simply for the--
1985.84-871,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1521.351,1523.072,For the interstate.
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,1523.072,1523.893,--Yes.
1985.84-871,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1523.893,1529.456,And has it in fact driven away customers into other areas?
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,1529.456,1531.347,With respect to interstate usage?
1985.84-871,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1531.347,1532.288,Yes.
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,1532.288,1535.63,"Oh, yes, there is no question there has been bypass which has resulted from rate increases."
1985.84-871,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1535.63,1539.222,And the Republic hasn't come to an end.
1985.84-871,0,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,1539.222,1542.064,"The Republic hasn't come to an end, Your Honor, no."
1985.84-871,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1546.065,1549.598,Mr. Solicitor General.
1985.84-871,1,18942,charles_fried,,1549.598,1561.326,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I should first begin by making a remark about the effect on rates."
1985.84-871,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1611.941,1619.916,"Mr. Fried, excuse me for interrupting, but I just was turning around in my mind here your opening remarks as a response to his figure, I guess it will be a billion dollars or something."
1985.84-871,1,18942,charles_fried,,1627.069,1631.854,--I don't know quite how to deal with that overall figure.
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,2777.626,2789.901,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the position of the telephone industry in this case is that the FCC's preemption order is correct and should be sustained."
1985.84-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2910.571,2916.345,"May I ask, Mr. Boudin, must they also have the same evaluation on the capital investment?"
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,2916.345,2919.007,The valuation is a red herring.
1985.84-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2928.394,2930.264,Isn't it original cost less depreciation?
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,2930.264,2940.69,"--Original cost less depreciation is the rate base, but the valuation is the original cost less the accumulated depreciation."
1985.84-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2940.69,2947.405,"Does it mean, then, that the Commission rule has the effect of determining what the rate base will be for all the--"
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,2947.405,2956.02,"No, because you have to make a large number of different determinations with respect to rate base, some of which are historical, some of which are legal or public policy."
1985.84-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2966.469,2976.805,"--Well, confining it to the telephone pole for a moment, must the remaining cost, the remaining value of the telephone pole be the same for both federal and state purposes in determining rate base?"
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,2976.805,2980.968,It will virtually always... in fact there is very little disagreement.
1985.84-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2980.968,2982.468,"Well, but must it be the same under the commission--"
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,2982.468,2987.252,You mean if the states try to set a different value?
1985.84-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2987.252,2992.015,--Say they wanted to use their old-fashioned method of depreciation for purposes of measuring original cost.
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,2993.036,2996.109,They cannot use an old-fashioned method of depreciation.
1985.84-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2999.942,3003.364,Under the regulations as they exist today?
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,3003.364,3003.701,Yes.
1985.84-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3003.701,3007.395,Could the commission forbid them from using a different original cost measure--
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,3007.395,3016.582,"It would be a significantly more difficult case, because it would take you back to the distinction between valuation and depreciation."
1985.84-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3024.616,3030.06,"--On valuation of a telephone pole, I am wondering if you can have one person driving and another one working the--"
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,3030.06,3035.405,"--Well, that would be... that is another case, and it is a harder case for the telephone company and the commission."
1985.84-871,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3094.113,3098.745,"--Mr. Boudin, why did the Court of Appeals shy away from reliance on this section?"
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,3098.745,3111.444,"Because the other ground, agency preemption, was so clearly established in the Fourth Circuit by the two North Carolina cases that there was nothing new to decide as long as they didn't bother with the new statute."
1985.84-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3240.578,3247.553,"So your argument, of course, is that the statute does the preempting, and it is not a case of agency preemption."
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,3250.695,3258.299,"Well, the agency is entitled under 220 to cede the authority to the state if it wishes to, so it could do something else, but only after an--"
1985.84-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3258.299,3259.691,Why is it entitled to do so?
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,3259.691,3266.584,"--The section provides, 220(h), that it can cede its 220 powers to the states if it wishes to."
1985.84-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3266.584,3268.927,And did it for a long time or not?
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,3268.927,3277.083,"It prescribed the depreciation itself, but it did so after consultation, the three-way meeting with the states."
1985.84-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3390.384,3406.535,"Well, what about... what was your response to... his response to 152(b), Section 152(b), where the commission is denied jurisdiction with respect to charges and so on with respect to intrastate communication?"
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,3406.535,3408.676,The answer to that is twofold.
1985.84-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3420.975,3424.608,"What if you... if you read (b), you don't even get to 220."
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,3424.608,3426.068,"--No, it is circular."
1985.84-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3439.248,3441.199,Because 220 deals specifically with depreciation?
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,3441.199,3443.519,"Exactly, and also involves the preemptive--"
1985.84-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3443.519,3445.98,I thought charges included depreciation.
1985.84-871,2,35487,michael_boudin,,3445.98,3453.897,--The term 2(b)(1) in our contention is a reference to rates charged to customers.
1985.84-871,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3480.314,3482.965,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Malone?"
1985.84-871,3,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,3482.965,3483.926,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-871,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3483.926,3486.258,You have five minutes remaining.
1985.84-871,3,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,3486.258,3487.337,Thank you very much.
1985.84-871,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.106,3568.27,"Are we supposed to decide here which one of you is right about the history, what was the status quo at the time?"
1985.84-871,3,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,3568.27,3571.513,"--Your Honor, the decisions... it is documented in our briefs."
1985.84-871,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3659.069,3665.014,Didn't Mr. Boudin say to us that all of the telephone companies were in support of this position?
1985.84-871,3,34852,lawrence_g_malone,,3665.014,3666.806,--They absolutely are not in support of it.
