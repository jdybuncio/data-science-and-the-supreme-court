1988.87-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.012,"We'll hear argument first this morning in number 87-1064, United States versus Philip George Stuart."
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,11.497,15.229,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1064,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,231.111,231.627,"Mr. Wallace, excuse me."
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,250.696,251.134,--That is correct.
1988.87-1064,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,251.134,253.274,--on Section 7602.
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,262.364,263.55,"Well, that is a--"
1988.87-1064,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,263.55,271.486,"So, how can you say that you're in a position to obtain it under our revenue laws when you're not seeking to ascertain United States tax liability?"
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,271.486,295.445,"--That is a... certainly a possible reading of 7602, and that very question was debated and decided in the 1975 Second Circuit case that we have cited in our brief, United States against A. L. Burbank Company, in which this court denied certiorari."
1988.87-1064,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.229,405.165,"You don't have any language that would allow that, though, do you?"
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,407.789,410.725,--We have no language.
1988.87-1064,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.725,414.444,What's the closest phrase you have that would allow it to be read this way?
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,414.444,471.109,"I, I don't have a phrase that looks specifically to investigation of compliance with Canadian or other countries' revenue laws, but I, I do think the broader perspective that I have mentioned, that these reciprocal obligations are a method by which the Internal Revenue Service is enabled more successfully to conduct its own investigations is highly pertinent, along with what we submit is congressional acquiescence in this interpretation, not only reflected in amendments of 7602, but in the confirmation of these numerous treaties that look toward the use of compulsory process."
1988.87-1064,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,471.109,477.447,"If you did not have the summons authority, the treaty wouldn't necessarily be a nullity, would it?"
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,477.447,479.291,Not necessarily.
1988.87-1064,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,479.291,482.822,Because the government still has information that it can furnish.
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,482.822,494.272,"It has information, although a similar argument could be made about the Service's authority to conduct any investigation or engage in any operations."
1988.87-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.302,539.831,Did the Ninth Circuit expressly consider the summons question in its opinion in this case?
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,539.831,546.483,"It did not expressly discuss this question, but it accepted the holding in the Burbank case."
1988.87-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.648,914.992,"Mr. Wallace, I don't know whether--"
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,926.316,985.37,"Well, it, it, it, it... this Court starting with United States against Powell has characterized the inquiry to be made in the summons enforcement proceedings as an inquiry into the IRS' good faith in issuing the summons, and good faith is largely translated into whether it's for a legitimate statutory purpose, whether the proper procedures have been followed, whether the information may be relevant as the court said to compliance with the Internal Revenue laws, whether there is a collateral purpose, such as harassing the taxpayer or trying to put pressure on the taxpayer to settle a collateral dispute."
1988.87-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1002.081,1010.702,Why couldn't you just presume that there was good faith in all matters of that kind and still say you've got to follow the American rule that there has been no reference for criminal purposes yet?
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1017.247,1024.79,"Well, it would question the legitimacy of their normal investigative process."
1988.87-1064,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1024.79,1028.023,"No, it would just say that's our rule on subpoena enforcement."
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1031.054,1045.689,"If the treaty or statute had specified that... you know, I can't argue that that would be an open-ended invitation for the courts to examine good faith."
1988.87-1064,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.224,1201.251,"Mr. Wallace, you're, you're really... you're suggesting that this statute would apply against a United States citizen as well; it's not just a citizen of a foreign country, right?"
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1207.919,1208.279,"Yes, it would."
1988.87-1064,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.279,1225.428,"So, a United States citizen who is being harassed by a by a foreign government, that foreign government can enlist our government in that harassment without any possibility of our courts stopping it?"
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1225.428,1255.931,"With respect to the summons enforcement proceeding, what could be shown is that the IRS was not acting in good faith because the IRS did not consider this a proper request under the treaty, but was lending itself to a scheme of harassment concerning information that has no possible relevance to tax information."
1988.87-1064,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.931,1258.415,"But you're taking a position the IRS doesn't have to, have to inquire into that."
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1269.753,1281.157,"I, I, I, I would not want to mislead the court into thinking that the IRS rubber-stamps every treaty request for information, even information that is on hand."
1988.87-1064,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1291.62,1301.913,"I think that's an extraordinary... I think that's extraordinary to have the United States courts engaging in that, and I think it's a hard question."
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1307.739,1308.394,--Well--
1988.87-1064,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.394,1311.175,"But since it hasn't, you're really sort of asking us to make it up."
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1311.175,1335.305,"--If I, if I may say so, Mr. Justice, what makes it seem less extraordinary to us, is that the summons enforcement proceeding, the, the attempt to interfere with the investigation is not the ordinary place in which the merits of summonses for third-party records is debated."
1988.87-1064,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1418.865,1436.327,"And I'm somewhat puzzled, however, because in your answer to Justice Scalia's question, you said well, the IRS does make... give itself some assurance that the other country is acting in good faith, yet I thought that's exactly what you're telling us we can't require you to do."
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1436.327,1445.996,"You can... in the summons enforcement proceeding, the question is the IRS' good faith rather than the--"
1988.87-1064,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1445.996,1447.635,I understand that that's your position.
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1447.635,1447.823,--Yes.
1988.87-1064,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1447.823,1456.131,"But the question was put to you suppose a country is harassing someone, say, for his political views, and the IRS is in good faith."
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1464.659,1471.36,"It, it does consider whether the request is a proper one under the treaty, that is correct."
1988.87-1064,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1474.171,1478.279,"Well, is it a proper request under the treaty if the country is harassing someone for their political views?"
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1478.279,1493.164,--That would... that would depend on whether there is also a legitimate basis for the request that complies with the terms of the treaty.
1988.87-1064,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1512.514,1515.576,"Well, it's still not clear to me when you examine into the motives of another country and when you don't."
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1524.291,1530.226,"Well, the Ninth Circuit held that the enforcement court should examine those motives."
1988.87-1064,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1685.446,1690.492,"Mr. Wallace, you, you remember what the earliest treaty like this was?"
1988.87-1064,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1690.492,1693.897,"--I, I, I could not say, Mr. Justice."
1988.87-1064,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1697.535,1698.863,"Very well, Mr. Wallace."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,1700.456,1704.627,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1064,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1753.076,1768.57,"Mr. Peery, the subsections, I guess, you're talking about, 7602(c) and so forth, speak of the Justice Department which surely refers to the United States Justice Department, doesn't it?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,1768.57,1769.819,Yes.
1988.87-1064,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1800.448,1801.12,Yes.
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,1820.955,1841.574,"Actually, in these cases I believe we do now know something about the method and approach of the Canadian tax authority and their interrelationship with the Canadian Department of Justice, and it is very much like the system in the United States, so that the burdensome inquiry that the government has raised I submit really does not apply to this case."
1988.87-1064,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.444,1893.208,And you think our interpretation of our law should be governed by Revenue Canada?
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,1893.208,1894.925,"No, sir, I was just saying--"
1988.87-1064,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.925,1895.566,"I mean, why... why?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,1900.424,1910.809,"--It ought to be governed by the totality of the revenue laws of the United States, which is what the treaty requires and which incorporates, certainly, 7602 and its procedures and the other treaties."
1988.87-1064,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1910.809,1927.787,"You bring before us one, one case out of however many treaties Mr. Wallace said there were in which it may be easy to analogize the, the, the revenue system of the country in question with that of the United States, but I, I doubt whether, whether it's possible with a lot of the other countries."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,1946.812,1954.979,"Well, Your Honor, we have a specific factual situation in this case, and I, I intend to address the broader rule that this Court is certainly interested in."
1988.87-1064,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.916,1958.447,"The Philippines, for example."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,1960.336,1961.508,I don't know that.
1988.87-1064,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1961.508,1961.883,"Oh, I see."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,1967.896,1969.349,Probably a Communist country as counsel--
1988.87-1064,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.349,1969.614,Right.
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,1973.8,2004.615,"--We point to the treaty with that country which refers specifically to the domestic tax revenue law of the United States, and we tell that country or have the IRS to tell that country that when you make a request of the IRS for information which may require our summons power, then tell us, certify to us that you do not presently have a criminal prosecution matter pending in this instance for which you, you are asking for this information."
1988.87-1064,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2024.281,2028.637,"What... but, but, you see, you, you have two different organizations in this country."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2054.94,2057.127,"--Perhaps I misspoke, Your Honor."
1988.87-1064,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.925,2096.36,"But what, what does that mean when, when you come to apply?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2105.293,2118.085,"Well, I'm not asking the court system or the IRS to investigate, although they say that they do look into the motivations of the requesting country."
1988.87-1064,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.662,2125.692,"But what, what I meant to ask you was you say is there a criminal prosecution."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2143.419,2162.723,"Well, we... we not only have problems of differences in countries' approach to these matters, but differences in language, and what... I think that a treaty partner asking us for information in this country ought to educate themselves about the difference between prosecution and investigation and should be able to comply with that request."
1988.87-1064,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2162.723,2169.049,"Well, what... in this country it's one function is in one division and another function is in another division."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2178.218,2179.436,"Well, I believe it is."
1988.87-1064,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2239.77,2256.718,"What, what would the Canadians or the Philippine government... say, the Philippine government do if they have a single unit that investigates both civil and criminal matters and they are simply studying the file?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2257.763,2261.558,It doesn't sound like it to me.
1988.87-1064,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2265.62,2272.147,"But it's... but it's your test, and if you can't even explain to us how the government should answer under its test, then it's not a very strong test."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2272.147,2281.472,"--Well, it is because the entire body of United States law makes a very important distinction between civil and criminal, criminal matters."
1988.87-1064,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2317.864,2337.215,"Mr. Peery, I guess you are not arguing to us here that under this treaty that the only information sought can be information relevant to an inquiry concerning an Internal Revenue tax of the United States?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2340.839,2353.615,"Well, I think there was, was support at the time the Burbank case was, was argued for the position that absent a specific authorization to the IRS to acquire information for a foreign government, none exists."
1988.87-1064,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2355.207,2356.645,But you are not making that argument to us?
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2357.145,2357.598,--I'm not.
1988.87-1064,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2367.843,2378.418,"--And the court below did not, of course, rest its holding on that matter?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2378.418,2378.573,No.
1988.87-1064,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2391.162,2395.208,"Of course certiorari denied doesn't mean we agree with it, necessarily."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2395.208,2396.848,"That's true, Your Honor."
1988.87-1064,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2414.511,2428.335,"You're, you're not raising the argument... you're just, just in case I might disagree with Burbank, you're asking me to imagine what kind of authority I think the United States would have if the United States had authority."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2429.834,2441.282,"Well, the question was asked earlier by the Court of Mr. Wallace, would the treaty be a nullity without the summons authority of the IRS, and I believe Mr. Wallace answered no."
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2563.639,2572.026,"May I ask on your view of the matter, do you think it requires an inquiry into the good faith of the Canadian taxing authorities?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2572.026,2583.053,"--No, sir, not at... at this stage, although this Court in LaSalle certainly for domestic purposes has left open the area of institutional good faith."
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2585.427,2595.048,If we're talking about a domestic matter and we were persuaded there was bad faith on the part of the IRS even though the matter had not yet been referred for prosecution--
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2595.048,2595.642,--Some other kind of bad faith.
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2595.642,2597.875,"--that would defeat the summons enforcement, would it not?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2597.875,2600.265,"Yes, and it should, and that's a proper area of inquiry."
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2600.265,2603.872,"Well, then, why should it not also defeat it in the Canadian context?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2603.872,2606.59,"Well, I, I believe that--"
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.59,2608.465,If you're saying the same law applies to both.
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2608.465,2609.042,--Sure.
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2612.056,2613.197,"So, therefore--"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2613.197,2619.866,"I think it's a proper area of inquiry if there's, there's a showing which fairly raises the issue of, of bad faith."
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2619.866,2622.24,--You'd require... I see.
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2623.895,2625.661,I'm saying--
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2625.661,2633.298,"--if the burden is on the taxpayer or the, the, the person resisting the summons, why has that burden been discharged in this case, then?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2633.298,2635.687,--Because I think there's a difference.
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2658.663,2666.504,"Then why shouldn't it be on the taxpayer's burden, or the, the person raising the issue's burden to say it is being used for such a purpose in Canada?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2668.659,2669.237,That's right.
1988.87-1064,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2720.747,2728.244,"Mr. Peery, does the record show why these Canadian citizens have the American bank accounts?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2728.244,2729.806,"No, sir, and I have no idea."
1988.87-1064,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2733.116,2734.038,There is--
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2734.038,2734.663,And there's no record.
1988.87-1064,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2737.678,2738.537,"--They're your clients, aren't they?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2738.537,2739.16,"--Yes, sir."
1988.87-1064,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2739.16,2740.27,But you have no idea?
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2740.27,2740.801,No.
1988.87-1064,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2754.482,2759.731,"Well, they might have been doing business in this country at one time, set up an account, and just kept it."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2759.731,2760.246,That's what I would assume.
1988.87-1064,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2760.246,2761.512,Nothing like that in the record?
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2761.512,2774.538,"No, but there's a lot of commerce between Washington State and British Columbia, which is where this, this factual situation arises, and I would assume that these were commercial matters at one time and may still be."
1988.87-1064,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2774.538,2776.13,But you don't know?
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2776.13,2777.63,"I do not know that, sir."
1988.87-1064,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2912.217,2920.775,Why is it the United States is concerned as to how Canada goes about investigating tax delinquencies there?
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2920.775,2927.319,"Well, I, I think it need not be concerned at this point, certainly, in these cases."
1988.87-1064,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2957.402,2961.57,"Well, that dichotomy has obviously been enacted in the TEFRA amendments."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,2970.833,2985.561,"I'm not urging that we be concerned except insofar as Canada might be harassing a, a United States citizen with respect to the use of its revenue department in asking the IRS to lend its weight to that."
1988.87-1064,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3004.818,3008.474,So you say that that language can be only read in one way?
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3022.405,3031.387,"Well, I think we certainly ought to be reluctant to make an inquiry into the domestic affairs of a, of a foreign government, a treaty partner."
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3159.631,3161.724,"Mr. Peery, can I interrupt you there for just a second?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3161.724,3162.239,Surely.
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3162.239,3170.407,"These banks that have the information, the one bank I guess, isn't it, somewhere in Washington, is an American bank."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3170.407,3171.407,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3171.407,3173.922,And the Canadian citizens have an account in the American bank?
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3173.922,3174.437,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3174.437,3183.074,"Now, isn't it possible that those Canadian citizens would have an income tax obligation in the United States by reason of interest earned on that account or something like that?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3183.074,3188.697,"It is possible, but there was no domestic revenue purpose indicated."
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3188.697,3197.459,"Well, but at least it would be permissible, would it not, for IRS to say I'd like to check the bank records there to see if these foreign citizens might owe some federal taxes."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3197.459,3197.944,Certainly.
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3197.944,3206.066,"And if so, that information would be obtainable purely for domestic purposes pursuant to the, to the United States statute."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3206.066,3208.456,"Cerainly, and it can even be a mixed purpose."
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3208.456,3209.969,Why isn't that the whole answer to the case?
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3209.969,3217.264,"Well, it's not, because of the court's concerns and the Congress' concerns about that important dichotomy between civil and criminal."
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3217.264,3226.838,"But there's no criminal... if they're just looking at the American purposes, there is not even a suggestion that there has been any American referral for... to the Department of Justice."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3226.838,3227.557,That's true.
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.931,3236.43,"Well, it hadn't been the basis, but it was... it could be done pursuant to American law is what I'm saying."
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3236.43,3237.553,"--Yes, it could."
1988.87-1064,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3237.553,3238.757,For just that limited purpose.
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3238.757,3261.637,"The problem arose because the information was furnished indicated clearly that the authority for the inquiry that the IRS was using was the tax treaty with Canada and Section 7602, and there was an indication that Revenue... that Canada was investigating for criminal purposes creating, certainly, an ambiguity that needed to be explored."
1988.87-1064,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3470.521,3488.452,"Mr. Peery, do you know what the... what would happen if the situation were reversed and our government was asking Revenue Canada to investigate American accounts up in British Columbia?"
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3499.276,3501.587,"They look at their own, Your Honor."
1988.87-1064,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3501.587,3502.321,They look at their own?
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3502.321,3505.446,I believe the government's brief has pointed that out.
1988.87-1064,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3511.021,3513.442,And does it parallel ours entirely?
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3513.442,3526.187,"--Not entirely, but there is that dichotomy and distinction between prosecution and investigation, and so there's no problem in compliance in Canada with, with that distinction."
1988.87-1064,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3526.187,3530.763,Is it true in Pakistan or the Philippines?
1988.87-1064,1,19827,charles_e_peery,,3530.763,3539.134,"I would just have to say they have to understand enough about our domestic revenue laws which, which control their rights to information under the treaty, Your Honor."
1988.87-1064,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3539.134,3540.899,"Thank you, Mr. Peery."
1988.87-1064,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3542.821,3565.28,"If I may refer the court to the pertinent statutes at the end of our brief, pages 2a and 3a, first of all, Section 7602(b) at the bottom of 2a says that a permissible purpose for the issuance of a summons is to get information about a criminal offense."
1988.87-1064,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3634.393,3658.633,"Well, but if we adopted that, Mr. Wallace, I assume we would have to adopt (b) as well; I mean, that is to say we would not... if we adopted your opponent's argument, we would have to say you also can't use the IRS' power if the foreign country is conducting a criminal investigation, even though there's no criminal prosecution pending."
1988.87-1064,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3662.771,3667.52,"Well, (b) says you can use it for the purpose of inquiring into a criminal offense, Mr. Justice."
1988.87-1064,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3676.252,3676.533,I see.
1988.87-1064,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3676.533,3683.234,"--had the purpose of inquiring into a criminal defense, and instead drew the bright line about whether a referral is in effect."
1988.87-1064,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3683.234,3684.375,Thank you Mr. Wallace.
