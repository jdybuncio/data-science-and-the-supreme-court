1986.85-1513,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.789,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-1513, Edwards against Aguillard."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,17.61,20.462,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,100.497,102.449,"Well, this wasn't really an en banc decision, was it?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,102.449,103.181,"--No, sir, it wasn't."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,119.874,122.843,"Of course, they just said the case should be reheard en banc."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,122.843,123.445,--Yes.
1986.85-1513,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,125.895,128.847,Disagreers always disagree very strongly.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,132.134,135.42,"And in this case, they certainly upheld that tradition."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,178.83,183.484,"Mr. Bird, what would you say was the factual issue that had to be resolved?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,183.484,188.887,"Your Honor, the definition of creation science is one very important factual issue, what the statute's about."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,188.887,190.787,You don't think the statute defines the term adequately?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,190.787,199.076,"Well, Your Honor, it does give a definition that's highly scientific, and referring only to scientific evidences, and inferences from those scientific evidences."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,199.076,203.23,"But the factual issue was, what does... what does the statutory term mean, is that what it is?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,203.23,203.93,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,206.016,209.468,"And these people, who had nothing to do with enacting the statute, are able to tell us what the statute means?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,209.468,224.828,"--Because it is bringing a term from a technical term into a statute, yes, Your Honor, much like in some of the technical regulatory statutes that might take a term of art from another field without attempting to give a plenary definition in the statute."
1986.85-1513,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,239.57,243.189,Why is the meaning of the statute a factual issue?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,260.75,273.843,"Your Honor, taking those questions in reverse, the Louisiana Supreme Court has reviewed this statute on different grounds, and has upheld it under applicable provisions of the Louisiana Constitution regarding prescribing curriculum."
1986.85-1513,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.932,284.232,As within its prerogative?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,288.836,315.153,"--Because a term that is a technical term, a term used within the scientific field, was being embodied in the statute, the State submits, Your Honor, that the definition of that term is a factual matter, appropriate for resolution by expert testimony on that field, much like if the State had regulated some particular form of, say, asbestos contamination, or whatever, and had used technical terms of art."
1986.85-1513,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.426,333.782,"So if we, as a Federal court, say that the Louisiana statute means X, the Louisiana Supreme Court couldn't say, no, it doesn't mean X, it means Y?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,333.782,348.891,"Well, Your Honor, I would suggest, in the context of the procedural issue, that this Court should not be saying, the statute means X, but instead, should allow the case to go to trial, a trial it's never had, in order to develop a factual record on that issue."
1986.85-1513,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.891,350.175,In order that we can say whether it means X.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,356.028,370.888,"Your Honor, with all respect, what we would like you to say is that this Court should not have to say whether it means X or Y, but that a trial, with factual development, ought to occur to enable expert witnesses on both sides to give definitions."
1986.85-1513,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,370.888,374.692,After which... after which a Federal court will say whether it means X or Y.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,376.359,378.228,"Not quite, Your Honor, because a Federal court--"
1986.85-1513,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,378.228,381.78,You're just quarreling that it was done too soon; not that it shouldn't be done by Federal courts.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,381.78,382.68,"--Your Honor, I'm suggesting--"
1986.85-1513,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,382.68,383.565,And I'm questioning whether--
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,383.565,393.82,"--that the only thing a Federal court ought to do is review whether the factual determination by the trial court, after a trial, is clearly erroneous."
1986.85-1513,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,430.378,434.247,--What if Louisiana chooses to use a technical term in an inaccurate sense?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,437.282,440.568,A State certainly could use a term and define it differently.
1986.85-1513,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,440.568,441.334,Of course it could.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,450.324,465.702,"Your Honor, recognizing the correctness of your point about State interpretations of terms that have a... have a State law background behind them, the term in this statute was a term borrowed from a technical field."
1986.85-1513,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,478.693,491.667,"Well, Mr. Bird, I understood the opinion of the Fifth Circuit, from which you're appealing, to say that the statute was unconstitutional because it had no secular purpose, and it failed that part of the so-called Lemon test."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,500.09,509.98,"Well, Your Honor, first, I think it's very important to notice that the Fifth Circuit and the District Court did not rely at all on the legislative history in reaching that determination."
1986.85-1513,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,535.946,545.571,"Well, Mr. Bird, if we were to do that here, wouldn't we just look at the legislative history and the stated purpose of the legislature in making that determination?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,562.347,565.449,"Your Honor, that might be possible given two caveats."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,703.521,707.825,What are those religious that you acknowledge are indicated in the record?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,707.825,714.996,"--Your Honor, we'd suggest that the legislative history indicates that there were a variety of reasons for this Act being passed."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,714.996,719.465,"No, I just asked you what were the religious purposes that are... that you acknowledge are present."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,719.465,721.834,"As a tertiary purpose only, not as the primary--"
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,721.834,722.301,I understand.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,722.301,729.755,"--or even the secondary purpose, we'd recognize that, doubtless, some legislators had a desire to teach religious doctrine in the classroom."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,748.735,754.389,"Do you think there was also a purpose... do you think there was also a purpose to exclude the teaching of evolutionary science, or whatever you might call it?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,754.389,755.523,"--No, sir, I don't."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,757.056,761.309,"So to the extent that there's a religious purpose, it's to add to the curriculum, rather than to subtract from it?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,761.309,762.126,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-1513,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,791.896,808.607,"Mr. Bird, do you think that it is Constitutional within the establishment clause to teach a purely religious concept in public school in order to balance other concepts that are perceived to be anti-religious?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,808.607,812.242,"Your Honor, not in this case, and not in the general case."
1986.85-1513,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,812.242,814.408,"Well, in general, I asked."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,814.408,814.758,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,814.758,815.444,In general.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,816.694,817.127,No.
1986.85-1513,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,817.127,817.594,No?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,817.594,827.168,"Only in the limited context this Court has recognized in Shemp and other decisions of an objective, neutral discussions of a wide variety of religious views."
1986.85-1513,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,847.613,858.021,"Mr. Bird, before you go further, you acknowledge before that a purpose was... tertiary purpose on the part of some legislators was to teach religious doctrine."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,868.329,869.645,--Absolutely not.
1986.85-1513,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.877,906.002,"Does it necessarily require the teaching of a God, a personal God, as opposed to a first cause that may be quite impersonal, or a giant slug, for all we know?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,906.002,912.172,"Your Honor, teaching creation science does not entail, necessarily, the teaching of any of those concepts."
1986.85-1513,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.456,966.575,"Well, that may or may not be so."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,966.575,967.575,It's a factual issue.
1986.85-1513,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.575,974.396,Either a factual issue or an issue of law to be decided by some court.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,977.114,978.05,"Yes, sir, it does."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,983.87,985.437,Let me ask you a question there--
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,986.037,986.656,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,986.656,994.726,Did I understand you to say it would be unconstitutional to have a course in the Louisiana schools or colleges on religion?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,994.726,1002.581,"No, Your Honor, not under the narrow exception this Court has recognized for objective, neutral, discussion of religion."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1009.569,1010.021,Right.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1015.389,1016.091,--Yes sir.
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1016.091,1024.244,"Louisiana State, I looked at the catalogue, as I count has seven courses on religion."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1030.935,1031.768,I'll certainly take your word for it.
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1031.768,1035.72,"--They have a course called, Introduction to Religion."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1054.966,1056.9,"Your Honor, that's not before the Court in this case--"
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1056.9,1057.418,I understand that.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1057.418,1058.568,"--but certainly, we have no reason to--"
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1058.568,1061.554,But I'm trying to find out what... what your position really is.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1061.554,1065.489,--My answer to your first question was in the context of elementary and secondary schools.
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1065.489,1065.972,Yes.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1065.972,1083.55,"And I think this Court has recognized, because of the different maturity level, the different critical thinking level of students at the upper... at the university and college level, that a far broader variety of courses of the type that you've just described would be generally permissible at the university level."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1083.55,1086.469,And of course at the university level they also have biology courses--
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1086.469,1086.971,Absolutely.
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1086.971,1088.387,--that no doubt go into evolution.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1088.387,1089.304,Absolutely.
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1089.304,1093.425,Are you saying that all we have before us today is what happens at the public school level?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1093.425,1094.841,"Yes, it is."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1094.841,1096.46,What about elementary school?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1096.46,1102.614,This would include elementary schools to the extent they're teaching anything about origins today.
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1102.614,1122.444,"It's curious, or so it seems to me, that the statute is very explicit in requiring that, with respect to everything that goes on in the classroom, in the textbooks, in the libraries, and in all instructional matters, that this statute has to be complied with."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1126.162,1133.816,"Well, Your Honor, this Court has charged public schools with keeping impermissible religious material out of the classrooms already."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1139.906,1141.256,You can monitor a textbook.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1141.256,1142.639,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1158.95,1161.652,Would you have to have monitors in every classroom?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1161.652,1162.519,"--Your Honor, certainly not."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1258.697,1264.934,"Mr. Bird, can I ask you, you gave an example a moment ago of a Big Bang theory to mention the evolutionary process."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1278.241,1280.277,That would really depend on their own categorization.
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.031,1294.97,"Well, I mean, it seems to me some people might be a creationist within your definition at a certain point, but then believe that evolution followed that beginning moment."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1294.97,1295.287,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.287,1296.905,And I'm just wondering how you classify that person.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1296.905,1305.059,There's certainly no question that some people would take elements of what the statute envisions as creation science and combine those with elements of evolution.
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.028,1310.63,Do you... do you think there's... they are two mutually exclusive categories?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1313.415,1318.152,"--Your Honor, we cited about 25 noncreationist parties--"
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1318.152,1319.318,"Well, I'd rather not refer--"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1319.318,1320.252,--who do view them as mutually exclusive.
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1320.252,1322.22,--You view them as mutually exclusive?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1322.22,1323.037,In the views of many people--
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1323.037,1325.572,"Now, can you tell me, then, which category my example falls in?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1325.572,1335.797,"--Well, Your Honor, we have taken the position that the Big Bang theory would be an evolutionary explanation of cosmic evolution, as described by Carl Sagan and others."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1335.797,1338.816,"Well, can you tell me which theory... which category my example falls under?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1338.816,1342.701,"Probably the evolutionary category, though some people would differ."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1342.701,1350.707,"Well, what if the... what if I included, say, Neanderthal, and then... but say that it was a lower form of life than present man?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1355.409,1374.155,"That would probably be categorized as an evolutionist view, with the creationist scientists at trial anticipating testimony that Neanderthal man certainly existed, but that the physical evidence is that it was simply someone comparable to modern humans with bone disease, causing a bowing of the bones."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.155,1381.226,All of your examples of people who are creation scientists would deny any evolutionary process at all?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1381.226,1382.845,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1395.485,1399.204,"Well, how can they... if they're mutually exclusive categories, how can there be an intermediate position?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1403.924,1418.434,"--Your Honor, I guess my point, to try to say it more clearly, is that many evolutionists do recognize creation science and evolution as mutually exclusive on each issue, as a logical matter."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1423.672,1425.005,"Well, but do you have a position?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1428.874,1436.58,"Yes, Your Honor, we... the State has taken the position consistently that creation science and evolution do reflect two separate positions--"
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1436.58,1441.883,"Mutually exclusive positions, and if there's any evolution at all, then you're in the evolutionary category?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1441.883,1446.351,"--Well, if you define evolution as being macroevolutionary change, yes."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1472.067,1473.753,"Well, if that's the test, your answer to my question is easy."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1476.871,1480.073,"Yes, Your Honor, I suppose so."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1480.073,1486.56,Even though there's a very definite process of evolution from the Neanderthal man to the present society.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1486.56,1488.945,And that's an area of disputed fact.
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.762,1500.486,"Well, but I mean, even if one believed that, he would still be a creationist under your definition, because he doesn't believe everything started from an amoeba, or something like that."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1500.486,1506.89,"--He'd certainly be taking at least many creationist assumptions and interpretations of the evidence, yes."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1506.89,1519.782,"Well, see, the difficulty I have is when you talk about many and some is, I'm trying to decide whether they are mutually exclusive categories or not, and whether teachers who have to administer this Act fall in one camp or the other, or could they fall in both."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1519.782,1521.65,A teacher could certainly fall in both.
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.538,1559.359,"Isn't it possible that some of the appeared abruptly, and others evolved from what first appeared abruptly?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1560.809,1562.893,"I'm afraid I didn't hear the end of that, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1562.893,1570.214,"I say, is it not possible that some forms of life appeared abruptly, and others evolved from those that did appear abruptly?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1570.214,1570.849,Absolutely.
1986.85-1513,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1572.599,1580.205,"And if that's true, I don't see how you can avoid the possibility that a person could be both an evolutionist and a creation scientist."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1580.205,1585.259,"--Well, many people do combine elements of both, and in that sense, fit your categorization."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1608.505,1609.938,Mr. Bird?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1609.938,1611.288,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1611.288,1614.842,"May we come to a lower level of discourse, and not talk about philosophy."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1617.444,1619.661,"I'm sure it won't be lower, but I'll be very happy to--"
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1619.661,1620.396,"Well, it'll be a lot lower."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1620.396,1621.046,--try addressing it.
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1621.046,1623.598,"You have private schools in Louisiana, don't you?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1623.598,1624.265,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1624.265,1625.531,Some religious and some not?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1625.531,1626.217,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1626.217,1631.252,Does your State Board of Education have to certify those schools?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1631.252,1634.137,"Your Honor, I'm not... yes, that is correct."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1634.137,1635.406,They do in Virginia.
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1635.406,1635.806,Pardon me?
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1635.806,1641.06,"They do in my State of Virginia, and I think in 22 of the States they do."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1641.06,1642.143,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1642.143,1654.117,"And what means is that a minimum course of study is prescribed; otherwise you don't have a certificate, and graduates are unable to get in good colleges."
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1654.117,1654.5,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1654.5,1658.586,"What I'm leading up to ask you is, does this statute apply to those schools?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1658.586,1659.888,"No, it does not."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1666.592,1671.679,"So if pupils didn't like these course, they could go into private schools or parochial schools?"
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1671.679,1677.4,"In that, different standards for private schools is something that is widely practiced and certainly is Constitutional justification."
1986.85-1513,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1677.4,1678.183,If they could afford to go?
1986.85-1513,0,43932,wendell_r_bird,,1678.183,1680.102,"If they could afford to, yes, sir."
1986.85-1513,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.054,1684.054,"Thank you, Mr. Bird."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1689.79,1693.075,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please:"
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1742.742,1744.627,Why don't we go to the affidavits in the case?
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1744.627,1745.377,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1745.377,1747.496,Why don't we go to the affidavits in the case?
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1750.364,1751.064,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.064,1756.435,"There was an affidavit by Dr. Scott Morrow, a Doctor in Biochemistry."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1756.435,1757.952,Yes.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.952,1761.57,Academic credentials.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1800.631,1804.266,"Well, Your Honor, this litigation was brought in the Federal court."
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.554,1840.422,"I thought you were talking about the plain language, with resort to legislative history?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1840.422,1840.906,I am.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.139,1922.743,"What about Aristotle's view of a first cause, an unmoved mover?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1922.743,1923.293,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.293,1930.265,Would that be a creationist view?
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1934.967,1936.169,"No, but--"
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1936.169,1937.219,"In fact, he probably considered himself a scientist."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1937.219,1939.971,--Acquinas had a somewhat similar view.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1939.971,1941.137,"Yes, but I want to go back earlier."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1950.393,1952.012,Of course not.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.012,1965.939,"Well, then, you could believe in a first cause, an unmoved mover, that may be impersonal, and has no obligation of obedience or veneration from men, and in fact, doesn't care what's happening to mankind."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1965.939,1966.672,Right.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.672,1969.557,And believe in creation.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1969.557,1971.675,"Well, believe in creation?"
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1978.896,1981.281,"And I ask you, it depends on what you mean by divine."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1985.933,1991.32,"--Divine, Your Honor, has connotations beyond, I respectfully submit."
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.32,1992.756,"--But the statute doesn't say ""divine""."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1992.756,1993.156,No.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1993.156,1993.739,"All it says is ""creation""."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1993.739,1996.958,"But when you look to see what ""creation"" means, it means ""divine""."
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2026.143,2029.945,Is it the Louisiana legislature that determines what Louisiana statutes mean?
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2031.631,2040.57,"It is the Louisiana legislature, Your Honor, which writes statutes, employing the common parlance--"
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.57,2041.387,We have a doctrine--
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2041.387,2053.978,"--and which, when courts are called on to interpret those statutes, courts, whether State, Federal or whatever, are obligated to follow and interpret those statutes in the light of the meaning of the Louisiana legislature."
1986.85-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.978,2078.777,"--Mr. Topkis, we have a doctrine called the Pullman doctrine, which is succinctly described as follows: No principle has found more consistent or clear expression than that the Federal courts should not adjudicate the Constitutionality of State enactments fairly open to interpretation until the State courts have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass upon them."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2078.777,2079.695,"Quite so, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2080.813,2088.9,"Now, does... do we have any idea what Louisiana courts thinks this phrase, creation, means in this statute?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2088.9,2098.423,We have only the very brief decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court to the effect that this statute does not offend the Louisiana Constitution.
1986.85-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2099.691,2110.064,"Mr. Topkis, you're arguing here in support of the Fifth Circuit, not only the judgment but the rationality, I take it, that there is no secular purpose for this statute?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2110.064,2111.749,"Right, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.749,2119.189,But I didn't understand the Fifth Circuit to rely as heavily as you apparently do on dictionary definitions of the terms in the statute?
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2119.189,2126.759,"Well, I thought, as I read the Fifth Circuit opinion, that they said, everybody knows what creation and creationism is."
1986.85-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2146.172,2164.718,"Well, I thought part of the Fifth Circuit opinion could be read as saying that if there was... if the statute was passed for religious purposes, say, fairly broadly interpreted like, love thy neighbor as thyself, or something, that the statute might be bad."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2166.42,2166.936,--That the statute might be...?
1986.85-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2166.936,2171.872,That the statute might be unconstitutional as being an establishment of religion.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2171.872,2176.608,I would not regard love thy neighbor as thyself as a necessarily religious doctrine.
1986.85-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.727,2184.381,But supposing it's a morality subscribed to by many religious faiths.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2184.381,2193.32,"Well, there are lots of propositions that are subscribed to by religious faiths, but they do not become religious, as I understand, merely by virtue of that subscription."
1986.85-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2207.747,2215.067,"Even though, perhaps, a number of church people go down and say, we want this statute passed because it's consistent with our religious belief?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2215.067,2218.452,Even though.
1986.85-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2219.97,2222.37,"Mr. Topkis, can I ask you a question?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2240.182,2245.27,"--I do not believe so, and my colleague assures me that that's his recollection, also."
1986.85-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2245.27,2249.907,--So there's no request by either party for abstention to have the State court advise the parties on the meaning?
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2249.907,2255.394,"Neither the parties nor the Fifth Circuit; I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2255.394,2256.61,Mr. Topkis--
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2256.61,2256.994,Justice Scalia.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.994,2262.047,"--this question is sort of like the Chief Justice's last question, but I think it's a little closer to this case."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2348.653,2353.854,"I wouldn't think so, Your Honor, because the principal wouldn't be acting out of religious motivation."
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2365.245,2369.566,"And here, do we know that the State is acting out of religious motivation?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2369.566,2373.685,"By every index that we can possibly have, Your Honor, yes."
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2373.685,2374.585,Which is what?
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2374.585,2377.72,We take a look at the vocabulary of the statute; it is religious.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2402.537,2423.534,"So in the case I gave, if it was the school board that went to the high school principal, and the members of the school board were upset about this, as opposed to Parthia, because of their religious affiliations, then it would be bad, and you would have to leave the teacher in and continue to teach that Rome was not on the southern shore of the Mediterranean."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2423.534,2435.841,"Well, again, I'm following your hypothetical, and I think that the... are you still assuming that it is the superintendent who makes the decision?"
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2441.245,2443.447,"No, he's directed by the school board."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2443.447,2444.997,Yes?
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2456.672,2457.624,I agree with you there.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2477.935,2478.62,Quite so.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.62,2479.337,"Okay, I'm with you then."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2479.337,2480.137,All right.
1986.85-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2526.351,2527.951,Don't overestimate us.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2549.134,2555.787,"Your Honors, I'd like now to go to another of Mr. Bird's buzzwords, academic freedom."
1986.85-1513,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2602.268,2602.834,"Well, now wait a minute--"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2612.457,2616.426,"Yes and no, if I may, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2640.893,2646.095,"Isn't it true that in elementary school, the principal goes in and out to make sure what you're teaching?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2646.095,2647.38,I... I think that's--
1986.85-1513,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2647.38,2647.763,Of course.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2650.249,2651.115,--Well--
1986.85-1513,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2651.115,2653.451,Where you xxx.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2653.451,2658.438,"--Well, academic freedom is not incompatible with supervision, I think, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1986.85-1513,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2658.438,2661.088,"Well, let me put it this way: Do you need it for this case?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2661.088,2663.857,"I don't think I do, no."
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2663.857,2665.925,I'd like to follow up on that a little bit.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2665.925,2666.859,Mr. Justice Powell.
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2666.859,2668.211,Think about the high school level.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2668.211,2668.861,Yes?
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2668.861,2677.166,"In the State of Louisiana, as I think we've mentioned before, the courses are prescribed by the State Board of Education."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2677.166,2677.716,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2677.716,2684.053,"And teachers are not free, absent permission, to teach different courses."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2688.39,2688.807,Quite so.
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2688.807,2693.509,It may give the local school board a choice between two or three.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2718.476,2730.117,"I see it's relevance, if I may, Mr. Justice Powell, only in the sense that this statute is defended as advancing academic freedom."
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2742.359,2745.544,"Perhaps it would be irrelevant to both arguments, both sides?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2745.544,2746.913,Could be.
1986.85-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2746.913,2762.755,"What if you had a statute, Mr. Topkis, that said, we think an awful lot of teachers in the school system in this State have presented only the Protestant view of the Reformation in their medieval history classes, and so we want to give equal time to the Catholic view?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2785.538,2801.213,"So long as the purpose of the school authorities, in taking this position, was an historical purpose rather than a religious one, I couldn't quarrel with it."
1986.85-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2801.213,2806.098,"It certainly wouldn't vindicate academic freedom, in the normal sense."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2806.098,2807.117,No.
1986.85-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.012,2932.248,"Mr. Topkis, let me just be sure:"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2936.816,2937.918,"--Oh, sure, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2944.321,2955.379,"Well, or at least there is something in the legislative history that some were motivated by a desire to counteract the evolutionary subject with teaching of another subject that would have a different message."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2955.379,2960.348,"But not, Your Honor... academic freedom does not--"
1986.85-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2960.348,2960.867,"I mean, you say that's not academic freedom."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2960.867,2961.25,--That's right.
1986.85-1513,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2961.25,2961.833,And maybe you're right.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2967.137,2974.525,"Yes, and what they want to do is see to it that their version of religion... they start with the premise that evolution is religious."
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2991.786,2992.252,Mr. Topkis.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2992.252,2993.254,--Justice Scalia.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2993.254,3006.146,"In your legislative history, and you know, I've read it, there are statements of the sort you... you quoted, including some by the sponsor of this, especially the first time around, the bill that was in a different form and didn't get passed."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3040.05,3040.485,Right.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3040.485,3054.31,"Now maybe the motive of those who introduced it and were most zealous for it may have been a fundamentalist Christian motive, but can we be sure that that was the motive of the entire legislature of Louisiana in passing the bill?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3054.31,3068.219,"Well, Your Honor, when we try to figure out what the legislature meant, we look first at its plain words; then at the words of the sponsors and so on; and then we listen, or we look, for anything else."
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.12,3097.585,xxx balance secular purpose.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3115.597,3120.815,"Not, Your Honor, with respect, when the complaint is, they're teaching that religion."
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3315.226,3321.88,"Some of the experts who provided affidavits were agnostics, at least one of them."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3321.88,3323.232,"--One of them so stated, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3323.232,3324.315,Said he was an agnostic.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3363.725,3365.392,I'm not sure I follow your question.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3367.677,3372.915,"Well, the school board is moved to correct the instructor whose teaching the wrong thing about Rome--"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3372.915,3373.648,Right.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3373.648,3377.45,--by the fact that it's inconsistent with their religious beliefs.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3377.45,3377.933,Right.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3377.933,3379.669,And it makes their religious look absurd.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3383.203,3383.954,Right.
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3383.954,3386.805,"Okay, so that's the reason they're concerned about it."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3386.805,3388.174,Yes?
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3388.174,3395.411,"Now, would you say that there purpose is to further their religion, or is their purpose of get the curriculum right and get the correct thing taught about--"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3395.411,3402.398,"I don't care about their purpose; as long as what they do is get the true historical facts taught, I'm not going to be terribly concerned."
1986.85-1513,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.398,3402.715,--Okay.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3409.587,3411.62,"Exactly, exactly."
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3412.139,3414.572,"Mr. Topkis, I just want to ask one quick question."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3414.572,3415.324,--Justice Powell.
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3415.324,3427.149,"Would you view the teaching of religious courses at the college level... state colleges, state universities... differently from the position that you take here today?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3427.149,3428.949,"I shouldn't think so, no, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3428.949,3436.255,"In other words, you would think a Constitutional question were raised if a university taught a course on the Bible?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3436.255,3437.488,"No, not a bit."
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3437.488,3439.273,What do you think?
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3439.273,3442.392,"I studied the Bible... well, I didn't go to a State university."
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3453.282,3454.516,0 xxx.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3454.516,3455.549,I'm sorry?
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3455.549,3456.818,I didn't understand you.
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3456.818,3457.601,I don't see anything--
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3457.601,3464.322,"Is it appropriate for a State university to teach Biblical courses, to teach a course on the Bible?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3464.322,3477.982,"--Absolutely, as long as it is taught in neutral fashion; as long as the State does not say, as long as no professor comes into class, and announces: Ladies and gentlemen, today I'm going to prove to you that the Bible is right."
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3477.982,3487.354,"If... if the university has courses in biology and chemistry and teaches specifically courses in evolution, would you object to courses on the Bible?"
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3487.354,3491.491,I would... I have no objection to courses on the Bible.
1986.85-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3502.847,3504.049,But not in public universities?
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3504.049,3506.417,"Not in public universities; no, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3506.417,3507.451,"Thank you, Mr. Topkis."
1986.85-1513,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3507.451,3508.984,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3508.984,3510.136,"Mr. Bird, do you have any more?"
1986.85-1513,2,43932,wendell_r_bird,,3512.405,3514.188,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3561.502,3562.152,May I ask about--
1986.85-1513,2,43932,wendell_r_bird,,3562.152,3562.852,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1513,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3562.852,3563.935,--academic freedom for a moment?
1986.85-1513,2,43932,wendell_r_bird,,3574.909,3581.063,"If they were within the same subject area, such as conversational German versus formal German--"
1986.85-1513,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3581.063,3585.034,"No, no, just German... they didn't particularly like Germans and they do like French."
1986.85-1513,2,43932,wendell_r_bird,,3591.354,3593.271,"--Well, of course, that's not the wording of this statute."
1986.85-1513,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3593.271,3593.89,"Well, it's pretty close."
1986.85-1513,2,43932,wendell_r_bird,,3593.89,3595.356,It is a balanced treatment statute.
1986.85-1513,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3595.79,3597.842,You can't teach evolution unless you teach this other subject.
1986.85-1513,2,43932,wendell_r_bird,,3597.842,3604.596,"--Your Honor, if the assumption of the legislature there, as here, was that most or nearly all teachers would opt for teaching both--"
1986.85-1513,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3604.596,3605.696,"I'm just asking, would it advance academic freedom?"
1986.85-1513,2,43932,wendell_r_bird,,3605.696,3606.012,"--Yes, it would."
1986.85-1513,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3606.012,3608.214,"They'd come in and say, we did it to advance academic freedom."
1986.85-1513,2,43932,wendell_r_bird,,3609.548,3615.367,"Yes, it would, if you recognize that a legislature may not use the terms ""academic freedom"" in the correct legal sense."
1986.85-1513,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3621.338,3622.121,"Thank you, Mr. Bird."
