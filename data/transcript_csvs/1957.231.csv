1957.231,0,26212,george_j_todaro,,15.889,21.589,"May -- Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1957.231,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,37.213,37.422,Yes.
1957.231,0,26212,george_j_todaro,,37.422,38.581,-- a tap going on --
1957.231,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,38.581,38.635,Sure.
1957.231,0,26212,george_j_todaro,,38.635,48.463,-- and that's a very obvious reason therefore the person knows that there is a telephone message being tapped in an indirect manner.
1957.231,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,48.463,49.818,Yes.
1957.231,0,26212,george_j_todaro,,49.818,58.939,I wanted to get down to this case.
1957.231,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,201.597,204.192,The state officer could not testify in the federal court.
1957.231,0,26212,george_j_todaro,,204.192,205.448,"In the federal court, yes."
1957.231,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,205.448,206.467,Is that so?
1957.231,0,26212,george_j_todaro,,206.467,213.403,"That's exactly the point of this you're here, whether a state officer can testify in the federal court in violation of 605."
1957.231,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,213.403,214.279,Yes.
1957.231,0,26212,george_j_todaro,,214.279,245.884,"Now, in the court below, the court stated that -- that despite the fact that the state officer was acting pursuant to the laws of the State of New York and pursuant to a warrant of the State of New York, as soon as he testified under the federal court, he was violating the federal law, 605."
1957.231,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,248.55,250.317,Do you say that's been held?
1957.231,0,26212,george_j_todaro,,250.317,250.892,I beg your pardon?
1957.231,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,250.892,252.411,Do you say that's been held?
1957.231,0,26212,george_j_todaro,,252.411,259.048,"By the lower court in this case, the Circuit Court -- the Second Circuit."
1957.231,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,259.048,262.75,I thought the Second Circuit said that it's -- it's alright.
1957.231,0,26212,george_j_todaro,,262.75,264.092,That it was alright to testify.
1957.231,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,264.092,264.659,Yes.
1957.231,0,26212,george_j_todaro,,265.454,265.901,It was alright --
1957.231,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,265.901,266.127,It was alright --
1957.231,0,26212,george_j_todaro,,266.127,271.09,"-- to testify but he said that as soon as the officer testified, he violated the federal --"
1957.231,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,271.09,271.458,I see.

1957.231,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1596.092,1602.413,"Yes, but apart from that, was the subject matter of the conversation testified?"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1611.106,1613.582,"Well, there was a -- the language --"
1957.231,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1613.582,1614.641,Yes.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1614.641,1617.535,-- about the 11 pieces was disclosed.
1957.231,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1648.166,1651.996,"Well, what I am -- I don't know why I have so much trouble about this."
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1667.362,1667.42,"No, Your Honor."
1957.231,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1667.42,1668.147,-- conversation.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1668.679,1669.417,No.(Voice Overlap) --
1957.231,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1669.417,1671.678,"Well, that's all I want to know."
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1676.964,1677.263,That is right.
1957.231,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1677.263,1678.185,"-- and that is all, is that right?"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1678.185,1679.902,"That's right, Your Honor."
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1679.902,1694.125,Why would that be true Mr. Davis if the evidence was or the statement was made on the evidence on the basis of the intercepted message and then prove what was in it and why was that (Voice Overlap) --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1694.125,1702.234,If that had been -- if that had been the case it would have -- then you would have a disclosure but the Government's case wasn't disclosure of the messages.
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1702.234,1713.353,"I understood you to say that the judge, in passing on the admissibility of evidence as presented to us, the telephone with so-called intercepted the messages."
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1715.427,1716.463,"Well, that's right."
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1725.955,1735.522,"So, why -- why would the judge not be barred just as much as though it had been presented to the jury?"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1742.081,1742.731,Well --
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1742.731,1743.48,-- why wouldn't all --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1743.48,1743.748,If it -- if it --
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1743.748,1745.67,"-- be wrong, to present it to the judge (Voice Overlap) --"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1745.67,1746.058,If it is wrong --
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1746.058,1746.46,(Voice Overlap)
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1746.46,1750.97,"-- if it is not wrong, Your Honor, Mr. Benanti can't object."
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1781.515,1786.722,He's attempting to deprive the Government of the benefits of what he called an unlawful disclosure.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1789.808,1790.802,That -- that is right.
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1822.458,1828.582,"So, your position then is different to what it would have been if the Government offered it as to the admissibility of evidence."
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1828.582,1831.194,"Well, if that would have certainly been a different case, yes."
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1849.581,1858.19,"But Mr. Davis, I don't see how that helps you much because the second Nardone case says that the -- the fruit is just as excludable as the --"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1858.19,1858.389,Well --
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1858.389,1859.218,-- intercept.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1859.218,1859.784,-- yes.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1878.322,1879.012,I don't follow you --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1879.012,1879.027,-- the (Voice Overlap) --
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1879.027,1879.674,-- at all.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1881.092,1881.224,Well --
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1881.224,1889.646,(Inaudible) too said you can't use the product of a prohibited 605 transaction.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1889.646,1890.246,That is right.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1890.246,1890.91,Isn't that it?
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1890.91,1891.465,That is right.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1891.465,1899.215,So the question that bothers Justice Harlan so much isn't decisive of this case or even very important to this case.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1899.215,1900.21,"Well, we do -- well it's the --"
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1900.21,1903.723,You must first establish that there was a violation of 605.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1903.723,1915.666,I think -- I think Mr. Todaro said that there would be a violation of 605 in this Court by the divulgence in this Court of this fruit.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1936.498,1936.621,All right.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1936.621,1942.059,But that doesn't mean that what is happening in court is itself a violation of 605.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1942.059,1946.131,"No, but I say that's immaterial to the essential question in this case."
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1946.131,1951.258,"It -- well, I'm not sure that -- well, I'm -- I'm not sure it's immaterial but it certainly is --"
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1951.258,1952.063,What I mean if you --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1952.063,1952.076,Yes.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1952.076,1952.601,-- if -- if --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1952.601,1953.009,We still have –-
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1953.009,1953.352,(Voice Overlap)
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1953.352,1954.442,-- we still have a case to decide.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1954.442,1966.78,If 605 was violated in this case then this evidence is inadmissible under Nardone and you don't prove that -- that 605 was violated by the inadmissibility of the -- of the fruit.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1966.78,1967.421,That is right.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1967.421,1968.406,All right.
1957.231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1968.406,1968.507,Mr. Davis --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1968.507,1969.674,Now --
1957.231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1969.674,1971.686,"-- you do rely on Weeks, don't you?"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1971.686,1978.273,"Well, I -- I wanted to mention Weeks because there's been some confusion -- almost all of Weeks deals with federal officials with the Court."
1957.231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1978.273,1979.939,"Yes, but it also deals with state officials."
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1979.939,1987.086,"The last paragraph, the next to the last, except for the result, deals with a seizure by policemen by --"
1957.231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1987.086,1987.106,Yes.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1987.106,2003.603,"-- local policeman and Weeks itself, is the origin of the rule that seizures by state police would -- state officials without the knowledge or concurrence of the federal officials may be introduced in evidence."
1957.231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2003.603,2012.464,"Now, do you recognize the distinction between the Weeks problem that it concerned the state officers and the problem we have here?"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2012.464,2016.946,"Well, there is a difference because the Weeks case deals, of course, with the -- with the Fourth Amendment."
1957.231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2026.696,2028.193,And your position is there's no --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2028.193,2028.528,Yes.
1957.231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2028.528,2030.92,-- difference in results they rely on Week's court.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2030.92,2032.161,We do rely on Weeks.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2060.358,2062.003,Can't we get Weeks straight?
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2098.738,2099.454,That's right.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2099.454,2113.778,"So, I couldn't possibly understand why your opponent relied on Weeks and why is the -- when you say Weeks you would mean the cases that follow, namely, Weeks -- the Weeks doctrine is a week of exclusion by misconduct on the part of federal officials."
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2113.778,2116.839,That is right and it draws the distinction with respect to state (Voice Overlap) --
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2116.839,2119.152,And all the rest follows Weiss and all the rest.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2119.152,2121.188,And that is -- that is right.
1957.231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2157.492,2159.303,And that was said as to federal officers.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2159.303,2160.299,That's been said as to federal officers.
1957.231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2160.299,2165.364,"But there the state officers, Weeks sanctioned the use of the material seized by state officers."
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2165.364,2165.97,That's right.
1957.231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2180.402,2187.753,And do you concede that what the state officers did in the Weeks situation was not a violation of federal law in any respect?
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2187.753,2189.566,"Oh, no."
1957.231,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2192.5,2193.43,And the violation of federal --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2193.43,2198.299,And the violation of -- of -- as an illegal search and seizure.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2205.384,2206.904,Was it dealt with?
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2215.895,2217.979,"But -- what -- yes, that is right."
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2218.787,2225.584,"And -- but a state officer who -- who breaks in a house, is he violating the Fourth Amendment?"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2225.584,2226.269,"No, he's not --"
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2226.269,2226.841,Certainly not.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2226.841,2228.253,No.
1957.231,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2228.253,2242.562,"So, when you get through with the Weeks case and it gets back to this case, what do you say to the facts of this case, will present or prohibit all divulgence and doesn't say anything about (Inaudible)"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2242.562,2244.907,"Well, I will come to that in a minute, Mr. Justice Burton."
1957.231,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2275.054,2275.42,Right.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2275.42,2290.378,"And if we follow Weeks, then we say that since these are state officials that are involved in -- and that they were engaged only in local state enforcements that it can be used in a federal -- in a federal court even assuming it was illegally --"
1957.231,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2290.378,2290.975,And that's the view --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2290.975,2291.019,-- taken.
1957.231,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2291.019,2293.287,-- or the statute view that you don't have in the Weeks case.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2293.287,2293.88,That is right.
1957.231,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2313.601,2316.034,And they say the same thing here is what I'm telling you.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2316.034,2316.505,That's right.
1957.231,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2340.903,2353.072,"Well, if the public policy involved of the federal court shall not lend themselves to aiding and abetting in a commission of a crime which is on your hypothesis involved under the statute."
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2353.072,2359.326,"Well, that it's not a -- those -- if -- if we did have a divulgence so that there was a crime being involved."
1957.231,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2359.326,2366.22,"Yes, but your -- your premise as I understood it was in answer to Justice Burton that you were assuming that there was a violation as to --"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2366.22,2366.455,That is right.
1957.231,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2366.455,2367.132,--the statute.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2367.132,2367.908,That is right.
1957.231,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2367.908,2369.016,If there is a violation of the --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2369.016,2371.58,"A past violation, that is right."

1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2614.826,2626.464,Because the claim of the petitioner here is that the lead -- the lead which led -- which resulted from the arrest came from wiretapping.

1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3595.046,3603.76,I find no evidence of any divulgence at the trial except as I had explained to the court as a basis for objecting to the introduction of the evidence.
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3603.76,3606.307,Do you challenge that statement in your brief?
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3607.218,3607.585,We --
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3607.585,3613.467,-- it's rather unusual to the court to go against the -- what the court says as to the facts of case --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3613.467,3613.854,"Well, we --"

1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3614.157,3625.28,"-- we have not -- we have not Mr. Justice Black, we haven't argued in our brief in this case and quite frankly until Mr. Justice Frankfurter pressed me on this one."
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3629.477,3630.005,I thought it (Voice Overlap) --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3630.005,3632.056,-- argued the absence of divulgence here.
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3632.056,3634.657,I thought (Inaudible) might have been the reason why you have the statement there.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3634.657,3634.953,Well --
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3634.953,3635.197,-- there.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3635.197,3649.195,-- I -- one reason -- one reason that -- that this comes up and -- and maybe without proper preparation is that we don't have any proper record in this case because of the way this thing comes to this Court.
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3649.195,3650.887,"That being true, wouldn't we have to accept"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3650.887,3650.985,Well --
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3650.985,3652.034,-- what the court held?
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3652.034,3664.446,"Well, you -- well we'd -- you have before you the transcript of the proceeding below which -- which will show you everything that was -- I mean there's no question as to what went on at the trial."
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3667.328,3671.916,He found that there was both interception and divulgence.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3671.916,3673.248,"Well, he makes that remark."
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3673.933,3676.704,"-- (Voice Overlap) at the Court's opinion, isn't it?"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3676.704,3686.58,"That's certainly in the Court's opinion whether it's a conscious weighing of any evidence or whether it's a -- an assumption, I don't know."
1957.231,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3686.58,3703.142,"Well, Mr. Davis, if at the trial either it's before the courts or before the jury, one of the officers testified to this conversation so far as 11 pieces are concerned."
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3706.654,3711.018,"Well, I think that that would have been a divulgence of that information, yes."
1957.231,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3711.018,3711.976,"Well, it was."
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3714.863,3716.219,"Yes, but I -- but I don't think --"
1957.231,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3716.219,3716.658,Well then --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3716.658,3732.173,-- that the petitioner -- the petitioner can now object because on cross-examination in opposing the in -- the admissibility of the evidence can object because he brought out a message of this kind.
1957.231,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3732.173,3738.751,"Well, you brought the fruits of it -- of it there and wasn't he entitled in his conscience to (Voice Overlap) --"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3738.751,3740.257,It's certainly wasn't entitled to.
1957.231,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3745.129,3745.588,And indeed --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3745.588,3746.015,-- mean that the Government --
1957.231,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3746.015,3748.514,-- there was this divulgence then -- then --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3748.514,3748.525,And this --
1957.231,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3748.525,3753.292,"-- if there was a divulgence, then Judge Medina is right, isn't he?"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3753.292,3760.847,"Well, not a divulgence in the sense that should exclude the evidence from the -- from the -- should result in an -- sa violation."
1957.231,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3760.847,3766.051,"Well, does the -- does the statute say that it shall not be divulged to a jury?"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3766.637,3776.874,"Well, if there was a violation by the police officer in -- in answering this question in court, if there was such a violation, it is not attributable to the Government."
1957.231,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3787.539,3806.905,"Well, when you -- when you bring a -- a witness into the case and -- and produce evidence that amounts to the introduction of -- of poisoned evidence, can you hide behind -- behind that --"
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3806.905,3807.188,No.
1957.231,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3807.188,3807.648,-- and say that --

1957.231,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3808.131,3818.405,-- we don't -- we -- we're not responsible for any divulgence because the -- the defendant tried to show and did show that it was illegally obtained?
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3818.405,3820.417,"We're not trying to hide behind it, Your Honor."
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3825.735,3826.562,-- (Voice Overlap)
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3826.562,3828.715,-- in order to challenge it he couldn't do anything else.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3828.715,3841.782,Suppose a police officer had said or asked the court's ruling not to -- to be allowed not to answer this question because to answer it would commit a crime.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3841.782,3847.125,I -- I think [Laughs] it would -- it would be an impossible situation.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3860.801,3862.472,I don't see -- I don't -- myself --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3862.472,3865.079,And that wouldn't be a divulgence with -- of the message.
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3865.079,3870.836,I don't see how the -- how it was necessary to tell that there's interception in order to tell that this was evidence.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3870.836,3875.013,"Well, they wanted to find out whether this resulted from the interception."
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3886.489,3886.879,What I'm suggesting --
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3886.879,3887.592,But --
1957.231,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3887.592,3898.639,-- and I (Inaudible) the policeman might say I'm -- I'm familiar with the law and I'm -- my -- my lips are sealed because that would make a crime which heretofore wasn't a crime because there's been no divulgence.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3898.639,3913.408,And then we would come down to the question of who has the burden of proof showing that there is a connection between the evidence and the -- and the alleged interception whether it is the objector or whether it's the -- the Government.
1957.231,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,3913.408,3916.798,I don't see how you get around what Justice Black pointed out.
1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3927.846,3931.325,"But -- but I'm not trying to use anything that was divulged, Your -- Your Honor."

1957.231,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3970.846,3971.063,That is --
1957.231,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3971.063,3973.145,I'd say that's -- that's all there is.
