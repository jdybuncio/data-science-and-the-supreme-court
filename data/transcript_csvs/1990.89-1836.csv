1990.89-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.919,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1836, Dominic P. Gentile v. the State Bar of Nevada."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,52.326,56.607,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,144.216,147.629,"You say his presentation, Mr. Tigar... you mean his presentation to the press?"
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,147.629,151.403,"--Yes, the conference, Chief Justice Rehnquist, that is videotaped."
1990.89-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.277,180.641,"Well, how much does a defense lawyer have to prove at trial in order for a defendant to be acquitted?"
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,184.004,185.223,--It could be.
1990.89-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,185.223,186.655,The burden... the burden is on the State.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,186.655,190.468,"The burden rests on the State, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,336.892,344.647,"Well, Mr. Tigar, here we're dealing with, I suppose, Nevada Supreme Court rule 177."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,344.647,346.998,"--That's my understanding, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,346.998,363.951,And part 1 of that says that a lawyer shall not make an extra judicial statement if the lawyers knows or reasonably should know that it will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,372.566,374.326,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, we do."
1990.89-1836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,388.057,401.025,"And is this provision, part 1 of rule 177, rather typical of what many States have in their rules governing attorney conduct?"
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,401.025,404.527,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is typical of what many States have done."
1990.89-1836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,404.527,405.248,So they're all invalid?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,405.248,412.691,"Any rule that does not embody the clear and present danger standard would be invalid under our view, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,452.048,459.111,"Well, I think part 2, A and B, present a somewhat different question."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,466.036,471.009,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, and our position on that is clear."
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,490.492,512.038,"In... in your view, Mr. Tigar, if the Court makes a ruling on a motion in limine that it's not to be brought out that a lie detector test has been given... trial is ongoing, can an attorney go out in the corridor at recess time and tell the press that there was lie detector test that the witness had failed?"
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,512.038,514.048,"Absolutely not, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,522.433,523.956,Suppose the jury had been sequestered.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,523.956,536.502,"--There might be less danger under such circumstances, but Justice Kennedy, I would submit that there a court could well find that the clear and present danger nonetheless exists, because we all--"
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,536.502,537.904,Clear and present danger of what?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,537.904,542.196,--The clear and present danger of a harm to the deliberative process that's then ongoing.
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,542.196,544.499,Because the jury is going to find out about it?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,544.499,558.208,"Justice Kennedy, I've tried some cases with sequestered juries, and unfortunately, despite the marshals' best efforts and sometimes even because the marshals are careless, matters are communicated to the jury."
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,559.728,569.484,"Well, is the... is the only clear and present danger that you can envisage the fact that the jury will receive information that it ought not to have?"
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,569.484,580.441,"--No, there are other dangers to the trial process, although once you get away from impact on the jury's deliberations, they are considerably more attenuated."
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,584.975,596.052,"Well, what are the other dangers of the trial process if an attorney reveals the contents of matters that the judge in limine has instructed the attorney shall not mention in the courtroom?"
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,596.052,604.607,"--The Court's opinion in Alderman against United States referred to two of them; national security and the rights of third parties, suggesting that protective orders were necessary there."
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,617.075,621.857,So rights of third parties tested under the clear and present danger test?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,621.857,631.545,"I think not, Justice Kennedy, because at least to the extent that they do not involve core speech on matters of public concern."
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,651.106,665.987,"Well, if... if you say that the court can protect the rights of third parties by disciplining or ordering an attorney not to discuss certain matters, then I take it the attorney does have some special obligations to the court that others do not."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,666.567,669.72,"That is absolutely correct, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,698.059,704.402,"Mr. Tigar, suppose... is... is there no interest in the dignity of the trial process that's separate and apart from injuring the jury?"
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,730.04,737.754,"--Mr. Justice Scalia, if the reenactment has no risk of any danger to the engoing trial process--"
1990.89-1836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.754,739.534,"It's a preenactment, not a reenactment."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,740.446,741.237,--If there is no--
1990.89-1836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.237,743.177,For those interested this is what the trial is going to look like.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,744.428,760.03,"--If your... if there is no risk of danger to the trial process, that sort of behavior, undignified as it may be... and it wouldn't be the first time that lawyers have done something undignified... would be protected by the First Amendment."
1990.89-1836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.03,760.599,It would?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,763.013,764.923,Excuse me?
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,764.923,766.185,Why would it be undignified?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,766.185,769.477,Justice Scalia's question assumed that it would be undignified.
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,771.307,772.319,Do you agree that it would be undignified?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,772.319,774.239,--Pardon me?
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,774.239,776.241,Do you agree that it would be undignified?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,776.241,779.135,"It would not necessarily be undignified, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,779.633,782.894,Depending upon... upon the skill of the counsel making the presentation?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,784.256,788.197,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, I have never done a preenactment of a celebrated case."
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,797.013,797.684,I have... one more question.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,812.084,815.747,"Connick v. Meyers, Justice Kennedy... the court attache can be disciplined."
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,815.747,816.157,Why?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,816.157,816.688,"Different standards, sir."
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,816.688,817.497,Why?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,820.101,838.28,"No, Justice Kennedy, because the rule which has to do with lawyer confidences, court attache duties, and the duties generally of employees as exemplified in nonlawyer cases such as Carpenter and Snepp have to do with the employer's responsibility and ability of consistent--"
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,838.28,838.921,"Well, suppose it's not a confidence."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,851.591,866.6,"--Consistent with the First Amendment and absent an employment relationship that governs the speech, such as in Connick or Snepp, then that information on a matter of public concern would be subject to the same standard for which we argue here."
1990.89-1836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,876.197,888.784,"What... what would the answer be if you had a sequestered jury and instead of a court attache making a statement, another judge of the same bench who wasn't presiding over the trial just decided to engage in commentary on it?"
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,901.573,903.182,"--Yes, Justice Souter--"
1990.89-1836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,903.182,910.508,But there is no value whatsoever in the... in effect in the public appearance of... of a deliberative process of justice?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,910.508,914.81,"--I had a little more to my answer, Justice Souter--"
1990.89-1836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,914.81,915.211,Right.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,915.211,917.922,--because I take your question extremely seriously.
1990.89-1836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,935.785,941.43,Why is a lawyer's effect on that appearance so much less?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,950.513,953.886,"--No, it is extremely significant, Justice Souter, and there is an additional reason."
1990.89-1836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1011.556,1013.766,Could... could I bring you back though to this question.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1057.254,1068.49,"As the Court did in Landmark, by looking not at legislative-type findings such as embodied in rule 177 and like the Nevada Supreme Court entertained."
1990.89-1836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1074.464,1091.458,"Okay, but the point is doesn't the harm take place by destroying the public, if not general or universal perception, that there is a disciplined and rational and deliberative process that is going to go on in the courtroom?"
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1129.643,1136.936,"--Justice Souter, the Court has resolutely refused to find the collision of First and Sixth Amendment rights the question suggests."
1990.89-1836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1152.346,1154.888,"Yes, but our... the... maybe I misunderstand you."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1171.31,1176.483,"I would answer your question then, sir, in this way, and I'm sorry if you thought I had evaded it earlier."
1990.89-1836,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1230.379,1237.291,So you're... you're saying that the interest the Government may properly protect should be assessed in terms of countervailing interests?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1237.291,1261.548,"I am saying, Justice Souter, that lawyers are public citizens, that these are matters of public concerns, and that the Government... if by that we mean the people's right to govern themselves... is something we hold dear... the First Amendment test for which we contend is essential to the proper operation of decision making processes that go well beyond the narrow interests of a particular trial."
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1261.548,1283.172,"And so you... I take it, Mr. Tigar, then you... you think that any lawyer can deliberately speak out before a trial begins and say things that he knows and intends to create a substantial likelihood of prejudicing a fair trial."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1283.172,1284.552,That--
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.552,1285.844,Lawyers are just free to do that.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1293.177,1296.591,"--If I am understood as saying that, Justice White, I have been a great deal less--"
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.591,1297.472,"--Well, the--"
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1297.472,1299.342,--coherent than I should.
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1299.342,1303.797,"--the rule... you say the rule... this rule, paragraph one is unconstitutional in the States."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1303.797,1305.857,Justice White--
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.857,1308.308,Because it doesn't include the clear and present danger standard.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1309.94,1310.678,--Justice White--
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.678,1320.275,So a lawyer is free to make statements that he knows will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1321.657,1322.987,"--No, Justice White, he is not."
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1323.949,1325.108,"Well... well, what can you do to him?"
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1327.161,1339.968,"--If the ABA would return to the standards for criminal justice that it once enacted before the model rules, the... a rule can be fashioned which takes account of the clear and present danger standard."
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1343.521,1343.931,"Well, you're not answering my question."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1364.414,1367.487,"Unless the State is willing to go further, Justice White."
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.487,1373.45,"Well, so I would say he is free... that any lawyer is free to try to prejudice an adjudicative proceeding."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1373.45,1377.144,Provided that the speech--
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1377.144,1378.266,The First Amendment gives him that right.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1378.266,1387.099,"--Provided the speech only rises to the substantial likelihood test and not to the clear and present danger test, yes, that is our position."
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1391.212,1394.223,So I guess it's just how hard he's going to try to prejudice it.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1394.223,1398.418,"--Justice White, I don't think that we have erected--"
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1398.418,1401.55,"Well, if he tries real hard, he can probably create a clear and present danger."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1401.55,1403.19,--Justice--
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.19,1411.885,"But if he just goes out and says, well, I really want to... I really want to prejudice this, but I'll only create a substantial likelihood of it."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1411.885,1417.76,"--Justice White, you assume the cynical lawyer, and of course, sometimes rules are made for cynical people."
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1417.76,1418.19,Well--
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1418.19,1419.88,On this record we see a lawyer--
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1419.88,1422.434,--I think... I think this rule is aimed at cynical lawyers.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1422.434,1424.134,--On this--
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1424.134,1429.467,Not lawyers who know that they are... that likely are going to prejudice the proceeding.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1429.467,1444.247,"--I wish... I wish to start by noting that the Nevada Supreme Court did not require any such proof with respect to petitioner Gentile, and the American Bar Association hasn't said that he violated the rule for which they contend."
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1448.18,1450.801,What did the supreme court hold?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1450.801,1454.485,--It found no prejudice but said that none was necessary--
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.485,1454.946,Well--
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1454.946,1456.715,--and cited its earlier case of In re Raggio.
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.715,1463.281,"--Well, no actual prejudice but as it turns out, the lawyer wasn't successful in prejudicing the proceedings."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1463.281,1471.596,"The undisputed evidence, Justice White, is that the amount of study and concern he put in the night before illustrates a determination to try to follow the rules."
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1495.561,1499.493,"Well, you've never... had to deal with a press release and a labor lawyer."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1504.527,1508.991,"--Bridges was a participant, Justice White, with--"
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.991,1509.512,He wasn't a lawyer.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1509.512,1510.431,--That is correct.
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.992,1517.817,He wasn't a lawyer and what they did was try to... they wanted to hold the... the press and the labor leader in contempt.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1521.08,1531.535,"And for that, sir, we will have to rely, Mr. Justice White, on the cases such as Keller v. State Bar and the other cases in which the Court has said that the First Amendment doesn't stop at the bar's door."
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1531.535,1538.42,And Landmark that you rely on carefully said we are not dealing here with a participant in the trial.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1538.42,1545.776,"Yes, Justice White, and the participants, which again is a term broader than lawyers, would invoke the Bridges and... and Wood cases."
1990.89-1836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1545.776,1547.607,"Well, I'm still talking about a lawyer."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1568.079,1569.341,The rules--
1990.89-1836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.341,1570.26,Would that violate the ABA rules?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1570.26,1574.484,--There is a prosecutor rule that says that prosecutors have to try to control the police.
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1599.319,1617.371,"Mr. Tigar, if we adopt the position you wish us to adopt, my assumption is that in every bench trial in the country an attorney would be free to rehearse his case... discuss his case on the courthouse steps 1 hour before the trial begins."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1618.312,1621.565,"We would not take that position, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1623.425,1635.544,I... I can't see any interest that you've identified or conceded here that would prohibit the bar from making... that would permit the bar to make a rule that would stop that conduct.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1635.544,1639.227,"--Cox v. Louisiana... Cox, too, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1639.227,1641.127,"All right, then 100 yards away from the courthouse."
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1641.127,1647.781,"100 yards away from the courthouse we still have conduct brigaded with speech, which is a part of the burden of Cox, too."
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.781,1648.833,That day or the day before?
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1648.833,1662.26,100 yards away and the day before a reenactment of a potential bench trial such as a moot court argument to a group of law students before a Supreme Court argument might very well be the sort of exercise that the Court would find protected.
1990.89-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.732,1666.074,You would like to have the Court find protected.
1990.89-1836,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1666.074,1669.817,"--Excuse me, if I misspoke, Justice White."
1990.89-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1669.817,1670.286,No.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1679.753,1682.104,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1726.963,1729.274,--Is it undisputed that he purpose was to prejudice jurors?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1729.274,1741.813,"--He own testimony makes that absolutely clear, Justice Stevens... pages 41 to 42 of the joint appendix, 45 of the joint appendix, 50 of the joint appendix, and 56."
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1789.905,1791.424,"He could have had his secretary do this though, right?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1796.53,1799.021,"Well, the... actually, Justice Scalia--"
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.021,1800.31,Would that have been all right under the rule?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1800.31,1809.526,"--Well, Nevada Supreme Court rule 203 provides that it's professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate any rule through the acts of another."
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1810.258,1811.878,Through the acts... so he couldn't... he couldn't have anybody do it?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1811.878,1820.593,"--Well, it would be extremely difficult, let me say as a practical matter, to prove a violation that a lawyer was somehow setting up a process--"
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.593,1821.214,Uh-huh.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1821.214,1822.255,--whereby somebody else was violating the rule.
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1830.981,1838.277,Do... do the ABA rules contain the same... proposals contain the same provision or is that of Nevada's own creation?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1838.277,1844.009,--The ABA rule... model rule 8.4(a) contains the same in substance provision.
1990.89-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1864.604,1869.827,"Well, could Sanders have hired a public relations person who is not a lawyer to make all these statements?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1869.827,1870.937,"Yes, I think he could have."
1990.89-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1870.937,1875.19,Could... could this... could the State prohibit that conduct?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1875.19,1877.251,It would be more difficult we would think.
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1897.015,1904.869,Do you think that the public is influenced by a defense lawyer saying that his client is innocent?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1904.869,1909.462,"--Well, Justice Marshall, a... much more than that was said at the press conference."
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1910.033,1911.865,"Well, would you answer the question?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1911.865,1916.787,"--I think that in some circumstances, depending on how it's said, it could have an effect."
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1919.119,1925.393,What do you... what do you expect... do you expect the defense counsel to admit he is defending a guilty man?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1925.393,1927.144,"--No, but here... here's the point--"
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1927.144,1927.615,Do you?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1927.615,1931.598,"--No, but here's the point, and it was established by this Court in the United States against Young."
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1950.648,1954.091,"Well, do you think that the average person is influenced--"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1954.091,1955.603,I think that--
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1955.603,1957.154,--by any... will you let me finish?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1957.154,1957.574,--Sure.
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1957.925,1961.417,--by anything a defense counsel say in the press conference?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1961.417,1963.999,"I do think so, yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1963.999,1964.51,You do?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1964.51,1967.181,This was the whole thrust of this Court's opinion in Sheppard.
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1983.971,1988.255,This is a case of the Bar Association doing it.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1988.255,1989.197,This is a Nevada--
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1989.197,1991.677,Do you recognize that they are two different situations?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,1991.677,1996.3,"--Well, these rules are Nevada Supreme Court rules; they were adopted by the court, Your Honor."
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1996.3,2002.233,"Couldn't the court have adopted the same thing in... in Nevada, put on a gag rule?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2002.233,2004.704,The problem with the gag rule--
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.704,2005.965,Couldn't that have been done?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2005.965,2007.177,--There are several--
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2007.177,2008.206,Yes or no?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2008.206,2015.202,"--In this case, no, because at the time the statements were made, there had not even been an appearance before the judge who was going to try the case."
1990.89-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2023.988,2026.43,This other one is much easier.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2028.252,2035.787,"--Well, the whole purpose, Your Honor, of professional standards is... is to identify conduct that lawyers should hold themselves to."
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.106,2108.032,"Mr. Klonoff, I guess if every lawyer went around saying, I really believe... honest, deep in my soul that my client is innocent, the public might be affected by the lawyer who can't say that."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2108.032,2109.455,Well--
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.455,2113.177,"You know, the press asks him, do you really believe deep down in your soul that your client is innocent?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2115.368,2117.269,"--Well, that's true."
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2117.73,2120.201,"--It would be sort of hard to defend guilty people, wouldn't it?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2120.201,2133.75,"--Well, but there is... the United States against Young has made clear in admonishing both the prosecutor and the defense lawyer in that case that it is misconduct to vouch for your client's innocence if you're the defense lawyer or if you're the prosecutor to say you--"
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2133.75,2134.64,"And that's the reason, isn't it?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2139.945,2140.596,--Absolutely.
1990.89-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2204.517,2215.393,"Mr. Klonoff, is... is the second part of rule 177 typical of State bar rules around the country?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2215.393,2216.474,"It is, Your Honor."
1990.89-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2226.93,2238.488,Which creates sort of a presumption that if the statement relates to credibility of a witness or a guilt or innocence of a defendant in a criminal case?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2238.488,2242.121,--Let me say they're not presumptions in an evidentiary sense.
1990.89-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2248.235,2253.838,Have they been... have they been operated in Nevada as a sort of presumption do you think?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2253.838,2255.548,--Not as an evidentiary presumption.
1990.89-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2270.789,2278.706,And you think that was done here notwithstanding the Nevada Supreme Court's finding that there was no actual prejudice?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2278.706,2279.795,"Oh, absolutely."
1990.89-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2321.582,2328.769,Do you think the case In re Primus speaks at all to the standard we should employ?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2328.769,2335.35,"We think that that the standard, Your Honor, in terms of... of the balancing test... there... there's really two parts to the question."
1990.89-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2344.306,2352.134,"Well, I ask you though about In re Primus which I thought did concern discipline of an attorney."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2354.484,2355.015,"Yes, it did."
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2527.717,2547.89,"Mr. Klonoff, why... I'm not saying that I disagree with part 2 of the rule, but I'm not sure why that part really refers to matters that are... that are ordinarily likely to have the effect of a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2563.26,2567.253,"--Well, the limitation takes you back into... into subsection 1."
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.614,2571.906,"Well, but all section two covers is criminal matters, is that right?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2571.906,2572.737,--No.
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2574.356,2575.047,Does it... does it cover civil as well?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2576.409,2586.915,"--It's a statement referred to in subsection 1 ordinarily is likely to have such an effect when it refers to a civil matter triable to a jury, a criminal matter, or other... any other proceeding that couldn't be dealt an incarceration."
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2587.395,2588.427,I see.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2591.72,2593.63,--We concede--
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2593.63,2597.143,"--pretty much anything unless it's like... likely to influence the judge which it shouldn't, right?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2597.143,2607.569,"--We... we concede in our brief that it would be extraordinarily difficult to violate the rule in the context of a bench trial, because of all the jurisprudence suggesting that judges are thick skinned and that they're different."
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2634.567,2636.527,"Well, let me go back to Justice Souter's hypothetical for a moment then."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2643.523,2647.787,"--Well, we heard that Mr. Tigar's rule does not apply."
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2647.787,2649.036,"No, I mean what is your view of this rule?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2649.036,2650.989,Our rule is that it very well could.
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2651.988,2652.439,And why?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2655.36,2655.961,--Because--
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.961,2657.791,If the jury is... is safe from hearing what's said.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2657.791,2664.136,--Studies have shown that in sequestration situations juries aren't always safe from hearing that sometimes they do get news.
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.288,2669.268,But you would rely on the possibility that the information we get to the jury even in that situation?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2669.268,2670.33,--That would be one theory.
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2673.202,2674.942,That... I really am... that's what I'm really asking.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2677.674,2679.987,"Well, that would be... that would be one... that would be one aspect of it."
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.209,2686.002,"But if that's the theory, why do you even need a substantial likelihood of prejudice to the trial?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2686.002,2687.942,"--Well, the dignity--"
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2687.942,2690.123,Why is it prejudiced to the dignity of the profession and so forth enough?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2690.123,2691.856,"--Well, it doesn't say the trial."
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.848,2698.588,The likelihood of--
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2698.588,2703.122,The likelihood of materially prejudicing a proceeding... of prejudicing the dignity of the proceeding.
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.732,2724.657,--Let me just be sure I understand one of the... does this rule only apply to lawyers who are representing parties to pending litigation?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2729.64,2736.284,"The rule is, as applied in Nevada and as far as we know in all other jurisdictions, only applies to the lawyer involved in the case."
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2760.398,2760.849,Right.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2760.849,2763.981,And the... and the Nevada Bar and the Nevada Supreme Court are not trying to do that.
1990.89-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2769.975,2780.322,"Well, on the question of the dignity of the court, suppose the defense counsel or trial counsel proves it to the jury, to its satisfaction, everything that he's said in the press conference."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2783.044,2784.204,--That does not.
1990.89-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2786.006,2799.995,"Because this is very important... I... I assume you... you would suggest that it's constitutional to have a rule saying that an officer of the court, an attorney in pending litigation cannot say anything which prejudices the dignity of the court."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2799.995,2805.548,"--Well, it would have to be a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing."
1990.89-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2805.548,2809.111,"Well, substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing the dignity of the court."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2809.111,2809.632,Yes.
1990.89-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2810.423,2822.48,And... and would you... and would you conclude that any statement that reveals the testimony that's going to be brought forth in the court offends the dignity of the court?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2822.48,2823.5,"--No, I don't think so."
1990.89-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2824.892,2828.532,"Well, what... what are the instances which you are trying to prohibit?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2832.496,2835.398,"Well, it would have to be in a very extreme situation."
1990.89-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2853.701,2862.866,"So, only in very extreme cases is it appropriate for a bar association to tell the attorney that it cannot comment on the case of the evidence?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2862.866,2866.967,"--No, only on... you're referring to the dignity of the court."
1990.89-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2868.499,2869.611,"Well, I want to know what your rule is."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2889.455,2899.809,"--Well, the primary interest of the bar here, and as we stated in our brief, is affecting, number 1, the outcome of the trial, and number 2, prejudicing the jury venire and requiring sequestration."
1990.89-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2899.809,2902.41,But that sounds just like Mr. Tigar's clear and present danger standard.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2902.41,2902.771,Not at all.
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.698,2956.858,"Mr. Klonoff, I... I'm not sure that the only basis for rules like this is... is prejudicing the outcome, but I must say that I read your rule 177 to be addressed to that."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2962.01,2962.971,Well--
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.971,2971.988,But you're... you're telling us that that language embraces something other than causing the... causing the outcome to be prejudged?
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2971.988,2974.7,"--Yes, it's very important to look at the... the actual--"
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.7,2976.961,And it includes dignity considerations as well.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2976.961,2978.693,--It could in some cases.
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2980.743,2981.375,Certainly didn't read it that way.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2982.964,2984.146,"--Well, the wording is--"
1990.89-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2984.146,2984.857,--You say it goes beyond that.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2984.857,3001.708,"--But the wording of substantial likelihood of material prejudice to an adjudicative proceeding rather that substantial likelihood of prejudice to the outcome is, for example, the type of language that the court uses in its Brady v. Maryland test about whether or not there's been reversible error from a prosecutor's failure to disclose exculpatory evidence."
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3059.124,3064.447,"Well, but he hasn't argued that this... his standard applies to direct communication between the lawyer and individual jurors I don't think."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3064.447,3066.409,"--Jurors in the case, but prospective jurors--"
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3066.409,3068.54,Or even individual prospective jurors I don't think.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3068.54,3070.002,"--Well, if he's saying that, I would submit, Your Honor--"
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3070.002,3070.42,"Well, that's--"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3070.42,3073.964,"--he's deluding the Nebraska Press standard, and that's ultimately the fear that we're concerned about."
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3074.745,3082.128,--May I ask you this question about your influence on the proceeding by requiring a more lengthy voir dire than you would otherwise have to have for example.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3109.156,3113.46,"--Well, you're... you're assuming that the prosecutor and the defense are talking about precisely the same thing which--"
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3113.46,3115.03,"Well, they did in this case."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3116.121,3116.582,--They did not.
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3135.453,3137.356,"--Yes, but the voir dire didn't go into that much detail, did it?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3140.529,3146.371,--This particular voir dire... and we would concede there were... there were I believe 10 juror who had heard about the case.
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3150.563,3151.855,Let me reframe the question.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3159.91,3162.041,"--In this voir dire, it was not."
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3166.364,3167.295,I see.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3167.295,3170.037,But the rule is a substantial likelihood of material prejudice.
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3171.037,3185.896,"And if you go back to your earlier answer to one of my questions about the... his motive is shown by the fact he was trying to counteract the already widespread information about the case, which would seem to indicate that he wasn't requiring any more knowledge in the general community than there already was."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3185.896,3191.402,"--Well, his very admission that he was trying to counteract is not an exception."
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3198.365,3199.146,"No, it isn't that."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3207.922,3208.633,That was the danger--
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3208.633,3215.999,"And if you already needed that extensive voir dire because of what the prosecutor and the police had said, isn't that a response to the concern?"
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3215.999,3216.56,"--Well, that's not a response here."
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3262.108,3272.125,"Would it... would it have violated the rule if you had... say it was a murder case, and the defense lawyer got up to counteract the publicity... highly publicized murder case and said, our defense is going to be alibi."
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3279.472,3282.022,"--No, they... if that's all they said, that would... that would clearly be--"
1990.89-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3282.022,3284.624,It wouldn't have to have the same prejudicial effect we've talked about.
1990.89-1836,1,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,3284.624,3290.749,"--Well, the... number 1, I... we don't think that just that kind of a conclusory statement would have the same prejudicial effect."
1990.89-1836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3390.456,3392.305,"Thank you, Mr. Klonoff."
1990.89-1836,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3394.697,3406.775,"In 1981, the ABA drafts group, as pointed out at footnote 19 of our reply brief, did say that the standard in this rule is equivalent to clear and present danger."
1990.89-1836,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3516.169,3517.919,"Mr. Tigar, the case is submitted."
