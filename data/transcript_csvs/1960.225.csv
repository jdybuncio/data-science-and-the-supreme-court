1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,29.437,33.081,May it please the Court.
1960.225,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,312.144,315.643,"Under subparagraph (4), I suppose a printing press could be seized at the State."
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,315.643,316.361,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.225,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,573.746,577.75,Was the distributing company's premises searched to?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,577.75,577.974,Yes.
1960.225,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,579.347,581.364,What are they -- what do they distribute?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,581.364,585.662,They distribute all types of magazines to the Greater Kansas City area.
1960.225,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,585.662,587.389,Newspapers?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,587.389,591.297,"The record doesn't show whether they distribute newspapers, Your Honor."
1960.225,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,592.18,593.63,(Voice Overlap) -- know the conventional magazine?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,593.63,600.399,"Yes, lifetime -- any -- they distribute salary-composed -- I mean, those were in seized, but they distribute it."
1960.225,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,722.899,727.303,Did your challenge is to the search or to the warrant or the what?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,727.303,734.589,Our -- my -- our challenge is to the -- is number one is to the statute on its face as being unconstitutional.
1960.225,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,762.806,766.104,Does the statute do that --
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,766.104,767.405,The --
1960.225,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,767.405,769.799,"-- on its face, by any terms in the statute?"
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,769.799,774.124,"No, the statute on its face does not do that."
1960.225,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,776.596,782.085,Then what's the matter with the statute on its terms?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,782.085,785.074,"On its face, you have this problem."
1960.225,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,834.128,835.175,Can he?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,847.505,850.606,It -- it's -- it does so state that.
1960.225,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,866.316,873.634,"Well, that's getting into the second question maybe, as to whether there are something wrong with the statute as applied."
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,878.958,884.208,"Well, assuming you had -- let's -- let's go a little backwards."
1960.225,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,980.772,992.161,"Well, you -- you are not raising a search and seizure question as such, you are raising this search and seizure procedure within the context of the whole so-called (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,992.161,993.97,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.225,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1027.51,1029.415,There wasn't a criminal prosecution here.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1029.415,1030.869,"No, there as never a criminal prosecution formed."
1960.225,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1030.869,1032.554,Just a forfeiture proceeding.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1032.554,1034.949,Just a forfeiture proceeding.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1034.949,1039.594,I understood you -- let's see if I understand what it is you're complaining about.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1049.778,1049.965,Yes.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1049.965,1054.508,-- that you are hereon.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1069.295,1072.029,"Well, that's -- that's -- I have to say that's part of it."
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1072.123,1084.286,"Well, then -- well, on its face doesn't mean that we sit here and independently read statutes from Missouri or Idaho or anywhere else."
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1087.317,1087.909,That's right.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1087.909,1090.043,"In other words, the state court leaps the faith."
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1090.043,1090.662,That's right.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1090.662,1093.023,"And we get a leap of faith, don't we?"
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1093.023,1093.462,That's correct.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1093.462,1113.017,What is there in the opinion of the Court -- wherein the opinion of the Court -- as the Court add days for us to crack things which -- which makes the statute read differently than a mere innocent reading without any gloss on it.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1113.017,1113.123,Well --
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1113.123,1114.22,Where -- where is it?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1133.858,1137.078,It doesn't -- I have to say it doesn't specifically say that.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1137.833,1139.525,"Well, how can I find out -- that was I want to know."
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1139.525,1140.43,But -- well -- pardon.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1140.43,1141.206,It doesn't specifically --
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1141.206,1141.617,Alright.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1142.646,1145.872,I can only ascertain these things by the English language.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1145.872,1147.65,That's right.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1152.994,1153.766,Where is that?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1153.766,1158.778,Page 123 of the record.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1158.778,1160.161,What does it say there?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1160.161,1174.714,"Well, in that particular instance, it goes into the description of what may be -- what sort of description is required by a warrant in Missouri."
1960.225,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1174.714,1188.279,"Now, is not the Court there dealing specifically with your attack upon the statute under the constitution and laws of Missouri?"
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1188.279,1192.529,"Well, that wasn't that clear, Your Honor."
1960.225,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1192.529,1192.666,This will --
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1192.666,1192.974,So --
1960.225,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1192.974,1206.255,-- make any attack in the Supreme Court of Missouri until your motion for rehearing under the First Amendment saved on the definition of obscenity.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1206.255,1208.826,"Yes, I'd say we did."
1960.225,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1209.555,1224.636,"Well, the Court didn't treat with the damage you did, did it, on page 121 of the record, the plea with your First Amendment claim with reference to the test of obscenity?"
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1233.365,1234.936,No.
1960.225,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1402.6,1405.151,"Well, whether it's on its face or as applied."
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1405.151,1408.477,(Inaudible) as applied -- actually they lump them together.
1960.225,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1413.859,1417.785,I understand you.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1417.785,1420.0,Now --
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1420.0,1422.315,You haven't answered mine.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1446.391,1448.686,"Well, I hope I can answer."
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1450.015,1452.908,"It was essential to your case, isn't it, your answer?"
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1452.908,1453.683,What?
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1453.683,1455.941,It's essential to your case --
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1455.941,1456.323,Yes.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1456.323,1463.291,-- because the statute comes here later with the meaning put on it by the Missouri Supreme Court.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1463.291,1464.742,Well --
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1464.742,1465.483,Now --
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1465.483,1465.689,"Now, I'd say --"
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1465.689,1474.822,"-- in answer to Justice Whittaker, you indicated that the statute, the mere English of the statute nowhere allows a search at large."
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1484.105,1494.619,"Well, they interpret as the meaning of what is required in a complaint is -- is not putting a gloss, and I think that's putting a gloss --"
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1494.619,1495.359,But where is it?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1500.687,1551.868,"Well, I -- I go back to -- to page 123 of the record in their opinion where they say the -- the -- wipe not the -- the gloss on the -- on the what's required on a complaint is on the bottom of 124 and at the top of 125, where they say that -- that since this Rule 3301 allows the issuance of a search warrant if the officer in his complaint states positively that there is a violation of the statute that -- that sufficient for the purpose of probable cause."
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1551.868,1552.854,Where do I find that?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1554.823,1572.145,"No, here's what, at 124, it says with respect to probable cause, the separate complaints by applications for the search warrant which were sworn to by the lieutenant of the Kansas City Police Department represented the Circuit Court by the police lieutenant and assistant prosecutor of Jackson County."
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1605.745,1607.93,And what's the inadequacy of that?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1607.93,1608.869,Well --
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1608.869,1618.303,"Before -- before that -- before that, 123, they say that it is unreasonable searches."
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1633.326,1634.274,Well --
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1634.274,1639.417,What's the matter with the complaint that says that -- that he swore the fact of his own knowledge.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1640.764,1649.763,"No, the -- our objection is not but he sworn the fact to his own knowledge, our objection is the fact they only swear is that there are obscene publications."
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1654.659,1662.902,"He doesn't -- he doesn't need to append the picture or describe in great detail what the contents of the -- of the materials are, is that it?"
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1665.284,1669.602,Or -- or he can describe -- or he can --
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1669.602,1670.537,"Now, I understand."
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1670.537,1677.061,I think it described them like a volume five of Adam magazine.
1960.225,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1677.061,1678.107,Nearly designative.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1678.107,1678.921,"Yes, designative."
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1679.693,1683.42,"He doesn't give a description that makes it obscene, is that your point?"
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1683.42,1689.79,"Yes, the description -- well, there are two problems."
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1762.383,1781.62,"Is this -- is -- that's -- that is what is authorized to be done here, what was authorized to be done here, allow the officer to go in and examine a lot of literature and then and there determine what is and what is not obscene, is that what the point is?"
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1781.62,1785.224,"Well, the officer actually -- yes, well, I would say that that's -- that's the point."
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1785.224,1786.606,(Voice Overlap) -- goes into a lot of books --
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1786.606,1786.675,That's right.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1786.675,1787.614,-- a lot of pamphlets --
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1787.614,1787.802,That's right.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1787.802,1789.56,-- and he must pick out.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1793.173,1793.229,Yes.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1793.229,1793.782,Is that it?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1793.782,1794.431,That's right.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1794.431,1797.223,"(Voice Overlap) -- at large and he must say ?Yes, this is obscene --"
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1797.223,1797.388,Yes.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1797.388,1797.999,"-- and this isn't."""
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1798.067,1798.701,That's right.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1799.289,1800.581,Is that what the record show?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1800.581,1802.009,"Yes, that's right."
1960.225,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1802.66,1805.212,But the search warrant show it didn't.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1805.212,1807.405,The search warrant also --
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1807.405,1811.679,But I thought the Court said you must designate specifically.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1834.215,1839.809,"Well, they consider the fact when you say there's been a search warrant alleges obscene material."
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1840.087,1844.224,We need at large to find out what isn't -- what isn't obscene among a hundreds of pamphlets.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1844.224,1845.413,Yes.
1960.225,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1848.842,1851.472,"Well, that's what the search warrant provide, wasn't it --"
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1851.472,1852.267,The search warrant --
1960.225,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1852.267,1853.16,-- (Voice Overlap) -- obscene matters?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1853.16,1854.528,"That's right, search warrant --"
1960.225,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1854.528,1856.975,It did not describe any of it at all in any particularity.
1960.225,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1856.975,1858.822,Where is the -- where is the search warrant?
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1858.822,1869.526,"The search warrant is on page two, three and four of the record."

1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1974.936,1975.625,The --
1960.225,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1975.625,1976.336,You didn't raise it.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1979.746,1980.459,"Oh, that's right."
1960.225,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1981.599,1982.145,You didn't raise it.
1960.225,0,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1982.92,1983.144,Yes.
1960.225,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1983.144,1983.789,-- it isn't here.

1960.225,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3983.151,3988.497,And they are not pressing it because of the practical difficulties involved in examining a hundred separate public -- publications.

1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,5889.142,5891.166,"That's right, that's right, Your Honor, in this case."
1960.225,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5976.85,5981.88,"I ought to know, but I don't Mr. Howard, when was this legislative scheme enacted?"
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,5981.88,5982.647,Of Missouri?
1960.225,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5982.647,5983.716,Yes.
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,5983.716,5986.869,"The exact year, I'm not sure, but it's sometime before 1900."
1960.225,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5986.869,5987.811,Before 1900?
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,5987.811,5989.264,"Yes, it's bound on the books a long time, but --"
1960.225,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5989.264,5990.455,It's the same scheme.
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,5990.455,5994.771,"-- but as to obscene literature, as far as I know, it's never been used."
1960.225,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6000.465,6002.765,"In getting more moral, are you?"
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6002.765,6012.237,"Well, there is getting more uproar about this question, and I think there is getting to be a lot more of what is normally called ""obscene literature"" that it used to be."
1960.225,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6016.835,6018.923,"You do have, I suppose, a criminal statutes."
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6018.923,6021.148,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1960.225,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6022.118,6022.537,Yes.
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6022.537,6034.297,"And we have -- in the Becker case, which we were talking about earlier today, was a prosecution under the criminal statute."
1960.225,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6196.374,6216.188,"(Inaudible) that before we ever got to those questions, we've got to find that you came and that the State did come into possession of these things under a lawful warrant gauged by the command of the First Amendment, do we not?"
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6218.204,6218.725,"I think, Your Honor --"
1960.225,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6218.725,6219.205,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6219.205,6230.023,"-- that -- first place, as I have mentioned a minute ago, I submit that this is a lawful warrant subject to the questions and criticisms that has been raised here today."
1960.225,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6274.682,6288.519,"May I ask you, would that be then to determine the validity of the search warrant by the result of its exercise of what you find?"
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6288.519,6293.918,"For you're in an action in rem on the particular item itself, yes, Your Honor."
1960.225,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6328.69,6334.805,"You say that because the product of the search is obvious obscenity, hardcore."
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6334.805,6336.33,"That's right, Your Honor."
1960.225,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6336.33,6343.009,"Oh, wouldn't that be then to judge the validity of the search warrant by the results of the search?"
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6343.009,6344.272,"No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1960.225,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6425.859,6428.725,"But you would -- if you determine the form, you would never reach the latter."
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6428.725,6433.185,"You would not need to reach the latter, and I say it does not follow that the statute is bad."
1960.225,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6440.238,6453.864,"Isn't it true, as a matter of practice, when these officers went out to execute this warrant and they go to the trial jurors, they take some, they fill out of it, just like sorting apples, isn't it?"
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6464.981,6466.215,What controls him?
1960.225,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6478.032,6480.71,I might be at one pile and you in another --
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6480.71,6480.775,"Yes, sir."
1960.225,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6480.775,6483.116,-- and you throw out stuff that I keep.
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6483.116,6485.155,"I think that is quite possible, Your Honor."
1960.225,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6487.187,6494.595,"Now, is that what the law contemplates when it says the warrant shall specifically describe the thing to be seized?"
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6494.595,6502.174,"I think that that count was in it because the difficulty here is not, to my mind, the lack of description."
1960.225,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,6539.668,6543.164,Do you have a special group of obscenity officers?
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6543.164,6545.587,"No, Your Honor."
1960.225,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,6554.915,6561.452,You can never have any of these prosecutions before they could have much experience in seizure of this warrant.
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6561.452,6564.884,"Now, they have had no experience in seizure, so they have had some experience in prosecution."
1960.225,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6564.884,6570.954,I would say from my examination of the box of goods that they used pretty good discretion.
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6570.954,6579.649,"Your Honor, as to the exhibits that are before the Court, I will urge very strongly that those exhibits are obscene without question."
1960.225,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6600.465,6609.344,I -- I notice that some of them included stories by Guy de Maupassant (Inaudible)
1960.225,1,24077,fred_l_howard,,6609.344,6612.008,"I believe there was -- I can't remember, Your Honor."
1960.225,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6672.866,6674.413,Mr. Glazer.
1960.225,2,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,6674.413,6698.386,"Before con -- concluding my argument in view of the questions in the Court, I would ask to leave the file with the clerk the briefs that appellant filed in Missouri Supreme Court so the Court will be able to look and to see what assignments to be made in the briefs if the Court so desires."
1960.225,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6698.386,6701.109,You will leave your briefs about this?
1960.225,2,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,6701.109,6701.735,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.225,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6701.735,6702.111,Yes.
1960.225,2,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,6702.111,6720.841,"Now, just to clear up certain misimpressions that I think appellees' argument might lead to, the Missouri Supreme Court actually did not determine that these magazines were obscene."
