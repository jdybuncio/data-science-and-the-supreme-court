1966.98,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,23.105,"Number 98, Charles Robert Anders, Petitioner, versus California."
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,24.843,27.677,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,304.88,305.661,Now Mr. Heyman you said --
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,305.661,306.181,Yes sir?
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,306.181,312.896,"-- these no-merit letters come obviously in the absence of briefs, but did you say in the absence of any record before the Supreme Court?"
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,312.896,318.067,"No sir, the District Court of Appeals has a full record of the case."
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,318.067,319.45,That's made automatically in California (Voice Overlap) --
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,319.45,320.697,That's made automatically in California.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,320.697,323.472,And the copy provided to each side and to the Court.
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,323.472,324.785,That's correct sir.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,324.785,328.923,And so that the Court does have that record before when it gets.
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,328.923,330.013,Right sir.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,330.013,331.109,There's no merit letter?
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,331.109,331.361,That's right sir.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,331.361,332.21,And that's all it has?
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,332.21,333.186,That's all it has before it sir.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,333.186,334.516,It does know that much about the case --
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,334.516,334.543,Yes.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,334.543,335.486,-- no more no less.
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,337.234,337.803,That's correct sir.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,351.902,354.964,"And this in California is a full record, isn't it?"
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,354.964,355.993,"Yes sir, a very full record."
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,355.993,360.104,"As in -- as you know from state to state, the word record means a variety of different things."
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,360.104,365.034,"Yes sir, I want to be sure that the Court understand this is a very full record."
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,365.034,366.576,Though the transcript of the evidence and the --
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,366.576,367.463,That's right sir.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,367.463,368.21,And so on and everything.
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,368.21,370.714,Yes.
1966.98,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,379.676,380.484,"Well, let's see Mr. Heyman."
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,380.484,380.522,Yes sir.
1966.98,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,380.522,390.093,I suppose as a practical matter that means then the appellate courts simply studies the records to see the victim detect any point of merit?
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,390.093,391.215,Yes sir that's precisely --
1966.98,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,391.215,397.225,But without any help as to what possible points might be argued on behalf of the convicted (Voice Overlap) --
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,397.225,398.126,That is correct sir.
1966.98,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,398.126,399.179,-- is that it?
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,399.179,412.687,It's not dissimilar in my view in any event to the procedure that existed prior to Douglas versus California which this Court rejected in the Douglas versus California case.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,476.953,491.158,"But if in -- under the present practice that was followed in this case which was authorized by the Nash case in California, what does happen after the District Court of Appeal gets this so-called no-merit letter then what happens?"
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,492.29,494.662,It's hard for me to generalize Mr. Justice Stewart.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,510.336,512.02,In this case he did file a pro se brief (Voice Overlap)?
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,512.02,513.048,In this case he did file a pro se --
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.048,514.634,"And a reply brief, if I remember correctly."
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,514.634,517.243,That is correct sir.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,517.243,527.245,"And then did the Court indicate what it did in this case, or has it indicated generally what its practice is to do in this kind of a case?"
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,536.266,539.093,I mean one attorney -- one appointed attorney has been appointed --
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,539.093,539.32,That's correct sir.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,539.32,544.404,He has now withdrawn about -- on the -- upon the representation that he can't find no merit in this case.
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,544.404,545.732,That's correct sir.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,545.732,550.377,"And the -- then the Court notifies the man himself, the petitioner --"
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,550.377,550.897,Yes sir.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,550.897,559.079,"-- of this fact and gives him leave to file a brief if he wants to and this petitioner did do so, and then the state filed a brief and then the petitioner field a reply brief."
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,559.079,560.271,Yes sir.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,560.271,562.974,And then I gather there was no oral argument.
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,562.974,563.614,No oral argument.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,563.614,565.448,Is there a generally oral argument to the (Voice Overlap) --
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,565.448,567.615,I do not believe there is a generally oral argument.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,567.615,568.181,So this was no (Voice Overlap) --
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,568.181,569.194,I'm quite sure there is not --
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,569.194,569.972,-- normal case.
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,574.4,575.371,Yes there is Your Honor.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,575.371,576.398,In paid appeal?
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,576.398,577.195,Yes Your Honor.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,577.195,579.739,Or an indigent appeals when there's a lawyer.
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,579.739,581.478,Yes Your Honor.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,581.478,587.731,"And then -- so here there was no oral argument and the Court wrote an opinion, didn't it?"
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,587.731,588.964,Yes it did Your Honor.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,588.964,597.904,"Did it indicate where, if any, where it got any additional help in developing the issues?"
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,597.904,606.044,"No, it mentioned in that opinion Your Honor that petitioner's attorney had withdrawn indicating that in his view there was no merit to the appeal."
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,627.395,637.549,"The reason I asked is -- one reason I asked these questions, I got the impression somewhere that the Court asks its lawyers on its staff or maybe lawyers with some bar association --"
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,637.549,638.549,Yes sir.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,638.549,640.207,-- or something to give it (Inaudible).
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,640.207,640.482,No.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,693.88,696.401,The Court consists of a panel of three judges?
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,696.401,697.61,That's correct Your Honor.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,697.61,698.684,And this is one of the three?
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,698.684,699.805,That's correct Your Honor.
1966.98,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,699.805,702.072,Who's assigned for this particular case?
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,702.072,703.82,Yes Your Honor.
1966.98,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,703.82,713.034,But as -- I think you said Mr. Heyman the opinion here made reference only to the points raised by the petitioner in his pro se brief?
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,713.034,713.815,That's correct Your Honor.
1966.98,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,713.815,720.243,"He didn't go on to say, “And we also have examined the record to see if we can find any other possible points and we discovered none”."
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,720.243,724.305,I can not -- I just don't recall that Mr. Justice Brennan.
1966.98,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,729.327,732.83,Suppose another lawyer had been appointed?
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,732.83,733.351,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.98,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,733.351,739.066,"And he had made a similar report, what would've been the judge's view here?"
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,739.066,740.692,If he had made a similar report?
1966.98,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,740.692,748.697,"He had reported that he had been appointed, a second lawyer been appointed and he gone over the record and could find nothing to argue."
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,748.697,759.144,"Well, my -- in my view Your Honor is that the system should be so constructed that the lawyer should come forward with the best argument that he can make under the circumstances."
1966.98,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,817.56,822.585,Are there in theory two possibilities here in your point of view?
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,864.891,865.911,That is correct Your Honor.
1966.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,890.055,899.479,So its standard is really just the ordinary appellate standard of just affirming or reversing based on whether they think there's merit in the point.
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,899.479,901.107,That's what I believe Mr. Justice White.
1966.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.631,906.426,At least they don't say points are frivolous.
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,906.426,907.584,That is correct.
1966.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.584,907.586,Then the --
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,907.586,908.59,That is correct.
1966.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.59,912.495,So they think they're good enough to warrant writing an opinion about it.
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,912.495,913.275,Well that's correct.
1966.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,915.581,916.17,That's right.
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,916.17,916.993,We could recognize.
1966.98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,916.993,922.586,"Well I must say though Mr. Heyman, I think I'd be more concerned if the practice, that's why I asked that earlier question"
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,922.586,923.631,Yes sir.
1966.98,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,923.631,933.945,If the practice then is simply to take the points advanced by the untutored petitioner and answer them and say they (Voice Overlap) them.
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,941.986,957.116,"Well Mr. Justice Brennan, I'm pleased that they go -- and I expect they do, that the California Courts go further than the specific intentions that or at least desire to go further than the specific contentions raised by petitioner."
1966.98,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,971.765,977.289,-- a judge has not always have put a lawyer for the petitioner (Voice Overlap) --
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,977.289,978.57,I think that's correct.
1966.98,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,978.57,986.738,Is there any statute or rule that requires him to scrutinize the entire record in such circumstances?
1966.98,0,28572,ira_michael_heyman,,986.738,990.471,Not to my knowledge Your Honor.
1966.98,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1139.407,1143.895,You may.
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1146.103,1149.281,"Honorable Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1966.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.21,1198.11,Can I ask you just (Voice Overlap) --
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1198.11,1198.797,Yes Your Honor.
1966.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1198.797,1200.547,Are there motions for new trial?
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1200.547,1207.212,"There are motions for new trial Your Honor, they are made -- they're not required for the appeal."
1966.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.892,1221.512,"When you say the obligation ends, I take it that a new trial motion is -- aren't required at all."
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1224.214,1227.283,Trial counsel makes the motion for new trial Your Honor.
1966.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1228.022,1230.929,"In appointed cases, do trial counsel ever make to the Court?"
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1230.929,1233.073,"Oh, yes Your Honor, many times."
1966.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.344,1248.177,"But you do know in many cases, the appellate court does know in many cases I suppose from the record what counsel thinks some new trial points are, or the points for recon (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1248.177,1252.227,"No question Your Honor, they get a full record, they get a transcript of all of the proceedings."
1966.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1252.227,1253.428,Was that true in this case?
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1253.428,1254.211,That was true in this case Your Honor.
1966.98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1254.211,1255.511,Was there a motion for new trial?
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1255.511,1259.435,No motion for new trial on my knowledge Your Honor.
1966.98,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1321.043,1325.148,"But by today's procedure, you include the procedure followed in this case or not?"
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1325.148,1331.725,It's been changed to add normal record without even requesting it to include instructions Your Honor.
1966.98,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1464.016,1465.572,They asked his indigency?
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1465.572,1467.492,"Yes Your Honor, that was the only case I know of."
1966.98,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1614.98,1616.431,How much time for that Mr. Roth?
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1616.431,1622.919,Arguments where -- received in the District Court of Appeal a maximum of a half hour aside Your Honor.
1966.98,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1644.95,1650.675,But did I understand Mr. Roth that the largest proportion of all appeals were submitted on the brief in the record?
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1650.675,1652.767,I would say that is true.
1966.98,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1757.634,1758.135,"Now, I would --"
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1758.135,1758.81,Yes Your Honor.
1966.98,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1758.81,1768.01,"Were the -- let's see, I gather you said only about 10% of the no-merit, who are the counsel in (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1768.01,1770.365,"Alright, now I'm going to asked that Your Honor."
1966.98,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1790.284,1791.848,Well you do have it in Los Angeles.
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1791.848,1792.904,Not for appeals Your Honor.
1966.98,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1792.904,1793.215,I see.
1966.98,1,25945,george_j_roth,,1793.215,1794.455,Not for appeals.
1966.98,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1865.784,1868.936,Are these volunteers on some sort of a list available to the Court (Voice Overlap)
