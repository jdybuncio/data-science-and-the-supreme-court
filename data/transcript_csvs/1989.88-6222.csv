1989.88-6222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.567,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-6222, Scott Wayne Blystone against Pennsylvania."
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,13.31,15.521,"Thank you, Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1989.88-6222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.739,184.564,Proof beyond a preponderance or proof by a preponderance?
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,184.564,184.963,--Proof by a preponderance of the evidence.
1989.88-6222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.963,185.433,Thank you.
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,185.433,185.823,Thank you.
1989.88-6222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.722,250.5,"Well, I thought the Pennsylvania law allowed full consideration of relevant mitigating evidence."
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,250.5,251.548,--It does.
1989.88-6222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.702,315.593,"Don't you think that an attorney would argue on the basis of all of the mitigating evidence that came in, including whatever degree of mental impairment there might be?"
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,315.593,329.531,"--Well, it is for a jury to give whatever weight they consider to any particular factor, and it could well be that amongst the 12 they might consider something that would be mitigating which an attorney wouldn't have brought up."
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,383.73,389.904,"Mr. Gettleman, I have some difficulty understanding how this argument relates to the question we granted certiorari to decide."
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,389.904,390.224,--Well--
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,390.224,397.64,Is whether the mandatory feature of the statute requires death when there is one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance is valid.
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,397.64,398.321,--It does--
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,398.321,402.162,And so we are assuming for purpose of decision there are no mitigating circumstances.
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,402.162,402.633,--Right.
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,402.633,404.415,xxx your question.
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,404.415,418.005,"But the argument suggests that because of the limiting nature or the limitations that Pennsylvania puts on the mitigating circumstances, that's the reason why there were no mitigating circumstances in this particular--"
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,418.005,421.817,"Well, that may be true, but I don't see how that is relevant to the question you presented in your certiorari petition."
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,421.817,423.609,"--Okay, well then, let me just go right to that, then."
1989.88-6222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,524.512,536.741,"Well, but Caldwell was at least in part based on the idea that the... there were... wrong statements of law, misleading statements of law made to the jury about their responsibility."
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,548.591,560.14,"Well, only to suggest that in Caldwell this Court spoke about the... the awesome responsibility it... is upon a jury when they decide whether or not to take somebody's life."
1989.88-6222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,591.435,604.724,"Well, your... your argument then is that... that... the jury must always be permitted, no matter what sort of facts it finds, to find in its discretion, whether it's life or death."
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,604.724,605.724,I do.
1989.88-6222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,616.433,618.633,"Well, what has this got to do with reliability?"
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,618.633,630.993,"--Well, reliability in the... in the respect that a jury really doesn't get to consider whether there is an... just because there is an aggravating circumstance, that death is an appropriate sentence."
1989.88-6222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.425,655.228,But... but I... I know Pennsylvania is different from North Carolina.
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,663.684,669.289,"Well, I would only like to suggest, and what I was trying to suggest to Justice Stevens, is simply this."
1989.88-6222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,676.083,678.594,"But that really isn't your question presented, is it?"
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,678.594,685.048,"--Well, only in the respect that you had suggested to me Pennsylvania had already found that there was no... there was no mitigation."
1989.88-6222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.826,712.629,Any mitigating circumstances.
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,712.629,720.243,"--If they didn't find any mitigating circumstances that outweighed aggravating circumstances, the verdict would have to be death."
1989.88-6222,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,747.012,771.809,"So, in your view, I take it, if in Pennsylvania, and I'm not sure that this is the case, the killing of a police officer in the line of duty is an aggravating circumstance, you think the Constitution requires a system in which the jury can find no mitigating circumstances, and then say well, really I don't think killing a police officer is a crime that deserves the death penalty."
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,777.002,784.138,I think it is constitutionally required that the jury can weigh an aggravating circumstance to make a determination--
1989.88-6222,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,784.138,785.808,"Well, what about the case that I put?"
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,802.211,818.221,"--I think the Constitution would require that the jury could look to that single circumstance to make a determination as to whether or not that was strong enough, or the facts that went into killing the police officer were such--"
1989.88-6222,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,818.221,822.803,"Well, the facts are all mitigating circumstances under Section 8 of the Pennsylvania code."
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,833.381,833.782,--Okay.
1989.88-6222,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.782,838.384,--is simply not the kind of crime that calls for the death penalty.
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,838.384,838.724,Yes.
1989.88-6222,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,838.724,839.896,All right.
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,850.635,859.932,"Well, I would only suggest, Justice Kennedy, that different legislatures around the country have addressed that very issue."
1989.88-6222,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,913.086,915.399,Because of the particular case.
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,915.399,922.392,--And because of the aggravating circumstance and the facts that surround the aggravating circumstance.
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.736,963.05,What was the aggravating circumstance in this case?
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,963.05,963.86,Felony murder.
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.86,969.075,"I mean, what... what was the... what was the aggravating, what... what... this was a robbery, was it not?"
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,969.075,970.604,It was a felony murder.
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,972.977,973.588,Was the robbery--
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,973.588,974.508,The robbery.
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,974.508,976.799,--a $13 robbery from the--
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,981.335,985.617,Murder... first degree murder in the course of committing a felony.
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1015.198,1031.26,"Well, they clearly here, as I understand the statute, clearly had to... assuming they didn't find mitigating circumstances, the fact that the defendant, rather than one of the other occupants of the car, stole the $13 from the victim is what not only authorized the death penalty, but actually mandated it."
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,1037.773,1052.454,"No, I think that if he was found guilty of... well, maybe under Enmund he couldn't, but in Pennsylvania... if he had been found guilty of first degree murder, as an accomplice--"
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1052.454,1056.007,But he had... assume he had nothing to do with the robbery of the $13.
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,1057.746,1065.481,"--Well, he could have as a co-conspirator, as a... in other words, because he didn't actually take the money--"
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1065.481,1067.534,Assume he didn't... if somebody didn't even know the 13--
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,1067.534,1068.673,"--No, probably not."
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1068.673,1079.842,"--So, not only probably not, the aggravating circumstance that authorized and also required the death penalty in this case was the fact that he was found guilty of the $13 robbery."
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,1079.842,1080.453,Correct.
1989.88-6222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.453,1091.199,And all the other facts are irrelevant to the... all the other aggravating circumstances are irrelevant to the death... to the penalty determination.
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,1091.199,1094.772,"Right, to the penalty determination, that's correct."
1989.88-6222,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1133.059,1141.054,"I guess I am just repeating what Justice Kennedy suggested, but you're... you're... you're sounding like the opposition in Furman."
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,1150.53,1153.462,But the... but... Justice Scalia--
1989.88-6222,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.462,1156.493,"And here you're saying that that is really what we ought to do, leave it up to the jury."
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,1156.493,1169.353,"--Well, what I would like to suggest is that in the Furman case the reason that they spoke about unbridled discretion, it was because of the broad spectrum of people who were death eligible."
1989.88-6222,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.581,1184.062,That's not what they said.
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,1209.26,1221.251,"--But the problem with that is that that conflicts with the Eighth Amendment requirement that a jury should make a determination that, under the facts and circumstances of the case, it's... this is the appropriate decision."
1989.88-6222,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.138,1259.149,[inaudible]
1989.88-6222,0,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,1259.149,1260.321,I know that.
1989.88-6222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1265.073,1267.024,"Very well, Mr. Gettleman."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1269.898,1279.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-6222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.854,1314.868,"xxx doesn't it, except that they require or allow mitigating evidence to be considered."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1323.594,1333.411,"--The evil, Justice White, in those cases, was that the jury never got to make the individualized determination that they're required by the statute to make."
1989.88-6222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1333.411,1333.851,Well--
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1333.851,1336.404,It was simple finding--
1989.88-6222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1336.404,1344.179,"--they, except for the mitigating evidence side, I don't know why it is different from Woodson."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1344.179,1346.971,"--Well, they... they... the statute in Woodson--"
1989.88-6222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1346.971,1352.797,"Which is a big difference, I agree, but once they find no mitigating evidence, their discretion is at an end."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1354.799,1365.697,"--Well, there are two thresholds that the Pennsylvania statute requires the jury to cross before it finds that this is a death penalty case."
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1437.701,1442.394,"May I ask, do you have a bifurcated system where the penalty hearing is separate from the trial?"
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1442.394,1443.496,"--Yes, Justice Stevens, we do."
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1443.496,1448.38,"And, if... if you had such a hearing... I take it you have the same jury though that hears both."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1448.38,1449.301,"Yes, yes, we do."
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1449.301,1464.011,"If you had a different trier of the fact in the sentencing hearing here, would the evidence... there is some very bad evidence in this case, this is obviously a very mean person... and had no remorse, and that tape recorder thing really makes him to be a pretty bad person."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1473.628,1479.641,"There was, there are two things that are... three things that are required under the valid aggravating circumstance--"
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1479.641,1479.771,I understand.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1479.771,1481.832,--It requires a murder.
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1481.832,1482.323,Right.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1482.323,1483.194,It requires a robbery--
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1483.194,1483.444,Right.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1483.444,1484.706,"--And then in this, the jury must--"
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1484.706,1485.517,And no mitigating circumstance.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1485.517,1487.046,"--Well, that this--"
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.046,1490.198,Say there is no... everybody agrees there is no mitigating circumstance here.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1500.525,1501.627,"--Well, it would not be considered."
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1514.617,1515.859,And it was all put before the jury.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1515.859,1517.679,"It was put before the jury, Your Honor."
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.582,1533.333,"And I take it, if it had been a sentencing hearing as opposed to a trial... I suppose it all went to intent, and I am not suggesting it was improperly received, but if you'd had a test to... you know, a separate hearing on penalty only, that evidence would have been irrelevant, wouldn't it?"
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1533.333,1534.432,--That's correct.
1989.88-6222,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1574.429,1602.138,"Well, in answer to Justice Stevens' question, I... I assume that if the state were trying to show there were no mitigating circumstances, it could introduce much of this evidence, I... i.e., to show that he was not acting under extreme emotional or mental disturbance when he went back and... and told his accomplices in the car that he was going to kill the victim, and... and then discussed it with the victim for a while."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1607.023,1608.485,"It... it... Justice Kennedy, that is correct."
1989.88-6222,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1626.808,1627.058,They could do it in rebuttal.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1640.389,1642.209,The state would show no mitigating... you mean aggravating?
1989.88-6222,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1642.209,1649.466,Does the state... does the state show absence of mitigating circumstances in its case in chief in the sentencing hearing?
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1649.466,1650.284,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
1989.88-6222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1986.215,1996.082,"I think that the verdict of the jury, and the way it was announced in court, was that the jury unanimously found no mitigating evidence."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1996.082,1997.672,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-6222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.521,2021.801,But the... and the verdict here--
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2021.801,2023.243,--And the verdict must be unanimous.
1989.88-6222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.243,2028.246,--But the verdict here was that there was... they unanimously found no mitigating evidence.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2028.246,2028.867,That is correct.
1989.88-6222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2051.164,2057.626,"Well, what would the verdict have said, Mr. Preate, if one juror had found mitigating circumstances and 11 had not?"
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2061.989,2063.792,"--Mr. Chief Justice, it certainly would."
1989.88-6222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2074.559,2075.32,"Okay, we know that, but let's--"
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2075.32,2075.591,Pardon me?
1989.88-6222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2075.591,2076.983,--Aggravating or mitigating?
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2076.983,2080.516,It would have to list the aggravating and spell it out what they found.
1989.88-6222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2080.516,2082.054,But I asked you about the mitigating.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2082.054,2083.558,If they found one mitigating--
1989.88-6222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.558,2087.909,"If one juror found one mitigating, and the other 11 didn't."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2087.909,2088.88,--That's correct.
1989.88-6222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2088.88,2090.982,"Well, how would the verdict read as to that aspect?"
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2090.982,2095.616,"The verdict would read the aggravating outweighed the mitigating, or the mitigating outweighed the aggravating."
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.126,2129.717,There was part of your brief on this subject... part of your brief on this subject puzzled me a little bit.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2144.359,2158.119,"--Certainly, because the... he could have... he could have... could have given effect to that evidence under, for example, (e)(7), the defendant's participation in the act was relatively minor."
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2170.749,2174.2,"So, in your view, a given circumstance can be both aggravating and mitigating at the same time."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2174.2,2175.001,It... it might be.
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2206.034,2212.018,"Even taking out those words, in one of your circumstances, as I remember it, is prior conviction of voluntary manslaughter."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2222.567,2223.449,Certainly.
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2225.071,2231.984,So something the legislature has determined to be an aggravating circumstance that mandates the death penalty then can be considered by the jury to be mitigating.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2231.984,2235.397,"--Certainly can, Your Honor, because he could introduce--"
1989.88-6222,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.397,2239.59,"I'm... I'm not sure, is... is it really the same circumstance?"
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2267.601,2280.03,"--What I was responding to, Justice Scalia, was Justice Stevens' point, that the prior conviction of voluntary manslaughter could be talked about as a mitigating factor under the Pennsylvania statute."
1989.88-6222,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2292.771,2296.802,"It is not a significant history, even though it mandates the death penalty if it's found."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2296.802,2301.226,"Well [inaudible], Justice Stevens, I don't think that it mandates the death penalty."
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.907,2303.209,In the absence of mitigating circumstances.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2303.209,2312.776,"--The jury can consider... consider whether or not the aggravating statute, the aggravating factor has been proven."
1989.88-6222,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2322.643,2329.299,It seems to me that the manslaughter conviction would not be a mitigating factor.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2335.693,2336.104,That is possible.
1989.88-6222,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.104,2337.736,The manslaughter conviction is an aggravating one.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2339.939,2341.659,"Well, that is possible, too, Your Honor."
1989.88-6222,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2410.607,2415.87,"Mr. Attorney General, just a matter of curiosity, how many people are on death row in Pennsylvania?"
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2415.87,2419.322,"--There are 110 at this particular time, Justice Blackmun."
1989.88-6222,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2426.051,2429.183,Have there been any executions up there recently?
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2429.183,2432.145,"Not, the last execution we had was in 1962."
1989.88-6222,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2577.753,2579.785,"And yet you haven't really enforced it, have you?"
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2579.785,2580.466,Pardon me?
1989.88-6222,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2580.466,2583.865,"I say, yet you haven't really enforced it, have you?"
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2583.865,2595.084,"Well, our... our appellate court is required under this statute, Justice Blackmun, required in every death penalty case, to conduct three specific reviews."
1989.88-6222,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2616.449,2623.263,"Of course there are those, I think Mr. Justice Powell among others, who have said if you are going to have a death penalty you ought to enforce it."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2629.809,2634.951,There's those... there are those who will agree with that argument.
1989.88-6222,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2686.837,2688.86,When did this crime take place?
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2688.86,2690.623,This crime took place in 1983.
1989.88-6222,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2692.846,2703.022,So that it... it's comparatively recent compared to a lot of other cases that are pending across the country.
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2703.022,2704.374,"That... that is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-6222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.122,2738.768,"Mr. Attorney, I can't resist saying I think the state is to be commended for not carrying out executions until the constitutionality of the statute has been determined in the first case."
1989.88-6222,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2738.768,2739.449,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.88-6222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2740.55,2742.01,"Thank you, General Preate."
1989.88-6222,2,37915,paul_r_gettleman,,2745.124,2753.412,"My rebuttal will be very brief, Judge... Mr. Chief Justice, and it would only be in response to just a couple of points that the Respondent made."
1989.88-6222,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2933.373,2934.071,"Thank you, Mr. Gettleman."
