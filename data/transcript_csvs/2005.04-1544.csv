2005.04-1544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.82,"We'll hear argument next in 04-1544, Vickie Lynn Marshall v. E. Pierce Marshall."
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,9.247,12.096,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-1544,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,63.353,64.68,Any exception whatever.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,64.68,67.108,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1544,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,79.631,105.001,"So if... if the contention in the... in the bankruptcy proceeding is that the will which has been probated by the State probate court is, in fact, not the true will and that under the true will, the bankruptcy estate would get money, you think the bankruptcy court would... would have jurisdiction to probate the will."
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,105.001,106.845,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1544,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,115.51,116.154,All right.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,130.788,134.82,"--Well, the... the bankruptcy jurisdiction statute states that--"
2005.04-1544,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.82,135.437,Yes or no.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,135.437,150.189,"--The answer is yes, it does, and it must have that power to be able to do so because the bankruptcy jurisdiction statute states that the court has jurisdiction, in rem jurisdiction, exclusive in rem jurisdiction--"
2005.04-1544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,150.189,151.283,What if the rem--
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,151.283,151.877,--over all assets of the--
2005.04-1544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,151.877,155.231,--what if the rem is in another court before the bankruptcy begins?
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,160.857,162.285,"--Yes, yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,185.067,205.721,"So even... even if property is in the custody of another court in the probate proceeding and the bankruptcy proceeding comes later, the bankruptcy proceeding would sweep whatever assets are before the probate court into the bankruptcy."
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,205.721,212.015,"That... that is correct, Your Honor, and there have been courts that have held that with respect--"
2005.04-1544,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,212.015,216.13,"Do you want to stand on this position, Mr. Richland, or do you have a lesser position--"
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,216.13,216.974,"--Well, it's certainly not--"
2005.04-1544,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.974,218.401,--that... that might cause you to win?
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,219.629,226.799,"--Well, it certainly is not necessary, of course, to... to... for us to prevail in this case."
2005.04-1544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,286.447,291.479,"But you did file a challenge to the probate of the will, didn't you, in Texas?"
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,291.479,305.263,"There was a challenge filed to the probate of the will originally by the... the brother of the respondent in this case, and eventually yes, our client did join that some years later after it was first filed."
2005.04-1544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,307.607,316.766,And wasn't the ground for that that it would be inconsistent with the inter vivos trust that you are asserting in the bankruptcy court proceeding?
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,316.766,318.704,"No, that was not the case, Your Honor."
2005.04-1544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,410.849,417.486,"You like this... apparently you like this argument, although you say you're miles away from probate."
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,467.298,483.344,"--Well, of course, if one looks at 1334(c)(2), one sees that Congress itself contemplated that there would bankruptcy jurisdiction under circumstances where there was no diversity jurisdiction and when there was no Federal question jurisdiction."
2005.04-1544,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.628,507.454,"But you could say the same thing about diversity jurisdiction, that Congress contemplated that there would be diversity jurisdiction where there was no bankruptcy jurisdiction and no Federal question jurisdiction."
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,509.314,533.835,"Well, excuse me, Justice Scalia, but what I think it does prove is that when Congress enacted in 1978 the rather comprehensive change that it made to the bankruptcy statutes, that it intended to exercise as broad a jurisdiction as possible so that the bankruptcy courts would be able to control the bankruptcy estate and make determinations as to how the creditors could best be protected."
2005.04-1544,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.273,541.732,I'm just saying no more so than... than when Congress enacted diversity jurisdiction.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,544.837,547.191,To... to apply very broadly according to its terms.
2005.04-1544,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,547.191,547.641,Yes.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,547.641,553.484,"And, of course, this Court in... first in Lear v. Armstrong said, yes, this applies very broadly."
2005.04-1544,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.696,569.23,That's true.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,569.23,602.037,"I do think that it's important, however, to realize that if one examines this Court's probate exception jurisdiction over the years, it has consistently determined that the... the narrowness of that exception must be confirmed, and as late as the Markham case, this Court has held that... that Federal courts have jurisdiction to decide all kinds of issues with respect to wills, all kinds of issues with respect to trusts."
2005.04-1544,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,617.903,621.341,"But none... none of this has to be done for you to win this case, does it?"
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,621.341,622.102,--You are absolutely correct.
2005.04-1544,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,622.102,623.863,Then I... I wish we'd stick to this case.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,623.863,625.207,"Well, I'm happy to do that, Your Honor."
2005.04-1544,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.825,640.586,You want to look moderate.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,640.586,641.236,--Oh--
2005.04-1544,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,641.236,649.4,Does this case involve anything more than the enforcement of an in personam tort judgment if you are to win?
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,649.4,652.338,--It... it would not.
2005.04-1544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,653.515,663.184,"Well, it did involve, at least the bankruptcy court thought, the judgment invalidating the inter vivos trust."
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,667.139,667.639,I... I don't believe--
2005.04-1544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,667.639,668.405,--correct me if I'm wrong about that.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,668.405,670.577,"--That is... that is incorrect, Justice Kennedy."
2005.04-1544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,705.605,707.876,I guess what you're going to hear in 5-10 minutes--
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,707.876,708.46,Yes.
2005.04-1544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,708.46,709.46,--you might as well deal with it now--
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,709.46,709.887,Yes.
2005.04-1544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,710.42,722.15,"--is that the inter vivos... a... a claim for a... the Texas tort of interference with inter vivos gift, according to Texas law, must be brought at the time of the probate proceeding."
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,728.11,731.642,"Well, A... A, we do not interpret Texas law as so providing."
2005.04-1544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,731.642,732.292,All right.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,732.986,733.636,But... but assuming--
2005.04-1544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,733.636,734.763,--suppose they're right about their interpretation.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,734.763,751.291,"--Assuming that they're right for that... by their interpretation, this Court has repeatedly said that it... that a... a State court cannot... by simply assigning matters that otherwise would be heard by Federal courts to the probate court, that it can, in effect, shield those--"
2005.04-1544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,751.291,753.313,And the strongest case for you on that is?
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,753.313,755.173,"--Oh, I think Hess--"
2005.04-1544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,755.173,756.417,You said this Court has repeatedly said.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,757.095,765.993,"--Said it over and over, but Hess v. Reynolds from 1885, which says that merely the convenience of a... a State court to, you know, assign matters to... to its probate court."
2005.04-1544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,767.42,769.958,But... but this case involves a lot more than convenience.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,783.132,786.997,"--But in fact, Chief Justice Roberts, I don't believe that's the case."
2005.04-1544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,828.08,828.496,Mr. Richland--
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,828.496,828.796,"--Excuse me, Justice--"
2005.04-1544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,828.796,844.291,"--what seems to me to be involved here is what is not uncommon in our Federal system, that is, two proceedings, both dealing with the same or closely related subject matter."
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,875.537,887.468,"--Justice Ginsburg, you're quite correct that issues... that... that the principles of preclusion ordinarily would deal with the kinds of issues here, and... and we think that that... those... that should be what governs this case."
2005.04-1544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,899.314,912.921,"Well, I'm... I'm assuming... and correct me if I'm wrong about this... that the bankruptcy court makes a proposed opinion."
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,919.641,922.746,--Unless it's a core matter.
2005.04-1544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,922.746,923.329,Yes.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,923.329,924.19,And here we claim that it is a core matter.
2005.04-1544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,924.19,925.601,"Well, if it isn't a core matter."
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,927.889,934.259,"If it isn't a core matter, then in any event the district court here held that there was no preclusion, and it held it for a number of reasons."
2005.04-1544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,934.259,936.853,But that was not reviewed by the Ninth Circuit.
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,936.853,937.28,That's correct.
2005.04-1544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,941.995,952.315,"That would... that would be the... if you... if you're correct about the limits of the probate exception, that issue would be open for review by the Ninth Circuit."
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,952.315,953.492,"It certainly would, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,957.858,959.035,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-1544,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,959.035,959.879,Thank you.
2005.04-1544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,959.879,966.682,Ms. Maynard.
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,966.682,974.236,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-1544,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1135.521,1138.637,Except if it's a will... will-specific.
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1154.682,1159.897,"I don't believe it does, and perhaps I'm... I'm... I wasn't making clear what my argument is."
2005.04-1544,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1227.343,1233.803,"Ms. Maynard, it's my understanding that a lot of this law developed out of the dicta in the Markham case."
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1239.607,1245.066,"It was probably not a very precise history, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-1544,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.28,1276.062,What do you mean by no jurisdiction to probate a will?
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1299.161,1303.871,The... the United States hasn't taken a position on the broader argument about whether or not the--
2005.04-1544,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1303.871,1308.503,"Well, if that isn't probating a will, the exception for probating a will doesn't... doesn't amount to a hill of beans, does it?"
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1308.503,1310.591,--If... if the question you're asking me is what does it mean to probate a will--
2005.04-1544,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.591,1311.074,Yes.
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1311.074,1324.947,"--the... the probate of a will requires determining that it has the appropriate formal prerequisites, which in most States is appropriate number of signatures that the testator was coherent, competent to make a will and that there was no undue influence."
2005.04-1544,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.947,1328.479,"Well, and that this is... that this is the... the last will and testament and that there is not some other one."
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1328.479,1330.591,"That's true, yes, that there's no competing will."
2005.04-1544,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1330.591,1331.002,Okay.
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1338.982,1339.882,The--
2005.04-1544,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1339.882,1340.826,We don't pretend to probate it.
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1343.264,1358.299,"--It's conceivable that if that determination went to a... an element of, for example, a tort claim and that the person were not... were not seeking to take under the will, it is possible."
2005.04-1544,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1419.625,1431.227,"Ms. Maynard, you said at one point it's not necessary for you to decide this, but there is vast confusion in the lower courts about the extent of the probate exception."
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1442.74,1446.678,"--That's what the United States believes the limit of the exception is, and the... let me be clear."
2005.04-1544,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1467.933,1474.236,"And in addition to Markham, what other case of this Court do you think spells out the proper bounds?"
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1474.236,1481.717,I... I think the... Waterman has a... has a good summary of the... of the limits.
2005.04-1544,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1513.646,1527.915,"We know there are a lot of scholars who think that Markham is the source of most of the confusion, and so that's why I was asking whether you think we should... to clear up, which you're suggesting we should do, we should reexamine some of that dicta or we should just stick to the holding."
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1527.915,1534.041,--I would... I would... you can... it would be helpful to... to clarify what the Court meant in Markham.
2005.04-1544,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1535.645,1536.989,With... with new dicta of our own?
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1537.789,1546.647,"It will probably be necessary, to... to rule on the case, to make some holding about what the scope of the exception is, Your Honor."
2005.04-1544,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1550.597,1552.024,We could just say whatever its scope is it ain't this.
2005.04-1544,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1553.368,1556.89,"--The Court certainly could resolve it that way, Your Honor."
2005.04-1544,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1583.121,1583.865,"Thank you, Ms. Maynard."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1598.055,1601.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-1544,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.696,1631.739,"Well, is it... is it correct... I just want to be sure I follow you... that they determined that the estate plan was invalid?"
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1631.739,1633.0,"--Correct, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-1544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1643.085,1650.306,"But this is all... this has nothing... I mean, I... you have the total differently... different understanding than I do of this case, and I did read Judge Carter's opinion."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1692.971,1700.951,"--Justice Breyer, the answer to your question, I think, depends upon the fact that opposing counsel has studiously avoided actually reviewing what his claim is."
2005.04-1544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1708.099,1708.932,I'm not interested in what he said.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1711.388,1712.054,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1712.054,1717.414,"--because that, it seems to me, is... and what is it that Judge Carter did that was wrong in this respect?"

2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1779.477,1788.97,"Isn't... isn't it the case that she can have her claim and she can prove her claim, but she may not be able to collect the judgment unless the living trust is invalid?"
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1791.658,1810.574,"--Your Honor, as a matter of law, she cannot have her claim because the two cases we rely on, Neill v. Yett and Thompson v. Deloitte, the two Texas cases, establish as a predicate to any tortious interference claim, she must demonstrate that the estate plan, the living trust, was invalid as a matter of Texas law."
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1815.767,1827.947,"Why does she have to show that is invalid as distinct from showing that another trust, favorable to her, was not created and it was not created because of the tortious conduct of your client?"
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1827.947,1842.064,"--Because, Justice Souter, under Texas law when the... the probate court determines the validity of an estate plan, it forecloses, as a matter of law, all expectancies contrary to those that are part of the estate plan."
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1842.064,1845.929,"Well, let me... let me stop you there because this is something I didn't understand in the brief."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1850.627,1851.111,Correct.
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1851.111,1856.847,I take it the Texas probate court determined the validity of a will here.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1856.847,1857.447,Correct.
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1857.447,1861.229,It determined the validity of... of a pourover trust.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1862.64,1864.068,"Yes, Your Honor, it did."
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1864.068,1864.452,All right.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1864.452,1864.996,The living trust.
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1864.996,1865.629,All right.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1881.374,1893.72,"No, Justice Souter, and the reason why is because her cause of action is a State law cause of action, and under Texas law, putting aside the fact that no Texas court has ever recognized a cause of action for tortious interference--"
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1893.72,1896.909,"That's in... you may be right on that, but that's not what... what we're here for."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1896.909,1897.369,--Right.
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1915.308,1934.375,"But when you speak of estate plan, you are... you seem to be talking in global terms; i.e., that there could have been no other disposition of assets by the decedent or on behalf of the decedent except those which the Texas court is recognizing, the trust, the will."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1941.439,1946.815,The Texas courts have conveniently described for us Justice... Justice Souter--
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1946.815,1948.659,"In other words, is it preclusive of everything else?"
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1949.586,1951.864,"--Yes, exactly so, Justice Souter."
2005.04-1544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1977.551,1983.104,"But that... that sounds to me like a matter of preemption, but... but... or not preemption but, you know, res judicata."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2002.254,2003.432,"--Yes, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-1544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2003.432,2004.526,It had all those documents.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2004.526,2005.542,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-1544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2014.6,2022.081,"So why isn't that, as Justice Breyer prefaced his question, an issue of preclusion rather than, as you frame it, an issue of jurisdiction?"
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2022.081,2040.404,"Chief Justice Roberts, the probate exception has always been jurisdictional, and the reason why it can't be subsumed by res judicata or collateral estoppel... we believe we win on those grounds, but the reason why the probate exception can't be subsumed within those doctrines is because it applies even before you have a State court judgment."
2005.04-1544,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2044.753,2045.297,Why should it?
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2081.552,2097.765,"--Justice Ginsburg, the probate exception, like the domestic relations exception, is best conceived as a presumption that when Congress establishes a font of Federal jurisdiction, it does not intend that jurisdiction to be extended to interfere with probate proceedings."
2005.04-1544,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2111.621,2113.132,"Well, you say... you say an... an estate plan."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2126.917,2129.094,"Justice Kennedy, no."
2005.04-1544,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2133.804,2142.701,"Well, there's... there's a further irony here in that revocable trusts are always promoted on the grounds that it keeps us out of probate."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2145.389,2151.276,"Well, Justice Kennedy, the living trust here did two things that a will does."
2005.04-1544,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2169.199,2170.176,But it isn't probated.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2174.891,2180.334,"--But in this case, Justice Scalia, the will and the... the living trust acted together."
2005.04-1544,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2191.503,2206.204,"Well, but as Justice Breyer indicated, can't you just, for purposes of understanding the cause of action as asserted by Vickie Marshall here, just say, we will assume the trust is valid, we will assume the will is valid?"
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2211.086,2218.216,"--Because, Justice Kennedy, again, the critical element of her cause of action is the invalidity of the trust as a matter of fact and law."
2005.04-1544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2218.216,2218.783,Why?
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2266.686,2267.452,"Certainly, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-1544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2302.808,2304.152,"Well, that's just one of the things."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2304.152,2304.819,But it's--
2005.04-1544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2304.819,2310.028,Among other things that went on were they hired private detectives to go after Vickie from the bed.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2329.278,2330.189,"--Of course, Your Honor--"
2005.04-1544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2330.189,2336.148,"And... and so I... but as I read it, there were many, many, many things involved here, and this is just one of them."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2343.546,2353.455,"--Justice Breyer, of course, as an aside, we went to great pains in the Ninth Circuit to demonstrate why all those findings were clearly erroneous and not based on the evidence."
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2384.95,2389.149,"Yes, but her claim is assume it's been made irrevocable."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2391.504,2392.254,Correct.
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2392.254,2394.108,"That's all she's saying, as I understand it."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2405.86,2411.321,"Justice Souter, as a matter of Texas law, she cannot establish a legitimate expectancy."
2005.04-1544,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2429.303,2437.617,"You're arguing a preclusion question, and if the Ninth Circuit thought it had jurisdiction, it could have tested what you say about Texas law."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2453.413,2459.622,"Justice Ginsburg, preclusion will also not work."
2005.04-1544,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2490.879,2494.567,I think it... it may be that there's another side to that story.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2532.628,2535.899,"--No, Justice Ginsburg, the claim was not a compulsory counterclaim."
2005.04-1544,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2562.03,2566.979,"I... I didn't understand the pleading to say if I have a claim, it would be nondischargeable."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2573.622,2577.237,"--Justice Ginsburg, Pierce did not ask the bankruptcy court to decide the claim."
2005.04-1544,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2585.801,2592.438,He would have to say I have a claim because the bankruptcy court is not going to decide a hypothetical if he has a claim.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2595.209,2597.897,"--But bankruptcy judges do that, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1544,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2602.429,2603.857,It has to be a real claim.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2605.712,2611.855,"No, Justice Ginsburg, because the nondischargeability jurisdiction in bankruptcy is unique."
2005.04-1544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2632.259,2640.491,"Counsel, I don't... I don't see how the interference with the probate court that you're articulating is any greater than the interference in Markham."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2651.826,2653.003,"--No, Chief Justice Roberts."
2005.04-1544,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2675.686,2678.207,Was it an estate plan or a will?
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2678.207,2679.301,--In Sutton--
2005.04-1544,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.301,2698.284,"I mean, you... you... you're stretching the probate concept from determining whether the will is valid or invalid and who inherits under the will to also determining what goes into the probate estate, that is, the insurance policies, the trust, and so forth."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2702.733,2708.626,"--Justice Scalia, the probate exception protects the integrity of the succession process."
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2718.101,2720.205,"No, I don't... I don't see your... your logic there."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2729.197,2729.813,--Correct.
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2739.95,2748.097,"If... if there had been a joint bank account, the succession would have been determined based on the validity of the joint bank account, and that certainly wouldn't have fallen within the probate exception."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2748.097,2755.317,"--Because the joint... where you have the equivalent of tenancies in the entirety, I'd say that's a separate issue."
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2774.29,2781.104,Does... does Texas law provide that a... a living trust must be executed and administered with the formalities of a will?
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2781.104,2783.548,"Not quite the same, Justice Souter."
2005.04-1544,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2784.458,2789.501,Then... then you have to get beyond our probate exception cases to cover the living trust.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2789.501,2795.144,"But in Sutton v. English, there was both a will and a trust, exactly the same as here."
2005.04-1544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2811.773,2816.882,"Yes, but she's not... she's not even going after the assets in this case."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2820.847,2834.272,"She is, but that's exactly the same as Broderick's Will, Chief Justice Roberts, an in personam claim against the beneficiaries of the allegedly invalid estate plan to impose a constructive trust on them to get the money."
2005.04-1544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2839.814,2841.242,"I don't think they're going to impose a constructive trust, are they?"
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2842.602,2845.784,But why are they going to say pay her the money?
2005.04-1544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2845.784,2861.402,"They're going to say it because they make a finding that through a whole variety of various devices, all of which were listed, that J. Howard, who wanted to give her money through something called the catchall trust was prevented in about 15 ways."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2897.775,2909.121,"What's not evidentiary, Justice Breyer, is the fact that in order to prove a legitimate expectancy, she must establish that the validated estate plan is in fact invalid."
2005.04-1544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2912.326,2915.758,What's the cite on that that I... that I need for--
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2915.758,2917.518,"Well, in our brief we cite to many, many cases, Your Honor."
2005.04-1544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2920.373,2929.865,"--You're saying you can't bring an inter vivos trust... an inter vivos... interference with an inter vivos gift action in Texas unless you show that a will, for example, is invalid."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2929.865,2937.529,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and those are the Neill v. Yett and the Thompson... Thompson v. Deloitte cases, which I was reading to before."
2005.04-1544,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2950.703,2951.219,But that... but that's res judicata.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2959.017,2962.122,"--Justice Scalia, it is not res judicata for the following reason."
2005.04-1544,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2970.769,2972.874,"You say that, but that case doesn't say that."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2972.874,2974.301,--That case doesn't say that.
2005.04-1544,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.301,2975.562,What... what case do you have that says that?
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2975.562,2987.165,The cases... there is no specific case where someone has tried to litigate a tortious interference claim in Federal court before the probate court has had... has had its say.
2005.04-1544,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3011.257,3020.416,"But the mere fact that you have jurisdiction to say something does not mean that if... if some other court says the same thing first, you won't be bound by that."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3020.416,3027.136,"The problem, though, Justice Scalia, is that the probate court is supposed to make that finding in a judgment good against the world."
2005.04-1544,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3039.898,3054.617,"You... you are suggesting an extraordinary setup with a State court being able to preclude other courts from dealing with related, not identical matters, and that's just not the way our system works."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3072.666,3073.583,--Justice Ginsburg--
2005.04-1544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3073.583,3076.949,The... the only court I've heard of that can do that is the Federal bankruptcy court.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3076.949,3086.774,"--Just as a Federal bankruptcy court is in rem and executes and enters some judgments good against the world with respect to some issues, a probate court does the same thing."
2005.04-1544,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3113.238,3123.74,"That's the definition of an in rem judgment, but she's suing for an in personam judgment an individual, not an estate, just for a plain old money judgment."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3123.74,3136.086,"--But in a race to judgment, Your Honor, if the Federal court gets to decide this critical issue of intent before the probate court, it preempts the probate court from doing its core probate function of validating or invalidating an estate plan."
2005.04-1544,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3139.307,3139.868,Mr. Brunstad--
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3139.868,3141.13,--this is a jurisdictional doctrine.
2005.04-1544,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3142.224,3142.557,--May I ask you two questions?
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3150.288,3163.811,"We argue no, Justice Stevens, because as we argued in the Ninth Circuit, there was not even bankruptcy jurisdiction because the other side never responded to our argument that the outcome of this case would not result in any money going to creditors of her estate."
2005.04-1544,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3163.811,3166.155,So your... you would prevail even if there were no probate exception in your view.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3166.155,3166.916,That's our argument.
2005.04-1544,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3169.354,3184.405,"And my... my second question is I noticed you quoted from a Minnesota Law Review about 250 cases, and the... your opponent pointed out that the... the next sentence of the article said the holdings don't support the generalization."
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3196.235,3198.923,"Justice Stevens, I think that the Sutton case is the closest."
2005.04-1544,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3223.949,3225.126,I'm not asking you to rank them.
2005.04-1544,2,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3234.368,3246.121,"--Justice Stevens, I think that it's... it would be helpful if I could give you a thumbnail sketch breaking down, what I was trying to do earlier, between those where there's impermissible interference and those where there's not impermissible interference."
