2014.13-628,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.568,"We'll hear argument first in Case 13628, Zivotofsky versus Kerry--"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,7.254,12.972,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-628,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,48.664,66.625,Suppose that -- suppose that the President and the Secretary of State put on the passport the place of birth -- I've written it out -- the place of birth on this Jerusalem-born citizen's passport has been listed as Israel at the holder's request.
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,85.687,90.091,"--Yes, Your Honor, they could put that statement on the passport."
2014.13-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,91.357,99.197,"But if -- if -- if -- Congress then passed a law saying that that statement had to come off the passport, could Congress do that?"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,99.197,101.647,"--Yes, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,123.062,123.662,Has that ever happened?
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,123.662,125.514,--Yes.
2014.13-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,125.514,135.136,"In the history of the United States where Congress asked the President to declare that it was not recognizing someone, has Congress ever recognized it?"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,135.136,136.353,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.13-628,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,153.264,173.928,"If you were careful to say at the outset that this is not recognition, the court of appeals decision, I think it was in the Judge Tabor concurrence, said that both parties urge upon us that they -- that the power of recognition is involved here and Congress has done it."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,190.037,194.841,We've provided to the Court alternative options for resolving this issue.
2014.13-628,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,224.694,230.097,"The the -- does -- the provision is part of a section, Section 214."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,264.169,268.306,"Justice Ginsburg, the -- that is correct."
2014.13-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,294.024,294.457,You say that.
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,381.996,384.782,"Two points, Justice Breyer."
2014.13-628,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,397.257,407.63,I want -- and I must interject at this point because you emphasize the Taiwan example and it seems to me it's most distinguishable.
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,427.127,428.627,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,433.014,433.914,"No, no, to go back to my question--"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,433.914,434.397,--But the question--
2014.13-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,434.397,435.747,--which I'd like an answer to.
2014.13-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.003,473.205,China objected to that.
2014.13-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,475.088,475.921,China may have done -- I want an answer to this question--
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,475.921,476.571,"--Yes, that is correct, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,476.571,481.908,--not whether China objected or didn't object or so forth.
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,502.652,507.037,So one last point on Taiwan--
2014.13-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,507.037,507.789,I'd like the first point.
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,509.689,516.829,"--Well, the first -- the first point is that this -- what goes on the passport does not confer the benefits of formal recognition of sovereignty."
2014.13-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,532.089,559.072,"Ms. Lewin, I -- I thought your position was you couldn't care less if the State Department thinks that this is going to interfere with our relations with the Palestinians, that Congress is entitled to do what it is authorized to do under the Constitution, even when that contradicts -- let's assume they can't recognize a country, but they can declare war on a country, can't they--"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,559.072,559.922,Yes.
2014.13-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.922,565.143,--that the State Department has decided to recognize and -- and to be friendly with?
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,565.143,566.16,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.16,566.745,Congress can do that.
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,566.745,567.428,That is correct.
2014.13-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.297,571.214,And you say can do the same here.
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,578.22,579.869,"--Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,580.885,590.943,"If you take that position, which explains it, then what do you think of Justice Story who writes in 1833 that,"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,630.768,631.937,--Justice--
2014.13-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,631.937,638.524,"So he is saying, of course, you have to have one person deciding such a thing, and that has to be the Executive."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,643.495,662.473,"--But that is a rather extreme position, number one, to suggest that the Executive Branch would have not only the authority to recognize a foreign government, but also at the State Department's say-so, that automatically would end the question or any review by any other branch."
2014.13-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,667.443,677.565,"But what -- there is always review with the power of the purse, and there's always review with not appointing an ambassador."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,689.623,703.949,"--There -- well, there is review, and even -- both to respond to Justice Sotomayor and Justice Breyer, Justice Story and William Rawle both recognize that authority of Congress to review."
2014.13-628,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,723.361,731.284,"I suppose -- I suppose you could also say Hamilton in 1787 or whatever it was trumped Storey in 1830, right?"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,737.354,742.841,Hamilton also switched his position before he was in the administration and after he was in the administration.
2014.13-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,748.161,748.661,Ms. Lewin--
2014.13-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,748.661,750.847,"In any case, this is not your main point, is it?"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,787.286,788.472,--That is correct.
2014.13-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,788.472,789.922,You don't claim that this is recognition.
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,789.922,792.357,We do not claim that this is recognition.
2014.13-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,794.542,797.828,"--Ms. Lewin, one factual matter I'd like."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,812.854,819.758,--The initial request was made purely because of a misunderstanding of what the law initially required.
2014.13-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,820.725,821.444,Answer my question.
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,828.28,831.649,--The position was then subsequently taken in litigation.
2014.13-628,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,841.355,843.973,May I ask you another -- another factual question?
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,851.063,852.079,Yes.
2014.13-628,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,852.079,862.787,"And the United States recognizes that as -- as a lawful exercise of Israeli authority, to issue a birth certificate for a child born in Jerusalem?"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,862.787,864.354,"I believe they do, Your Honor."
2014.13-628,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,864.354,875.344,"So what -- this is a question I would ask the Solicitor General, but I don't completely understand what the position of the United States is regarding Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,910.334,912.453,"I do not believe so, Your Honor."
2014.13-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,917.355,927.044,"Ms. Lewin, if I can ask you, if your primary position is that this is not a recognition statute, can we talk a little bit about what it is?"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,937.685,947.457,This statute is a statute that was created to give individuals the right to self-identify as they choose that they were born in Israel.
2014.13-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,947.457,953.528,But the United States Government does not usually give people that right to self-identify in this way.
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1002.027,1022.941,"This statute was rectifying a misguided policy of the State Department which enabled individuals born in Israel proper, whether in Tel Aviv or in Haifa, who were opposed politically to the State of Israel to remove that sovereign, to remove reference to Israel from their passport, but it did not allow the flip."
2014.13-628,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1033.482,1043.854,What about Palestinians who were born in Jerusalem and want to have Palestine as their place of birth?
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1047.99,1054.229,"Correct, Justice Ginsburg, because at that point there was, before 1948, a Palestine."
2014.13-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1057.264,1063.335,"Now, people can -- Palestinians cannot -- American-born Palestinians cannot do that."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1070.755,1079.194,--And that is because this statute was dealing with an existing sovereign that you either remove from the passport or put on the passport.
2014.13-628,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1088.833,1097.656,"If an American citizen is born in Barcelona, Spain, is that citizen allowed, by the State Department, to put Barcelona as place of birth?"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1097.656,1102.81,--If they wish to remove the country of birth and list the smaller entity?
2014.13-628,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1103.227,1110.146,And is that a -- is that a vanity plate for people who believe in Catalan independence?
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1110.146,1117.736,"It is enabling an individual to exercise their choice to self-identify as they choose, yes."
2014.13-628,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1117.736,1124.223,"But, again, your argument -- and you're consistent on this, your first argument is that this is not recognition."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1162.431,1165.05,"Justice Kennedy, you are correct."
2014.13-628,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1181.412,1184.114,But you -- but you say that this isn't recognition.
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1195.752,1204.777,"Well, Your Honor, if it does not amount to recognition, then Congress had the authority to pass this legislation pursuant to its passport authority."
2014.13-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.777,1210.012,I -- I guess there are competing canons here.
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1228.642,1229.742,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-628,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.742,1238.931,"So the State Department says this amounts to recognition, and Congress says whether it does or not, we want -- we want this person to be able to list Israel."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1238.931,1240.031,That is correct.
2014.13-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1248.054,1250.056,"Can I -- can I give you a hypothetical, Ms. Lewin?"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1271.919,1275.537,"Excuse me, this would be a law passed?"
2014.13-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1275.537,1288.781,"This is a law passed by Congress and it says every time a U.S. citizen is born in Jerusalem, the Secretary of State has to send an official letter to every other foreign minister saying that a new American has been born in Israel."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1288.781,1291.299,"Yes, that would be constitutional."
2014.13-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1291.299,1306.576,"That would be constitutional, even though the -- the Congress is basically telling the Secretary of State to engage in a certain kind of diplomatic communication with other foreign countries."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1306.576,1313.579,The description of the law that you provide seems to be very similar to what a passport does.
2014.13-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1320.568,1321.418,"Yes, exactly right."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1365.18,1374.303,But recognizing an individual as an American citizen facilitates the transfer and the movement of American citizens across borders.
2014.13-628,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1399.751,1417.896,"So you would say in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, maybe the letter that's required to be sent to every foreign head of state would be unconstitutional, but that doesn't mean that the passport is, because the passport is used primarily for purposes of identification, and it's only the letter that makes it something else."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1417.896,1420.096,"Correct, Justice Roberts."
2014.13-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1420.096,1420.931,"Well, if you say that--"
2014.13-628,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1420.931,1424.383,Justice Kennedy.
2014.13-628,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1424.383,1431.637,Do you want us to say in our opinion that this is not a political declaration?
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1431.637,1435.874,"This is not a political declaration, that's correct, Justice Kennedy."
2014.13-628,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1435.874,1439.16,"Well, then, I'm not sure why that Congress passed it, then."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1439.16,1453.319,"Congress passed it to give these individuals the right to self-identify as they choose, because individuals in general have that ability on their passport to choose and designate--"
2014.13-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1453.319,1459.137,I thought it was a Federal crime to say that you were born in the United States when you weren't on an official document.
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1484.188,1485.254,--Since 19--
2014.13-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1485.254,1487.573,"I mean, they can self-identify all they want, but can they do that?"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1487.573,1489.408,--Yes.
2014.13-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1501.516,1511.772,"I know what it's done, but has the U.S. recognized -- has any President since 1948 recognized Israel's sovereignty over that area?"
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1511.772,1513.441,"--In a formal sense, no."
2014.13-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1517.093,1525.431,"--Ms. Lewin, may I just I know your time is -- but if I might just go back to the thought that the Chief Justice gave you that you agreed with."
2014.13-628,0,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,1565.492,1578.15,"It is a communication merely to facilitate this transfer of individuals as American citizens, not to make public statements about where they were born or where they're from or what countries the United States recognizes."
2014.13-628,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1579.85,1580.502,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1587.839,1590.124,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1616.591,1620.143,What -- what if there were a law that said precisely pretty much what you just said?
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1636.253,1640.374,I think there would be limits to Congress's ability to do that.
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1648.06,1650.646,So -- so that law would be unconstitutional?
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1650.646,1653.631,"To the extent it said for all purposes, yes, because--"
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1653.631,1656.233,"Well, isn't that exactly what the Taiwan Relations Act says?"
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1664.256,1665.941,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice, that's quite different."
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1676.83,1687.021,"Well, let's say the President -- let's say the President did not want to recognize Taiwan and Congress passes a law that says for every purpose under American law, we will treat Taiwan as if it had been recognized?"
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1687.021,1698.762,"That might raise a serious Constitution question, but that isn't the situation that was -- it wasn't the case when it was enacted, it's not the case now, and it's -- and it's different from the current situation."
2014.13-628,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1712.153,1713.089,But is that really true?
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1734.518,1749.262,"I -- I think that that -- that in a situation like that, the Court ought to defer to the Executive Branch's judgment that the place of birth listing can have significant diplomatic consequences."
2014.13-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.955,1776.262,"If it -- if it is within Congress's -- if it is within Congress's power, what difference does it make whether it antagonizes foreign countries?"
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1776.262,1783.935,"--Well, there are certain things that are within Congress's power that would antagonize foreign countries that wouldn't raise a separation of powers problem, of course, like a trade embargo or a travel ban."
2014.13-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.218,1784.968,And this may be one of them.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1785.318,1786.135,--This is not one of them.
2014.13-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.135,1789.503,--the mere fact that it upsets foreign relations doesn't prove a thing.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1789.503,1789.839,No.
2014.13-628,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1814.137,1820.874,But why couldn't you have a disclaimer of the kind that I've explained to the Petitioners' counsel.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1830.48,1831.832,Your Honor--
2014.13-628,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1831.832,1832.848,Why wouldn't that solve the problem?
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1832.848,1838.236,--It doesn't solve the problem because the issuance of the disclaimer is a credibility hit.
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1857.98,1861.851,"If it had -- if it were such a big deal, why did the Chief Executive at the time sign it?"
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1861.851,1868.438,"Well, the Chief Executive issued a signing statement which really was, in effect, a disclaimer, in 2002."
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1879.913,1892.653,"So we should give no weight to the fact that the Chief Executive signed the law that he is now saying has such a dramatic that his successor, but I gather the position is the same -- is now saying has such deleterious effects on American foreign policy?"
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1896.188,1896.672,--No.
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1907.728,1908.078,"Oh, no."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1917.502,1920.621,I don't think that I think the credibility of the assertion is proven by history.
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1950.223,1954.192,But that's partly because the Executive Branch made such a big deal out of it.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1963.381,1964.9,"--With all due respect, Your Honor--"
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1964.9,1969.952,"--nothing to see here, move on, and we're proving that by going ahead and signing it."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1978.557,1991.031,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice, with all due respect, I think on this question that you're asking me, this is a place where the Court should accord deference to the judgments of the Executive Branch and the State Department, in particular."
2014.13-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2004.106,2004.573,Not necessarily.
2014.13-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2004.573,2008.993,What they're asking you to do is to look -- they're asking the government to lie.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2008.993,2010.71,I think that--
2014.13-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2010.71,2017.848,I'm not that's exactly what you're saying the government should the executive department should not do.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2017.848,2027.988,--I do think the problem here is that the executive made a considered judgment in 2002 that this couldn't sensibly be handled that way.
2014.13-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2028.421,2028.921,So how are we--
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2028.921,2034.892,"What if it just says “ Disputed ”, parentheses after it, “ Disputed ”?"
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2038.277,2038.927,"--Well, I don't know."
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2053.353,2055.738,"Well, it's disputed as a matter of the government of the United States."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2069.146,2081.123,"--Well, there's a dispute certainly among the parties of the region, but I think the whole premise of Petitioner's argument here is that within the government of the United States there isn't a dispute over the recognition issue."
2014.13-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2081.123,2083.456,--Can you help me with this same question?
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2162.975,2170.113,"I do think this Court, the last time the case was here, said that ultimately it was up to the Court to judge the constitutionality of the statute."
2014.13-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2190.594,2202.485,"General Verrilli, if we agree with the Petitioner, we do not have to confront the constitutional question whether the President has exclusive power over recognition."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2209.506,2214.459,"Well, let me I'm delighted to talk about it, but before I do, let me actually address that."
2014.13-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.688,2273.331,"But if it does, then their argument is going to be it does amount to a -- if it does contradict it, then Congress is making its own judgment about recognition."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2278.25,2279.818,"--Well, I'm happy to address it."
2014.13-628,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2286.406,2292.66,"Couldn't you say that, at a minimum, the Petitioner has conceded that it is not clear that this is recognition?"
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2292.66,2307.167,"Yes, that's certainly the case and, therefore, we take as a given that the President's position on recognition, which is the same as the position every President going back to Truman, is the official position of the United States and the executive is being forced to issue diplomatic communications that contradict it."
2014.13-628,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2307.167,2314.673,"General Verrilli, it is -- the requirement of place of birth on the passport, that doesn't come from the Congress."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2316.441,2317.558,That's correct.
2014.13-628,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2319.31,2340.823,"And I thought that the purpose of birthplace identified by the government, by the executive, is to identify the person and not it's not something that the President or the executive required out of a foreign policy concern."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2345.542,2347.244,"Yes, that is its primary purpose."
2014.13-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2381.467,2387.121,This is a pretty rough way to identify someone.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2392.773,2416.906,"--That's true, Justice Sotomayor, but, you know -- and this question about whether place of birth designations are necessary on passports is actually one that Congress asked the Comptroller General to study back several decades ago and there were a series of studies made, and the conclusion of those studies, which you can find in the current version of the Foreign Affairs Manual, not the one in the joint appendix, but the one on the State Department's web site, is that you really have to have them for two reasons."
2014.13-628,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2436.385,2438.654,Can I ask you the question I asked Ms. Lewin.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2456.116,2463.119,"The position of the executive is that we recognize, as a practical matter, the authority of Israel over West Jerusalem."
2014.13-628,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2481.031,2484.149,"Well, it must have been accepted as evidence of birth or the passport would never have been issued."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2484.149,2487.185,"--Well, we do have the consular notification of birth."
2014.13-628,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2487.185,2488.901,I thought you had to provide a birth certificate--
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2488.901,2489.301,Right.
2014.13-628,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2489.301,2489.887,--in order to get that.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2489.887,2490.47,"Well, that's right."
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2519.07,2537.201,"Let's say there's a -- that passports are printed in Country A, not the United States, and there's a printing plant there, and Congress passes a law saying, no, you must have the passports printed in Country B because we don't think you should recognize Country A."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2540.319,2543.021,"Well, I'm trying try to give you a precise answer to that."
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2551.708,2555.512,Because Congress wished the President would not recognize Country A.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2562.083,2569.42,"--That would be a harder case than this one, I think, because it doesn't as clearly implicate the President's ability to give effect to recognition power."
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2577.026,2584.012,I thought your position was that the President has the exclusive right to decide what interferes with his recognition power.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2584.012,2601.308,"No, I think that the President has the right to give effect to his recognition power, and Congress cannot try to command the Executive Branch to act in a manner itself that contradicts the President's recognition decision because that prevents the President from giving effect to that decision."
2014.13-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2618.803,2621.888,"War making is an executive function, too."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2621.888,2638.749,"--But with respect to -- with respect to the executive functions around recognition, when Congress wanted the -- excuse me, when the framers wanted the Congress to play a role and the Constitution envisions a role for the framers in those executive functions, it's prescribed."
2014.13-628,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2655.878,2689.432,"If I think that that Congress generally -- that Congress has the authority under the Constitution to require identification information in passports and to specify the identification information that's included, if I -- if I believe that, then the effect of your argument, I guess, is that something that Congress can do is unconstitutional if it affects the recognition power -- the President's recognition authority in -- in some way."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2690.432,2691.801,"No, our position is narrower."
2014.13-628,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2721.07,2723.689,"I don't -- I don't like to, you know, just keep going back to the same thing."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2745.518,2756.993,"--I appreciate the appeal of that idea, Justice Kennedy, but the problem with it is that the need to make that statement doesn't further the diplomatic interest of the United States--"
2014.13-628,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2756.993,2759.178,"Ms. Lewin answered, I think quite candidly--"
2014.13-628,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2759.178,2760.595,But it doesn't further -- why doesn't it further it?
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2760.595,2769.634,--Because the very need to make the statement calls the credibility of the President's representation of our recognition position into question.
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2770.134,2771.453,But just like the signing statement.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2771.453,2773.522,"--Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2773.522,2779.609,"Just like the signing statement, which said precisely what Justice Kennedy suggested, that the Executive could do at this point."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2779.609,2780.109,Right.
2014.13-628,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2791.566,2801.872,"--General Verrilli, I think the answer to the question that Ms. Lewin gave was that she said yes, the Executive could put that on the passport."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2822.369,2830.041,"And I do think that's the necessary implication of the Petitioner's argument here, not only that Congress could forbid a disclaimer, but Congress could require that the--"
2014.13-628,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2830.041,2831.374,But that law isn't in front of us.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2831.374,2852.038,"--But -- but were the -- were the Court to uphold the constitutionality of the law that is in front of you, it seems to me the necessary implication of that would be that Congress could prevent a disclaimer, it could require not just that Israel be listed but Jerusalem, Israel be listed on -- on a country of birth, and it seems to me that those are very serious interferences with the President's--"
2014.13-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2852.038,2870.266,"General, if I'm understanding your narrow holding, just so that we can underscore it, what you're saying is that Congress can't compel speech by the President with respect to foreign relations."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2870.266,2884.359,"--I would put it a little more narrowly, Your Honor, that Congress cannot compel the Executive to issue diplomatic communications that contradict the official position of the United States on a matter of recognition."
2014.13-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.395,2892.799,"Well, you see, I -- I pick up this passport, and it says place of birth, Israel."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2899.536,2900.371,"No, you don't."
2014.13-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2900.688,2908.891,So how does it -- how does it advertise to the world that -- that the President is contradicting himself?
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2912.945,2927.705,"--The world knows that we will issue thousands of passports to people born in Jerusalem identifying them as born in Israel, and the world knows that we will be doing that because the Congress of the United States required it."
2014.13-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.538,2933.526,"But it is not a communication contained in the passport itself, is it?"
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2954.855,2962.543,--You're requiring the President to make statements thousands of times that contradict the official recognition position of the United States.
2014.13-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2991.895,3003.786,"General, in general, when I travel abroad and come back to the United States or when I go to a foreign country and they're stamping my passport, do they have forms that require you to identify the city?"
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3003.786,3006.572,"I'm not aware that they do, Your Honor."
2014.13-628,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3010.859,3013.978,I know that some of them do.
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3013.978,3015.261,"Well, they may well, Your Honor."
2014.13-628,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3121.263,3122.449,--Why would that be so?
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3160.572,3163.357,--I've got -- I've got at least two points to make about that if I could.
2014.13-628,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3187.558,3192.126,"But Congress did that, so nothing that we do is going to change that or change what Congress thought."
2014.13-628,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3192.126,3195.578,"--I think that's, with all due respect, too easy an assumption, Your Honor."
2014.13-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3289.273,3290.757,"Thank you, General."
2014.13-628,2,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,3293.159,3297.211,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2014.13-628,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3312.722,3313.288,"No, it's not."
2014.13-628,2,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,3319.809,3320.226,--Yes.
2014.13-628,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3335.336,3339.623,And there was a waiver -- and there was a waiver provided and every President has exercised the waiver.
2014.13-628,2,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,3339.623,3344.192,"--So this would be, though, recognizing, as was said before, that there is a disagreement, but not--"
2014.13-628,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3344.192,3345.544,How could you tell me it's not a lie?
2014.13-628,2,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,3361.053,3364.505,--But the speech is the speech of the individual who has self-identified.
2014.13-628,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3364.505,3366.19,But the individual is not the one issuing the passport.
2014.13-628,2,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,3373.111,3377.748,"But we are permitting that speech when it comes to West Bank, Gaza Strip, a host of others."
2014.13-628,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3379.881,3389.387,"I take it, Ms. Lewin, when you say the West Bank, I take it you think that Congress could pass the identical statute with respect to a child born in Hebron, say."
2014.13-628,2,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,3389.387,3392.306,Saying that--
2014.13-628,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3392.306,3392.991,"That that, too, is Israel?"
2014.13-628,2,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,3392.991,3394.008,--Correct.
2014.13-628,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3394.008,3394.591,Yes.
2014.13-628,2,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,3395.008,3415.038,"We are providing two alternative arguments, Justice Kagan: One saying that this is does not amount to recognition; or if the Court decides to reach the separation of powers question and views this as somehow implicating the recognition clause, that at this point the law passed by Congress would trump the President."
2014.13-628,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3492.704,3496.242,"Can I say that this seems a particularly unfortunate week to be making this kind of,"
2014.13-628,2,56101,alyza_d_lewin,,3518.255,3533.115,"--Well, the -- it is a sensitive issue, but to suggest that what will go on a passport as a place of birth is going to implicate or make it worse, there's no evidence of that."
2014.13-628,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3533.881,3534.631,"Thank you, counsel."
