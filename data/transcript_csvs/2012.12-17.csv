2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.32,"We'll hear argument this morning first in Case 12-17, McBurney v. Young."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,7.57,9.022,"Thank you, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,31.369,34.737,"When -- when was the first of those laws enacted, do you know?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,43.843,44.276,--That's right.
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,44.476,45.209,In the '60s.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,45.209,48.045,--In the '60s and the early '70s.
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,52.699,61.887,"And you say that's a fundamental -- that's a fundamental right covered by a Privileges and Immunities Clause, which nobody had until the 1960s."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,61.887,76.564,"--Well, to be clear, the modern transparency laws are new, but they sit on top of well-established common law rights to access that are based not on modern notions of transparency but on the right to secure property and other basic interests--"
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,76.564,78.714,"But those -- those rights still exist in this State, don't they?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,85.618,101.377,"--Well, it's true that -- that Virginia's law exempts deeds from its Freedom of Information law, but if I understand their position correctly, they would be entitled as a constitutional matter under their theory to preclude people from other States from accessing even deeds."
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,101.377,106.464,"Well, I'll ask him -- I didn't understand that to be their position, but -- but I guess we can ask them."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,106.464,110.749,"My client, Mr. Hurlbert, is in the business of gathering property records for his clients."
2012.12-17,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,125.359,130.412,Can you -- can you explain that business a little more fully than you did in the briefs?
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,135.697,136.483,That's right.
2012.12-17,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,136.483,143.22,And he -- and he does that for a client who could very well ask himself.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,145.839,148.874,"Well, he -- you know, he doesn't just do the routine request."
2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,179.326,182.862,"All -- all he has to do is get somebody from -- from Virginia to ask for him, right?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,182.862,188.682,"Well, he could hire someone from Virginia to do that, but that's -- you know, that's sort of precisely what the--"
2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,188.682,192.736,"Well, but you don't have to pay the person too much, he just has to write a letter saying give me these documents, right?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,192.736,196.355,"--He would still have to hire someone, and that would be an increased cost."
2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,196.922,201.676,"Well, an increased cost of -- I don't know how much -- 100 bucks, right?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,206.644,207.18,--Yeah.
2012.12-17,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,238.765,243.853,How much -- how much of an impact in fact does it have on his business?
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,247.121,254.81,"Well, for him, in the Virginia market, it completely forecloses him from doing access -- business in the Virginia market."
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,280.878,301.624,"Mr. Gupta, I -- I understand that the -- the reasoning of Virginia in not allowing out of State people to -- to get these FOIA requests is the following: That the purpose of these -- these laws -- and I remember it when the first ones were enacted -- government in the sunshine."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,334.012,336.145,"--A few responses, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.855,352.824,But -- but you don't need any personal or property interest under these laws.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,374.387,382.426,"--Even -- even at the time that these laws were enacted in the -- in the '60s, it was well-understood that they were going to have a big commercial impact."
2012.12-17,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,386.897,394.301,"But the point is that FOIA is tied to, as Justice Scalia said, the citizens should know what their government is doing."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,424.82,425.272,Right.
2012.12-17,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,464.747,471.817,And is the only thing that's necessary -- excuse me -- is the only thing that's necessary that the law affect a few people commercially?
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,480.823,489.279,"--Well, what this Court has said is that there is no de minimis exception if there's discrimination against commerce, but here, what's going on is anything but de minimis."
2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,518.282,521.484,But this is not -- this is not a regulation of commerce.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,533.458,542.397,"But that's -- that was the Fourth Circuit's theory and I think incidental can mean a few different things, and I think in -- in their opinion, it -- it does mean at least three different things."
2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,600.65,617.128,"What if the State of Virginia says, as a policy, we want to help Virginia businesses and so we're going to open a business training, best practices institute where you're going to learn how to be a better business person, but the only people who can come in are -- are Virginia businesses."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,617.128,617.544,Right.
2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,617.544,626.384,"Under your theory, because that will have an effect, an incidental effect on commerce in a way that's discriminatory, is -- is that unconstitutional?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,626.384,627.367,I don't think so.
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,649.333,655.237,"But that -- that just goes to the extent of the impact, not -- not on the principle."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,666.009,667.294,"--Well, maybe I didn't explain it very well."
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,685.506,686.589,So what?
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,697.647,698.547,Well--
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,698.547,699.864,And -- and you dismiss that relevance.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,704.484,713.339,"--Well, to the extent that you -- you think it does matter, I mean, that -- that distinction doesn't matter in this case because the impact is -- is great."
2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,718.643,724.297,"Is that -- when you're talking about impact, is that a Pike analysis?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,724.297,725.281,--No.
2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,733.42,736.539,"Well, I thought if it was facial discrimination, you're not concerned about impact."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,736.539,737.439,--That's right.
2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,737.755,743.509,"I thought a question of talking about the effects on interstate commerce, that's the, you know, the Pike analysis."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,743.509,743.959,No.
2012.12-17,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,760.637,768.41,What's your closest case in support of the proposition that this is impermissible as a discrimination against interstate commerce?
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,769.326,775.747,"When you say “ this ”, you mean the -- that public records access is commerce?"
2012.12-17,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,775.747,788.121,"If -- if you -- you are arguing, as one of your arguments here, that this is discriminatory as to -- as to interstate commerce, as I understand your argument, what is the best case you have to support your position?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,789.239,797.679,"Well, I think if you're -- if you're -- if the question is about whether or not records access is commerce, there's Reno v. Condon this Court's unanimous--"
2012.12-17,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,797.679,800.279,"Well, my question is what's the best case you have for your argument?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,800.279,811.92,"--Well, I think, you know, this Court's unanimous decision in Reno v. Condon held that because people buy public records and sell them in interstate commerce, that's indisputably interstate commerce."
2012.12-17,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,813.189,814.589,But that wasn't a discrimination.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,815.322,815.641,--That's right.
2012.12-17,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,815.641,818.426,--That's just -- that goes to the question whether or not this is commerce.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,818.426,819.376,That -- that's right.
2012.12-17,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,819.376,825.08,What is your best case to show that this is discriminatory in violation of our precedence?
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,825.08,832.816,"Well, Virginia doesn't deny that there's discrimination on its face, so I take your question to be asking, you know, what about the commerce aspect."
2012.12-17,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,834.352,836.47,"If I have to write the opinion, what case do I put down?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,836.97,837.937,"--Yeah, I mean, you -- okay."
2012.12-17,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.278,849.895,If I only have time to read one case--
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,849.895,850.295,--Yeah.
2012.12-17,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,850.295,853.33,"--or possibly two, which would you like me to read?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,855.449,855.899,Yeah.
2012.12-17,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,859.801,860.086,Okay.
2012.12-17,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,860.503,861.386,That's why you're here.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,861.386,862.169,--So right.
2012.12-17,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,896.259,897.442,--Look at those.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,911.369,911.852,--Right.
2012.12-17,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,911.852,915.138,"Now, it's pretty hard for me to put this case into that mold."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,915.138,921.307,"Well, I mean, one -- you know, one piece of evidence, Justice Breyer, is the media exception to the Virginia statute."
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.932,933.199,"Just Virginia media, though, isn't it?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,934.717,936.753,"--That's right, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,936.753,938.886,--exists or is broadcast into Virginia?
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,938.886,939.955,That's right.
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.538,948.125,"So that's consistent with their purpose that this statute is meant to assure good, honest government in Virginia."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,948.125,952.596,"--Well, if this is a statute, it's a pretty unusual statute that discriminates among newspapers."
2012.12-17,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,953.013,969.89,"If it does what the -- I had exactly the same question for both parts of your argument, that, what it's their -- am I right in thinking that anyone can get any information -- anyone in any State can get any information that pertains to him or her?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,973.026,974.542,--There is a separate Virginia--
2012.12-17,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,974.542,975.294,Is that right or not?
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,975.294,975.928,--Yes.
2012.12-17,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,977.794,978.496,Okay.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,979.013,979.546,That's right.
2012.12-17,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,979.546,984.567,Anyone from Alaska to Hawaii can get any information that pertains to him or her.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,991.638,992.554,That's correct.
2012.12-17,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,992.554,993.09,Okay.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1023.525,1024.009,Uh-huh.
2012.12-17,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1024.009,1034.417,"Now, if that's the interest, that's an interest that probably a State has the right, just as it has the right to say other people can't vote in State elections."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1047.241,1047.791,Sure.
2012.12-17,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1072.523,1085.35,"But if it costs for Virginia -- Virginia has to take care of its own, and if it has to service FOIA requests from all over, it's going to cost the State."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1098.49,1106.513,"But -- but there's no loss in resources, Justice Ginsburg, because the statute allows Virginia to fully recoup any administrative expenses."
2012.12-17,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1106.513,1107.979,"Counsel, I'm having--"
2012.12-17,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.979,1113.35,But they -- but they just don't want out -- they -- they don't want outlanders mucking around in -- in Virginia government.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1121.373,1122.523,Yeah.
2012.12-17,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1134.865,1151.725,"--Counsel, I'm -- I -- there is underlying your argument a sort of fundamental belief that you are entitled to relief -- pardon the alliteration simply because the statute discriminates between citizens and noncitizens."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1153.244,1154.327,"No, not at all."
2012.12-17,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1154.844,1162.933,"So if it's not, what are the two rights that you -- or what rights are it that you're claiming have been violated?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1166.702,1171.289,--It's the privilege or immunity of pursuing a common calling across State borders.
2012.12-17,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1181.811,1185.013,So is this an as-applied challenge to the--
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1185.013,1185.363,That's right.
2012.12-17,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1185.363,1185.715,--All right.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1185.715,1186.231,That's right.
2012.12-17,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1186.231,1187.365,So this is an as-applied challenge.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1187.365,1188.115,Yes.
2012.12-17,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1203.859,1212.198,"Then you would be doing something very strange with this statute, because you would be saying Hurlbert has a right to this because it's his business."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1239.515,1240.181,--Right.
2012.12-17,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1248.704,1261.612,"I -- I'm having a problem, and then I think it's Justice Ginsburg's problem, which is absent the statute, he can't demand that Virginia provide him with this information because that's how he wants to work, correct?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1271.134,1278.638,"--Well, he's -- all he's asking for is information that's available in the public archives on equal terms with Virginians."
2012.12-17,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1281.507,1288.345,"He -- he has a very reasonable request in my view, but the question isn't the reasonableness of his request."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1336.66,1337.31,--No.
2012.12-17,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1337.31,1339.778,--and -- and they either do have the right or they don't.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1345.266,1345.799,Right.
2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1396.449,1400.603,Is this -- is this your Privileges and Immunities argument or your dormant Commerce Clause argument?
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1400.603,1408.006,"--You know, I think the logic of both arguments are similar, but I think it most clearly is illustrated in the Privileges and Immunities context where--"
2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1408.006,1410.874,So then it's not enough that this is a big deal to your client.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1427.253,1430.288,"--I don't think it's a stretch at all, Justice -- Chief Justice."
2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1441.294,1442.43,"No, but see, they're just to get into those."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1452.785,1452.985,"--No, no."
2012.12-17,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1501.699,1505.836,I'm still trying to tease out what your claim is.
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1521.445,1525.833,"I think that would be a closer question, but I think that presents some problems as well."
2012.12-17,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1544.395,1546.58,Why isn't it just -- you just being costs them more?
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1546.58,1547.03,Right.
2012.12-17,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1547.03,1553.817,"That was Justice Ginsburg's point, which is every time you've put in a request, you're costing them more money."
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1553.817,1554.133,Right.
2012.12-17,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1559.654,1560.354,"Well, why?"
2012.12-17,0,20895,deepak_gupta,,1561.07,1561.672,--Right.
2012.12-17,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1595.393,1595.977,"--Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1600.464,1604.249,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-17,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1606.285,1612.772,I'm not sure how you save administrative costs under this statute.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1634.703,1654.432,"--I would suggest that the purpose of the statute, which is political, not commercial, left the State with the position that it was going to subsidize with tax dollars this function because we can't recover our overhead; we can over -- only recover the actual cost."
2012.12-17,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1654.432,1662.872,So you want to give more businesses to Virginia citizens who will now charge out-of-State residents money to process their FOIA requests?
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1662.872,1664.205,"No, Your Honor."
2012.12-17,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1747.894,1757.333,"So if I understood your answer to Justice Sotomayor, the only reason you don't let out-of-staters get these records is because of the added overhead costs?"
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1757.333,1758.283,"No, Your Honor."
2012.12-17,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1763.437,1763.837,"Well, I know."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1801.695,1811.901,--The -- we are here to defend the decisions of the two lower courts that apply existing doctrine.
2012.12-17,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1818.657,1822.209,That's under the Privileges -- Privileges and Immunities argument.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1822.209,1822.759,--That's correct.
2012.12-17,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1822.759,1823.226,Okay.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1825.244,1831.132,"Under the Dormant Commerce Clause, we would first have to have a regulation of commerce that's discriminatory."
2012.12-17,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1835.952,1837.552,"No, I know -- I understand your argument."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1853.747,1855.03,"--I cannot, Your Honor."
2012.12-17,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1855.03,1855.68,Why not?
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1855.68,1866.988,"Mr. Chief Justice, the statute says I cannot recoup the cost of maintaining and generating the database, which is by definition overhead."
2012.12-17,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1867.605,1871.642,"Well, you've got to maintain and generate the database anyway for Virginia citizens who are going to ask for it."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1880.147,1881.364,"--It's an added burden, too."
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.73,1885.532,"But the Virginia citizens pay for that database, right?"
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1885.532,1885.968,--They do.
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.468,1888.92,And the out-of-staters don't pay for the database.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1888.92,1890.92,--This is a taxpayer subsidized system.
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.92,1898.692,"And besides, do -- do you -- is it the law that -- that the State of Virginia cannot do anything that's pointless?"
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1904.263,1918.689,"The -- there is a burden -- there is a non-financial burden as well, because as one who is subject to FOIA requests, we have a finite number of officials and employees who have to address these things."
2012.12-17,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1918.689,1921.022,You keep making that argument.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1943.888,1958.898,"In -- in fact, the State of Virginia has made the policy decision to give this information to its citizens, and not to inquire behind it to see whether or not somebody's doing it for an out-of-Stater."
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.898,1961.616,Or even for commercial purposes.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,1989.952,1991.836,And we don't -- and we don't try.
2012.12-17,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2004.295,2009.163,"It's no more complicated in the system if you let out-of-Staters have access, too."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2012.901,2018.186,The thing that is of -- of great concern -- why do we care?
2012.12-17,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2054.126,2055.994,That's where he comes in with his argument.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2144.952,2151.856,"But it's very difficult for Mr. Hurlbert to make that fairly expansive argument, because it turns out--"
2012.12-17,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2151.856,2154.058,"Well, to be fair, I -- I was sort of expanding it."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2155.208,2172.019,"--But in point of fact, because he is entitled to the tax assessment data in the clerk's office, in the case of Henrico County, where he went, you go in the same building and -- if you're Mr. Hurlbert, you turn in one direction and go to the clerk's office."
2012.12-17,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2180.541,2189.397,"But you don't deny that in general, this does affect out-of-State data collectors, people who are engaged in the kind of business that Justice Breyer was talking about."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2189.931,2204.574,"I have no idea in this record, because we were on summary judgment -- cross motions for summary judgment, and the district court of the court of appeals both in our judgment correctly ruled that there's a two-step inquiry."
2012.12-17,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2210.894,2213.346,Only in his Privileges and Immunities Clause claim.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2248.352,2264.445,"--If -- if in fact you want to rewrite the statute to -- subject it to attack, obviously, that would then raise questions about a nongovernmental protectionist intent."
2012.12-17,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2269.949,2276.587,"--Well, that's the question I'm -- I'm raising the best argument for your adversary, okay?"
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2276.587,2277.653,Right.
2012.12-17,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2277.653,2288.477,"Because we could call it a direct -- he calls it direct discrimination, because commercial businesses are being permitted in Virginia but not noncommercial."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2296.416,2299.702,I would have about three answers to that.
2012.12-17,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2341.244,2354.753,"Are you telling us that there is simply no commercial consequences to this statute at all, that Virginians find this to be of no commercial value in any instance?"
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2354.753,2359.257,--I am totally agnostic on this record because we don't have any data on that.
2012.12-17,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2359.257,2360.723,"Well, you were the one with summary judgment."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2387.057,2388.39,All right.
2012.12-17,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2388.39,2389.342,It's not just political.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2389.342,2405.019,On this record -- on this record the position that was accepted by the two courts below entirely in accordance with this Court's existing doctrine was the first inquiry under Privileges and Immunities was whether there was a fundamental right.
2012.12-17,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2408.471,2410.773,Let's talk about the Commerce Clause.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2425.765,2439.109,"I'm saying that under this record that never came up nor should it have come up, because what the court said on Dormant Commerce Clause, both of the courts below, was this was not a regulation of commerce, it is a governmental action--"
2012.12-17,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2439.109,2439.792,But it has--
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.792,2459.087,You are saying that it's no more necessary for you to show that there's no commercial value to allowing out-of-staters to do this than it is necessary for you to show that there is no commercial value to your not allowing out-of-staters to hunt deer in Virginia.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2459.087,2461.106,--I believe you are correct.
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.106,2462.173,You are saying that it's up to Virginia--
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2462.173,2463.308,"Correct, Your Honor."
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2463.308,2466.092,--whether out-of-staters can hunt for Virginia game.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2466.092,2466.409,Correct.
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2466.409,2478.234,"And it's up to Virginia whether out-of-staters can have access to the State's records, that they have no interest in personally, under this law."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2479.967,2485.654,"But remember they do have access to this information, both Hurlbert and McBurney."
2012.12-17,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2485.654,2496.446,That assumes the question as to whether or not there is a general commercial interest in these -- in these -- in these documents.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2502.366,2505.385,Here's the problem in this case.
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.823,2518.459,"If that's your argument on it, I reject it as Justice Kennedy does."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2523.013,2525.465,--I'm trying to explain why it doesn't matter.
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.465,2526.981,"Yeah, that's what I thought."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2526.981,2542.527,"It doesn't matter because if, on the threshold inquiry, we don't have a discriminatory regulation of commerce but just an ordinary governmental function than only Pike-Church analysis could possibly--"
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.527,2545.461,You can't say discriminatory regulation.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2555.584,2573.029,--The fact of the matter is that it has been -- taxes have been found to be both violations of privileges and immunities and Dormant Commerce Clause where there was unequal taxation of commerce.
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.029,2577.6,Even though it's -- even though it's not a regulation of commerce?
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2577.6,2578.016,Okay.
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.466,2579.716,Okay.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2580.885,2595.894,"--I apologize I chose a word that is not as apt as it should have been, but a regulation or taxation centering around commerce intended to affect and actually affecting commerce, this just isn't that kind of activity."
2012.12-17,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2595.894,2598.596,"Well, general, just indulge me with a hypothetical."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2636.269,2642.09,If I had -- if I had a statute which on its face dealt with commerce--
2012.12-17,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2642.09,2645.66,The statute does exactly the same thing.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2665.289,2684.917,"--I would be saying something at least slightly different if I had different facts that I had to deal with, but I think in principle I would be arguing the power of the State to pass this kind of act without having to submit to the Dormant Commerce Clause, at least first-tier Dormant Commerce Clause analysis."
2012.12-17,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2684.917,2696.824,"--What else can Virginia do besides -- I don't know if there are elk in Virginia, but besides -- to reserve for its own -- for its own people?"
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2710.818,2716.572,"Well, Virginia can do things including have in-state tuition."
2012.12-17,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2754.68,2762.953,"I think the thing, general, that I was trying to get at, it seems to me you have a very good case that these statutes were meant for a different purpose."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2795.84,2821.991,"If -- if we were going to say, if you were going to say that this is an inquiry that needs to be made under the Commerce Clause, this would be a particularly poor vehicle for doing it, because, the Fourth Circuit held that the Pike analysis of the district court was not appealed, and therefore this case could not be sent back on remand to develop a burden analysis of a record--"
2012.12-17,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2821.991,2825.109,But Pike is not relevant here.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2852.776,2862.032,"--Well, there's -- there's discrimination only in the sense that we discriminate against people who we don't let vote because they don't live in the Commonwealth as well."
2012.12-17,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2868.186,2874.674,"You -- you could say the same thing, we don't discriminate against Californians who want to come and pack their melons in Arizona."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2874.674,2883.546,"--Well, I would say that -- that whether or not somebody can deal with an item in commerce is -- is -- raises Commerce Clause questions."
2012.12-17,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2911.382,2921.338,It -- it would surprise me if an out-of-State investor who was thinking of putting a large plant in Virginia had absolutely no interest in Virginia's tax policies.
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,2921.338,2923.123,--But they are available.
2012.12-17,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2938.616,2947.305,"But there -- there -- suppose -- I think they have an argument, saying of course this information would be useful for gathering national statistics and helping the national economy."
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,3022.805,3031.042,I -- I think there that -- that the important policy issue in this case for us is precisely as you articulated.
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3058.145,3062.03,"We are talking about State-owned documents, aren't we?"
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,3062.03,3062.897,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.897,3075.505,"There is not much that's as close to the sovereignty of the State as the possession and right to exclude people from its own records and its own documents, right?"
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,3075.505,3078.207,"I agree, Your -- Justice Scalia."
2012.12-17,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3078.207,3091.55,"So the -- the issue is, can the State allow its own citizens for purposes of seeing that the government is -- is being run on the up-and-up, have access to those documents without letting the whole world?"
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,3091.55,3093.734,"Yes, Your Honor, that is our position."
2012.12-17,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3093.734,3100.305,So why doesn't the dormant Commerce Clause affect the hypothetical I laid out?
2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,3129.992,3137.763,I am -- I am arguing that -- of course I think we say in our brief that -- that they can be put into commerce.

2012.12-17,1,22373,e_duncan_getchell_jr,,3164.765,3169.2,--Because it is not an exercise of the State police power to regulate commerce.

2012.12-17,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,3302.503,3303.286,--Right.
