1995.94-1361,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.439,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 94-1361, Marjorie Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines, and a companion case."
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,10.422,13.891,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,68.208,74.762,The world adopted French civil law when it subscribed to the Warsaw Treaty?
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,74.762,82.868,"No, it did not, Your Honor, but French civil law is one indication of the meaning of those words at the time it was drafted."
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,89.456,89.939,I don't understand.
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,94.843,95.46,--We do.
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,95.46,97.628,"We do, and French civil law governs."
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,97.628,98.445,It governs--
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,98.445,100.664,And the Warsaw Treaty adopted French civil law.
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,100.664,101.364,--It did--
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,101.364,102.282,It seems to me very unlikely.
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,102.282,119.993,"--It did to the extent... this Court in Saks said that you look to French civil law because that's the law that was used when it was drafted, and dommage survenu in French civil law includes both dommage moral and dommage material, which is both the pecuniary damages and the moral damages."
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,119.993,131.116,"Every element of damages that French civil law includes can be recovered under the Warsaw Treaty, and every element of damages that French civil law does not permit to be recovered must be excluded?"
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,131.116,132.468,"Yes, Your Honor, and I think--"
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,132.468,138.955,"Now, is this French civil law as it is amended from year to year, or is it the French civil law that was in effect at the time the--"
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,138.955,141.407,--I believe it would be the French civil law that was in effect at the time.
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,141.407,141.941,--In effect at the time--
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,141.941,150.88,"But more than anything, Your Honor, it's the plain meaning, because this Court in interpreting treaties, and in the Chan case this Court looked at plain meaning, and in the Chan case, Your Honor--"
1995.94-1361,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,150.88,183.868,"--If we are to take seriously your argument that French law, French jurisprudence controls, then what mustn't we take into account all of French law, that is, how it in fact applies in France, and no matter how many elements of damages... of damage would be included in the word dommage, still, there are no juries in France, and awards on all of the items are more modest than they are in the United States."
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,201.73,211.168,"--We look at French civil law to determining the meaning of the phrase, dommage survenu, and we note that they did not restrict it to pecuniary laws."
1995.94-1361,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,218.239,234.117,"I just... if... let's just say pain and suffering would be an element, but in fact pain and suffering damages awarded in French cases do not compare with the size of awards in this country."
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,239.855,256.279,"--If French law controlled everything, that would the case, Your Honor, but in this case we are before you on loss of society, and the narrow question is whether the phrase dommage survenu in French law, the phrase dommage, includes loss of society or dommage moral, and we contend that it does."
1995.94-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,256.279,286.4,"Well, Mr. Needham, the Warsaw Convention also contains Article 24, and under Article 24, which refers back to Article 17, where you find the phrase dommage survenu, it appears to leave the level and nature of damages under the Warsaw Convention subject to limitations and law of the signatory nations."
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,291.453,309.581,"Well, Your Honor, we would contend that subsection 2 of Article 24 refers to the procedural matters to the State, and it reads that without prejudice to the questions as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit, and what are their respective rights... rather than saying what are their rights, what are their respective rights."
1995.94-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,340.6,351.658,"Well, what about a signatory State that does not permit a cause of action after death to a survivor, only to the estate of the decedent?"
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,359.162,368.286,I think it would to the extent that that State decides who may bring the lawsuits and who is entitled to have which question submitted to the jury.
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.286,378.742,"Isn't that a strange, strange system you're... I mean, French law governs what damage may be recovered, but local law governs who gets the damages."
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,382.527,386.081,"Well, reading through the minutes, Your Honor, the United States was not present."
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,393.485,414.748,"No, I understand that, but I never look at that stuff anyway, but it seems to me if you have alternate interpretations of the text, you shouldn't impose the one that creates a bizarre result, and it seems bizarre to me that French law should determine whether there can be recovery, but local law shall determine who gets the recovery."
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,416.784,418.15,"Well, Your Honor, I would submit--"
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.15,423.588,That can be avoided by interpreting Article 25 as Justice O'Connor suggested it could be interpreted.
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,423.588,427.508,"--Well, when the Warsaw Convention wanted a reference to local law, they were very specific."
1995.94-1361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,450.857,455.742,Did the French... did French law determine the meaning of misconduct in this case?
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,455.742,457.361,It did not.
1995.94-1361,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,524.47,542.45,"Was there not a report that a company... at the time that the Warsaw Convention was originally drafted that said there were the two problems, the who and the what damages, that they couldn't successfully resolve and both were referred to local law."
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,592.633,598.168,"--I'm relying more on the plain meaning of the words, and the plain meaning of the words as they appear in the treaty."
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.787,607.476,Am I correct that all of the foreign courts that have grappled with this except one have applied local law rather than French law--
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,607.476,608.96,"Well, there's the--"
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.96,611.095,--and that one court was overruled by statute?
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,611.095,630.389,"--Well, that one court is Preston v. Hunting Air Transport, which is an English case, and then there's the Israeli case which this Court cited with some disfavor in Floyd when it awarded emotional damages, called Air France v. Titner, a case in Israel, when they looked at the plain meaning of Article 17 and said it was good jurisprudential policy to give it a wide meaning."
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.508,634.543,Why was that?
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,640.947,641.831,--I don't know.
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,649.803,654.172,"Jurisprudence favors plaintiffs rather than defendants, is that the jurisprudential principle?"
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,654.172,665.229,"--Well, I think the principle is that a treaty with a cap such as this, when the cap is off, that the good jurisprudential policy is to give the plain meaning of the words and to give adequate compensation."
1995.94-1361,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,666.348,669.633,That may be perfectly... the plain meaning of the word sounds fine.
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,685.876,688.678,--I favor the broader one in this case for several reasons.
1995.94-1361,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,743.848,736.425,That's what the treaty says.
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,744.831,752.954,"Yes, Your Honor, and the treaty says that the airlines or the carrier may not invoke that cap when there's a finding of wilful misconduct."
1995.94-1361,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,752.954,766.445,"So the cap isn't involved here, but I don't see how it follows what else you're saying, that apparently the sky is the limit, regardless of language and that sort of thing, that you just bend every effort to maximize the plaintiff's recovery."
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,766.445,767.512,"We do not, Your Honor."
1995.94-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,780.985,797.964,"Now, if it were a domestic flight that had gone down over the high seas, I assume that there would be no damages such as you are recovering... seeking to recover here for loss of society."
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,797.964,798.547,--If this--
1995.94-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,798.547,800.983,Domestic passengers would not be able to recover--
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,800.983,801.616,--If this--
1995.94-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,801.616,802.416,--for loss of society.
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,802.416,805.351,"--If this were governed by the Death on the High Seas Act, there would be--"
1995.94-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,805.351,805.618,Right.
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,805.618,806.637,--only a pecuniary loss.
1995.94-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,806.637,807.237,Right.
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,807.237,811.957,"If this case were governed by varying State laws, there is overwhelming support for the loss of society."
1995.94-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,811.957,818.777,"Yes, but we've said that when a death occurs on the high seas it's governed by DOHSA, isn't that right?"
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,818.777,822.812,"Well, the DOHSA has been applied to deaths on the high seas."
1995.94-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,827.966,832.454,And do you say the cause of action is created by the Warsaw Convention?
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,832.454,833.004,We do.
1995.94-1361,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,833.004,838.524,"Could you file suit under Korean law, do you suppose, in this case?"
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,838.524,847.797,"Well, there was... there's one part of the Death on the High Seas Act that allows you under 7... section 764 to use the law of the carrier."
1995.94-1361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,877.899,886.672,"Well, I take it it's the law of the case because of the D.C. Circuit's opinion that U.S. law applies, not Korean law, U.S. law of some sort."
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,886.672,896.945,"Well, that was not in our particular case, and I believe they were talking about the list of beneficiaries and who are the proper parties to bring the cas, and they looked to the Death on the High Seas Act for that."
1995.94-1361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,896.945,902.864,"But is it not the law of the case that Korean law cannot apply, or am I wrong about that?"
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,902.864,904.466,I believe that is the law of the case.
1995.94-1361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,909.018,912.822,"Well, under the Warsaw Convention Korean law might have applied in some cases, might it not?"
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,912.822,916.191,--For Korean citizens it may have applied in some factor.
1995.94-1361,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,954.399,957.268,"But that's not... that, I take it, is not the argument."
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,986.12,998.845,"Your Honor, the statute passed by Congress, and this Court in Alves said that it was hastily enacted, it was not the product of attentive judicial review, and was merely to fill a gap for death on the high seas."
1995.94-1361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1014.688,1017.557,"What case did you rely on, Mr. Needham?"
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,1017.557,1021.81,"I relied on Alves, Your Honor, and the quote from Alves is that--"
1995.94-1361,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1021.81,1023.493,Do you have a citation?
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,1023.493,1024.829,"--I do, Your Honor."
1995.94-1361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1048.695,1050.278,What was the date of that case?
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,1050.278,1052.48,"That was 1980, Your Honor."
1995.94-1361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1052.48,1053.063,Yes.
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,1053.063,1054.265,And the Court--
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1054.265,1055.015,But that's--
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,1064.554,1104.281,"--Well, in Miles this Court did apply it, but I think Miles is very distinguishable, because you had a Jones Act seaman, and I think what this Court held is, when you have a Jones Act seaman, and he's wearing his Jones Act seaman hat, then whether he's in the territorial waters or on the high seas, and whether it's under the Jones Act or general maritime law, you're going to treat him the same as a Jones Act seaman, and I don't think that extinguished the general maritime right to recover loss of society that this Court announced in Gaudet, and this Court went on to say in Alves that no intention appears that DOHSA has the effect of foreclosing any nonstatutory Federal remedies that might be found appropriate to effectuate the policies of general maritime--"
1995.94-1361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1104.281,1109.816,"Yes, but shouldn't the complete answer to the Chief Justice's question include a citation to Executive Jet?"
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,1114.903,1122.909,"--That is... is correct, there has been an application of DOHSA to air crashes, but not in cases where the Warsaw Convention controls."
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.909,1125.278,"Well, wait, why should that make any difference?"
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,1156.214,1157.999,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, because--"
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.999,1158.282,Why not?
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,1158.282,1169.557,"--We have a binding treaty obligation, and the DOHSA, because you have the DOHSA for certain restrictive kinds of deaths, does not mean that that trumps the treaty obligation that comes 14 years later."
1995.94-1361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1169.557,1178.83,"That's true if the treaty refers to French law, but if the treaty refers to United States law, isn't it clear that the United States law is DOHSA?"
1995.94-1361,0,45736,w_paul_needham,,1178.83,1180.563,"Not in this case, Your Honor."
1995.94-1361,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1570.931,1581.239,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1361,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1590.595,1609.639,"May I ask right there, because I didn't get a chance to ask your opponent, but the... assuming the treaty doesn't speak for itself, we have to go behind the treaty to look at some other law, it seemed to me as I read the papers in this case that both of you seemed to assume that we do look to American law, to United States law for the answers, and I just wonder why?"
1995.94-1361,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1609.639,1616.21,--In the action that was pled here... there were actions pled under the Warsaw Convention and under the Death on the High Seas Act.
1995.94-1361,2,45736,w_paul_needham,,3262.775,3263.711,Thank you.
1995.94-1361,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3295.147,3299.55,"But the people who are guilty of the wilful misconduct were the flight crew, weren't they?"
1995.94-1361,2,45736,w_paul_needham,,3299.55,3303.419,"--Well, the flight crew, and that gets imputed to Korean Air Lines, which is the defendant."
1995.94-1361,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3303.419,3307.89,"Yes, but the flight crew, I suppose they have a pretty good deterrent whatever the damages are."
1995.94-1361,2,45736,w_paul_needham,,3307.89,3310.175,"Yes, absolutely."
1995.94-1361,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3310.175,3321.631,"I thought the purpose of the Warsaw Convention was to put a lid on the damages, wasn't that the main purpose of it, so that the then-infant industry would be able to grow up?"
1995.94-1361,2,45736,w_paul_needham,,3321.631,3328.618,"That's absolutely true, but even then, they said no lid when there's wilful misconduct, so as concerned as they were then about judgments--"
1995.94-1361,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3328.618,3339.608,"Yes, well, I thought the purpose was rather to put a lid on damages but, when the conduct was so bad, they were going to allow it to be handled the way tort litigation was handled generally."
1995.94-1361,2,45736,w_paul_needham,,3339.608,3356.285,"--And that... that is this case, Your Honor, and in this case, to award loss of society, and we believe that Federal common law is correct, we believe loss of society is there in Federal common law, and we believe to attach a financial dependency requirement to loss of society is inappropriate."
1995.94-1361,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3364.974,3366.243,"Counsel, I have one question."
1995.94-1361,2,45736,w_paul_needham,,3383.502,3385.754,"--Your Honor, that was alternative pleading."
1995.94-1361,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3403.916,3406.666,"What happened to that Count II, Death on the High Seas--"
1995.94-1361,2,45736,w_paul_needham,,3406.666,3408.384,"--I think that count was either dismissed, or there was no finding."
1995.94-1361,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3430.816,3432.516,"Thank you, Mr. Needham."
