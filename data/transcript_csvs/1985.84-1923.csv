1985.84-1923,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.987,We will hear arguments next in Bowen against City of New York.
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,19.128,31.769,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents important questions of subject matter jurisdiction of a Federal District Court in cases arising under the Social Security Act."
1985.84-1923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.878,184.185,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, I guess the problem is that the District Court founds that the Secretary's policy involved in this case was a covert one."
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,201.731,211.937,"The District Court labeled the policy secret, but all it could have meant by secret, I submit, is that--"
1985.84-1923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.937,214.389,Didn't it label it covert?
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,214.389,217.174,"--I don't know if that word was used specifically, but--"
1985.84-1923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.174,222.395,And you didn't file any challenge to that in this court?
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,222.395,232.683,"--Well, it wasn't... if what the courts below meant by that was there was some affirmative act of concealment of what was going on, then we certainly do dispute that."
1985.84-1923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.683,237.07,"But you didn't raise it in the cert petition, did you?"
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,237.07,240.622,"Oh, yes, I think it is at Page... on the second to--"
1985.84-1923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,240.622,241.506,But dispute to that finding?
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,241.506,244.474,--Not as a separate question as such.
1985.84-1923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.474,245.093,No.
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,252.08,257.234,"On Page 26 of our certiorari petition, we point out and we have repeatedly--"
1985.84-1923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,257.234,263.305,"You talk about it, but I had just assumed we had to take that finding as a given."
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,263.305,287.253,"--We don't regard it as a finding, and have not throughout, and this is what we argued in the Court of Appeals at oral arguments and in the rehearing petition, that all that happened here, and all the plaintiffs really tried to establish at trial was that the various memoranda that they relied upon as evidence of the policy were not published, or were not routinely made available to the claimants."
1985.84-1923,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,287.253,290.622,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, is that quite accurate?"
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,302.247,305.132,"Well, the ALJ's--"
1985.84-1923,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,305.132,317.622,"If the only ones who knew anything whatever about it were the state and perhaps also the federal agency, but it wasn't, as Justice O'Connor said, something that was made generally known to the public, was it?"
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,317.622,333.568,"--No, I am not suggesting that it was published, but what I am saying is that the application of the regulations that these memoranda refer to were contained in the sort of routine internal memoranda that go on all the time in the administration of the program."
1985.84-1923,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,333.568,338.953,I don't see how the class members could have raised this question before the agency if they didn't know about it.
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,338.953,342.924,The question is not whether they could have raised this specific question.
1985.84-1923,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,369.157,384.334,"Well, will you tell me just when the policy of resuming the existence of residual capacity of claimants who don't have a listed mental impairment, when did that policy become publicly known?"
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,386.084,388.185,I don't know that it can be pinpointed.
1985.84-1923,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,389.82,393.522,What form did it take when it was finally made public?
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,393.522,409.632,"--Well, it was litigated in the Minnesota mental health case out in Minnesota, and there were, as I understand it, Freedom of Information Act requests for regional documents that referred to this."
1985.84-1923,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,413.353,415.536,But that is the form that the public notice took?
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,415.536,417.888,You said when it became public.
1985.84-1923,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,489.784,497.024,"You know, I am troubled by your characterization of the claim as being a challenge to the thinking process."
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,520.922,524.474,"--Well, that is the legal argument, but that is different from the claim for benefits."
1985.84-1923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,659.527,663.446,"I am a little puzzled, because I have the same difficulty Justice O'Connor does."
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,678.574,684.311,"First of all, it was certainly openly discussed with the state agency."
1985.84-1923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,695.65,696.669,You may be absolutely right.
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,713.145,714.73,That is a label.
1985.84-1923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,718.965,729.49,But it is a policy which according to the trial judge prevented the members of the class from knowing the basis of decision of their claims and therefore deterred them from seeking further review.
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,730.74,738.56,"--The second part of the decision, I don't think there is any basis for concluding that the 10,000 class members were deterred by the failure--"
1985.84-1923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,738.56,747.066,"Well, if you get findings of fact against you from the trial judge, and he has been taking bribes, and you don't know it, you may just think the findings aren't worth challenging."
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,749.216,751.768,--That is an extrinsic sort of corruption of the system.
1985.84-1923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.288,761.34,--He decided the case for a reason he did not disclose.
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,772.647,799.332,"But that... they wrote a decision that explained they had arrived at the conclusion the person could work, but there is no requirement that a decisionmaker has to give the basic outlines of his decision, but there is no requirement that he explain all of the thought processes that he goes through, in the same way that there is no requirement that the District Court fully explain every step that it went through."
1985.84-1923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,799.332,799.849,"Well, I think there is."
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,817.626,833.372,"But I guess the question has to be in a case like this, as I was starting to say before, there are 4,700 state agency employees who adjudicate these claims, 14,000 employees."
1985.84-1923,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,910.272,928.384,"I thought what Judge Weinstein was particularly concerned about was that the decisions of the review physicians were based on a policy, a per se policy rather than on a medical judgment, and that fact was never made known to the claimants."
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,945.445,947.028,That is what he found.
1985.84-1923,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,948.58,958.853,"Well, the claimants who wanted to attack that were unaware, could have attacked it within 60 days, they weren't aware that was being done."
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,962.438,967.409,An ALJ's hearing is not an appeal from the state agency's decision.
1985.84-1923,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,975.13,975.58,"Well, he didn't know."
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,979.649,995.028,--But the fact that he didn't know the way the state agency person decided it in no way prevented him from arguing to the ALJ that he did have the RFC... that he did not have the RFC to engage in unskilled work.
1985.84-1923,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,995.028,995.861,--He didn't know it.
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,998.08,999.396,"No, but that did not--"
1985.84-1923,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,999.396,1005.884,How can you argue that you denied something that you don't know exists?
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1005.884,1016.457,--An application for disability benefits is based on the allegation by the claimant that he has a mental in this case impairment that prevents him from working.
1985.84-1923,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1048.429,1054.066,And he doesn't know that what he is going to argue has already been decided.
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1054.066,1057.018,But it hasn't been decided in any conclusive manner against him.
1985.84-1923,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1068.224,1074.73,If the guy has got a sore... or something he can look into and see it?
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1074.73,1080.482,"No, the ALJ hearing is a de novo determination at which the claimant starts all over again."
1985.84-1923,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1080.482,1081.734,I know it is de novo.
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1108.917,1111.553,There is one more administrative layer of review.
1985.84-1923,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1116.69,1120.659,Is that an appeal as a matter of right?
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1120.659,1123.011,"Well, the appeals counsel has discretion whether to hear it or not."
1985.84-1923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1133.05,1135.001,A conflict among the ALJ's.
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1135.001,1135.884,--Pardon me?
1985.84-1923,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1135.884,1137.853,A conflict among the ALJ's.
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1137.853,1138.336,Yes.
1985.84-1923,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1142.305,1147.926,Is there a time limit on the petition for review to the appeals counsel?
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1147.926,1166.94,"Yes, at every stage of the administrative process there is a 60-day time limit, and the claimant is specifically told that, and at most of the levels of administrative review, particularly after the reconsideration, before the ALJ level, he is told that he can call up a phone number at SSA and ask for more information if he wants to, if he thinks that he needs it."
1985.84-1923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1391.015,1394.902,Was the 1984 Act passed before or after the District Court decision?
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1394.902,1396.902,It was passed after the District Court's decision.
1985.84-1923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1396.902,1400.456,Presumably they knew about the decision and may not have thought anything more was necessary.
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1400.456,1402.573,It was passed after the Court of Appeals decision as well.
1985.84-1923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1402.573,1406.377,Did they indicate any disapproval of those decisions?
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1406.377,1411.312,"Well, the decision in this case, the jurisdictional questions were not really addressed."
1985.84-1923,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1422.886,1429.725,"Your argument is, as I understand it, that they made a number of special reopening provisions in other areas of the law."
1985.84-1923,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1433.61,1454.241,"--But it was still pending on appeal, and the point was that the problem Congress perceived was not one, while it viewed the Second Circuit, the New York example as an example of what had happened, Congress perceived that this was a problem of nationwide dimension and fashioned a nationwide solution."
1985.84-1923,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1614.212,1615.864,Mr. Schwartz.
1985.84-1923,1,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1615.864,1634.441,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, what happened here in the Social Security Administration was highly disturbing, as was found by the courts below in a series of detailed findings which the government did not challenge on appeal and did not raise in their cert petition to this Court."
1985.84-1923,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1810.441,1813.993,"Well, you say pervasive subverting of the legal process itself."
1985.84-1923,1,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1831.354,1841.176,"No, if you had a regulation which is within the administrative discretion of the Secretary, and I will assume that, like in your decision in Ringer, the matter was clearly discretionary."
1985.84-1923,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1852.065,1857.619,--What if a court were later to find that that regulation was unauthorized.
1985.84-1923,1,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1861.238,1863.773,"First, you don't have to reach that here."
1985.84-1923,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.773,1864.792,"Well, but I would like your answer."
1985.84-1923,1,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1864.792,1865.308,Okay.
1985.84-1923,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1871.196,1875.397,Unauthorized either by statute... let's say unauthorized by statute.
1985.84-1923,1,24645,frederick_ao_schwarz_jr,,1875.397,1878.715,"I don't think you are going to excuse exhaustion there, Your Honor."
1985.84-1923,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3416.171,3417.254,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1923,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3468.623,3471.239,Were the ALJ's bound by this so-called--
1985.84-1923,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3471.239,3473.041,The ALJ's were not bound by it.
1985.84-1923,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3480.43,3485.832,--So an appeal to the ALJ exhausting of it wouldn't have been futile.
1985.84-1923,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3485.832,3486.534,That's right.
1985.84-1923,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3497.306,3502.877,"I suppose the less the ALJ's knew about it, the more chance it would be they would get relief."
1985.84-1923,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3502.877,3503.61,--Precisely.
1985.84-1923,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3518.22,3519.471,What about the appeals counsel?
1985.84-1923,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3522.257,3524.257,I am not sure.
1985.84-1923,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3596.656,3597.289,"Thank you, gentlemen."
