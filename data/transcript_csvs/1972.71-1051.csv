1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,47.097,50.215,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1051,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,84.826,86.375,There was a common lobby and --
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,86.375,87.985,"Common lobby, yes sir."
1972.71-1051,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,584.303,593.716,How many dollars are spent in efforts to suppress it by local and the State police and federal?
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,593.716,596.146,"I would say Your Honor, a great deal."
1972.71-1051,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,596.72,601.722,A lot of people will be put out of work though --[Laughter]
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,601.722,620.204,"Well, I think Mr. Clancy, my brother who has the amicus brief in this case probably would feel they will be put out of work, but in this context, we think that the focus on action on the conduct of the disseminator would not be inconsistent with the protection of the right of the public under the First Amendment."
1972.71-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,995.782,997.33,Are those statutes are in your brief Mr. --
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,997.33,998.67,No sir they are not.
1972.71-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,998.67,999.277,They are not?
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,999.277,999.975,No sir they are not.
1972.71-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,999.975,1000.782,Do you have them?
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1000.782,1004.056,Yes I can furnish them to the Court.
1972.71-1051,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1004.056,1005.066,Did you submit them?
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1005.066,1006.19,Yes sir.
1972.71-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1006.19,1009.687,Are those the only two that you know of Hawaii and Oregon?
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1009.687,1013.14,They are the only two States which have thus far done this.
1972.71-1051,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1013.14,1014.946,How recent is Oregon’s?
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1014.946,1019.116,Oregon’s is about a year and four months Your Honor.
1972.71-1051,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1060.109,1061.635,"There was no jury in this case, was there?"
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1061.635,1062.623,No sir.
1972.71-1051,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1062.623,1066.534,And indeed it was a proceeding in the nature of an equitable proceeding?
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1066.534,1068.747,"Yes, sir that’s correct."
1972.71-1051,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1068.747,1080.594,"In the petition for certiorari, you say in your brief that the relevant statutes and the constitutional provisions are in certiorari petition and I picked that up and all I find is a criminal statute."
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1080.594,1086.047,"That’s the point I’m making Your Honor and I said earlier Your Honor, there is no statute to cover what they were doing."
1972.71-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1092.705,1096.556,"It’s an ordinary, civil, equitable objective?"
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1096.556,1109.127,"That’s correct but relying upon the criminal statute for definitional purposes and of course ultimately they may have decided to take the films when they obtained them as an ancillary proceeding, instituted criminal proceedings."
1972.71-1051,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1117.751,1127.753,"Well of course if the Court’s of Georgia say that that’s a procedure available under Georgia law, I suppose that’s the end of it as far we are concerned."
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1133.795,1135.127,"No sir, there is no statutory authority."
1972.71-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1135.127,1135.685,"Well, you argue --"
1972.71-1051,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1135.685,1138.633,One must proceeded by the Georgian Courts and --
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1138.633,1148.63,"Yes but again, they approved the procedure in this particular case but they didn’t say or dwell or say that the judge issue his opinion within so many days."
1972.71-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1148.63,1150.036,Well that’s your Freedman argument?
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1150.036,1152.934,Yes sir that the point I was making.
1972.71-1051,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1152.934,1162.924,"(Inaudible) in fact here the Judge took an unduly long time on the facts here he did, but because there were no guidelines another Judge might have?"
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1162.924,1165.673,That’s correct sir.
1972.71-1051,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1165.673,1171.87,Was this in the nature of the ancient nuisance type of injunction?
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1171.87,1173.358,"Sir, I don’t see that."
1972.71-1051,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1199.085,1201.926,"You mentioned an amicus brief, I don’t seem to have one, who filed this brief?"
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1201.926,1204.557,"Well, I got one this morning."
1972.71-1051,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1204.557,1206.466,"It was just filed this morning, late."
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1206.466,1209.319,"Well, I just received it this morning."
1972.71-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1209.319,1212.534,"Of course you won, you prevailed in the Trial Court?"
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1212.534,1212.975,Yes sir.
1972.71-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1212.975,1221.258,And you had an adverse determination which was not on the issue of obscenity as I understand on the sex of the film?
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1221.258,1223.254,Yes sir.
1972.71-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1223.254,1225.957,And that was favorable to your client?
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1225.957,1227.554,"That the first ruling was, yes sir."
1972.71-1051,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1227.554,1236.574,And you don’t -- you still think that that procedure did not satisfy the Freedman standards?
1972.71-1051,0,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,1236.574,1251.495,"Viewing it, as I was responding to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the fact that Judge Etheridge did it this way, “We are left then to assert our procedural due process in First Amendment cases to the efficiency of a particular Judge in a particular jurisdiction.”"
1972.71-1051,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1263.684,1269.166,"Very well Mr. Smith, Mr. Moran."
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1269.166,1274.589,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1413.691,1416.228,We’ll pick up at that point after lunch.
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1425.073,1435.973,I believe at the recess we were at the point concerning the procedure employed in this particular case in the State of Georgia.
1972.71-1051,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1514.958,1516.629,The film was produced in the Court?
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1516.629,1516.911,Yes sir.
1972.71-1051,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1516.911,1522.094,"And shown to the Court, and then after it was returned to the defendant?"
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1522.094,1525.418,"No sir, it was kept as evidence in that particular case."
1972.71-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1525.418,1528.419,But they were permitted to go ahead with showing on another copy?
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1528.419,1529.795,Yes sir.
1972.71-1051,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1530.316,1533.122,Do they have -- if they have more than one print of the film?
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1533.122,1535.263,I do not know sir.
1972.71-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1543.684,1549.645,What this amounted to was a seizure of evidence by way of a civil action.
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1549.645,1553.79,"Yes sir, after a hearing."
1972.71-1051,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1553.79,1557.018,But did I understand was this the only print of the film?
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1557.018,1558.454,I do not know that.
1972.71-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1558.454,1558.552,Well --
1972.71-1051,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1558.552,1563.419,But you did say I thought that they were free to continue to exhibit but they don’t know what that --
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1563.419,1566.272,There was no prohibition about exhibiting the film.
1972.71-1051,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1566.272,1568.451,But you don’t know that they in fact did exhibit.
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1568.451,1569.619,No sir.
1972.71-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1693.398,1700.557,"How would you go about this procedure, what procedure would you employ if you were doing that now?"
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1700.557,1701.554,In --
1972.71-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1701.554,1702.538,In Georgia.
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1702.538,1721.143,"We would proceed under search warrant, and proceed criminally, and make the arrest, have the commitment hearing which we are required to do in the matter of 24 to 48 hours and have every criminal -- a protection of any person accused of crime, there could be no destruction."
1972.71-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1739.659,1753.881,"Well then you -- once you do I suppose is that some officer would have to see the exhibition and then he’d make an affidavit in support of the search warrant, go to a magistrate and get search warrant on the basis of that information, is that right?"
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1753.881,1756.285,"Yes, a factual affidavit now."
1972.71-1051,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1760.92,1761.112,Describe it.
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,1761.112,1771.867,"-- exactly as the film is described in this brief and that’s the factual basis upon which they are now issued, and let the magistrate himself determine it."
1972.71-1051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2264.989,2266.025,Mr. Moran.
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,2266.025,2266.463,Yes sir.
1972.71-1051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2266.463,2272.86,Let me ask you one question relating or attempting to relate the question the Court asked to be argued to the state of the record here?
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,2287.86,2289.241,It was silent in that regard.
1972.71-1051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2294.836,2297.768,Was there any evidence that there wasn’t pandering or exposure to juveniles?
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,2297.768,2300.141,Because I don’t think that it was raised on either side.
1972.71-1051,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2300.141,2302.075,You feel it was silent then?
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,2302.075,2315.393,"It was silent, there were photographs at the outside of the theatre, which they said was modest warning of what is going on inside, but we did not consider that to be as such to be pandering the streets."
1972.71-1051,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2315.393,2323.837,"No, but did I understand your colleague to say that there was some notice outside that no children under certain age would be admitted?"
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,2323.837,2328.546,I think it said “Be 21 or be gone” or something like that I presume it referred to the age.
1972.71-1051,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2328.546,2334.261,And also if certain types of material offend you don’t come inside?
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,2334.261,2335.308,That’s right.
1972.71-1051,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2335.308,2336.131,That kind of notice?
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,2336.131,2336.639,Yes sir.
1972.71-1051,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2336.639,2338.607,"And that was before the Trial Judge, wasn’t it?"
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,2338.607,2339.205,That’s right.
1972.71-1051,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2339.205,2340.86,I don’t see otherwise how we could have --
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,2340.86,2344.688,"As a matter of fact, he lost his pictures and we put ours in filling."
1972.71-1051,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2345.52,2354.029,"But as I recall the order, the trial judge it was on the basis of a finding to that effect that he denied the injunction, wasn’t it?"
1972.71-1051,1,43016,thomas_moran,,2354.029,2355.376,Yes sir.
1972.71-1051,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3067.742,3068.928,Thank you Mr. Moran.
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3070.521,3076.717,"Yes sir, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1051,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3080.909,3082.711,Before you start Mr. Smith.
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3090.941,3091.316,Yes sir.
1972.71-1051,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3091.316,3092.414,Were they before the Trial Judge?
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3092.414,3092.88,Yes sir.
1972.71-1051,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3092.88,3093.552,They were in evidence?
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3093.552,3094.396,Absolutely yes Sir.
1972.71-1051,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3094.396,3098.472,"And where are the originals of those photographs, are they here in the record?"
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3098.472,3099.348,They should be [Voice Overlap]
1972.71-1051,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3099.348,3100.06,These are only just?
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3100.06,3101.484,Yes they should be.
1972.71-1051,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3101.484,3103.477,It’s hard to read for example from this.
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3103.477,3103.97,I think they are.
1972.71-1051,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3103.97,3105.99,The notices says “Over 21” --
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3105.99,3106.504,Yes.
1972.71-1051,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3106.504,3107.217,Do you think they are?
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3107.217,3123.745,"They are and in fact the oral testimony of one of the police officers indicated what the sign read on page 57 I believe, of the appendix were Officer Little said, “Of course he went to state that no one below 21 years of age is admitted.”"
1972.71-1051,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3123.745,3128.871,Counsel you better stay under the microphone.
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3128.871,3131.182,"And we can make them available, Your Honor."
1972.71-1051,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3142.306,3150.992,"There’s a picture of the building I think in the amicus brief on F, right at the end of the amicus brief."
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3157.696,3158.863,Yes sir that’s right.
1972.71-1051,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3158.863,3159.795,Is that the same?
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3159.795,3160.333,Yes sir that’s the same.

1972.71-1051,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3162.04,3164.15,That’s the reproduction of the actual exhibit?
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3164.15,3172.367,"I don’t know where they got this from Your Honor, but I would suppose that it appears to be the same."
1972.71-1051,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3297.108,3302.695,What's this really got to do with the issue before us?
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3302.695,3318.769,"What it has to do with the issue before us is that if we listen to these factors, we see there’s a lot of confusion and trying to apply what this Court set out, thinking perhaps it was a good solid solution, aligned, limiting, and saying what is obscene and what is not obscene."
1972.71-1051,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3369.755,3371.048,What do you mean by conduct?
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3377.129,3377.76,But he talking about focusing on the --
1972.71-1051,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3377.76,3377.823,"And you are asking me to do the same, what do you mean by that?"
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3377.823,3382.366,Focusing on the conduct of what’s depicted in the film.
1972.71-1051,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3382.366,3385.573,Well I thought the conduct of conducting a movie theatre is what he was talking about?
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3385.573,3386.182,Yes sir I was talking --
1972.71-1051,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3386.182,3387.184,What are you talking about?
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3387.184,3394.896,"The conduct that thrust itself upon an unwilling public, the conduct that interferes with my rights and when I don’t want to view something."
1972.71-1051,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3399.2,3401.292,You would limit it to that?
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3401.292,3410.88,I would limit it to the situation as I said where minors are involved and to those ways of dissemination which intrude into the privacy of unwilling individuals.
1972.71-1051,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3457.999,3462.458,"What if they did, would you -- that doesn’t come out of your -- that wouldn’t be within either one of your exceptions anyway?"
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3462.458,3464.142,"That’s correct and I’m really, again [Voice Overlap]"
1972.71-1051,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3464.142,3466.018,So what has that got to do with your submission?
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3466.018,3482.295,"On the question of the procedure, Mr. Justice Burger inquired regarding the procedure, how this came about, what is the current procedure today, and one of the things I was pointing out was, it was pointed out by brother, there was an answer he would make an affidavit as to what was being shown but no people can agree on what was being shown."
1972.71-1051,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3487.321,3503.297,"But I understand your argument to be that that is basically an irrelevant inquiry under your submission that it’s permissible in any event, so long as there’s not an assault on the privacy of unwilling people and so long as that is not exposed to children, is that your argument?"
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3503.297,3505.564,Yes sir that is in the context of our fourth argument.
1972.71-1051,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3505.564,3509.475,"So this question is irrelevant to your argument, is it not?"
1972.71-1051,2,40382,robert_eugene_smith,,3509.475,3514.109,"Irrelevant as to that argument on point number four, yes sir."
