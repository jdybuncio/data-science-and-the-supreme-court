1962.430,2,20488,dean_acheson,,7101.933,7108.045,Because I think they are based upon what I've just been showing you here.

1962.430,2,20488,dean_acheson,,7607.024,7611.519,This is based on the findings of fact of the United States District Court in Alabama.

1962.430,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8934.873,8949.416,"Suppose the Commission were to decide that these rates are unlawful and in the meantime these petitioners have been destroyed, another barge line, would you say that was consistent with the Act?"

1962.430,2,20488,dean_acheson,,9009.906,9013.917,The purpose of the Act is to regulate commerce and to regulate rates.
1962.430,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9017.884,9019.229,That is right.
1962.430,2,20488,dean_acheson,,9019.229,9029.477,"Now, Your Honor asked me a highly theoretical question as to whether if certain people were then put out of business."
1962.430,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9029.477,9029.935,That's the evidence?
1962.430,2,20488,dean_acheson,,9029.935,9033.278,This would be contrary to general public policy.

1962.430,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9157.633,9158.937,Why did it say that?
1962.430,2,20488,dean_acheson,,9158.937,9165.227,It says the Commission may suspend the rate for up to seven months.

1962.430,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9179.892,9180.457,That's right.

1962.430,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9218.403,9219.256,[Inaudible] the plain language that way.
1962.430,2,20488,dean_acheson,,9219.256,9226.505,The plain language of the Act is at the end of such period the rates shall go into effect.
1962.430,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9226.505,9242.727,"But it says nothing at all about the problem they had in mind as to whether if those rates going in effect, the Court shall forego that the -- one of the great parts of their jurisdiction is exercised for centuries to prevent irreparable damages from unlawful conduct."
1962.430,2,20488,dean_acheson,,9242.727,9251.447,"In the first place, Your Honor, I tried to point out that for centuries this jurisdiction has not been exercised in this regard."

1962.430,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9279.734,9281.272,In that case?
1962.430,2,20488,dean_acheson,,9281.272,9293.779,He said in that case that the weight of authority before 1910 was that these federal courts did not have the authority to enjoin the rates.
1962.430,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9303.185,9305.724,What about Judge Riffkin's case?
