1997.96-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.997,"We'll hear argument now in No. 96-1581, South Dakota v. Yankton Sioux Tribe."
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,9.497,12.683,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,135.836,151.001,"May I ask you, General Barnett, you use the word ""disestablishment"", but as I read particularly Judge Magill's decision, his dissenting opinion, he's very careful to speak always about diminishing."
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,155.765,174.617,"--Your Honor, I believe that diminishment probably should be read to suggest a case more like Rosebud v. Kneip, where the Court said that as to several counties, the reservation was disestablished, but it still left one county with a compact square of reservation."
1997.96-1581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,219.849,231.656,Even though Judge Magill said that he thought that the District Court erred in holding that the reservation had not been diminished?
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,231.656,232.344,Yes.
1997.96-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,309.937,324.557,"General Barnett, was the particular tract of land that we're concerned with in this case part of the land that was restored to the public domain by the 1892 agreement?"
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,324.557,328.587,"--Yes, Your Honor, we do contend that it was restored to the public domain."
1997.96-1581,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,353.764,357.855,So this parcel was not allotted land that was later alienated?
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,357.855,370.601,"168,000 acres of the 430... 168,000 were immediately ceded to the Federal Government, and then, then, as I said, began a rapid process of sale."
1997.96-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,384.689,388.359,"Yeah, we were asking about this particular tract of land."
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,394.06,394.31,"Oh, okay."
1997.96-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,394.732,397.199,And we're talking about a particular tract of land.
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,397.589,397.917,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1997.96-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,397.917,401.604,"Now, was that land that was directly restored to the public domain?"
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,405.697,410.382,It was... it was... it is now and was at the time of trial fee land.
1997.96-1581,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,433.311,436.185,"What... that was before the 1890... 1892 agreement, then?"
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,436.185,437.574,--That I cannot answer.
1997.96-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,443.369,451.708,"The Respondents rely on a savings clause in Article XVIII, is it?"
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,451.708,453.192,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,453.192,455.676,Are you going to address that?
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,455.676,456.332,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,456.332,466.421,Because it is language that is different than that which we have seen in other treaties or agreements.
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,466.421,466.968,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,668.108,669.481,Why... why isn't this in the operative language?
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,669.481,672.683,--In the 1892?
1997.96-1581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,672.683,673.246,Right.
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,673.246,686.521,"Because I don't think they intended to disestablish... excuse me... I think they intended to disestablish, and I don't think that... that they intended Article XVIII to... to change what the terms or the operative intent of the Act were."
1997.96-1581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,696.455,699.033,Then why didn't they just say that and nothing else?
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,699.033,705.341,"Well, I think, as one justice said... or judge said... at the Eighth Circuit, lawyers repeat themselves."
1997.96-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.31,830.088,May I ask this question about Article I and... and also Justice Ginsburg's question of distinction between dis... disestablishment and... and diminishment.
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,855.89,860.185,"Well, I read that reference as a geographical reference."
1997.96-1581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.185,860.638,Yes.
1997.96-1581,0,35434,mark_w_barnett,,860.638,865.387,"And... and... and through... and the use of the phrase ""within the reservation""--"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1591.67,1596.059,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.559,1719.355,"As far as this parcel at issue here is concerned, does it make any difference?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1719.355,1722.572,"In what... in what regard, Justice Scalia?"
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.572,1734.176,"Even if it is only a diminishment rather than a disestablishment, wouldn't the parcel here be in the portion that was diminished... that is, it was taken away from the Tribe?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1734.176,1736.784,"Yes, it would be."
1997.96-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.277,1755.276,So then it has to be disestablishment or nothing?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1755.276,1755.995,Or nothing.
1997.96-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1759.369,1762.837,"Well, but then do you agree with the theory that it has to be... you would say nothing and they would say disestablishment?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1762.837,1763.991,Precisely.
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1763.991,1766.569,"Why... why couldn't you, even if it was a checkerboard?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1766.569,1767.864,"Well, it would--"
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1767.864,1769.115,Why do we have to reach that question--
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1769.115,1783.578,"--I think it was one... this Court at one point said that if that were the case... first of all, it's looked upon with disfavor; but, secondly, they would say law enforcement people would have to have a map to decide who they can arrest and where."
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1786.982,1792.856,"--Do you... do you think... what is the practical consequence of the... of... of this case, one way or the other?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1815.362,1815.924,Yes.
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1816.549,1816.783,Yes.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1823.75,1824.375,"Well, that would never happen."
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1824.375,1824.828,Yeah.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1824.828,1830.825,"First of all, the Federal Government and the Tribe have been exercising jurisdiction ever since the Eighth Circuit opinion."
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1845.037,1851.847,What is the jurisdiction in respect to those who are not members of the Tribe who are in this territory?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1855.236,1855.673,"--Oh, of course, yes."
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1856.205,1859.547,Do they have town councils?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1859.547,1859.735,Yes.
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1859.735,1861.391,What government runs--
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1861.391,1862.234,There's a county government.
1997.96-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1865.671,1866.077,"--Well, isn't this--"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1876.227,1881.178,Only... only within the boundaries of the reservation and only with regard to Indian defendants in criminal cases.
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1881.178,1887.113,"--So in the nonIndian defendants, in the... in the ones... people, I'm thinking, who are not Indians, they have towns and there are some laws."
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1887.113,1887.645,Yes.
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1887.645,1888.176,And rules.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1895.641,1897.204,The normal rules of South Dakota--
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1897.204,1897.86,--Of South Dakota?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1897.86,1898.501,--South Dakota.
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1898.501,1903.998,Why do South Dakota law apply if it's within the bounds of a reservation?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1907.793,1909.871,"Sorry, say that last word again?"
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1909.871,1913.682,Why do... is it... what... I'm just missing a very basic hornbook point probably.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1921.241,1922.474,South Dakota law.
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1922.474,1923.631,The State laws apply?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1923.631,1924.177,That's right.
1997.96-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.376,1934.891,"Well, what... what about civil jurisdiction, Mr. Abourezk?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,1952.166,1952.947,Yes.
1997.96-1581,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1962.583,1965.973,That was as a result of the decision that we made in that case.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2003.566,2007.081,"--No, it will make no difference... minimal difference to the nonIndian population."
1997.96-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2007.081,2009.611,"Well, then... then why was this permit denied?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2009.611,2011.954,The permit... the permit wasn't--
1997.96-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2011.954,2015.047,And... and why... why would the permit have been denied if... if... if you're correct?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2015.047,2017.233,"--No, the permit wasn't denied."
1997.96-1581,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2026.261,2031.618,"Well, but you take the position that the Tribe has authority to determine whether or not the plant will be located here."
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2031.618,2032.118,No.
1997.96-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.331,2048.188,So Federal law rather than State law would govern?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2048.188,2048.471,--Yes.
1997.96-1581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2054.078,2063.918,"And is the reason that State law would apply to the governance of the cities and towns in Justice Breyer's example, is the reason for that that there is no supplanting Federal law?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2063.918,2064.447,No.
1997.96-1581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2072.71,2073.179,I see.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2123.205,2125.408,"I don't know of any, if there are."
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2128.017,2139.918,"So it... it may... it may be... it may be true that... that the way people thought at the end of the 19th century, if the Tribe, as a tribe, doesn't own anything in this whole area, there can't be a reservation."
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2144.415,2144.978,"--Well, Justice--"
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.978,2147.743,All of which can be... can be alienated to nonIndians.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2155.599,2156.88,"--Well, there is in this case."
1997.96-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2170.858,2172.545,But that doesn't go to tribal lands?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2172.545,2172.952,--Pardon?
1997.96-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2172.952,2177.684,"That doesn't go to whether or not they are tribal lands, the fact that there may be Indians living there."
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2180.386,2180.808,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2193.942,2200.659,"But... but are you taking the position, to put it crudely, sort of the mirror image of the one that... that I was... I was attributing to the State?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2220.728,2222.837,I would say something totally different--
1997.96-1581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2222.837,2223.602,--retains.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2223.961,2224.446,--Your Honor.
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.469,2243.173,Why pick out that?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2253.199,2253.731,--No.
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2258.183,2259.79,"Oh, the 1858 Treaty, it continues."
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2259.79,2260.134,--Yes.
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.134,2261.649,I'm talking about the 1892 Treaty.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2265.21,2266.788,"Well, it doesn't really say that."
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2269.115,2270.194,Can you tell me why it doesn't say that?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2272.349,2273.083,--I think--
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.083,2276.753,Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to abrogate the 1858 Treaty.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2276.753,2277.346,--Yes.
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.346,2285.952,"And everything in the agreement abrogated one thing or another in the 18... the whole purpose of the agreement was to abrogate some elements of the 1858 Treaty, wasn't it?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2285.952,2293.043,"Respectfully, there's only one change made in the... between the 1858 Treaty and the '94 agreement, where there was a conflict."
1997.96-1581,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2313.238,2334.354,"But isn't that a rather major... just a whole change in the concept, from this is a reservation reserved for the use of Indians to a concept of we want the white men to come in and work side by side for... one is preserving a culture and the other is trying to break it up and assimilate it into another culture."
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2339.228,2342.179,"--Oh, I don't... I don't agree with that, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.96-1581,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2390.816,2394.814,But... but this Court has said it's nearly irrebuttable.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2397.049,2401.765,"--No, Solem said if you take those two, they're almost... or nearly... Hagen said ""nearly""."
1997.96-1581,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2416.353,2418.273,"But then you... must... mustn't you... mustn't you, if you're taking that position, say,"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2434.314,2438.891,"--Well, if it is ambiguous, it should be decided in favor of the Tribe, in any event."
1997.96-1581,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2439.562,2454.258,"But if you say... if we're faced with something ir... almost irrebuttable and something that's kind of weak, it could mean one thing, it could mean another thing, why does the... the part that's uncertain--"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2454.258,2454.774,--Well--
1997.96-1581,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2454.774,2458.991,--dominate what we have said is a very strong presumption?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2458.991,2475.376,"--Justice Ginsburg, if you read the entire agreement and the statute of 1894, what my position is... our position is that the presumption is in favor of maintaining the reservation boundaries because of what Article XVIII, Article XVII, and the school--"
1997.96-1581,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2475.376,2480.56,Then the presumption that's created by the cession and sum certain clause is rebutted in your view?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2480.56,2487.261,"--It's not only rebutted, but it shifts... the burden of proof then shifts to the State or the people trying to abolish the reservation."
1997.96-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2489.432,2501.146,"But don't you agree that there are various inferences that can be drawn, say, between Article XVIII and Article I and II, that it isn't just crystal clear?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2522.748,2529.838,But you also said in Solem that there must be substantial and compelling evidence in order to disestablish or diminish a reservation.
1997.96-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2539.426,2546.471,but the language in Solem suggests it meets its burden of... when it says there's a cession of land for a sum certain.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2547.565,2549.236,--If that's all there were.
1997.96-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2551.579,2552.001,Yes.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2559.42,2562.808,"Oh, I... well, of course, our position is that we have an awful lot more."
1997.96-1581,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2562.808,2563.105,Right.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2584.44,2589.953,"Well, we take that position simply because it's not practical to... to diminish--"
1997.96-1581,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2589.953,2591.61,"You don't take that position, do you?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2591.61,2593.327,"--We don't really, because it's not practical."
1997.96-1581,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2594.546,2598.466,Although you said there are some tribal lands left.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2598.466,2598.904,--Yes.
1997.96-1581,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2598.904,2602.964,"But they also are checkerboarded, I take it?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2602.964,2603.339,"Yes, they are."
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2603.339,2605.042,How... how did they ever get there?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2617.239,2618.848,That there is still some?
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2618.848,2620.145,Tribal lands.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2620.145,2622.019,"Well, they're owned by individual Indians."
1997.96-1581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2622.019,2624.628,"So these are all allotted lands, in other words?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2624.628,2625.001,Yes.
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2628.281,2629.078,What other tribal lands?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2636.607,2636.747,--No.
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.185,2637.607,--No?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2637.607,2643.979,"Your Honor, what... what happened was there were... the allotments were over 200,000 acres that were allotted out."
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.945,2650.508,Right.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2658.035,2658.473,Yes.
1997.96-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2658.473,2658.957,Okay.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2665.689,2666.438,"Yes, there were."
1997.96-1581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2666.781,2669.452,"Well, I thought... then I don't understand your answer to Justice Scalia."
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2669.452,2671.108,--I must have misunderstood his question.
1997.96-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2677.856,2678.137,But--
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2689.696,2693.599,"Yes, very... not very many... not very many acres, but there are."
1997.96-1581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2693.88,2698.596,And some of them have been in the Tribe's possession since before the 1892 Treaty?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2698.596,2703.017,There were all in the Tribe's possession prior to 1892.
1997.96-1581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2703.986,2718.652,But the... the... the land... the... the communally owned tribal land was owned by the Indians and so held before 1892 and have been held continuously to the present day; is that correct?
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2718.652,2719.557,--No.
1997.96-1581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2726.164,2726.649,Right.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2726.649,2731.178,"--around... and then... then what was left over, in 1892, the government purchased."
1997.96-1581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2732.381,2738.847,"So when the government purchased, there were no communally land... owned lands, tribal lands, retained by the Tribe as such?"
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2739.378,2740.144,"Well, only a mile square."
1997.96-1581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2743.938,2744.469,--Okay.
1997.96-1581,1,28877,james_g_abourezk,,2745.969,2746.157,Thank you.
1997.96-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2746.157,2750.64,Mr.... who do we have here?
1997.96-1581,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2752.936,2757.356,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1581,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2799.885,2810.694,"But there's nothing in there, I take it, to suggest that this kind of jurisdiction was being exercised over either allotted lands or the lands that were conveyed in 18... or under the... under the 1892 agreement?"
1997.96-1581,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2810.694,2822.409,The record is unclear as to whether the State or the Tribe or the Federal Government was exercising jurisdiction over the allotted lands at the time.
1997.96-1581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2869.139,2879.089,"A theory which is beautifully in accord with the State's notion that everyone would have assumed that if there's nothing left in a reservation but allotted lands, there's no reservation left."
1997.96-1581,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2879.089,2885.242,"Oh, that's a theory that this Court has subsequently rejected over the last 35 years."
1997.96-1581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2885.242,2895.425,"But it fits very nicely with what you say to be the... the... the... the understanding, that... that you can't have a... the reservation went with... with Indian ownership."
1997.96-1581,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2895.425,2922.868,"Oh, the Court has acknowledged that in a number of other cases, including Solem, that at the time, the understanding was that Indian status was a property status, but that Congress disabused everyone of that notion in 1948, and that when we are deciding these disestablishment and diminishment issues, we are looking at reservations as they have been considered after '48, and not as they may have been considered 100 years ago."
1997.96-1581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2922.868,2926.054,"Well, how... how... what is the normal now?"
1997.96-1581,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2951.371,2956.291,State law governs them except in some particular instances that this Court has spelled out.
1997.96-1581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2956.291,2956.65,Why does State law govern?
1997.96-1581,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2963.258,2964.772,No.
1997.96-1581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2971.472,2971.722,All right.
1997.96-1581,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2979.375,2981.765,"That's our position, that things should not change--"
1997.96-1581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2981.765,2994.838,Then why is it... I'm back at Justice Kennedy's point... why is it that there's some argument here about building a... some kind of thing in this... waste disposal or what it is... if the State law governs the same as it would if it were not within the reservation?
1997.96-1581,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,2994.838,3005.132,--This was a... a particular issue of the EPA's authority to delegate primary supervision of landfills to the State.
1997.96-1581,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3013.361,3014.939,What about... what about taxation?
1997.96-1581,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3014.939,3020.904,"--As a general matter, the State may tax its citizens on the reservation."
1997.96-1581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3032.651,3052.019,"So in the absence of a Federal statute that explicitly distinguishes between what happens on the reservation or not, everything stays the same, but for the Indians themselves, because they would have certain rights under tribal law, et cetera, if it is a reservation, throughout the reservation that they wouldn't have if it isn't; is that right?"
1997.96-1581,2,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,3052.019,3052.472,With a few limited--
1997.96-1581,3,35434,mark_w_barnett,,3345.777,3346.479,Well--
1997.96-1581,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3346.479,3349.073,What does the State lose if... if you lose?
1997.96-1581,3,35434,mark_w_barnett,,3349.073,3362.785,"--I think we lose a vast amount of clarity, as we are standing... or, up until the District Court opinion, jurisdiction in the 90 percent of this area that has gone out of Indian hands was--"
1997.96-1581,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3362.785,3367.83,What... what kinds of authority can you not exercise if you lose that you're exercising now?
1997.96-1581,3,35434,mark_w_barnett,,3367.83,3375.968,"--Well, obviously, if you were to hold that it is still a reservation in this entire area, it would have a big effect on criminal jurisdiction."
1997.96-1581,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3392.195,3394.21,It's criminal jurisdiction over Indians?
1997.96-1581,3,35434,mark_w_barnett,,3394.21,3394.663,--Pardon me?
1997.96-1581,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3394.663,3396.382,Criminal jurisdiction over Indians.
1997.96-1581,3,35434,mark_w_barnett,,3400.91,3402.066,"Yes, I think there would be."
1997.96-1581,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3407.111,3407.517,"No, no, no."
1997.96-1581,3,35434,mark_w_barnett,,3408.814,3409.391,"--Yes, there would be."
