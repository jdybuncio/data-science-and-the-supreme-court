1968.749,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.671,"Number 749, Adolpho Rodriquez, petitioner, versus The United States."
1968.749,0,46627,william_ross_wallace,,10.115,14.032,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,774.264,775.453,What would the motion have been?
1968.749,0,46627,william_ross_wallace,,775.952,783.744,"Well, I think it would have been motion Your Honor to permit the prisoner to proceed in forma pauperis on the appeal and --"
1968.749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,783.744,784.129,"Well, it doesn't --"
1968.749,0,46627,william_ross_wallace,,784.129,790.543,"-- it would have meant, I think also the appointment by the court of counsel for the prisoner."
1968.749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,790.543,796.759,The difficulty I have is that reading Roman III of the appendix to your reply brief.
1968.749,0,46627,william_ross_wallace,,803.569,804.797,That I agree Your Honor.
1968.749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,852.134,854.9,If you don't read the record as supporting that statement do you?
1968.749,0,46627,william_ross_wallace,,855.56,856.637,I don't read this record of supporting.
1968.749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,856.637,857.503,That's what you mean?
1968.749,0,46627,william_ross_wallace,,857.503,870.527,"No, then it came down again before on the Section 2255 application before Judge MacBride and Judge MacBride then said that an oral notice had been made."
1968.749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,902.614,905.626,"Well, I can -- how -- how do we know that?"
1968.749,0,46627,william_ross_wallace,,905.626,908.479,"Well, it can have no other purpose, Your Honor."
1968.749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1190.57,1200.205,Is there any -- any indication at this point what if anything he would be able to present on appeal?
1968.749,0,46627,william_ross_wallace,,1200.205,1201.352,I have no idea.
1968.749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1320.706,1324.867,What happen to the petitioner's wife in this --
1968.749,0,46627,william_ross_wallace,,1324.867,1334.008,The petitioner asked me and wrote to me and asked me if I could find out whether his wife was -- he has not been able to communicate with her.
1968.749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1337.658,1338.431,She was convicted of --
1968.749,0,46627,william_ross_wallace,,1338.431,1344.827,"She was convicted and sent to Terminal Island Prison, I think, in Southern California."
1968.749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1355.331,1359.008,Because she too seems to have been the subject of this motion --
1968.749,0,46627,william_ross_wallace,,1359.008,1359.369,"Yes, that's right."
1968.749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1359.369,1362.371,-- of this abortive tentative motion on --
1968.749,0,46627,william_ross_wallace,,1362.371,1362.619,That's right.
1968.749,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1362.619,1364.557,-- page 3.
1968.749,0,46627,william_ross_wallace,,1364.557,1379.189,But he knows -- has no knowledge where she presently is and she may for what I know still be in the prison in California.
1968.749,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1381.207,1385.659,Ms. Rosenberg.
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,1385.659,1387.541,May it please the Court.
1968.749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1886.114,1888.437,This is result of what case I missed it?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,1888.437,1889.069,"Machibroda, Your Honor."
1968.749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1889.069,1890.438,"Machibroda, I thought so."
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,1890.438,1893.445,And before that Walker against Johnston.
1968.749,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2131.662,2139.634,"Ms. Rosenberg, any place along the line that you consider in giving the prisoner a lawyer?"
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2139.634,2140.164,Oh!
1968.749,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2174.539,2177.294,When if ever does the prisoner get a lawyer?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2177.294,2180.653,"Well, if from the lawyer's response."
1968.749,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2225.175,2225.403,What my problem --
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2225.403,2227.626,Before we have to give a lawyer.
1968.749,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2227.626,2237.396,"My problem is, if I understand you correctly, that in this very case, once this petitioner had a lawyer."
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2247.548,2247.991,Only you --
1968.749,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.991,2253.525,Doesn't that mean that when he gets back to the District Court he has to have a lawyer?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2253.525,2260.164,"Your Honor, he didn't have a lawyer except the prisoner lawyer is a pretty good one in this case."
1968.749,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2268.562,2269.434,That's the one.
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2269.434,2269.86,Yes.
1968.749,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2270.458,2272.673,"Well, he can't have that one in Court because he's still --"
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2272.673,2273.039,No!
1968.749,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2273.039,2274.04,-- in prison.
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2274.04,2295.037,"Well, all we're saying is he leaves allegations that he makes here are the kind that a prisoner can make particularly in the light of this Court's decision in Johnson against Avery and the system that's been developed in the federal prisons in most of them of having assistance to the petitioners."
1968.749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2372.488,2374.966,"Well, as to make a sentences I suppose so that the --"
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2374.966,2375.954,"Well, that brings --"
1968.749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2375.954,2376.169,-- that would be a matter of mechanics.
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2376.169,2377.561,-- each one has a question.
1968.749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2431.665,2432.566,How long is this?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2432.566,2446.331,"-- I think that it would, if I may respectfully so suggest be desirable that an opinion so indicate, so that the courts who are faced with the problems will know what to do."
1968.749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2446.331,2448.297,"What's the other alternative procedure, Ms. Rosenberg?"
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2448.297,2448.732,Pardon?
1968.749,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2448.732,2453.374,What's the other alternative procedure? You said there were two of which this one you thought was preferable?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2453.374,2459.909,The other alternative had been to -- on for the District Court on 2255.
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2502.248,2531.98,"Well Ms. Rosenberg, what do you think that the situation of this kind where we have an ignorant, illiterate foreigner who is being tried for an offense and he hears his colloquy in Court and then shortly after 30 days, attempts to perfect his appeal and in two subsequent proceedings."
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2571.671,2573.386,"Oh, we have agreed to be nice."
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2574.508,2575.685,Why do you -- why do you tells us --
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2575.685,2576.331,"No, I think the --"
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2576.331,2577.365,-- narrow us down?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2595.255,2605.617,"Your Honor, I was not -- I said I thought the preferable procedure would be to have the judge vacate the judgment and allow time for appeal."
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2609.627,2617.855,"Well, now I didn't understand that you agreed that this case should go back and he should be granted an appeal."
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2631.979,2632.338,Oh!
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2646.999,2650.647,"There were somebody was obviously derelict, who was it?"
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2654.25,2655.479,I don't know.
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2655.479,2656.548,Was it the judge?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2660.95,2663.282,I don't know Your Honor.
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2663.306,2663.747,"Well, Ms. Rosenberg --"
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2663.747,2674.073,"-- do know that there are cases in which there's a determination counsel had said to a prisoner, “I do not think there was anything to be gained by appeal.”"
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2674.073,2677.473,You -- do we have nothing like that in this case?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2680.207,2683.967,We don't know what has been said Your Honor.
1968.749,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2686.704,2691.332,What is the -- what is the destination do you think you should be made in this case?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2691.332,2725.329,"I think this -- I think the proper is to -- for this Court to rule that the prisoner need not show grounds for appeal that if the allegation in its petition, it can be present back to consider whether the allegations of the petition for a writ of certiorari that -- when we say that on the basis of the allegations and the petition for a writ of certiorari."
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2735.727,2739.289,Isn't that the issue that's here right now?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2739.289,2741.585,"No, it's whether he stated the basis."
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2741.585,2742.462,I beg your pardon?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2742.462,2752.707,It's whether he has stated the claim which the District Court should consider and we agree that he has stated the district acclaim which the District Court should consider.
1968.749,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2836.454,2847.331,Are you suggesting there should be a remand for the purposes of framing an issue as to what went on between this man and his lawyer?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2847.331,2848.0,Yes.
1968.749,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2848.0,2852.289,Depending on that to there would be a hearing or not?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2852.289,2852.938,That's right.
1968.749,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2852.938,2853.564,Is that it?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2853.564,2854.391,That's our position.
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2904.965,2910.245,Do we have to convict counsel or do we have to interpret what he said to the court?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2953.117,2956.574,"Well, Your Honor."
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2958.743,2958.814,I beg your pardon?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2958.814,2960.307,-- they have to file a written to the judge.
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2971.414,2972.348,Something went on?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2976.724,2977.903,"No, after sentencing."
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2980.104,2996.598,"At sentencing, his counsel said that he wanted -- this man want to proceed in forma pauperis and the Court interpreted that evidently as an abandonment of the client and the desire from that moment for him to proceed in forma pauperis."
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3012.113,3023.358,"Well, it still seems to me that a defendant has said that counsel promised to do something and counsel didn't do it."
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3035.027,3043.547,"Do you know for well that if this case goes back and counsel said that, “No, I didn't, I didn't tell him I would appeal."
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3088.292,3088.722,We have agreed to that --
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3088.722,3095.32,"-- because of that and because of our rule, he can't have an appeal."
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3135.05,3138.716,"Well, I think Your Honor, you are if so ruling accusing --"
1968.749,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3138.716,3139.525,I beg your pardon?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3139.525,3145.213,I think that we are accusing counsel of the derelicts in duty without hearing counsel.
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.783,3237.007,"Ms. Rosenberg, what's the predicate on your position here, is it rule of criminal procedure or are they with supervisory powers constitute --"
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3237.007,3237.383,What?
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3237.815,3239.377,Of the counsel you're talking about?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3239.377,3242.714,Of the right to counsel on appeal?
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3242.714,3243.511,Quite right.
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3252.691,3255.22,"Well, there could have been a violation of the right to counsel."
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3275.225,3280.285,Any counsel would be it fails to follow its orders.
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3285.26,3294.796,"Of course, it is had so said that if counsel has overreached it's in some form or another that's the Calland case in the Seventh Circuit."
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3294.796,3299.92,"Well, that's what we reached but you would -- you would throw in with that (Inaudible)?"
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3299.92,3303.175,"Well, if you were in that instance since it's very hard to reconcile the cases --"
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.175,3304.553,"Ms. Rosenberg, I am just asking --"
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3304.553,3305.161,-- with --
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3305.161,3306.214,-- what do you think the answer is?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3306.214,3309.461,I think it must be a little more that negligence.
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3312.264,3318.761,This claim makes this instance forgetting about it or he puts (Inaudible).
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3318.761,3319.264,That's right.
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3319.264,3322.305,-- the secretary is sick that's the Fifth?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3322.305,3324.148,That's Robinson.
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3324.148,3325.351,Alright.
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3328.467,3335.193,My department suggested its position is a pure negligence without any of the reaching aspects is not enough.
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3335.193,3341.273,Well then I suppose you would say there would have to be a hearing in this case you get it.
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3344.04,3353.461,Not necessarily because he says the counsel agreed and then deliberately failed to take any steps.
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3357.968,3359.907,Deliberately?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3359.907,3368.724,"I said I wouldn't do it under the Calland case, if the counsel says, the only way you can take an appeal is to pay me $500.00."
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3374.81,3386.62,"You have repeated the cases here, you well know that maybe he knows about either -- maybe you wouldn't distinguish unless with respect between your point of view?"
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3386.62,3387.288,No.
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3387.288,3387.995,(Inaudible)
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3387.995,3388.164,No.
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3403.656,3403.767,Well --
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3403.767,3406.998,"But what you say, I would --- I think you have a good case on appeal --"
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.998,3410.793,But still -- but there's a point of counsel.
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3416.705,3418.298,No.
1968.749,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3443.047,3446.897,You make a difference in the point in your indictment?
1968.749,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3446.897,3447.33,No.
