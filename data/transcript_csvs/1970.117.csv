1970.117,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.95,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 117, Coates against the City of Cincinnati."
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,45.257,45.787,Thank you sir.
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.817,207.923,Was there a conviction in this case?
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,207.923,210.859,Yes sir.
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,210.859,212.682,And was there a trial?
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,212.682,213.76,Yes sir.
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,215.906,218.759,How about the evidence?
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,218.759,219.783,"At the trial, the --"
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,219.783,220.743,It was directly?
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,220.743,221.482,No.
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,242.089,244.808,"Certainly, evidence must have represented by the state to --"
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,244.808,245.116,Yes.
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,251.515,258.077,You don’t know what conduct the appellant’s were found guilty of?
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,258.077,259.531,That is correct.
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,259.531,270.777,And although would you suggest that there are some facts in the world that anybody could realize or might be covered by the statute?
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,270.777,273.326,"Yes, yes, I certainly do."
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,295.752,303.231,What if your clients were guilty of precisely that conduct which any fool would know would violate the statute?
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,303.231,309.642,"If I understand you correctly, then they should have been charged with it, whether be obscene discourse or disorderly conduct or assault and battery or --"
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,309.642,323.313,"But where -- they were charged under the statute and let’s assume the evidence at the trial showed the conduct which anybody would know was covered by the statute, there couldn’t be much doubt about it?"
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,323.313,325.975,"I have to disagree, Your Honor."
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,331.612,337.082,"So, your answer really is that there is nothing, no conduct that you can think of that would be annoying?"
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,337.082,339.698,I think we have to apply a certain degree of reason there.
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.322,349.009,"Well, let’s assume your clients gathered on the street and engaged in precisely that conduct?"
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,349.009,349.296,Right.
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,357.428,367.878,"Well, I agree that it may -- that conduct may have violated some other statutes, but the question is whether it violated this one?"
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,367.878,368.287,Right.
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,368.287,372.492,And that conduct you concede that anybody would say was annoying?
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,372.492,373.176,Right.
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,373.176,383.115,"And so, there wouldn’t be any doubt in the minds of someone engaging in that conduct that it was the kind of conduct that was clearly proscribed by the statute?"
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,383.115,383.682,Right.
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,387.72,389.05,"Well then how could -- oh, go ahead."
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,389.05,390.568,-- granting what Your Honor says.
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,400.655,403.325,"Well, that’s the different -- that’s a -- I understand that argument."
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,426.498,427.164,I think I’ve to --
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,427.164,430.552,Those people whose conduct is clearly covered by it?
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,430.552,433.927,"I think I have to agree completely with what you just said, yes sir."
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.741,458.074,"Why didn’t you bring the -- why is it, why does that the record have the facts in?"
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,458.074,463.701,I find that a very difficult question which I’ve been anticipating for some months.
1970.117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.625,523.455,That’s the ordinance that it didn’t reach the facts then?
1970.117,0,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,523.455,523.6,No.
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,1806.674,1812.353,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1861.563,1863.502,Are you reciting the facts in this case?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,1863.502,1871.099,To assist the Court with regard to this matter because there was -- there were several questions with regards to the facts.
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1872.415,1873.491,But they’re not in the record?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,1873.491,1875.109,That’s correct Your Honor.
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1903.846,1907.499,Do you have a disorderly conduct ordinance?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,1907.499,1908.761,"Yes, we do Your Honor."
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1908.761,1912.912,What’s the difference between that ordinance and this one?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,1912.912,1929.895,"Well, the language is different in that the disorderly conduct ordinance of the City of Cincinnati provides that it shall be unlawful for an individual to conduct himself in a noisy, rude, boisterous or insulting matter within the City of Cincinnati."
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.895,1931.457,And that’s different from this one?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,1931.457,1936.557,Different in the sense that it’s -- that is one individual different in the language that it’s used.
1970.117,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1936.557,1938.1,This requires a group doesn’t it --
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,1938.1,1946.299,"This requires -- this might be classified, if it please Your Honors as perhaps a group disorderly conduct ordinance."
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1946.66,1954.038,Couldn’t three people simultaneously on the same corner be guilty of disorderly conduct?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,1954.038,1955.631,"Oh, I think they could Your Honor."
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1955.631,1961.93,"Vow, what’s the difference between the statutes?"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,1970.307,1971.972,"Your Honor, I --"
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1971.972,1977.527,Is this less than disorderly conduct?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,1977.527,1987.479,"I think its conduct which is troubling, annoying, vexatious conduct that blocks the street, stops commerce, stops pedestrians."
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1987.479,1995.754,Is there a situation where three people on the same corner could violate both ordinances at the same time?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,1995.754,1997.264,Both ordinances at the same time?
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1999.294,2004.877,"Well, could you prosecute them for both?"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2004.877,2011.585,I would suggest that as a practical matter that would not happen.
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2011.585,2012.504,But could you?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2012.504,2014.742,I think we probably could Your Honor.
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2014.742,2016.224,Why could you?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2016.224,2016.892,Pardon me?
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2016.892,2021.21,Why could you if it’s the same conduct and it’s been tried or convicted with another?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2021.21,2022.178,"Well, if they tried of --"
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2022.178,2023.688,Again by giving it a different name?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2030.381,2023.688,No.
1970.117,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2032.36,2036.773,I took you perhaps to be responding that you could charge them under either?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2036.773,2037.767,Either; correct.
1970.117,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2037.767,2038.686,But not both?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2038.686,2058.253,"I don’t think so or I don’t think we could try, that we can set a defender up and shoot him down like that if you will with the variety of charges, such as we often times find in the traffic area where over zealous police officers quite candidly, set somebody up with driving one of the influence of alcohol, reckless operation and a myriad of other things."
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2182.667,2192.873,"Well suppose three people are standing outside of the house of some colleges to just despise the smoking and they’re smoking cigarettes, that would be annoying, wouldn’t it not?"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2192.873,2193.326,No.
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2194.099,2194.44,Oh!
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2195.533,2199.58,"Is your question, if three people stood outside a house and smoke cigarettes?"
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2199.58,2199.929,Yes.
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2199.929,2204.895,"And the person inside determined that it was annoying, would they fall within this ordinance?"
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2206.407,2210.398,"I think, I would be annoying, wouldn’t it?"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2210.398,2231.053,"May it please the Court, based upon the common sense approach to a resolution of these cases as in People versus Harvey from the State of New York and the matter of United States versus Woodward, we’re not talking about the peculiar susceptibilities of some individuals to annoying."
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2231.898,2235.658,Well doesn't say the statute said annoying to the people in the house?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2235.658,2236.289,"Yes, that’s correct."
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2236.289,2240.584,Annoying to person’s passing by or occupants of adjacent building.
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2240.584,2241.062,That’s correct.
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2241.062,2242.244,That’s what the statute says.
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2242.244,2242.747,That’s correct.
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2242.747,2255.152,"So, if you’re smoking cigarettes outside of somebody’s house as opposed to smoking cigarettes and it was against smog and everything, it would be annoying, wouldn’t it?"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2255.152,2276.341,"Well Your Honor, may interpret it as annoying and I don’t interpret it the same way because I think that we are setting up a situation there where we’re appealing to a particular susceptitude or attitude of the individual involved."
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.527,2315.628,"But don’t restrict your answer to Harvard, but take any school and tell me what annoying means?[Laughter]"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2315.628,2316.041,Annoying --
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2316.041,2318.517,"Any school, take anyone?"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2318.517,2319.399,Annoying --
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2319.399,2324.302,That I as a citizen know the limits of annoying.
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2331.866,2334.02,About a half a million.
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2334.02,2342.0,"About a half a million people, because this is to the people in their individual house."
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2354.109,2359.271,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I don’t know."
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2366.794,2369.724,That there are some things that we all agree --
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2369.724,2372.034,"Are annoying, that’s correct."
1970.117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2373.273,2376.009,How do you mean that respectfully?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2376.009,2382.467,"Well, that is precisely why we’re fortunate enough to have courts such as this one and trial courts."
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2430.635,2442.897,Is there any of chance or any -- could it have gone into court anyway and put facts and say yes so that we could know what they have held was annoying?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2442.897,2448.295,"Respectfully Your Honor as I recollect this case, a record was made."
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2451.703,2462.178,"Couldn’t the city have brought up the other, suppose it had a motion to include the facts in the record? Couldn’t it not do so on the --"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2462.178,2464.763,I think we could have certainly Your Honor.
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2464.763,2465.648,You couldn’t have?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2465.648,2467.364,"Could have, yes."
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2467.364,2469.967,So that both of are to be blamed for not having the facts in here?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2469.967,2475.462,"Well, I’ve to conceive, perhaps, that’s true."
1970.117,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2475.462,2484.374,"Ordinarily, the responsibility for the record -- stated the record when it gets to an appellant court is the responsibility of the person who brings this case here."
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2484.374,2484.972,That’s correct.
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2484.972,2492.435,"That’s ordinarily true, but we frequently have the other side make motions to amend the record and something in it."
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2533.45,2544.707,"That’s correct Your Honor and based upon the posture of the case is it appears before you, it’s my request that you affirm the court below."
1970.117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.707,2573.054,"Will you -- you remember -- it seems they've been -- the state seems they’ve been willing to have the statute judged on its face without any reference to the facts since you never altered the facts, you never certified them to your state courts and you’re quite willing to have the decision made about the validity of the statute based just on its face?"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2573.054,2574.202,That’s correct Your Honor.
1970.117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.202,2583.915,"And I take that you’re not only willing to have that done here, but you want the Supreme Court of Ohio heard?"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2583.915,2584.952,That’s correct Your Honor.
1970.117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.952,2586.699,On the face of the statute?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2586.699,2599.998,"We think that these -- we think that the statute on it face is not vague, nor overbroad or does not suffer from any constitutional and infirmity."
1970.117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.998,2609.392,"You don’t concede at all that in some applications, somebody might have some real doubt about whether he was annoying somebody?"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2609.392,2618.497,"Your Honor, I concede that in all human events, we all must make judgments and have some doubt about what our position maybe."
1970.117,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2669.148,2672.507,"What was that citation, 346 F.2d 212?"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2672.507,2673.478,That’s correct Your Honor.
1970.117,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2673.478,2676.046,"And you have the other one, it isn’t cited in your brief either?"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2676.046,2677.056,"No, it’s not Your Honor."
1970.117,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2677.056,2677.719,Harvey --
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2677.719,2687.733,"People versus Harvey, 307 New York 588, 1954."
1970.117,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2687.733,2688.171,Okay.
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2688.171,2692.82,I understand this is in part of labor dispute?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2692.82,2694.883,There are actually five defendants.
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2705.068,2708.741,I’m sure the picketing was annoying to the employer?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2708.741,2719.533,"Well, the picketing was so -- was such that they blocked the public sidewalk, they blocked the street and driveways, would not allowed --"
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2719.533,2720.741,But we don’t have that.
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2720.741,2722.561,That’s correct Your Honor.
1970.117,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2722.561,2725.262,Let me ask you this question on this matter of vagueness.
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2757.395,2776.707,"Responding to Your Honor’s first question Mr. Chief Justice, yes, we have such an ordinance, and I think that ordinance like this ordinance says to the operator of an automobile or one who wishes to harangue his brothers on the street, you must do so as a reasonable man."
1970.117,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2899.25,2900.99,Was he a member of the three-judge-court?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2900.99,2902.47,That’s correct Your Honor.
1970.117,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2902.47,2903.988,In the Northern District of Ohio?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2903.988,2908.329,"Western Division, yes Your Honor, and was sitting as one of a three-judge-court."
1970.117,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2908.329,2908.866,Three-judge-court.
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2908.866,2911.308,Three-judge-court.
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2934.362,2937.427,But you’re not claiming your argument to the law would be good.
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2941.932,2942.946,"I’m sorry Your Honor, I didn’t --"
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2942.946,2953.646,You’re not claiming are you that would be a valid crime if it said nothing in the word except that it shall be a crime in the state for one man to annoy his neighbor?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2953.646,2953.803,No.
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2959.198,2963.355,What you have here is a case where the word could have a good meaning?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2963.355,2964.381,That’s correct.
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2964.381,2970.151,"And could make the statute valid under the rule, but you don’t have the facts?"
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2977.889,2996.001,"Well, I humbly suggest that it was the appellant’s decision to come the road that they did and that we have responded and that this Court at this point should affirm the court of Ohio -- Supreme Court of Ohio."
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2996.001,2998.807,Should we affirm it or to dismiss it?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,2998.807,3001.198,"Well, dismiss the case or affirm."
1970.117,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3005.786,3007.432,On what basis?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,3007.432,3013.868,That the statute is not vague nor overbroad on its face.
1970.117,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3013.868,3015.164,That’s the only issue presented here isn’t it in this appeal?
1970.117,1,16656,a_david_nichols,,3015.164,3017.273,That’s correct.
1970.117,2,39829,robert_r_lavercombe,,3640.722,3642.084,That’s all we’re asking you to do.
1970.117,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3647.48,3648.012,Thank you gentlemen.
