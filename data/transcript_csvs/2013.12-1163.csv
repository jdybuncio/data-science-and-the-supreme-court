2013.12-1163,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.373,"We'll hear argument next in Case 12-1163, Highmark v. Allcare Health Management Systems."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,1112.387,1116.478,"May it please the Court, and Mr. Chief Justice -- I've got that reversed."
2013.12-1163,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1228.41,1251.26,"Even if I assumed that ultimately the claim that you made might have been -- might have had a basis, like the court below agreed, as I read the District Court's decision, it wasn't basing its decision merely on that."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,1320.747,1331.492,"Your Honor, with due deference, there were four issues -- actually five because Allcare lost on one of the issues, the 102 claim."
2013.12-1163,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1590.312,1598.45,"Well, but then it would be four to three on one issue, then it has, as in this case, conflicting cases within its own docket."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,1600.933,1604.681,"Your Honor, I apologize."
2013.12-1163,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1606.008,1623.735,"Well, I'm just saying, the point -- you're quite correct, the Federal Circuit was established to bring about uniformity in patent law, but they seem to have a great deal of disagreement among themselves and are going back and forth in particular cases in this area specifically about what the appropriate approach is."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,1623.735,1625.876,"Your Honor, they do have disagreement."
2013.12-1163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1665.938,1667.53,"Well, they do sometimes."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,1667.53,1668.749,Pardon?
2013.12-1163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1668.749,1671.31,"I mean, there are a lot of areas of the law where they do."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,1737.846,1739.298,I'm not sure.
2013.12-1163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1739.298,1740.627,"Oh, I guarantee."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,1757.338,1769.02,"Your Honor, there are times when it may be difficult to separate facts from law, and in the Markman case, the Court talked about it as being a mongrel type of situation."
2013.12-1163,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1827.232,1843.819,"Well, what about Judge Moore's point that when you're talking about pure issues of patent law maybe you're right, but when you're talking about baselessness, that's something that the district court actually have more experience with, whether it's under EIJA, whether it's under EDPA, whether it's under qualified immunity."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,1847.878,1866.621,"Your Honor, on the question broadly of objective baselessness, one might say that is so, but on the question of objective baselessness in a patent context, in the 285 context, where you've got legal issues, where you've got claim construction issues, they are certainly not better situated than the Federal Circuit."
2013.12-1163,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1928.752,1930.814,"Well, you've got to stop charging such outrageous fees."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,1932.096,1934.875,"--That's the way it used to be with you, Your Honor."
2013.12-1163,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1935.781,1936.5,"Oh, no."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,1936.5,1947.636,"The fact is, when you've got fees like that, there is going to be an appeal."
2013.12-1163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2014.703,2023.761,"Two of the items you mentioned, one was venue, and the other was claim preclusion, issue preclusion."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,2032.554,2034.507,"On what kind of issues, Your Honor?"
2013.12-1163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2034.507,2036.256,You mentioned the venue question.
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,2036.256,2036.819,Yes.
2013.12-1163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2036.819,2040.271,And I was surprised.
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,2043.972,2044.675,Yes.
2013.12-1163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2044.675,2051.297,"But you, I'm sure, have read Mackfeld in the D.C. Circuit--"
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,2051.297,2052.905,"Written by you, Your Honor."
2013.12-1163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2052.905,2081.051,"--one of the problems there, one conduct that was considered unreasonable was suing in a distant forum, very far from where the defendants operated and claim preclusion and issue preclusion come up in all kinds of cases, so there's nothing expert about the Federal Circuit on those issues."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,2081.051,2099.388,"Your Honor, I have to acknowledge that on an issue of whether or not a conduct in a different circuit should be sanctionable in another circuit, the Federal Circuit is certainly not more expert on that kind of an issue than another court."
2013.12-1163,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.999,2181.464,"Well, you know, once you -- once you have a statute that confers discretion on a District Court, you don't expect uniformity of decision-making."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,2201.863,2202.613,Let me--
2013.12-1163,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.613,2203.111,--as part of the District Courts?
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,2203.111,2203.658,--Let me--
2013.12-1163,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.658,2204.955,It seems to me it quite clearly doesn't.
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,2204.955,2206.595,"--Let me address that, Your Honor."
2013.12-1163,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2264.574,2273.211,"Well -- well, you -- you acknowledge that a lot of these cases -- probably most of these cases do not involve exclusively legal issues."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,2273.93,2275.117,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2013.12-1163,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.117,2287.237,And so in -- in all of those cases you're not going to get uniformity because their -- you acknowledge that in -- in the nonlegal issues there is discretion in the District Court.
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,2303.45,2303.936,Your Honor--
2013.12-1163,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2303.936,2317.834,"You're -- you're creating uniformity in one narrow aspect of -- of this decision, that involving legal claims, but there are many other aspects of the decisions that will destroy whatever uniformity you're trying to achieve."
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,2317.834,2320.613,"--Your Honor, I hadn't finished my point, so let me just finish it, which is a response to your point."
2013.12-1163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2383.715,2397.756,The problem with -- the problem is -- the one I think that -- that really seems to be at the heart of what you have to decide is it worth saying to the Court of Appeals: Start distinguishing between which of the two categories it falls into.
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,2439.271,2444.661,"Justice Breyer, my response is that in many cases there won't be a problem distinguishing between law and fact."
2013.12-1163,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2466.617,2467.241,I'm sorry.
2013.12-1163,2,62293,donald_r_dunner,,2581.526,2589.163,"--Your Honor, there are -- there are two facets to the answer I would give to that question."
2013.12-1163,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2701.789,2703.225,"Thank you, Counsel."
