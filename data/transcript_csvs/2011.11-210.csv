2011.11-210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.73,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-210, United States v. Alvarez."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,7.713,10.244,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,55.35,58.646,"General, may I pose a hypothetical?"
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,93.975,106.296,"--I think, Your Honor, it would depend on whether that was, that expression, was reasonably understood by the audience as a statement of fact or as an exercise in political theater."
2011.11-210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,111.951,119.699,"Somewhat dangerous, isn't it, to subject speech to the absolute rule of no protection?"
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,126.964,140.582,"Well, what -- what I would say with respect to that, Your Honor, is that this Court has said in numerous contexts, numerous contexts, that the calculated factual falsehood has no First Amendment value for its own sake."
2011.11-210,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,140.582,145.72,"Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that that's quite correct."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,177.565,179.783,I want to be--
2011.11-210,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.783,180.204,And--
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,180.204,198.913,"--I want to respond with precision, Justice Kennedy, that the -- I think what this Court -- and Gertz is a good example -- has done is to draw a line, and that line -- and I think it is Gertz itself that contains this Court's statement that false statements of fact have no First Amendment value."
2011.11-210,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,204.958,207.676,--But that's in the context of a defamation case.
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,207.676,207.957,Yes.
2011.11-210,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,207.957,220.654,"And you want to take the Gertz case, where it's well understood that defamation is actionable, and say that as a general matter, that the government can inveigh against what's false."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,220.654,244.94,"The -- no, I'm trying to say something much narrower than that, Justice Kennedy, that, with respect to factually false statements, the government has the authority, if it can meet the ""breathing space"" principles that this Court's cases have articulated, along with the recognition that factually false statements have no intrinsic First Amendment value -- those are substantial constraints."
2011.11-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,271.647,288.67,"Suppose -- suppose, General Verrilli, that the decorations were left out and Congress had said: We don't like people saying that they were in the Marine Corps for 25 years when they never served for a single day in any armed force."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,310.035,313.302,"Well, I do think the decorations matter, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.11-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.748,325.562,Why is it much harder to define?
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,339.402,342.354,"That's -- that's exactly our argument, Justice Scalia."
2011.11-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.354,342.386,Okay.
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,360.315,361.453,Yes.
2011.11-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.453,362.779,Why isn't that just as--
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,362.779,366.406,"And if that -- and if that is -- and that's what I was trying to get to, Justice Scalia, is that--"
2011.11-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.406,369.186,"--Their service is demeaned when everybody says, I served in the armed forces."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,369.186,373.355,"--Congress -- under this Court's ""breathing space"" principles, Congress would need to articulate a substantial interest."
2011.11-210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,376.37,376.962,"Well, where do you stop?"
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,403.608,404.687,"I think that that case,--"
2011.11-210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,417.369,419.167,The substantial interest is the one that I've just said.
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,419.167,428.24,"--States -- States do have laws, some States do have laws respecting false claims to have received a diploma from a public university."
2011.11-210,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,428.24,429.551,But that's for submitting resumes.
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,431.66,436.827,If I could get back to Your Honor's point about the nature of the harm.
2011.11-210,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,473.767,479.967,"They were -- they were in the context, though, of recognized torts, intentional infliction for emotional distress."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,513.89,514.689,That -- that is true.
2011.11-210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,558.437,578.648,"Harms -- General, I spent a lot of time going through the multiple cases that you cited in your brief defining the various statutes that basically impose penalties for impersonation of some sort or another."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,675.466,676.827,"Well, I think three points."
2011.11-210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,706.252,708.187,I didn't mention -- neither did Justice Story.
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,708.187,709.391,--And -- but -- and again--
2011.11-210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,709.391,714.765,"He said if you want to regulate a falsehood, it has to cause a harm in this way."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,714.765,721.105,"--And that's why I want to get to -- that's -- but I think it's relevant, Your Honor, to the point about Justice Story in the following way."
2011.11-210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,740.595,741.628,Not really.
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,745.875,747.298,--Right.
2011.11-210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,747.298,754.606,"The government has a right to subpoena you at trial, subject you to oath, and force you to tell the truth."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,754.606,755.402,The statute--
2011.11-210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,755.402,756.31,So if you -- that's a right.
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,758.619,779.925,"--But not a -- as -- as I read what Justice Story is talking about, he was talking about the rights of private citizens, and what I'm saying is there is an additional category of long recognized, well accepted government regulation of factual -- calculated factual falsehood that serves systemic interests."
2011.11-210,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,811.067,817.786,Is your argument limited to statements that a person makes about himself or herself?
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,817.786,818.488,--Yes.
2011.11-210,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,836.839,839.323,What's the principal reason for drawing the line there?
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,859.814,860.422,I think--
2011.11-210,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,860.422,862.906,That would be protected by the First Amendment?
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,862.906,879.804,"--I think that would be -- that would be a case in which under the ""breathing space"" principles that this Court applies when we're talking about calculated factual falsehood, you have to answer a question, which is, how much risk is there of chilling constitutionally protected speech, because when you're talking about somebody else--"
2011.11-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,879.804,880.884,I don't see any difference as far as that risk goes.
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,895.128,898.002,--And that only -- and that--
2011.11-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.002,907.404,"Now this doesn't mean that every falsehood can be punished, because in -- in punishing some falsehoods you -- you risk deterring -- deterring truth."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,907.404,911.51,--And that's -- that was what I was trying to say in response to Justice Alito's question.
2011.11-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.916,914.978,I believe that there is no First Amendment value in -- in falsehood.
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,914.978,928.317,"--You have to answer the question in that case of whether there was a material risk of deterring expression that's truthful because -- what -- who knows whether your grandfather was telling the truth when he -- when he said he won the medal, and so you -- it may be a more difficult case."
2011.11-210,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,932.517,933.114,"General, is there--"
2011.11-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,933.114,943.779,"--Well, the assumption -- the assumption is that it's false, that was -- and that it's not so hard to find out if somebody claimed to have the Medal of Honor and he doesn't."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,981.842,983.749,"Yes, it could be."
2011.11-210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1017.78,1021.749,"I want to follow up on Justice Scalia's question, because I'm not sure I understood."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1054.221,1059.403,"Well, that is the position we've taken in this case, Your Honor."
2011.11-210,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1093.696,1109.395,"--General, what about these State statutes -- there are more of them than I thought that there would be -- that say no demonstrable falsehoods by a political candidate in a political race, and prohibit demonstrable falsehoods by political candidates?"
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1113.783,1125.496,"--I think that those kinds of statutes are going to have a lot harder time getting through the Court's ""breathing space"" analysis because the context in which they arise is one that would create a more significant risk of chill--"
2011.11-210,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1125.496,1128.62,"Well, suppose it says demonstrable falsehoods about yourself--"
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1128.62,1129.825,--I think--
2011.11-210,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1129.825,1138.462,"--just about your qualifications, about what you've done in your life, your -- you know, whether you have a Medal of Honor, whether you've been in military service, whether you've been to college."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1145.349,1146.035,--Yeah.
2011.11-210,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1159.922,1161.86,I guess I don't understand why it would be more chilling in the one case than in the other.
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1167.763,1180.819,"Well, I think the idea would be, in a situation like that one, the government's power and authority is being trained specifically on the political process and statements in the political process, and this is -- this is quite different."
2011.11-210,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1183.568,1192.846,"Well, I assume that that would be in the case of the State statutes because the State feels that it has a specially important interest in maintaining the political sphere free of lies."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1192.846,1210.962,"--I guess the chilling effect seems to me, at least, to be materially different than in a situation like this one, where what we're talking about is a very specific pinpoint thing, one thing: Have you been awarded a military honor or not?"
2011.11-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1224.064,1231.174,"I suppose that even in the commercial context we allow a decent amount of lying, don't we?"
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1234.235,1236.251,Well--
2011.11-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.251,1248.572,"Although -- although, you know, making false representations to sell a product is unlawful, we do allow puffing, don't we?"
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1248.572,1250.21,--Well certainly.
2011.11-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.21,1252.445,You won't buy it cheaper anywhere else.
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1252.445,1253.884,That's -- that's certainly right.
2011.11-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.321,1261.395,So maybe we allow a certain amount of puffing in political speech as well.
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1261.395,1262.849,--And I do think--
2011.11-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.849,1264.113,"Nobody believes all that stuff, right?"
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1264.113,1269.174,"--I do think the Court's -- I do think the Court's breathing space analysis would call for that, I think that's true."
2011.11-210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1271.061,1289.572,"I suppose it might have something to do with, whether called collateral or not, I mean, I would think the concern in the midst of a political campaign is you have the U.S. attorney or the deputy district attorney bringing a -- filing a prosecution of someone 2 weeks before the election saying, you lied about this or that and maybe there would have to be a deposition or maybe there would have to be a trial."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1290.758,1291.897,"Nothing at all, Your Honor."
2011.11-210,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1293.476,1300.802,"Well, it seems to me your best analogy is the trademark analogy, Olympic case, et cetera."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1334.584,1362.763,"--Yes, and that's the government's interest here, and we do think that that kind of -- I think, Your Honor, that the reason that I think our -- we have a lot of slippery slope type questions here today, but I would urge the Court not to -- not to decline to make a sound decision about this statute based on concern about not being able to draw the line, because this statute is as narrow as you can get."
2011.11-210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1362.763,1365.542,"General, but I have a problem, which is it's not as narrow as it could get."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1461.517,1467.218,"As a father of a 20-year-old daughter, so do I, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.11-210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1483.62,1487.164,Or I'm not going to do this because the medal has been debased.
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1487.164,1489.208,"--That's not -- well, that's not what the honor system is about."
2011.11-210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1557.207,1565.44,"But the reality here is that this gentleman was publicized, deriled for what he did."
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1571.862,1589.118,"--But, given that this is a category of calculated factual falsehood, we think the government has the authority and the constitutional -- and the constitutional space to try to deter this kind of speech, as well as allow for private attorneys."
2011.11-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1590.057,1592.696,Did the military -- did the military ask for this?
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1601.599,1613.283,"--It did not, Justice Ginsburg, but under Article I, section 8, Congress has substantial authority to regulate our armed forces, get substantial deference."
2011.11-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.291,1627.949,"Did the Commander in Chief sign that, that legislation?"
2011.11-210,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1627.949,1628.995,"Yes, he did, Your Honor."
2011.11-210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1630.43,1631.508,"Thank you, Mr. Verrilli."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1639.865,1650.577,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Stolen Valor Act criminalizes pure speech in the form of bare falsity, a mere telling of a lie."
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1666.761,1672.898,"What is -- what is the First Amendment value in a lie, pure lie?"
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1672.898,1674.505,Just a pure lie?
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1678.614,1679.722,The value of what?
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1679.722,1681.032,Personal autonomy.
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1681.032,1682.752,What does that mean?
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1682.752,1685.704,"Well, that we get to -- we get to exaggerate and create--"
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1685.704,1686.983,"No, not exaggerate -- lie."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1686.983,1697.477,"--Well, when we create our own persona, we're often making up things about ourselves that we want people to think about us, and that can be valuable."
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1706.399,1709.3,"Well, but that was for literary purposes."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1721.189,1722.78,--Perhaps.
2011.11-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1728.248,1743.273,"Do you really think that there is -- that the First Amendment -- that there is First Amendment value in a bald-faced lie about a purely factual statement that a person makes about himself, because that person would like to create a particular persona?"
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1750.802,1758.859,"Yes, Your Honor, so long as it doesn't cause imminent harm to another person or imminent harm to a government function."
2011.11-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1758.859,1759.67,Obvious example.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1762.092,1765.543,"Well, that's right."
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1765.543,1766.795,That's not a statement about one's self.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1768.823,1769.338,And that's--
2011.11-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1769.338,1769.666,Are you hiding Jews in the cellar?
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1769.666,1770.212,--Excuse me.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1800.183,1812.521,"--Well, perhaps, just dealing with an example under the Stolen Valor Act, if a grandfather were to make up a story that he had won a medal in order to persuade a grandchild to--"
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1812.521,1814.022,In order to--
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1814.022,1815.114,--to join the military--
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1815.114,1829.812,"--It seems to me that that's missing the limitation that the government has read into this statute: Not damage, not for parody, not to avoid the discovery of someone who should be hidden, not in order to do something with respect to one's grandson."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1837.777,1846.633,"--Well, another value is the fact that the purpose of the First Amendment was a limit on government power."
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1855.536,1865.593,"Well, of course they do in countless areas, the state does, whether you're talking about defamation, trademark, perjury, all sorts of things."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1870.873,1871.949,"Well, that's right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.523,1891.708,"Well, sometimes the harm is just impairment of governmental purposes, such as section 1001, which criminalizes the making of a false statement to any Federal agent, for Pete's sake."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1909.295,1911.84,"Well, we believe there is a difference there, Your Honor."
2011.11-210,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1926.475,1931.018,"But, Mr. Libby, you've suggested to us that we should apply strict scrutiny to all of these cases."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1944.094,1946.84,"Well, no, Your Honor."
2011.11-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1974.92,1982.622,Do we give some deference to Congress as to whether there is a harm to governmental purposes or do we make it up ourselves?
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,1997.022,1997.63,Well--
2011.11-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.63,2000.395,By charlatans.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2005.422,2011.918,"--Justice Scalia, it's not entirely clear what Congress thought here because Congress held no hearings on this."
2011.11-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2015.14,2020.809,"Well, it's a matter -- it's a matter of common sense that it seems to me that it demeans the medal."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2030.898,2037.128,--Wearing medals is a slightly different category because there you're dealing with conduct rather than content.
2011.11-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2037.128,2038.283,"Well, I'm not so sure."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2053.109,2059.403,It may be or it may be in doubt under certain situations where one is wearing a medal.
2011.11-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2064.917,2075.052,"I think it is, the whole purpose of the person who puts the medal on his tuxedo that he didn't earn is an expressive purpose."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2077.16,2080.175,"It may be, Your Honor."
2011.11-210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2084.032,2084.719,Why?
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2097.057,2099.088,That's right.
2011.11-210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2106.463,2108.912,So you think wearing--
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2108.912,2110.304,"--this provision, that it could be."
2011.11-210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2110.304,2121.003,"--that the wearing of a military decoration that you haven't earned, that that's also of questionable consistency with the First Amendment?"
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2121.003,2122.579,It may be.
2011.11-210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2126.872,2127.952,No circumstances.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2132.811,2148.835,"If -- if there is -- if Congress does not have a non-speech purpose for prohibiting the wearing of the medals, then if it's strictly an expressive purpose, then, yes, there would be a significant First Amendment problem."
2011.11-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2148.835,2150.598,"Well, don't you think that's the case?"
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2154.489,2157.16,Well -- and that very well may be.
2011.11-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2165.422,2176.353,You acknowledge that the First Amendment allows the prohibition or the regulation of false speech if it causes at least certain kinds of harms.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2209.873,2227.273,I believe -- what we believe the right way of looking at this is you -- you determine whether or not there is imminent harm or a significant risk of imminent harm to an individual or to a government function that would result from the speech.
2011.11-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2227.273,2232.081,"When you say imminent, you mean -- what do you mean by that?"
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2232.081,2238.922,"I guess I'm suggesting the Brandenburg standard, which is--"
2011.11-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2238.922,2246.482,"Well, if that's the standard then most of the prosecutions for making false statements to a Federal law enforcement officer are not going to survive, are they?"
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2246.482,2251.044,"--Well, but the issue is what about the law."
2011.11-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2269.754,2273.175,"Well, then you're not really talking about imminent harm, I don't think."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2274.282,2285.387,"--Well, when one lies to a government investigator, presumably you're doing it in order to send them in the wrong direction, even if it doesn't do that."
2011.11-210,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2305.474,2316.268,"Mr. Libby, let's suppose that I agree with Gertz that there is no constitutional value in a false statement of fact, and the reason why we protect some false statements of fact is to protect truthful speech."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2330.59,2336.947,"--Your Honor, it's not that it may necessarily chill any truthful speech."
2011.11-210,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2347.971,2351.254,"So, boy, I mean, that's a big concession, Mr. Libby."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2363.027,2373.848,"Well -- we do -- well, we do have the situation where we believe the statute currently does cover: Someone could be prosecuted for engaging in parody or satire or exaggeration."
2011.11-210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2378.02,2393.95,"But the government has said: That's not how we read the statute, and the courts read statutes to avoid a constitutional collision."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2406.554,2423.438,--Then it's still our position that it's still a -- that all speech is presumptively protected unless we go back and it fits into one of the historical categories of speech that this Court has found historically is unprotected.
2011.11-210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2430.921,2432.278,"Counselor, it might--"
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2432.278,2436.899,I don't understand the government to argue that the speech at issue here is totally unprotected.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2458.876,2462.921,I suppose I read the government's argument differently.
2011.11-210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2486.131,2496.908,"--May I -- if I understood your argument, you're saying historically we have not protected false statements that cause harm."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2499.345,2501.938,"That's correct, yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2501.938,2502.406,All right.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2563.79,2576.42,"Well, in the situation with intentional infliction of emotional distress, you're arguing with an instantaneous harm, a mental distress that results from the false statement."
2011.11-210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2585.869,2599.533,"So why isn't the outrage that medal winners, legitimately entitled medal winners, experience in seeing fake people, hearing fake people claim a medal, why isn't that comparable?"
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2599.533,2609.672,"--Well, I don't believe that fits into the same category of mental distress that we look at in intentional infliction of emotional distress."
2011.11-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2647.657,2666.148,"It seems to me what you're arguing is that we should determine that there are certain harms that are sufficient to allow the prohibition of a false statement and there are certain harms that are not sufficient, irrespective of what judgment Congress made about the significance of those harms."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2667.287,2669.318,That's certainly part of it.
2011.11-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2682.862,2684.516,Why not?
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2766.733,2767.31,--There are.
2011.11-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.399,2785.287,"The government is going to hire people to follow, you know -- is that realistic?"
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2785.287,2787.783,"--Well, what--"
2011.11-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2787.783,2789.284,"I mean, there is a sanction."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2815.851,2818.663,"--Well, Justice Scalia, isn't that exactly what's happening right now with this law?"
2011.11-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2843.571,2853.768,"Is there anything else -- under that circumstance, that the threat of criminal prosecution might discourage from lying, who would never be caught."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2865.591,2872.107,"Well, of course if you're never caught, then under the government's theory, then no one has been harmed individually or--"
2011.11-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2872.107,2874.934,Not under my theory.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2903.373,2903.716,--Sure.
2011.11-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2931.053,2936.925,How about giving a Medal of Shame to those who have falsely claimed to have earned the Medal of Valor?
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2938.017,2942.891,"--Well, Your Honor -- actually, that's certainly something the government could do."
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2942.891,2944.919,"Well, not under your theory, right?"
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2952.667,2964.694,"Well, there is a significant difference between a criminal sanction that puts someone in prison versus simply exposing them for what they are, which is a liar."
2011.11-210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2975.316,2987.762,"Suppose -- suppose the statute were amended, as has been proposed, to require an intent to obtain anything of value."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,2987.762,2990.059,That would turn the law into a fraud statute.
2011.11-210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2995.963,3004.347,But that wouldn't -- that wouldn't reach this speaker.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3009.519,3012.205,"Well, that's -- I mean, that's not what we have here."
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3015.594,3017.626,How do we -- how do we know that?
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3019.654,3019.657,Yes.
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3019.657,3023.809,Doesn't it help a politician to have a Congressional Medal of Honor?
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3023.809,3026.184,"Perhaps, Your Honor."
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3038.242,3050.268,"But it seems to me that your willingness to say that this statute is valid so long as there's some benefit to the person who lies, it's an awfully big concession."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3050.268,3061.125,"Well, it would -- if it -- again, if Congress were to amend the law to require that it be done with the intent to obtain a thing of value, again, it becomes fraud."
2011.11-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3063.857,3066.809,"So a thing of value, it has to be something of commercial value, right?"
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3078.582,3079.959,"Well, Your Honor--"
2011.11-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3079.959,3082.63,"You have to get a penny out of it, right?"
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3082.63,3088.565,"--As I understand the proposed amendment, it just says anything of a non de minimis value."
2011.11-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3092.251,3094.578,Just a basic definition of fraud in the criminal law.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3094.578,3095.67,--That's right.
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3102.229,3113.534,"So if he -- so if he makes this statement at a debate when he's running for office, then you can prosecute him, because getting the office is presumably something of value."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3116.677,3119.285,"Perhaps, Your Honor."
2011.11-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3140.589,3144.633,"What if he just gets the cheers of the crowd, he's up there."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3151.788,3154.705,It -- it could be.
2011.11-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3160.465,3163.479,But that's not -- the answer is would the First Amendment permit that.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3163.479,3169.024,"--That's a difficult question, Your Honor."
2011.11-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3169.024,3171.353,"Well, that's sort of the question we have to answer here."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3173.15,3173.821,Sure.
2011.11-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3175.1,3181.675,Suppose what the person gets is -- is a date with a potential rich spouse.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3182.724,3197.17,"Your Honor, I think when it comes -- when you get into the situation where you're getting something like a date, I do not know that -- I certainly wouldn't consider that a non de minimis thing of value, but--"
2011.11-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3197.17,3201.371,Some people might have a different opinion.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3202.7,3210.71,"--Well, that -- that -- and that may be, which is why, should that ultimately become the law, courts would have to look at that very closely."
2011.11-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3210.71,3228.187,"Well, how would it work in the law now, where we have similar statutes, and there's an additional requirement when you're imitating, say, a Federal officer or somebody else you shouldn't, you have to perform an overt act that asserts authority that the impersonator claims to have."
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3251.752,3263.56,"Well, when you get into the issue of impersonation, then you're -- the Court perhaps would be assessing it under the amount of imminent harm to an individual that can--"
2011.11-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3263.56,3264.621,Nothing to do with harm.
2011.11-210,1,31595,jonathan_d_libby,,3290.127,3297.326,"--It would be important, certainly in the First Amendment context, to limit the language as much as possible."
2011.11-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3330.53,3331.454,"Thank you, Mr. Libby."
2011.11-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3338.777,3346.526,"My -- my only -- one of my questions is the slippery slope problem, college degrees and so forth."
2011.11-210,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3347.759,3349.43,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-210,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3362.627,3364.175,But--
2011.11-210,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3364.175,3365.922,--the statute's got to be narrowly drawn.
2011.11-210,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3367.139,3367.72,--College degrees.
2011.11-210,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3367.72,3382.46,"--Well, as I think I said in my -- in my opening statement, that -- I actually think that's a case in which you could argue that one either way, because there might be, if the government articulated a substantial interest in protecting its--"
