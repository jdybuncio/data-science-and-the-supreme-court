2011.10-577,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.154,"We will hear argument next in Case 10-577, Kawashima v. Holder."
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,7.004,13.474,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,152.212,164.337,"How would you prove fraud and deceit beyond proving that the person lied, intentionally lied?"
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,173.026,177.93,It's the intention to deceive or the intention to defraud.
2011.10-577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.147,185.268,Isn't intentionally lying -- doesn't that mean that you intend to deceive?
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,185.268,186.12,"--It does not, Your Honor."
2011.10-577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,186.12,186.769,It doesn't?
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,186.769,195.891,"It does not mean, because you are saying a false -- making a false statement, that that is evidence of an intent to deceive."
2011.10-577,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,195.891,213.77,"Mr. Whalen, the common definition of deceit is acting -- intentionally giving a false impression, intentionally giving a false impression with the intent that someone will act on it."
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,226.745,244.556,"Justice Ginsburg, the difference I'm trying to ask the Court to consider, it is the intent which is an element of fraud and deceit."
2011.10-577,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,257.632,261.668,But why isn't it obvious?
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,280.831,293.305,"Because the requirements, Your Honor, of 7206 is a finding of -- of simply making a false statement."
2011.10-577,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.852,315.687,And that it's willful.
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,316.77,317.97,"--Pardon me, Your Honor?"
2011.10-577,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,317.97,319.039,That it's willful.
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,324.091,326.043,"Yes, Your Honor, but as this Court--"
2011.10-577,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,326.043,326.676,So that is not correct.
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,343.838,346.956,"--If I may, Your Honor."
2011.10-577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.385,421.604,You know that it's false when you say it.
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,426.456,430.193,Willfully means intentionally.
2011.10-577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,433.062,434.462,I don't want another adverb.
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,445.286,446.136,--Yes.
2011.10-577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.136,446.736,Okay.
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,451.856,459.879,Deceit involves an intention to induce somebody to act.
2011.10-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,479.793,481.043,"I'm sorry, but I'm a little bit lost here."
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,509.578,512.68,I -- I do say reliance is generally is what happens.
2011.10-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,537.545,540.581,So it also had to prove that the government relied?
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,542.366,554.107,"--I'm saying that the government -- if the government wanted to prove fraud or deceit, they -- that would be an element of the crime of tax evasion, 72--"
2011.10-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,554.107,566.065,"I'm -- I'm not even sure why, because under tax evasion you can be charged with tax evasion merely for avoiding the payment of tax."
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,584.11,596.918,"--The government would have to prove fraud or deceit, because an intent to evade is -- the Court -- the -- the government has to prove--"
2011.10-577,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,596.918,603.572,"If there's a -- if there are cases that say otherwise, what does that do to your argument?"
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,614.462,615.912,--I would be surprised by those--
2011.10-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,615.912,625.335,"Well, suppose somebody goes -- he goes to a country where we have no extradition treaty, takes all his assets and writes a postcard to the IRS once a month saying ha-ha-ha."
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,632.007,637.411,--Then the government would bring an action under the--
2011.10-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,637.411,639.011,"Well, 7201."
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,689.778,699.466,"--What's wrong with it, Your Honor, is that what we're talking about is the aggravated felony statute."
2011.10-577,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,901.061,901.528,I'm sorry.
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,905.149,906.115,--Yes.
2011.10-577,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,908.698,909.4,Okay.
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,909.4,914.202,That is the exceptions to the running of the statute of limitations.
2011.10-577,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,914.202,916.285,Do we have it in the briefs?
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,916.285,918.904,I have it in my reply brief.
2011.10-577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.141,924.574,Do you have the text of it?
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,935.615,936.165,Yes.
2011.10-577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.91,1035.095,"Well, why?"
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1076.153,1083.89,Anyone who leaves the country with an intent to avoid tax is committing tax evasion.
2011.10-577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1083.89,1084.64,That's right.
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1085.942,1086.809,And that is--
2011.10-577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.809,1090.077,Without lying -- without lying -- without making a single lie.
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1090.077,1099.432,"--What I'm saying is that fraud, such as you suggest, Your Honor, is going to be an aggravated felony."
2011.10-577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.269,1127.652,Yes.
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1141.509,1147.229,"7201 involves, I'm suggesting--"
2011.10-577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.229,1149.848,An attempt to evade or defeat:
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1170.493,1201.195,"--Well, the point I am trying to make, Your Honor, is that if your example is an example of fraud and deceit, which I agree it is, then a crime of fraud and deceit would not be in (M)(i) because it would BE -- it would already be captured in (M)(i) if the government's position was upheld."
2011.10-577,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1201.195,1206.333,But the point that is being made is not that it's fraud and deceit.
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1241.006,1246.743,That would be a violation of one of the other internal revenue crimes.
2011.10-577,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1246.743,1250.895,Would it be evasion simply not to report your income?
2011.10-577,0,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,1250.895,1260.736,"If the government chose to prove that it was an attempt to evade the tax, it would."
2011.10-577,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1335.301,1336.218,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1348.025,1350.393,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1364.137,1373.576,"Mr. Gannon, do you think that you can commit tax evasion without committing either fraud or deceit, and are there cases that show that?"
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1373.576,1381.765,The cases that we cited in our brief on page 34 that discuss this are ones that are evasion of payment cases as opposed to evasion of assessment cases.
2011.10-577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1411.801,1413.318,What about just not filing returns?
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1413.318,1417.938,Just not filing a return is probably not going to be enough to establish tax evasion.
2011.10-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1433.464,1444.855,"I mean, I suppose what confuses me is when somebody is convicted of 7201, they can't -- they are estopped from contesting a civil fraud suit, isn't that right?"
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1456.813,1469.737,"Well, certainly in the context of the civil tax fraud penalty, the Tax Court has concluded that intent to evade is synonymous with an understatement due to fraud."
2011.10-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1522.105,1523.305,"Counsel, what if you do--"
2011.10-577,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1523.305,1523.571,Excuse me.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1532.894,1534.596,You mean--
2011.10-577,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1534.596,1536.663,Any tax crime.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1536.663,1537.281,--Any tax crime--
2011.10-577,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1537.281,1538.265,"Felonies, I should say."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1538.265,1542.667,--There are several tax offenses that don't necessarily involve fraud or deceit.
2011.10-577,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1559.711,1561.761,Does that fall under tax evasion or that's a separate statute?
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1561.761,1562.746,--That's not tax evasion.
2011.10-577,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1565.698,1566.465,I cut you off.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1567.432,1583.157,"I was saying that I already mentioned to Justice Scalia that section 7203, all of these offenses I'm talking about, are in 26 U.S.C. 7203, the willful failure to file a return or to pay tax or maintain records or supply information doesn't necessarily involve fraud or deceit."
2011.10-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1620.099,1625.07,"Counsel, what -- what is your answer to your friend's 6501(c)(i) argument?"
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1625.07,1654.856,"Well, my answer is that I don't think it proves really any more than the collateral estoppel cases in the civil fraud context the provision that we're talking about is not reprinted in any of the briefs, but 6501(c)(1) is an exception that -- that lifts the limitation on when the IRS can levy an assessment or seek collection; and it refers to the case of a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade tax."
2011.10-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1671.532,1679.805,"Well, no, but I think your friend's argument, which had some appeal, is 7206 is fraud and false statements."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1691.779,1698.433,"--Well, I -- I think if you look to (c)(2) it also refers to a willful attempt in any manner to defeat or evade tax."
2011.10-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1743.728,1748.213,--But Scharton was a very old case which had been distinguished away by many courts.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1753.667,1768.659,"--Well, to this day section 6531, which is the statute of limitations provision which we do reprint in our appendix, includes provisions that refer not only generally to offenses involving fraud but also specifically to a tax evasion offense."
2011.10-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1784.536,1815.705,"--I mean, the paradoxical thing about your argument is that one, it makes us think that Congress was just being hypervigilant about this problem of making sure that tax evasion offenses were covered, even though tax evasion offenses almost always do involve fraud or deceit, but Congress was thinking about these hypothetical possibilities that maybe there was going to be some conviction out there that would not involve fraud or deceit, and so Congress is being super-careful about this."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1827.196,1843.308,"--But Justice Kagan, we don't think it's superfluous, in part because of the evasion of payment cases we are talking about, but I think also if you look at the context of the rest of paragraph 43, the aggravated felony definition, you'll see that there are several other provisions that have significant overlap in them."
2011.10-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1862.603,1867.857,So our rule of statutory construction when it comes to this aggravated felony statute is that superfluity doesn't matter?
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1867.857,1869.975,"--No, Justice Kagan, I think that offense."
2011.10-577,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1924.094,1927.978,But 7206 is the lesser offense.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1977.678,1986.684,--The reason why we don't think that's appropriate is in part because as I have explained there -- there is some aspect of which (M)(ii) is not superfluous.
2011.10-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2032.513,2037.298,"What about -- what about -- Suppose we suppose that didn't even exist here, 7201."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2094.56,2100.964,"--Well, I don't think that the common law definitions of fraud and deceit are the ones that this Court has always applied in the context--"
2011.10-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2100.964,2101.481,"No, no, not always."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2108.304,2109.254,--So--
2011.10-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2109.254,2119.992,"And in most of these M's and A's and B's and C's, and so forth, they refer to statutes by number, so most of it although not all of it is very specific."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2125.579,2126.598,--In the--
2011.10-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2126.598,2127.631,Traditional elements.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2127.631,2136.221,"--In the criminal context the Court has recognized that fraud offenses don't require the government to prove reliance or damages, and that makes sense."
2011.10-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2143.458,2144.06,"No, no, no."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2149.964,2151.064,And--
2011.10-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2151.064,2158.217,"Which he may or may not I mean, when you commit -- a person commits perjury may or may not have intended that a victim rely to his detriment."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2160.336,2170.192,"--We do not have to prove as a separate element that there is reliance or intended reliance here, but we do need to prove what we think satisfies the plain meaning of the term deceit."
2011.10-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2183.368,2184.052,Deceit can mean that.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2184.052,2187.987,"--does not believe to be true or correct, and it's all done willfully."
2011.10-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2187.987,2194.242,"No, the tort didn't involve The tort involved the same element of fraud which you don't want to rely on."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2194.242,2197.611,"That -- that's right, and we think here Congress has used the -- the term--"
2011.10-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2197.611,2205.031,Is there any -- is there any evidence of what -- I mean is there any argument other than that you just think that and you could argue the other way?
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2206.133,2218.108,"--Well, I think that Congress did use the terms disjunctively here, and I think that the -- now the plain meaning of deceit it sort of operates in the opposite direction of the one you are talking about, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2260.602,2264.22,"Could I make sure, Mr. Gannon, that I understand your argument about superfluidity?"
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2288.085,2291.406,"Well, I think that is a factual matter, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2291.889,2292.739,A factual matter argument.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2292.739,2300.179,"--We were observing that as a factual matter, those evasion-of-payment cases probably would not happen without there being acts of concealment."
2011.10-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2300.179,2301.162,And that's what I'm asking.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2306.166,2322.175,"I don't believe that I can, but I think that to the extent that the Court has looked into the elements of the offense in 7201, if they are talking about evasion of payment, that will not necessarily require deceptive acts of concealment."
2011.10-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2323.108,2334.566,"I know, but we have a very And active IRS which prosecutes lots of tax cases, and you are saying that it just never prosecutes tax cases under this section that don't involve affirmative acts of fraud."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2334.566,2335.516,--Well--
2011.10-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2335.516,2342.589,And that makes me wonder why Congress was so worried about this problem that it ignored normal rules of statutory interpretation.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2342.589,2374.643,"--Well -- And I believe that the reason that they were worried could be because of the Scharton decision which this Court had already said that evasion does not necessarily require fraud because the textual cues in 7201 are much further from fraud and deceit than those in 7206, that there's also -- there would be less certainty, even assuming that Congress was well aware of the established practice at the Federal level of having 7201 tax evasion cases be compared with fraud, this is also a provision that applies to State and foreign offenses."
2011.10-577,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2381.73,2410.999,"Well, one of the problems that was brought up in the amicus brief which actually was considered, that reading the (M)(i) to include 7206 offenses would also -- would bring in offenses that are merely misdemeanors at the State and local level, it would really swell the category of tax crimes that lead to deportation."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2471.205,2477.609,"Well, that may well be the consequence of the definition that Congress has adopted here of aggravated felony."
2011.10-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2510.146,2514.348,"Let me go up and start with I mean, if this Justice Ginsburg's first question."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2533.273,2539.261,"--Congress has given us two different metrics of determining whether those, whether those offenses are aggravated felonies."
2011.10-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2551.152,2555.555,The government's view is that of course you have to meet the other requirements.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2573.7,2578.068,"--In the beginning when of the I think most perjury amount of loss was $200,000."
2011.10-577,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2580.604,2581.57,But all I need are a few.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2599.648,2608.937,"--There -- Yes, there are such Sometimes they go under (S), which is the paragraph for perjury, which was actually not in existence when (M)(i) was added to the statute."
2011.10-577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2616.974,2621.676,"Well, I'm confused by the $10,000 requirement."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2623.878,2625.897,It does not need to be an element of the offense.
2011.10-577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2627.932,2632.383,"Just the consequence of the fraud or deceit, right?"
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2632.383,2637.121,"--It needs to be tied to the offensive conviction, under this Court's decision in Ninja."
2011.10-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2743.105,2761.416,"But It would have been perfectly easy for Congress to write a provision which said just in case that -- you know, just in case this decision called Scharton has any effect, we mean tax evasion, too, without writing it in this way that appears to exclude all other tax offenses."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2761.416,2768.904,"--I don't see how -- if Congress wanted to exclude all other tax offenses, I think they should have put that exception in (M)(i)."
2011.10-577,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2779.212,2784.516,"Well, that's just arguing against our application of the normal rule of avoiding superfluidity where we can."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2784.516,2786.349,"--Well, yes."
2011.10-577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.627,2833.895,They still wouldn't -- no.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2837.681,2839.216,"Well, I -- they would be--"
2011.10-577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2839.216,2846.303,"You use the mail to avoid -- Still, what you are being prosecuted for is use of the mail to defraud."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2846.303,2859.98,"--But the -- I mean, as I understand Petitioner's argument, it is the fact that (M)(ii) refers to revenue loss that is the thing that makes it pull in or define a category of cases involving tax offenses."
2011.10-577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2879.108,2879.858,But he put it wrong.
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2886.364,2893.268,Then -- I just don't see how the reference to a single provision of 7201 refers to all other tax provisions--
2011.10-577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2893.268,2894.518,"Well, it's not just that."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2943.967,2953.739,"--None of the courts of appeals has had any difficulty concluding that the government is a victim when it loses more than $10,000 in a fraud case, or indeed in a tax evasion case."
2011.10-577,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3044.063,3049.201,"There is a technical aspect of this case I don't understand, and maybe you can explain it."
2011.10-577,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3061.424,3069.964,"She -- although it -- the statute itself refers to aiding, assisting, procuring or advising, it's not a traditional aiding and abetting statute."
2011.10-577,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3119.297,3120.03,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-577,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,3122.999,3138.091,"My colleague mentioned the Yermian case, which is in our brief, but I failed to present it to the Court today."
2011.10-577,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3330.15,3332.483,Although it's not a criminal statute.
2011.10-577,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,3332.483,3334.268,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
2011.10-577,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3334.268,3336.137,It's not a criminal statute.
2011.10-577,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,3336.137,3348.194,This Court in the Fong case said that the rule of lenity applies to an immigration case.
2011.10-577,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3375.779,3381.749,"There -- there's one technical feature, too, that I also didn't understand."
2011.10-577,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,3413.97,3421.91,The threshold amount is not an issue in the case.
2011.10-577,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3421.91,3434.967,"I would just like to know how we got -- how the $245,000 revenue loss was calculated, given that the crime that was charged, the failure was to report only $76,000?"
2011.10-577,2,43461,thomas_j_whalen,,3434.967,3435.7,I don't know.
