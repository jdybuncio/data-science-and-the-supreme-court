1974.73-296,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,35.376,We'll hear arguments next in Huffman against Pursue.
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,38.253,42.106,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,71.516,79.159,"You'll get to the second point if we agree with you on the first, is that correct?"
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,79.159,79.726,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,80.413,80.95,Is that correct?
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,80.95,83.074,"Unfortunately, yes sir."
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,83.074,84.349,And why is that unfortunate?
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,84.349,85.817,"Well, I --"
1974.73-296,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,85.817,87.312,In some which way we can go on?
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,87.312,95.281,"Well, that's -- what I'm saying here is, I would much prefer that the second issue also be decided but because of other --"
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,95.281,96.199,But the circumstances (Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,96.199,98.744,I think the first is the more important issue.
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,99.473,102.086,And if we do agree with you on the first issue.
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,103.88,106.954,That's right Your Honor.
1974.73-296,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,321.208,325.29,"Well, what do you conceive the res or res to be here Mr. Clancy?"
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,325.29,332.72,"Well, Your Honors, it's the property involve the public nuisance concept, the tax of property itself, the business location."
1974.73-296,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,345.673,347.926,"You mean like padlocking the building, (Voice Overlap)?"
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,347.926,348.905,That's the same thing.
1974.73-296,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,383.389,386.054,Is there no way they can purge themselves?
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,386.054,387.663,"Well, there is under the statute."
1974.73-296,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,396.262,406.358,"Where was it, they came in with a -- by posting a bond and showing that they were going to run a -- build a garage there, they're selling automobiles, they don't (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,406.358,412.803,"No question, but the Court would be forced to say that that use was entirely correct and permitted."
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,448.655,457.659,Are you going to spend anymore time Mr. Clancy on the question of the propriety of the District Court's acting at all?
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,457.659,458.188,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,459.004,460.771,"Is that it -- essential question, isn't it?"
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,461.917,467.843,"No, I just want to touch -- I'm just now touching upon why the opinion itself and why it is wrong?"
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,467.843,468.123,I see.
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,468.123,469.049,Then I'm going to comeback to the procedure --
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,469.049,470.666,"I see, fine."
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,470.666,478.881,Touching upon the -- my one answer to the opinion is that their legal reasoning is wrong and they asked themselves the wrong question.
1974.73-296,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,622.904,634.442,"Mr. Clancy, there is some difference between abating a whorehouse or speak easy and abating something that sells books just because of the First Amendment, isn't there?"
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,634.442,657.273,"No, not necessarily Your Honor, if you say that, the public nuisance that you're going against is the course of business and you limit it to a type of situation where the entire business or that part of business is -- the substantial portion of it is directed entirely to purposes of lewdness then you have proceeded against on a proper manner."
1974.73-296,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,777.07,796.985,"I take it what you're saying Mr. Clancy that while there maybe a difference between the First Amendment case and some other kinds of cases, that once you have demonstrated the obscenity factor, then it's outside the protection of the First Amendment as this Court has held and it's like any other case."
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,796.985,801.327,"Oh, absolutely, they'll come in the court every time and say presumptively as First Amendment."
1974.73-296,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,806.994,813.629,"You concede that there was a presumption against prior restraint here but you've overcome it, is that your claim?"
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,813.629,813.966,"Granted, yes sir."
1974.73-296,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,813.966,814.845,By proof.
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,814.845,817.138,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-296,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1157.042,1163.609,Does the Federal District Court in this case set in Lima or do you have Toledo?
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1163.609,1164.687,"Toledo, Your Honor."
1974.73-296,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1164.687,1169.088,"But in the Allen County proceeding, the state proceeding was in Lima?"
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1169.088,1177.005,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-296,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.241,1333.996,What was -- was their a motion to remand made?
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1333.996,1336.0,"There were two, not one but two."
1974.73-296,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1396.057,1409.84,"It may appear somewhere in this record voluminous as it is but I have missed it, is the state Attorney General figure in these proceedings or as each County or District autonomous?"
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1409.84,1411.185,He took no part Your Honor.
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1419.02,1424.537,"The statute, the prosecuting attorney can initiate the action or any private citizen?"
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1424.537,1425.264,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1425.264,1428.865,"But not the state attorney general, excepted so far as he may be a private citizen?"
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1428.865,1429.951,That's right.
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1431.506,1432.123,As in -- initiating this --
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1432.123,1433.438,Prior to --
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1433.438,1433.937,-- nuisance abatement action.
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1433.937,1435.444,"No, I was thinking -- I was thinking about a different --"
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1435.444,1437.949,That can be done by any county prosecutor --
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1437.949,1438.947,A private citizen.
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1438.947,1439.556,Or a private citizen.
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1439.556,1440.562,Or a prosecutor.
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1440.562,1441.338,Correct?
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1441.338,1442.057,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-296,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1442.057,1450.499,Then Ohio is like the majority of the states that the Attorney General does not control all the litigation in all of the counties and districts?
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1450.499,1451.108,That's right Your Honor.
1974.73-296,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1451.108,1453.212,The prosecuting attorney is in control.
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1453.212,1455.286,Yes sir.
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1642.212,1648.374,"Mr. Clancy, you didn't -- I don't think I heard you mention that the case of Younger against Harris, do you think that's --"
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1648.374,1648.823,No Your Honor.
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1649.721,1650.689,It has nothing to do with this.
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1650.689,1656.893,-- should be decided on the matter of the res exception which is a jurisdictional matter.
1974.73-296,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1695.344,1698.079,"So, you don't think Younger against Harris has any relevance here?"
1974.73-296,0,29667,james_j_clancy,,1698.079,1701.051,Why -- if you abandoned my -- I think it does.
1974.73-296,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1727.661,1729.059,Mr. Deitch.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,1729.059,1733.199,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.73-296,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1750.655,1760.477,"Ordinarily, is it true in Ohio as it is in most states that the Attorney General leaves it to the local prosecution?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,1760.477,1770.035,"Honestly, Mr. Chief Justice being a Georgia lawyer and not an Ohio lawyer, I don't know but upon an advice of Ohio counsel that is the case."
1974.73-296,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.764,1848.53,"Well, don't you have a right to appeal from the order of the Court of Common Pleas granting the injunction to the Ohio Court of Appeals?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,1848.53,1850.427,Not a temporary injunction Your Honor.
1974.73-296,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1850.427,1851.283,Not a temporary injunction?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,1851.283,1851.949,"No, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1865.048,1876.32,"Well, of course you can apply to an appellate court for a stay and it can be denied and that doesn't mean that you don't have a right to appeal in the normal courts even if the appellant court won't grant you a stay?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,1876.32,1895.033,"The Supreme Court of Ohio in 1973 in State ex rel. Ewing versus “Without a Stitch” said that, “It was error for the trial judge to allow a motion picture to continue to show pending after a temporary injunction pending appeal.”"
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1904.805,1911.472,But that doesn't go to my Brother Rehnquist's question as to the right of appeal.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,1913.457,1920.044,It's my understanding of Ohio law that there is no right of appeal at this stage of the proceedings.
1974.73-296,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1920.044,1927.557,"It'd be one of the very, very few jurisdictions I've ever heard on for after a temporary injunction was issued on the hearing, you didn't have a right of appeal."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1930.447,1935.807,I passed the Ohio Bar exam once and the -- unless the law has change that was my impression there was right of appeal.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,1935.807,1940.336,"At this point in time, when the federal law suit was filed."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1958.239,1958.519,"Well, that's something --"
1974.73-296,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1958.519,1967.523,It seems (Voice Overlap) if we have a -- an Ohio -- a case involved in Ohio statutory or Ohio procedure with a California lawyer on one side and a Georgia one on the other?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,1967.523,1970.727,"Well, let me explain this, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1974.73-296,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1980.444,1989.602,"Well, frankly, I'd like to know whether under the Ohio procedure there is a right of appeal here and all you're able to say, according to your understanding, there is not."
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1993.053,1994.66,"Except, but we all have to look at that?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,1994.66,1998.071,Or I will provide to the court an interpretation (Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1998.071,1999.389,It is your position that --
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,1999.389,2000.854,Legislative or judicially.
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2000.854,2005.385,"When you have an abatement of the nuisance there's no right of appeal, that's what you say?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2005.385,2006.243,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2006.243,2011.052,"Well, a lot of Stitch case did go all the way to Ohio Supreme Court, it didn't get -- it had to get there somehow presumably."
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2011.052,2012.816,"On permanent injunction, yes sir."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2012.816,2013.914,That was after a permanent injunction.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2013.914,2014.453,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2014.453,2026.358,"I think if I'm not mistaken we have another petition for certiorari pending here, maybe is that case from the Higher Supreme Court involving the same nuisance statute?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2026.358,2033.821,Possibly but its position with regard to Younger versus Harris that which I -- Your Honor has been inquiring to Mr. Clancy.
1974.73-296,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2195.97,2198.933,But it wasn't free to enforce its temporary injunction?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2198.933,2201.825,Not to close -- to padlock the theater which it did.
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2215.815,2219.126,You said (Inaudible) was free to bring contempt charges?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2219.126,2226.035,"For a certain Motion Pictures which had been found to be obscene by the trial court, the state trial court."
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2226.035,2230.444,I thought the injunction was against for the stayed action?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2230.444,2231.123,"No, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2232.329,2232.796,Padlock.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2232.796,2234.383,"-- closure -- purely, the padlock."
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2234.383,2237.245,They continued padlocking?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2237.245,2242.046,"No, once Judge Walinski's order was issued, the padlock was taken off."
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2242.046,2245.417,"What, the padlock is taken off, then how can you get contempt?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2245.417,2257.562,"Well, as Judge Walinski said this doesn't affect an injunction against exhibits A through Z or exhibit 1 through 45 which the trial court found to be obscene."
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2263.244,2265.607,"And that's final now, isn't it?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2265.607,2268.366,"Well, after Judge Walinski issued this order."
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2268.366,2272.492,"Without this Federal Court order, that injunction is final."
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2272.492,2276.442,"No, that was a temporary injunction, at that point in time."
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2276.442,2279.217,"Well, this -- well it -- have they had any hearing since then?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2279.217,2279.634,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2279.634,2282.818,"Once, Judge Walinski issued his order."
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2282.818,2282.916,Then it came on --
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2282.916,2289.83,"How long did the temporary injunction enforced -- applied, I was going to ask you how long is a temporary injunction by the law --"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2289.83,2292.611,"Well, the temporary injunction was issued on December --"
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2292.611,2295.294,How long is it valid in Ohio?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2295.294,2299.294,Until the final hearing on the permanent injunction.
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2299.294,2301.12,It lasts forever?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2301.12,2308.644,"Well, the statutory scheme says, this -- this case shall not -- you don't have to bring it on within 10 days or with 15 days."
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2313.496,2317.456,"And so, still in effect except for the Federal Court order?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2317.456,2320.8,"Well, it was still in effect at that time except for the padlocking --"
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2320.8,2321.788,How about now?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2321.788,2325.81,"Well, since that time, the matter came on for permanent injunction."
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2325.81,2327.187,That's what I thought.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2327.187,2334.949,"Right, but before the permanent injunction, Mr. Dakota transferred the lease to Pursue Limited."
1974.73-296,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2350.182,2352.029,"Well, how does that stand now?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2352.029,2390.94,"So, after that permanent injunction, Pursue Limited went back in the federal court as party plaintiff and sued Mr. Huffman and noticed the Attorney General not naming him as a party defendant and asked for declaratory relief and injunction not against criminal prosecution but only against the padlock provisions of 3767.01 et seq. and the three-judge court declared only 3767.04 and .06 to be unconstitutional that is the padlock provisions."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2439.251,2444.109,"Under the statute, it's not -- I didn't find it in the appellant's brief, is it where it ought to be?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2444.109,2446.308,It's in the --
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2446.308,2446.957,I think its there?

1974.73-296,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2458.109,2471.194,"I take it for after the permanent injunction before the -- after that the case was started in the district -- Federal District Court, it might have been an appeal where the Court of Appeals in Ohio?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2471.194,2475.334,"Yes, sir, there could have been an appeal from the permanent injunction."
1974.73-296,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2476.11,2477.178,And that was what?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2479.544,2500.278,"No, because when Mr. Dakota filed his suit, when he was the tenant the Court issued that the injunction for temporary restraining order and then once permanent injunction came down, Pursue adopted in our complaint the allegations and we're -- were said to be bound by lis pendens, then we assume the same position --"
1974.73-296,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2500.278,2506.618,But Pursue at that juncture -- after the permanent injunction have appealed the permanent injunction of the higher Court of Appeals?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2506.618,2513.244,"It could have -- well, it wasn't the name defendant, merely served with papers by the sheriff."
1974.73-296,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2516.146,2519.378,"Well, who could have appealed the permanent injunction?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2519.378,2526.725,"Well, I would imagine that Mr. Dakota could have appealed in name sake only or --"
1974.73-296,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2526.725,2529.408,"Now Pursue went into the federal court, is that it?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2529.408,2530.244,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2530.244,2534.306,And sought a restraint against enforcement of the padlock injunction?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2534.306,2534.935,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2536.49,2539.193,"Well, you could've gone in the federal court to do that."
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2539.193,2540.169,I beg your pardon.
1974.73-296,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2540.169,2546.803,"If you could go under the Federal Court as you did, why couldn't you have taken on the appeal from the permanent injunction?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2546.803,2553.458,Because of the manner of the First Amendment and the discretionary aspect of the Court of Appeals --
1974.73-296,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2553.458,2559.145,"That doesn't answer my -- may I suggest, why could you not -- Pursue not have appealed --"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2559.145,2559.353,Technically --
1974.73-296,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2559.353,2560.549,-- for permanent injunction?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2560.549,2560.956,Technically --
1974.73-296,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2560.956,2562.333,"Not technically, could it have?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2562.333,2563.8,It could have appealed.
1974.73-296,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2563.8,2564.669,But chose not to but to go to the federal court.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2564.669,2571.074,It chose the federal forum to ask for declaratory relief and injunction against the padlock provisions.
1974.73-296,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2571.074,2574.58,Does that raise a Younger question?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2574.58,2582.545,I believe at Younger is not applicable because this is purely civil proceeding and this Court left the question open in Younger.
1974.73-296,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2582.545,2591.326,"But hadn't all these issues that you raised in the federal court already been decided in the state court, why should you have enough doing relitigate them in the federal court?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2591.326,2598.602,"Well, the matter we were -- as Dakota was already in the federal court, he chose his forum where to be heard."
1974.73-296,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2602.053,2607.794,"Well, but quite a part from his filing a suit, weren't these issues litigated in the nuisance proceeding?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2610.247,2618.435,"No, not Pursue Limited because I as counsel for Pursue appeared at the permanent injunction hearing and Judge Lieb asked me if I was a member of --"
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2618.435,2621.607,(Voice Overlap) lets just assume the property hasn't changed then?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2621.607,2623.691,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2623.691,2627.461,"Well, didn't -- was there a final judgment in the --"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2627.461,2631.064,But the federal litigation had been commenced before final judgment.
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2631.064,2633.9,I know but what's the rule on res judicata?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2640.395,2643.618,"No sir, the federal action was started before the permanent injunction."
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.618,2647.259,"Well, and -- but what include it?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2647.259,2647.586,No.
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.375,2656.69,"Well, if they're two suits going on at the same time, probably the same issue but the one that finishes first normally becomes res judicata, the other?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2656.69,2659.016,"Then, if that's the rationale then --"
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.016,2659.433,What (Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2659.433,2669.093,"-- Pursue or Dakota would be precluded from -- if they file an appeal then the federal court would say, “Well, you're going up on the state ladder.”"
1974.73-296,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2669.093,2675.001,So as every other party that once litigates and once for one firm and seeks to transfer in mid-stream to another.
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.001,2675.568,(Voice Overlap) res judicata.
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2675.568,2681.464,"Well, did Huffman interpose as a defense to the federal suit res judicata?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2681.464,2682.382,"Not to my knowledge, no sir."
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2682.382,2686.174,"Well, I supposed that's the answer, the res judicata question, isn't it?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2686.174,2686.244,I don't --
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2686.244,2688.979,"It's the defense isn't it, that either had to interpose?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2688.979,2691.412,I do not believe he raised that as a defense entered in the court.
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2691.412,2698.922,"But if he didn't then I supposed that's out of the case but that doesn't take the Younger question out, does it?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2698.922,2702.763,It's our position -- there is a Younger question -- the following Younger --
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2702.763,2709.867,It's your -- your position is that the Younger principles apply only to pending criminal prosecutions.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2709.867,2709.905,That's correct.
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2709.905,2712.198,And not to this civil.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2712.198,2712.917,And if the court would --
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2712.917,2715.999,I know as I understand it this civil if that's what it is.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2715.999,2716.326,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2716.326,2722.344,"Our proceeding is in aid of a possible criminal prosecution, isn't it, under that statute?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2722.344,2726.427,"Now, it separate and distinct from a criminal prosecution."
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2726.427,2728.571,Not in aid of?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2728.571,2736.288,"Well, it refers in the last subsection that this is a separate procedure from criminal procedure."
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2746.48,2746.937,Which one?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2746.937,2747.356,-- are there.
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2751.327,2752.413,First Amendment argument?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2752.413,2754.956,"Yes, sir, the closing of the theater."
1974.73-296,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2754.956,2761.89,"Well, did -- to what extent was that tried out to where it was, the content of these films tried out in the state courts?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2761.89,2780.411,"The content of the films with what -- at this point in time at the filing of Mr. Dakota's complaint, at the filing of Pursue's complaint to final judgment and by the federal court on April the 20, 1972, the only procedures to my knowledge against the defendants in the state action was a civil proceeding which doesn't allow them --"
1974.73-296,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2780.411,2785.145,"Well, did they try out the issue of obscenity of the film?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2785.145,2789.933,The judge sitting without a jury did say these films presented to me are obscene.
1974.73-296,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2789.933,2791.6,And that's his final judgment?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2791.6,2793.416,That was his judgment.
1974.73-296,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2826.261,2839.785,"Well, do you read the community standard language in the various obscenity opinions of this Court as mandating a jury trial in the civil proceeding where the state doesn't choose to provide one?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2839.785,2845.931,I'm saying that to allow the state court to padlock an establishment based upon one judge --
1974.73-296,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2845.931,2848.145,Are you going to answer my question?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2848.145,2851.377,"I'm sorry Your Honor -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist, would you please repeat it?"
1974.73-296,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2851.377,2852.163,Yes.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2867.691,2871.141,Not -- no sir.
1974.73-296,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2879.93,2894.612,"But they have through the state -- they have indirectly as Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggest, by the state legislature having vested the power to decide that factual issue in a single judge instead of a jury of six or 12 people?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2894.612,2906.755,"In a single judge for the motion pictures presented to him.But then you get to the question of the over breadth of the statutory scheme and his order, closing in future, in future of the showing of any motion picture --"
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2906.755,2911.643,"Well, I know some have argued that the First Amendment requires a jury trial."
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2932.985,2936.895,I don't believe so.
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2982.659,2991.19,"In other words that -- the litigant of that case I gather did not go to a federal court, he just went up through the state court system, is that right?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2991.19,2991.797,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2991.797,2994.919,"And now as petition for certiorari here, is that correct?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,2994.919,2995.765,"Yes, sir, yes sir."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2995.765,3007.672,"And presumably if this Court should find the question to be a worthy of a grant of certiorari, we would grant it and decide the constitutionality of it, correct?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3007.672,3008.249,That's correct.
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3011.401,3012.417,Subject to --
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3012.417,3012.884,Subject to review by this Court.

1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3015.09,3020.168,"And I think a petition for certiorari has been filed and is pending, isn't it?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3020.168,3023.918,I do not know.
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3023.918,3039.405,"In other words, the very -- the fact that the Highest Court of the state has ruled against you, hardly in and of itself makes it appropriate for the Federal District Court to rule, does it, under the --"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3039.405,3048.922,"Well, it's my understanding that as far as an authoritative judicial construction by the Highest Court of the state, if this Court says that court is wrong, that would change."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3066.483,3076.951,"Under the law of Ohio which is the law of that state and until or unless it's reviewed and they revised or reversed by this Court, isn't that right?"

1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3105.663,3111.719,"Your Honor, reading the syllabus four -- maybe I don't understand the import of --"
1974.73-296,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3111.719,3112.456,Well --
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3112.456,3113.811,-- your question Mr. Justice Powell.
1974.73-296,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3113.811,3126.267,Wasn't the original state injunction directed not nearly to films that had been found to be obscene but also to any films that might be shown in the future?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3126.267,3126.305,And without --
1974.73-296,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3126.305,3129.157,"It was the original injunction, wasn't it?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3129.157,3131.233,"In Lima, is that what Your Honor is referring to?"
1974.73-296,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3131.233,3132.62,The case that's before us today.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3132.62,3133.915,"Yes, sir, yes, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3133.915,3151.277,"Now, the Ohio Court in the case that I referred to, “Without a Stitch” as I read that opinion, limited the effect to the statute only to films that had been found to be obscene, is that correct?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3151.277,3151.606,"No, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3170.323,3171.87,Closing the theater for a year.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3171.87,3173.068,That's correct.
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3173.068,3183.619,Subject to -- in a bond and then the property owners could come in during the year and say that they're repented and they are not going to do this anymore.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3183.619,3189.046,The property owners but not the tenant who doesn't have any interest in the property in the theater.
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3200.067,3214.247,But are you arguing Mr. Deitch that you didn't go to the Supreme Court of Ohio with this case because the result was a foregone conclusion after the Supreme Court of Ohio's decision in “Without a Stitch”?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3214.247,3235.269,"No, at the time this permanent injunction was issued, I -- we felt that to go in the federal court because the Supreme Court of Ohio in an early case in 1971 it said, “A motion picture film can be enjoined and the nuisance provisions under these schemes can be invoked.”"
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3235.269,3235.836,"Well, that's --"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3235.836,3236.692,"So, based upon that judgment --"
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3236.692,3243.678,Or maybe I have the wrong reference that was not in the “Without a Stitch” decision but in another decision of the Ohio Supreme Court?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3243.678,3244.469,"Yes, sir and --"
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3244.469,3250.966,But many events it's because of that decision that you went into the federal forum instead of going to the Ohio Supreme Court?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3250.966,3269.154,"That was part of the rationale and once the temporary opinion and order of Judge Walinski was entered staying the closure there wasn't -- we felt there's no reason to go in to state court and have the state come in and say, “Look, they've appealed in the state court, dismiss it for this reasons.”"
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3274.388,3282.992,"The “Without a Stitch” decision, it was announced by the Supreme Court of Ohio on February 27th of this year, you didn't have the benefit of that at a time?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3282.992,3283.788,"No, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3283.788,3285.914,"In -- this litigation in Lima, Ohio, did you?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3285.914,3287.032,"No, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3291.072,3291.559,"Oh, yes."
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3291.559,3305.612,"It was a per curiam opinion and the Court said that, “They could enjoined the showing of Vixen and apply the 3767 Provisions which they said .02 et Seq. which included the abatement."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3305.612,3342.656,"In contrary to a suggestion in the question of my Brother Powell instead of a narrowing this business statute the Supreme Court of Ohio in the “Without a Stitch” case, if anything seems to broaden it, if I read paragraph one of the syllabus correctly, it says, “The exhibition of a single obscene motion picture is sufficient to render a theater a nuisance as defined in Revised Code, no numbers, which means that on the basis of a showing of a single picture this place could be showed -- closed up for a year."
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3342.656,3343.542,That syllabus --
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3343.542,3343.7,That's syllabus four --
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3343.7,3346.658,"Syllabus 4 says, “It -- the Court shall issue an order --"
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3346.658,3346.756,Right.
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3346.756,3348.141,-- permanently closing it.”
1974.73-296,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3351.195,3355.417,You're not an Ohio lawyer I understand but I understand the syllabus is the law.
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3355.417,3357.142,"Yes, he told us (Voice Overlap)."
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3357.142,3358.268,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3419.279,3427.154,"Can I ask you -- Could I ask you, I see on -- in the appendix, page O18 and O19."
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3445.385,3453.589,"That the order -- padlocking order be stayed pending a three-judge court hearing, just the padlock provision."
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.589,3453.916,Well --
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3453.916,3455.044,That the order closing the theater.
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3455.044,3463.966,I'm just saying – I'm just saying I'm saying on though the three-judge court issued it's a -- issued it's an injunction on December 1st?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3463.966,3464.885,That's correct.
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3464.885,3470.632,And it ordered some adversary hearings in the state court?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3470.632,3471.578,"No, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3471.578,3475.43,"But that what's this motion says, you agree with this recitation?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3475.43,3478.743,The federal court on the December 1st merely stayed the padlocking.
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3485.17,3486.178,Unless there are some --
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3486.178,3491.5,If their adversary hearing is as the motion pictures that injunction is not bothered at all.
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3496.239,3502.574,"But anyway on November the 30, I take it there was a permanent injunction?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3502.574,3504.795,"Yes, sir, issued by the state court."
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3504.795,3505.045,And the --
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3505.045,3506.799,After Judge Walinski said --
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3506.799,3509.594,And don't you think that was appealable?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3509.594,3510.7,"Well, based upon the fact --"
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3510.7,3512.245,"Well, was it or not?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3512.245,3515.526,That order was appealable but based upon the fact we were already in the federal court.
1974.73-296,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3515.526,3518.73,"Yeah, while you preferred to get in an injunction the next day?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3518.73,3519.109,That's right.
1974.73-296,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3533.197,3533.337,What is the --
1974.73-296,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3533.337,3537.03,But Younger against Harris applies to a civil action?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3537.03,3537.836,I beg your pardon?
1974.73-296,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3537.836,3545.727,"You see, if the Younger against Harris principles apply on the civil side, are you in difficulty?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3545.727,3545.957,"No, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3554.658,3560.105,Despite the right to appeal from the permanent injunction issued in November 30th?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3560.105,3561.113,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3561.113,3562.959,Are you in difficulty?
1974.73-296,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3562.959,3567.52,"Younger against Harris itself, was it -- involved First Amendment claims?"
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3567.52,3567.73,"Well, you're --"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3567.73,3569.725,"Well, relating to criminal prosecution."
1974.73-296,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3569.725,3577.929,As I understand your argument is that you clearly within the exceptional circumstances envisioned in Younger against Harris even assuming Younger against Harris applies?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3577.929,3580.272,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-296,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3580.272,3584.743,"What is the situation right now, are the movies -- is it operating or isn't it operating?"
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3584.743,3588.376,I don't believe Pursue is operating in Lima at this time.
1974.73-296,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3593.217,3596.399,Is anybody operating the theater again?
1974.73-296,1,25208,gilbert_h_deitch,,3596.399,3601.277,I think the theater is in operation.
1974.73-296,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3623.087,3625.243,"You have two minutes, Mr. Clancy."
1974.73-296,2,29667,james_j_clancy,,3625.243,3625.65,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-296,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3760.527,3788.446,"Now the problem, as I understand your Brother on the other side, he says that the, “Going up through the state court system as -- gives him insufficient remedies, assuming that he has a good First Amendment claim because the State of Ohio Supreme Court has held that under this statute, it is error for the trial court to permit the continued showing of the movie pending appeal."
1974.73-296,2,29667,james_j_clancy,,3791.069,3795.079,"Well, what I'm saying that there's no right to show under constitutional principles."
1974.73-296,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3795.079,3796.115,I know it's what you're just saying but --
1974.73-296,2,29667,james_j_clancy,,3796.115,3798.009,To show after the trial court finds --
1974.73-296,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3798.009,3798.538,Right.
1974.73-296,2,29667,james_j_clancy,,3798.538,3799.616,-- that “Without a Stitches” is obscene.
1974.73-296,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3799.616,3799.953,And pending --
1974.73-296,2,29667,james_j_clancy,,3799.953,3801.86,The trial court finding is the determination.
1974.73-296,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3801.86,3813.928,"And pending an appeal from that finding the Supreme Court of Ohio says, “Its error under the statute to grant any sort of a stay and to permit these continued showing of the film.”"
1974.73-296,2,29667,james_j_clancy,,3818.237,3823.717,"Right, I'm saying that the Ohio Supreme Court says, after the trial court finds that “Without a Stitch” is obscene."
1974.73-296,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3823.717,3824.244,Right.
1974.73-296,2,29667,james_j_clancy,,3824.244,3825.629,There's stay from it.
1974.73-296,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3825.629,3827.386,Right and its error to grant a stay?
1974.73-296,2,29667,james_j_clancy,,3827.386,3829.53,"Yeah, that the theater owner has got to pull it then."
