1969.190,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.056,"Number 190, Turner against the United States."
1969.190,0,29905,josiah_e_dubois_jr,,13.056,19.395,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.190,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,19.395,21.537,Mr. Dubois.
1969.190,0,29905,josiah_e_dubois_jr,,21.537,33.556,"I have agreed with Mr. Rivkin who has filed an amicus brief that with the concern of the Court, he may use anytime of the remaining after my principal argument."
1969.190,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,33.556,36.589,In the -- in rebuttal?
1969.190,0,29905,josiah_e_dubois_jr,,37.798,38.831,As part of -- yes.
1969.190,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,43.013,46.245,Have you arranged to see that he doesn't absorb all your rebuttal time?
1969.190,0,29905,josiah_e_dubois_jr,,46.245,48.116,"Well, if he does, --"
1969.190,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,48.116,49.653,"Very well, we'll leave it up to your gentlemen."
1969.190,0,29905,josiah_e_dubois_jr,,49.653,51.523,It's more or less.
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,635.087,638.023,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.190,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1048.134,1071.546,Do you suggest that the Government or the Congress in order to establish this presumption must negate every possible source or is the presumption supportable if on balance it's more probable than not that it's an imported substance?
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1071.546,1084.181,I would not apply Mr. Chief Justice either a 100% standard or a 51% standard to what the Government might -- must substantiate.
1969.190,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1084.308,1093.166,"Your definition earlier was more probable than that, I wouldn't -- how far do you go than on the percentages?"
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1093.166,1119.034,"Well, the particular language with which one may deal in nice points is substantial assurance that more, that it has more probably than not come about it, so I would say even if there were a 51% requirement, one must feel quite sure in fact to a point that one might speak of as beyond to a moral certainty that the particular substance was unlawfully imported to the United States."
1969.190,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1119.034,1123.094,"Well, has any case ever held that it had to be to a moral certainty?"
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1123.094,1125.177,"No, and I don't ask, this one does."
1969.190,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1130.205,1130.349,Which is?
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1130.349,1132.168,We're not thinking such quantitative terms.
1969.190,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1132.168,1150.006,"Would you think that this presumption, statutory presumption here is more or less offensive than the common law presumption which is enacted in the statute in some states arising from the possession of recently stolen property, unexplained possession?"
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1150.006,1162.444,I would say Your Honor that it does in terms that Tot uses strain one's tolerance to apply that test to the substance.
1969.190,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1163.594,1170.735,"In other words, you could live with the other, the common law presumption but you think that's not as offensive as the statutory presumption here?"
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1170.735,1175.315,"In the light of the showings which I'm making here Your Honor, I think that that's the circumstance."
1969.190,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1245.409,1248.337,"Is it illegal to produce heroin, is it not?"
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1248.337,1249.768,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.190,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1249.768,1255.027,Would it be assumed that would cut down on the local manufacture?
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1255.027,1266.297,"It -- it might, on the other hand it might also raise the incentive for local manufacture Your Honor by driving up the price but that wouldn't be in violation of the statute."
1969.190,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1266.297,1272.953,"Well, have -- I'm still on with the Chief Justice, I'm worried about how far the Government has to prove that point?"
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1272.953,1290.434,"We're concerned with the criminal case, as a criminal case, it's a further question of the degree to which the Government may chop down on a defendant's rights and that is I would say that we're up around the realm of reasonable doubt, beyond a reasonable doubt."
1969.190,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1465.847,1467.201,I would like to ask you one question.
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1467.201,1468.16,"Yes, Mr. Justice Black."
1969.190,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1468.16,1483.467,Are you challenging the right of Congress to fix the amount of evidence that will authorize or compel a jury to convict?
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1483.467,1486.826,"I am not directly challenging that Your Honor, I have --"
1969.190,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1486.826,1489.104,It seems to me you're doing it indirectly.
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1489.104,1489.427,"Well, --"
1969.190,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1489.427,1492.641,I don't see why you hesitate to do it directly.
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1492.641,1495.92,You haven't hesitated to do it directly Mr. Justice Black and I would --
1969.190,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1495.92,1497.092,Are you saying?
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1497.092,1507.863,"I submit that you Mr. Justice Black have not challenged, have not hesitated to take that challenge up and that is why you have pointed in the past to considerations other than those arguments."
1969.190,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1507.863,1523.74,"In Congress -- in the Congress interfere to the constitutional rule, functions of the Court to try cases any more than the Court can interfere for the right of Congress to pass legislation?"
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1523.74,1558.004,"Put in that manner Mr. Justice Black, I would respond affirmatively and indeed, it's my further contention as you have pointed out in your descent in Gainey, in your concurring opinion in Romano and in Leary that these presumptions work a depravation of due process of law by converting the reasonable doubt test which must be met, they interfere with the right of the defendant to a trial by jury, in addition to the self incriminatory aspects which the counsel for the petitioner has pointed out."
1969.190,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1573.591,1596.223,"Let's assume that Congress has no such right to establish standards of proof, does that in any way inhibit judges from applying a standard which Congress may have incidentally defined if judges think its insensible standard as they have with reference to the inference as to be drawn from possession of recently stolen property?"
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1603.385,1614.868,My own feeling is that there are certainly are matters that judges may -- of which they may take judicial notice but that there are restrictions on the extent to which that process may also operate.
1969.190,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1614.868,1627.354,"Well, is this presumption here fundamentally very much different from the inferences which the Courts permit juries to draw from possession of recently stolen property?"
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1627.354,1638.928,"In its operation I would say it is not but I think that this Court has applied tests on a case by case basis on a presumption by presumption basis and I'm not attacking all presumptions here, I'm not attacking the presumption of recently stolen property."
1969.190,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1651.902,1654.143,What were the charges you have directed?
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1654.143,1654.739,Pardon me.
1969.190,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1654.739,1665.58,"For the Clerk would have charged you do you have directed, but there is a presumption that this defendant is guilty from these facts, did you return them loose?"
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1671.331,1679.034,"He would have so vitiated our constitutional system that at any point thereafter, the case should be totally reversed."
1969.190,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1679.034,1687.874,He would be acquitted and there's a provision in the constitution that a man should not be put in jeopardy twice for the same thing.
1969.190,1,41939,steven_r_rivkin,,1687.874,1690.735,"That is correct, and he could not be retried."
1969.190,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1738.578,1742.066,Very well Mr. Rivkin.
1969.190,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1746.774,1750.244,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.190,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2192.739,2200.174,"Well of course, I supposed the Government will admit that Congress couldn't foreclose that?"
1969.190,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2200.174,2205.183,"Well, we need not admit it because Congress has not attempted to foreclose --"
1969.190,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2205.183,2208.585,I wouldn't think it did not.
1969.190,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2208.585,2249.398,"In the series of cases I mentioned, this Court has developed the standard for testing the constitutionality of criminal statutory presumptions in terms whether there is a rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed or as it was re-stated last term in Leary, a criminal statutory presumption must be regarded as irrational or arbitrary and hence unconstitutional unless it can be at least said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend."
1969.190,3,29905,josiah_e_dubois_jr,,3543.259,3557.158,I just want to say Yee Hem and Casey decisions were decided before judge and reading the Yee Hem decision particularly that part called Government's brief and the judge's decision is different like day and night.
1969.190,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3597.862,3601.391,"Thank you Mr. DuBois, Mr. Rivkin and Mr. Wallace."
