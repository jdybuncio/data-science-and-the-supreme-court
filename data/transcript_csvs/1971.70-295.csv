1971.70-295,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.022,The case is submitted.
1971.70-295,0,27192,henry_harfield,,27.355,30.508,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1971.70-295,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,249.266,260.858,"Mr. Harfield, just as a matter of practicality, suppose that the respondent prevails here, what happens to the $2 million?"
1971.70-295,0,27192,henry_harfield,,260.858,267.595,"I take it that the $2 million would -- you mean in the sense, physically will it be remitted to Cuba?"
1971.70-295,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,267.595,273.542,"Well, does Banco Nacional get the $2 million?"
1971.70-295,0,27192,henry_harfield,,273.542,288.275,"Well, I take it that the any recovery by Banco Nacional would be for the benefit of the Cuban Government because Banco Nacional is at least at this point completely integrated into the Cuban monolithic system."
1971.70-295,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,293.382,294.966,Just as this is to which my question is directed?
1971.70-295,0,27192,henry_harfield,,294.966,296.802,Yes.
1971.70-295,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,344.867,351.527,"But my next question would be, why is the respondent fighting so hard for it?"
1971.70-295,0,27192,henry_harfield,,356.027,362.988,"I compare $2 million good reasons why the respondent is fighting hard, I mean why the petitioner is fighting hard for it."
1971.70-295,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,535.832,540.62,"Mr. Harfield, historically, where did the Act of State Doctrine originate, in the courts or in --"
1971.70-295,0,27192,henry_harfield,,540.62,543.206,It originated in the courts Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-295,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,543.206,547.238,On suggestion from what source?
1971.70-295,0,27192,henry_harfield,,547.238,555.436,I think it was not precisely on the suggestion from the Executive but it is so interrelated.
1971.70-295,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,555.436,556.988,"Well it’s a doctrine of committee, is it not?"
1971.70-295,0,27192,henry_harfield,,556.988,557.44,It’s a doctrine of committee.
1971.70-295,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,557.44,558.815,It’s not between the branches?
1971.70-295,0,27192,henry_harfield,,558.815,563.013,It is a doctrine of committee as between branches as well as between --
1971.70-295,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,563.013,563.274,Governments.
1971.70-295,0,27192,henry_harfield,,563.274,564.809,"Nations, as between governments."
1971.70-295,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,564.809,578.206,"But internally within our own framework, it is a doctrine of committee of the court’s giving deference to the overwriting responsibilities of the Executive in relation to foreign policies, is that not correct?"
1971.70-295,0,27192,henry_harfield,,578.206,581.93,I believe that to be exactly correct.
1971.70-295,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,928.124,956.194,"Mr. Harfield, under Rule 13, my understanding is that counterclaims are limited that those against the opposing party and here as I understand, Banco Nacional was the plaintiff and you have asserted a counterclaim, but basically as I understand goes against the government of Cuba rather than Banco Nacional, and the District Court ruled in your favor on summary judgment and the Court of Appeals did not pass on the District Court ruling."
1971.70-295,0,27192,henry_harfield,,961.626,962.625,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1971.70-295,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,962.625,963.698,On what basis?
1971.70-295,0,27192,henry_harfield,,963.698,966.185,"Well, on two bases."
1971.70-295,1,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1583.231,1586.775,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleased the Court."
1971.70-295,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1676.774,1685.793,"Perhaps, it might not unreasonable to ask them if your position is that this is just to go into the pool."
1971.70-295,1,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1685.793,1686.557,Of course.
1971.70-295,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1686.557,1693.553,"And in that case then, why is the Cuban banks are concerned about this?"
1971.70-295,1,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1693.553,1695.462,We want to -- I could speculate.
1971.70-295,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1850.573,1859.139,"Well, I can understand, your not wanting to speculate about the policies of your client too because that involves the a matter of your client’s foreign policy but --"
1971.70-295,1,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1859.139,1861.91,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-295,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.91,1872.268,Would you care to speculate on why the courts remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the State Department’s view.
1971.70-295,1,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1872.268,1876.852,"Well, oh while, I will get to that Your Honor."
1971.70-295,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2146.839,2157.683,Or hasn’t been here that Executive Branch indicated that they would prefer to have judicial branch just to go ahead and decide this lawsuit?
1971.70-295,1,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,2157.683,2159.687,It has in this case.
1971.70-295,2,27192,henry_harfield,,3431.634,3433.416,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-295,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3529.09,3531.199,"Well, I didn’t think there was much doubt about that."
1971.70-295,2,27192,henry_harfield,,3542.119,3544.889,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1971.70-295,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3731.638,3739.112,"Well, I have notice of the sovereign ever -- can the motives of a sovereign ever be called in the question in an expropriation?"
1971.70-295,2,27192,henry_harfield,,3744.57,3748.124,"Well, I think that would be so Your Honor."
1971.70-295,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3763.17,3764.024,Thank you Mr. Harfield.
