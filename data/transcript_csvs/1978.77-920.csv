1978.77-920,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.518,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 9 -- number 920, Thor Power Tool Company against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,13.479,17.73,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-920,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,48.216,55.703,"I suppose it might be accurately added that they present infinite variations, is that not so?"
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,55.703,60.994,They certainly do Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-920,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,187.089,192.347,Did your client dispose these excess parts at any time Mr. Berens?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,192.347,194.829,In the meantime did you say?
1978.77-920,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,194.829,196.288,At any time.
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,196.288,208.432,The excess parts in issue Mr. Justice Blackmun for 64% or 78% were disposed off by 1971.
1978.77-920,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,208.432,210.445,Disposed off in what way?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,210.445,223.894,"By scraping and this was by an exact tracing, Exhibit 17, I believe shows that."
1978.77-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.647,594.645,May I ask just one question?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,602.964,611.322,"No, Mr. Justice Stevens, and I am quite aware of that from the (Inaudible) decision that there maybe more than one best accounting practice."
1978.77-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,611.322,615.756,"Yeah, but an unusual use of the word best, but it really means an acceptable or --"
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,615.756,616.465,Yes.
1978.77-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,624.101,630.092,"Right, but I just wanted to be sure I wasn't misunderstanding it."
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,630.092,646.594,"The question then resolves did Thor's method clearly reflect income, under both Section 446 and 471? And we believe the test under both is identical."
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.149,814.569,What do you -- you say the taxpayer writes the inventory down to net realizable cost?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,814.569,815.453,Yes.
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,815.453,816.958,What is a net realizable cost?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,821.395,826.066,No in the Thor's case it was specifically an estimate of scrap value.
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,826.066,831.906,And why is the inventory held rather than scrapped at that time?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,831.906,836.233,Because on an individual item basis Mr. Justice White it is --
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.233,837.227,You can make a mistake.
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,837.227,846.273,"-- it is unknown, it is clear that Thor may have underestimated one of the 44,000 items and overestimated the other."
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,846.273,861.335,Do you have some experience in that regard as to what percentage of the inventory that Thor would like to write down later proves to be salable and that it has a value?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,861.335,895.216,"In 1971, when Arthur Anderson was first engaged as Thor's accountants, this from the record, they did a first-time-through special test of the inventory write downs of this excess system, and they found, for the -- using the exact system and that the company used and doing very extensive sampling, they found in 1970 that the write down -- I am not speaking of the 1964 but in 1970 it was about, if I recall it correctly, about 5% too low, and in 1971 --"
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,895.216,900.803,"So 5% of the items were taken back in ordinary sales, is that it?"
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,900.803,902.699,They should have written off more than they did.
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,902.699,903.28,Oh I see.
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,903.28,911.837,"The write down was too little, a low is misleading there, too little and again in 1971 it was too little by a larger degree."
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.59,930.955,Nevertheless -- even so there would have been isolated or recurring instances of inventory that was written down that nevertheless was sold?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,930.955,942.206,"Absolutely, absolutely and at that time to the extent that it was sold, that it already have been written taxable income in the later year would have been increased."
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,942.206,949.016,By the difference between its net realizable value and the sales price?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,949.016,950.634,"Yes, yes."
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,950.634,953.428,Things are segregated so you know which inventory you are --
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,953.428,967.599,No they are not segregated and I volunteer the observation that while it was stated in both lower courts' opinions neither state -- neither cited any authority for segregation and we could find none.
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,967.599,977.098,What happens if an item that's been written down is sold at the same -- at what it used to be sold for?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,982.344,985.72,"Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly what is done."
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1086.067,1089.121,"Ultimately your write down is going to be adjusted, isn't it?"
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1089.121,1090.454,It's going to be adjusted on a --
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1090.454,1093.317,"When you scrap it, when you scrap it?"
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1093.317,1095.686,Or when it's eventually all sold.
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1097.354,1101.864,Suppose it's scrapped and suppose you get out of it more than you thought you would?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1101.864,1105.012,"Then that's suggested too, the scraping revenues go into gross income."
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1105.012,1107.51,"And if you get less, what about that?"
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1107.51,1113.539,Then you -- through the write off system you get an additional loss at that time.
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.539,1117.677,"So, eventually things turn out accurately?"
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1117.677,1128.886,"It rolls through, but I would like to stress Mr. Justice White, both when it's scraped and when it is sold, either disposal eventually catches up."
1978.77-920,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1128.886,1145.568,"Mr. Berens your time is going on, but sometime before you sit down you have a response to the argument that the inventory evaluation procedure was a change in accounting method, the Government makes this, and I would like to get your response to it?"
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1145.568,1145.7,Yes.
1978.77-920,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1145.7,1150.371,At your convenience just before you sit down.
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1150.371,1157.841,"I suppose it would be -- would you prefer Mr. Justice Blackmun to give it now, I was going to save it for a rebuttal time but I would be glad to respond."
1978.77-920,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1157.841,1161.317,"It's alright, but just so you catch it sometime."
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1161.317,1165.305,May be I better in case I lose my rebuttal time.
1978.77-920,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1299.014,1306.997,Are you saying that the taxpayer has used consistently the lower of cost or market method for valuing inventories?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1306.997,1309.255,"Yes, and the record is clear on that Mr. Justice Powell."
1978.77-920,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1309.255,1318.713,Right and when you use the term net realizable value that's not inconsistent with the cost or market method?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1318.713,1325.982,"As we conceive it based on generally accepted accounting principles, it is part of the lower of cost or market system."
1978.77-920,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1362.102,1371.879,"I want to be sure incidentally Mr. Berens, do I correctly understand that you are not attacking specifically any of the regulations involved here?"
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1371.879,1376.019,"No Mr. Justice Blackmun, we cannot attack them because they are an omission."
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1392.746,1398.787,But you say -- you just talked about an interpretation of the regulation with which you disagree?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1398.787,1404.633,"Yes the Commissioner's interpretation of the regulations we believe is improper, but the regulations are not invalid."
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.946,1412.093,But you think the interpretation of that particular regulation is contrary to the statute?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1412.093,1412.737,Yes.
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1412.737,1414.594,Yes.
1978.77-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.594,1418.797,"I am sorry Mister Berens when you say you took the position the regulation was, or was not contrary to the statute?"
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1418.797,1427.534,"No, the regulation -- you expressed it in a different way Mr. Justice Stevens it makes it -- I'll have to answer it a little differently."
1978.77-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1439.741,1442.962,Well is 1471.4 silent on it?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1456.27,1461.625,"We never argued that there was an extraordinary circumstance, that was from the Tax Court's opinion."
1978.77-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1497.1,1500.517,I want to stay with that for just a moment.
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1505.173,1506.222,"Yes, yes."
1978.77-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1506.222,1516.866,And you contend that the existence of an excess inventory -- do you contend there were abnormal market circumstances in your case?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1516.866,1531.741,"We contend that there is inherent abnormality in the market for replacements parts, that there is not a normal pricing effect of supply and demand as was testified both by Mr. --"
1978.77-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.741,1540.806,"But the answer the Court of Appeals gave as I remember was, you regularly produce in excess, because this is the normal way you do business but that nevertheless is abnormal?"
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1540.806,1549.379,The market does not operate in the normal way for replacement parts.
1978.77-920,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1597.427,1607.397,Wouldn't your reasoning apply to any goods which a manufacturer makes expecting not to be able to sell 100% of his production?
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1607.397,1633.198,"I would say it would and it certainly would apply to the retailer who buys quantities of goods some of which he knows are going to turn out to be obsolete and unsellable, which ones he doesn't know, but the lower of cost or market system is designed to handle that situation."
1978.77-920,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1693.221,1698.088,(Inaudible)
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1698.088,1701.795,I think 269 Mr. Justice Brennan.
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1780.614,1782.739,Well how did you run into 284 US.
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1784.053,1796.443,Well we were reading some of the cases in respondent's brief and one sharp pre-Commissioner said it was bound by US Cartridge and that's the first time that it had crossed apparently anyone's eye in our office.
1978.77-920,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.443,1802.576,But maybe an associate was working for a partnership?[Attempt to Laughter]
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1802.576,1807.294,I wish she would have found it earlier.
1978.77-920,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1813.89,1816.041,You've covered that in your brief though --
1978.77-920,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1816.041,1818.08,We will have to stand (Voice Overlap)
1978.77-920,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1818.999,1822.713,Very well.
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1829.779,1833.286,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-920,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2140.826,2151.125,"Mr. Smith, I assume you would agree that no manufacturer can perfectly or with perfect accuracy estimate the amount of spare parts he is going to need --"
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2151.125,2152.11,"Absolutely Your Honor, I think this was a --"
1978.77-920,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2152.11,2158.282,"He must be high on some parts and if he has had bad staff work, he is going to be low perhaps on some others?"
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2158.282,2170.574,"Asolutely Mr. Chief Justice and I think it was perfectly reasonable business sense, and I think it goes to the point that Mr. Justice Stevens explored with counsel earlier, and that is, this was not an abnormal situation."
1978.77-920,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2203.631,2206.182,Which might turn out to be excess at some point?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2206.182,2214.134,"Might turn out to be excess at one point, and that's basically our point, because at some point is not at the end of 1964."
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.997,2256.344,Can I ask you sort of fundamental question about your view on the statute and the regulation?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2287.906,2289.503,"Absolutely, absolutely."
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2289.503,2293.042,You say if there is not a regulation authorizing it they are through?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2293.042,2296.331,"Exactly, exactly, exactly."
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2315.168,2319.148,You have burdened the Court of Appeals with those. [Attempt to Laughter]
1978.77-920,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2319.148,2325.588,"Mr. Smith, in this connection was 2 (f) argued to the courts below?"
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2325.588,2326.82,"Absolutely, I believe so."
1978.77-920,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2329.268,2330.211,Are you sure of that?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2330.211,2360.424,"Yes, I think the Court of Appeals had the benefit of -- in fact there is a good deal with acquisitions in the petitioners' brief about post -- appellate counsel's post talk justifications but while that maybe complementary, I may view that as personally complimentary, I think basically all of these considerations were put to the Court of Appeals including the change of accounting method argument as well."
1978.77-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.564,2399.545,"You just say these regulations prohibited, are you going to --"
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2399.545,2402.828,"Yes, I'm going to explain them."
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2408.711,2409.481,Mr. Smith --
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2409.481,2410.134,Yes sir.
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2410.134,2425.375,"-- before you go on, didn't the Tax Court find that generally accepted accounting practice required what was done by this taxpayer, and that the SEC also would have required it in a registration statement?"
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2425.375,2427.379,There may well be at the SEC might require.
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2487.848,2497.07,"What promoted my question was, not that I was suggesting there may never be a variation in between tax requirements and accounting requirements."
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2511.098,2513.025,"Oh, no, I didn't mean to suggest that."
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2529.488,2531.156,I thought they wouldn't have said without testimony.
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2531.156,2532.892,"Well, there was testimony to that effect."
1978.77-920,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2553.969,2555.237,What page?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2555.237,2562.295,"Page 8, I mean it's a standard -- it was a standard caveat that the accountants kept appending to their opinions."
1978.77-920,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2586.711,2591.326,"But my brother Powell's question was, it went to what the Tax Court found?"
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2591.326,2592.126,I think the Tax Court did find that they --
1978.77-920,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2592.126,2598.237,Did find that and that's in conformity with the Section 446 of the law enacted by Congress?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2598.237,2603.066,"Well, it's in conformity with one requirement of Section 446."
1978.77-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2603.066,2605.543,Why do you think they should give away?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2605.543,2608.34,"Well, I don't think --"
1978.77-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2608.34,2628.803,"If the Tax Court finds that the accountants won't certify as -- they wouldn't certify, if the taxpayer uses your method, then how can it possibly be in accord with best accounting practices?"
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2628.803,2633.092,"Well Mr. Justice White, if I may just answer your question in a slightly different way."
1978.77-920,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2648.059,2650.203,And the Tax Court found that it did both?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2650.203,2651.505,The Tax Court did not find it.
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2670.703,2675.423,You say that your method; the method that you insist on would be accepted in the accounting field --
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2675.423,2677.119,"May not be,may not be."
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2677.119,2684.848,"Well, if it isn't then this statute isn't satisfied either?"
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2684.848,2697.111,"Well, then I must say I can -- I think it's true as Mr. Justice Stevens indicated, there is no one -- I don't think in this area there is one accounting method --"
1978.77-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2697.111,2709.334,But you answered Mr. Justice Powell that there was a finding that – or at least a testimony that accountants would not have accepted any other basis?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2709.334,2713.777,"I think that's right, there was testimony to that effect."
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2719.162,2719.824,Mr. Smith let me get something straight?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2719.824,2721.975,"Yes, sure."
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2721.975,2728.996,Earlier your opponent and I had a colloquy in which we agreed there could be more than one best accounting method.
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2738.383,2738.929,Right.
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2738.929,2746.465,"Say not unlike a case where you might have a piece of real estate, that's on its book showed one figure but there is a reason to believe its market values is much lower."
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2756.007,2758.111,Exactly I think if there was a disclosure.
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.111,2760.446,"But, let me get to the heart of the thing."
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2773.604,2775.342,There is no such finding in that regard.
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2775.342,2782.4,Is there a testimony by the experts that they put on the stand that that would not be an acceptable method?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2782.4,2787.226,"No, I think the testimony simply said that the taxpayer's method would be a good method of accounting."
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2787.226,2788.223,It would be unacceptable.
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2788.223,2813.218,"Yeah, I think the way – perhaps the resolve this in a procedural sort of way, I mean it never quite frankly occurred to me, but if the statute requires these two things and the taxpayers has the burden of proof in the Tax Court, and it's the taxpayer's job to demonstrate that, its claimed reduction is proper and if it doesn't meet both tests then the deficiency is approved."
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2813.218,2826.969,"In a way I think your argument may be that the taxpayer is really challenging the regulation and requiring a method of accounting that's not a best method of accounting within the meaning of the statute, even though it's been on the books for some 40 years or something?"
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2826.969,2831.444,"Well, I don't want to confront the accounting testimony."
1978.77-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2832.492,2833.094,No (Inaudible).
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2833.094,2836.072,[Attempt to Laughter] I don't think I have to do that.
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2836.072,2846.392,"Mr. Smith, one thing that makes me keep coming back and taking your time is, that you refer to testimony and of course that's filed."
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2878.47,2879.193,I think you are right.
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2879.445,2881.438,I am trying to make clear that this taxpayer --
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2881.438,2884.995,This method of accounting was perfectly -- the Tax Court goes on to say –-
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2884.995,2886.797,It's required?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2886.797,2887.638,What?
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2887.829,2889.994,The Tax Court said it was required [Attempt to Laughter] not just --
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2889.994,2891.805,"Yes, but then the Tax Court went on to say Mr. Justice --"
1978.77-920,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2891.805,2892.755,It still leaves the second rule --
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2892.755,2894.071,Yes exactly.
1978.77-920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2914.805,2928.069,"You have to get to the regulations if you take 446 (b), entitled exceptions which I take it means there are exceptions to Section 446 (a)."
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2932.756,2934.798,"Right, then the secretary makes the computation."
1978.77-920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2934.798,2935.785,"And that's the end of it, whether it conforms --"
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2935.785,2937.033,And that's what we have done.
1978.77-920,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2954.468,2969.738,"But even if it conforms to entirely proper accounting practice and even if the accounting professional would say, this is the only way to do it, if the Commissioner can properly determine that it does not clearly reflect income, you win I would think?"
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2969.738,2976.419,That's absolutely the case and the reason we win in our view is because this doesn't meet the requirements of the regulations yes.
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2976.808,2983.152,"May I follow up on Mr. Justice Rehnquist, a point with which I do not necessarily disagree."
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3001.649,3003.707,Well I don't think there is any presumption as such.
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3007.104,3012.097,That can put the burden on a Commissioner to demonstrate why the taxpayer was wrong?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3012.097,3013.25,Oh no I don't think so.
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3024.613,3027.226,Even in view of the conjunctive language in 471?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3027.226,3028.015,Yes.
1978.77-920,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3042.543,3043.649,What are you reading?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3043.649,3049.443,I am in 471-2 (b).
1978.77-920,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3049.443,3050.578,Page?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3050.578,3056.112,"Page 85, I am sorry, the appendix to our brief."
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3088.848,3095.933,Of course one starts with the statutory language and the regulations can rise no higher than that?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3095.933,3096.433,Sure.
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3096.433,3109.557,My question really was whether or not statue itself does not put the burden on the Commissioner in this type of situation where the taxpayer has met the first requirement of the statue?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3109.557,3112.115,"No, I don't think it does Mr. Justice Powell."
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3119.358,3119.933,I am familiar with that.
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3119.933,3144.009,"Yes, and I think that the portions of the code has a few sections which specifically put the burden of proof on the Commissioner in accumulated earnings tax case if the taxpayer files a statement of reasonable cause for accumulations then the Commissioner has the burden that's by statue, in a case where the Commissioner asserts the 50% fraud penalty, the Commissioner has the burden."
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3164.991,3167.407,May I ask you just one more question and then I will be very quiet.
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3167.407,3170.064,Sure.
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3170.064,3191.7,How does a taxpayer in a business that involves a substantial number of items comply with what I understand your point is and that is that there must be a realization of the loss estimated to exist in inventory before it maybe taken in the taxable year in question.
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3192.86,3194.263,Well there are several ways.
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3200.039,3219.156,"Suppose you have a millions bits and pieces of inventory, you can't selectively scrap, perhaps you could, but you would still have a very large number of items that perhaps properly should be written down on a cost or market inventory basis."
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3220.005,3229.729,Well what one does is look at the regulations which provide for a way of fixing the proper amount of the write down.
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3405.206,3425.698,"Well Mr. Smith, one of the taxpayer came to the Tax Court or came to the Commissioner and said, look my net realizable value is scrap value, here is what I could get if I actually scraped it, and suppose you said well we agree with you that if you scrapped it right now, that is the net realizable value."
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3433.254,3435.313,Oh it has to be scrapped.
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3435.313,3437.647,I know but you [Attempt to Laughter] --
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3437.647,3441.707,"In another words, what I am saying is that there are another --"
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3441.707,3454.946,"Suppose he gets offers from people who are buying scrap and he comes in and says at page 86, he says I here have some bona fide offers for my inventory and scrap value?"
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3454.946,3457.395,If I may just modify your example in one respect.
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3457.395,3460.958,"Don't modify at all, take my example for a minute."
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3460.958,3471.701,"(Attempt to Laughter)Well, I would say that the write down would be permitted if the goods were damaged in perfect shopworn, unstylish or they are broken, lost --"
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3471.701,3480.422,"So you just don't permit [Attempt to Laughter] on the page 86, don't permit writing down for just excess inventory."
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3480.422,3481.827,"Exactly, exactly and --"
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3481.827,3486.65,Well why did you cite that to us as an example of what the taxpayer could have done here?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3486.65,3487.623,Excuse me.
1978.77-920,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3487.623,3493.43,Well you indicated he might have used this method on page 86?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3493.43,3500.842,"I said if the goods were damaged or shopworn, it said, in other words what I am simply saying that these are detailed technical rules."
1978.77-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3500.842,3506.474,"So tell me again now Mr. Smith, I asked you a while ago."
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3513.424,3513.895,"Oh, certainly."
1978.77-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3513.895,3516.572,Certainly 86 doesn't now you have conceded?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3516.572,3519.135,Page 87.
1978.77-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3519.135,3521.13,So 86 is irrelevant.
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3521.13,3522.105,"Yes, well no."
1978.77-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3525.972,3529.437,Well it doesn't cover this?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3529.437,3533.999,It refutes -- I mean it's relevant only because petitioner has claimed to come within it.
1978.77-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3533.999,3536.366,You said it was running with the prohibition on the equipment.
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3536.366,3568.441,"The prohibition is at the top of page 87, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 “deducting from the inventory a reserve for price changes or an estimated depreciation in the value thereof,” and we set forth in great detail in our brief at pages 41 to 44 and cited a number of cases which incidentally antedate."
1978.77-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3568.441,3570.2,But is this the only provision you are saying?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3570.2,3575.091,"No, two and three as well expressly prohibit."
1978.77-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3590.291,3592.052,Is there anything else in the –
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3592.052,3606.808,"No, there is no expressed prohibition, everything else -- we have invoked the regulation in every other respect to refute the taxpayer's claim to the inventory right then."
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3614.304,3619.374,(Voice Overlap) allow them to write off any inventory of any item that had been unsold for at least a year?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3619.374,3620.503,Say that excuse me.
1978.77-920,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3620.503,3624.517,There were some items on which there had been no sales for at least a year.
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3632.135,3642.029,"There were were two, as I said earlier, there were two specific write downs, one of them for obsolete goods, you are right and the other one was for --"
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3642.029,3645.784,Wasn't the test of obsolescence no sales of the particular item for a year?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3645.784,3648.934,"I think they were scrapped, they were scrapped as obsolete."
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3654.752,3662.21,Do you know whether or not the Commissioner allowed write off for obsolescence merely on a showing that an item had not been sold for years?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3662.21,3675.111,"I don't think there is anything in the record that indicates that and I would suggest that wouldn't meet the test of the regulations simply because something wasn't sold for a year, I don't think indicates that it's without utility or value to the taxpayer."
1978.77-920,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3675.111,3683.321,And under what part of the regulation was that particular write down for obsolescence permitted?
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3683.321,3685.573,Permitted?
1978.77-920,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3704.338,3705.2,Realized loss.
1978.77-920,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3705.2,3709.856,"Yeah exactly, and it is of no value to you or whatever you can get for it."
1978.77-920,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3712.623,3713.418,Thank you gentlemen.
