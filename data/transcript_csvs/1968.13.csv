1968.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,29.156,"Number 13 and Number 15, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company et al., appellants, versus Aberdeen and Rockfish Railroad Company et al., and Interstate Commerce Commission, appellant versus Aberdeen and Rockfish Railroad Company et al."
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,35.549,39.447,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,537.866,540.11,Except the cost for what did you say --
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,540.11,542.921,The cost of performing the service involved.
1968.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,542.921,543.315,Yes.
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,543.315,549.692,As to which it found the Northern lines cost higher than those of the Southern lines.
1968.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,701.749,710.329,We'll recess.
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,714.487,718.809,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,768.657,773.05,Did you just before you started -- just straighten me out.
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,777.163,780.355,"Well, cost if Your Honor please --"
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.355,781.569,Is that fully distributed?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,781.569,785.382,It is fully distributed cost and revenue need --
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.382,789.826,But that excludes any need for profit?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,789.826,792.448,"No, there's a return element in that --"
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,792.448,793.099,In fully distributed?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,793.099,798.003,"In fully distributed cost, there's a return of 4% on value of property."
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,798.003,800.586,"Well then, what would the revenue need?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,800.586,804.96,Revenue need then is something over and above that kind of cost.
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.865,807.656,For investments?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,807.656,827.185,"-- is -- no, it's just to continue it on operation for Railroad is in badly need of revenue and divisions based upon relative cost alone even fully distributed are not sufficient then the Commission has the power to award higher divisions to keep that railroad in operation."
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.185,831.512,The railroads need revenues except to pay its loss for the return.
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,831.512,846.34,"Well, the cost involved, Your Honor, would be just the cost of performing the particular service involved but it would have all the cost of performing the other service not involved in a given case."
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.732,863.558,"For what, for example?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,863.558,864.356,For nothing.
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.73,870.377,It does?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,870.377,871.168,Pardon me?
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,871.168,873.284,It does?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,873.284,873.466,Yes.
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,873.466,874.593,What's it needed for?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,874.593,877.19,It needs it to continue operation.
1968.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1094.975,1112.621,"Well, do the Northern roads and the Southern roads devote the same percentage of their cars and their property and so on to the North-South traffic?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1112.621,1114.559,"No, I don't think they do, Your Honor."
1968.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1114.559,1118.44,"What are those percentages, give me an illustration in some respect?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1118.44,1132.066,"Well, the only illustration I can give you Your Honor is that the traffic involved in the North-South traffic involved for Southern lines is very much greater than for Northern lines."
1968.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1137.743,1165.961,"Well, that's just offhand and matter of first impression that's would make some kind surprising offhand that the Commission would use a totality of cost of any of these items as the basis instead of correcting it for the particular traffic involved."
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1165.961,1167.047,"Well, if Your Honor please in that --"
1968.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1167.047,1170.257,"That is what it did, isn't it?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1170.257,1182.225,It did that except to the extent that it allowed five of the adjustments that were submitted by the Southern lines and declined seven.
1968.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1201.136,1241.333,"I know, but however that might be, it did strike me is being rather odd that the Commission would use this aggregate basis in considering such a relatively small factor of the business of the Northern roads particularly and of the Southern roads and especially in view of the fact that the percentage of -- was different in the case of the North and the South and radically different."
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1241.333,1256.66,"Now, if Your Honor please, in the class rate case which was the first case in which the Commission used cost evidence under this formula and before this formula was devised, they had no reliable way of getting service cost."
1968.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1321.088,1325.457,"Well, was there such finding here?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1325.457,1326.952,"No, Your Honor."
1968.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1326.952,1327.658,That's what I missed in this --
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1327.658,1332.701,There was not a finding in those words.
1968.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1332.701,1334.488,"Was there anything like it, that's what I've been finding."
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1334.488,1344.641,"Yes, there was a finding that the costs as adjusted accurately and reliably represented the cost of performing the North-South service."
1968.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1344.641,1354.047,"I know, but that's not quite pinpointed to the problem that I have in mind, is it?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1359.83,1360.55,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.13,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1360.55,1370.1,"And to my mind, that perhaps most vividly presents the issue that has troubled me."
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1370.1,1372.212,"Very well, Your Honor."
1968.13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1372.212,1379.83,There wasn't a commuter problem isolated as such in the Chicago and North-Western railroad?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1379.83,1385.514,"No, there was not Your Honor."
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1535.919,1537.048,Exclude what?
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1665.057,1669.578,Was either side challenge that finding?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1674.992,1681.233,"Well Your Honor, I didn't intend to say that they could not be computed."
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1701.011,1723.55,"I asked you that question because I've been wondering here, how much, how strongly one can say that the Commission can accurately figure cost passenger service and the cost of freight service, the whole system of railroads, North and South?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1723.55,1726.433,"Your Honor, it imposes very great problems."
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1726.433,1732.329,"How much of its judgment, how much of it is finding and how much of it is guessed worth?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1732.329,1765.87,"If Your Honor please, in a case called rail passenger train deficit, in 306 ICC at 714 decided in 1959, I believe that you will find there an expression of the Commission to the extent to the effect that in deciding how much of the common cost should be allocated is largely a question of judgment, and a rather speculative factor."
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1765.87,1767.799,"306 ICC, what page?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1767.799,1770.371,306 at 417.
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1770.371,1782.186,"Well now, you started off as I recall it by saying that they found that the cost of carriage for the Northern railroad was more in the cost of the Southern railroad?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1782.186,1784.539,Yes Your Honor.
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1784.539,1785.772,Is that accurate?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1787.746,1788.714,Oh yes.
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1788.714,1789.948,How?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1789.948,1798.609,"Well, they make that on the basis of the application of a cost formula, which they used day in and day out."
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1804.593,1806.658,I understand that so far.
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1806.658,1808.515,"Oh this, and I'm speaking now of the formula for determining --"
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1808.515,1813.411,Is that the that was whole formula that takes sample?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1813.411,1841.141,"Oh, there are some sampling in it Your Honor, but by and large it's an analysis of the accounts of the railroads which are kept in accordance with the Commission's uniform system of accounts, and they'll get a unit cost of performing this service or that, and then a traffic study is made to find out how many units of the cost -- how many units of that service are involved in the service your studying."
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1845.059,1854.432,"I understand it's done, but how much of it must we consider to really as you read that from that 306 Illinois is a question of judgment?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1854.432,1854.831,"Well Your Honor, I did --"
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1854.831,1858.444,How much is a question of accurate findings of facts.
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1858.444,1868.918,It might reference to it being a matter of judgment had to do with the passenger service and only those expenses of the passenger that are common with freight.
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1877.424,1880.679,Do they have to get it from the books of the railroad?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1880.679,1887.328,They get it from annual reports of the railroads which account by the account are submitted to the Commission.
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1887.328,1890.586,Do they analyze it in any way to see if it is correct?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1890.586,1895.954,"Well, the Commission regularly has investigators going checking books of railroads."
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1895.954,1897.609,Kind of an over supervision.
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1897.609,1899.073,Yes Your Honor.
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1899.073,1908.299,But do they ever investigate those cost to see if they are put down on the books accurately?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1912.402,1917.698,"Your Honor, I don't know the extent to which that audit how deep it goes."
1968.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1917.698,1918.843,"Mr. Kaier, may I ask --"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1918.843,1919.847,Yes sir.
1968.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1919.847,1921.795,Do I get this correctly.
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1929.445,1930.701,Yes Your Honor.
1968.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1930.701,1944.799,"And the Southern line insisted that no, they should also be taken under consideration, passenger to the extent of intercity, but not commuter?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1944.799,1945.519,Correct.
1968.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1945.519,1946.151,That's what it is?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1946.151,1946.84,Yes Your Honor.
1968.13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1946.84,1952.193,I gather intercity uses the same facilities for freight and passenger?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1952.193,1955.659,"Well, sometimes it does."
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.008,1983.889,"But anyway, this was the purported justification of distinguishing between intercity --"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1983.889,1984.628,It was.
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.628,1985.594,And commuter service.
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1985.594,1986.643,"Yes Your Honor, it was."
1968.13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1986.643,1990.444,Because the South I gather does not have the commuter problem as Northern line?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,1990.444,1992.098,That is correct.
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2126.973,2128.448,What do you mean by common?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,2128.448,2134.607,Common is between freight and passenger.
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2165.246,2168.018,Is any question of freight rates involved here or just --
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,2168.018,2168.746,"Well, this is just --"
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2168.746,2169.912,Limited to division?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,2169.912,2175.087,This is limited to the divisions Your Honor.
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2234.742,2238.897,Are they the most expensive to operate?
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,2238.897,2241.409,"Oh, I don't think so Your Honor and I really don't know."
1968.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2243.012,2244.217,"Over the mountains, I believe?"
1968.13,0,22627,edward_a_kaier,,2244.217,2245.507,Over the mountains.
1968.13,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2321.106,2329.369,"If it please the Court, my name is Arthur Cerra and I'm an Assistant Associate General Counsel of the Interstate Commerce Commission."
1968.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2535.49,2537.973,(Inaudible)
1968.13,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2537.973,2558.569,"Between different kinds of traffic of railroads Mr. Justice Black, for example, a car of North-South traffic might travel in the train with traffic from various other areas of the country when it reaches the border."
1968.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2622.79,2626.481,"Well, that really cuts very deep doesn't it?"
1968.13,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2633.197,2634.175,"I didn't quite understand your question, Your Honor."
1968.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2634.175,2642.484,"Well, suppose you had a particular plain ascertainment cost of kind particular types of commodities, you do that don't you?"
1968.13,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2642.484,2643.619,"We do, Your Honor."
1968.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2643.619,2654.507,And that most to those cost are a part of a joint cost that involved many other operations.
1968.13,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2718.112,2722.77,"Mr. Justice Fortas, this is precisely what the Commission did here."
1968.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2734.168,2736.05,"Well, it's distinguishable."
1968.13,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2761.977,2765.694,"Well, the question I would have to ask in that, how do we get these cost Your Honor?"
1968.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2777.734,2780.204,I just think that'd be a very sensible way of going about it.
1968.13,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2780.204,2782.417,And that's precisely what happened in this case.
1968.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2782.417,2784.583,But you did not break it down.
1968.13,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2793.029,2806.966,But the aggregate cost Your Honor are all the services that are performed by the railroad to provide all the work units in expenses that takes to provide any amount of traffic that the railroads handle.
1968.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2834.074,2839.416,"Yes, but a further or refinement beyond that would be possible, would it not?"
1968.13,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2887.261,2894.467,"The standards that it would present arise from the problem that here, the Commission used fully distributed cost."
1968.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2908.455,2911.013,"I know, but you get the question of should it."
1968.13,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2911.013,2911.798,Should it?
1968.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2911.798,2912.092,"Of course you did, but should it?"
1968.13,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,2912.092,2917.456,And this is the determination of cost which depends on policy.
1968.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2988.373,3007.466,"Well, I'm not going to pursue any further beyond suggesting to you that basic problem here is as I understand it, arises from the fact that the Commission said, “We're going to make the -- we're going to review these divisions on the basis of comparative cost.”"
1968.13,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,3008.641,3009.963,That is correct Your Honor.
1968.13,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3009.963,3016.577,"Not of the factors cost, not what the railroad's need, but cost."
1968.13,1,15718,arthur_j_cerra,,3099.3,3119.93,"Your Honor, the refinement we made based on the Rail Form A computations and based on the fact that parties who seek to show that there are differences in one given body of traffic as compared to average traffic were shown here."
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3216.343,3217.369,May it please the Court.
1968.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3280.408,3282.18,The equality of cost?
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3282.18,3305.3,"Equality of -- that they are differences this Court in 1947 in New York versus Unites States determined that they were no differences between the official territory of the North and the Southern territory, and by virtue of that, you established the uniformity of rates and then subsequent to that, the uniformity of divisions."
1968.13,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3398.748,3403.847,I'd understood that the net average change in the divisions with 3%.
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3403.847,3409.733,"17%, that's a net average change in the amount of money we cost the Southern railroads."
1968.13,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3410.89,3411.28,Yes.
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3411.28,3439.976,"-- Mr. Kaier said, but the division preference that they are giving in this case is an average of 17% more to the Northern railroad for carrying -- if you got a whole of 50 miles in the North and we've got an identical whole of 50 miles in the South, they are going to give them an average of 17% more in the North for carrying that same amount of traffic over that same distance as we would get for carrying the same amount of traffic over the same distance in the South."
1968.13,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3447.333,3449.851,"And now, tell me what is the 3%?"
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3449.851,3459.864,The 3% that they're talking about is the amount of money that is going to take away from the Southern railroads operating revenues.
1968.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3466.989,3473.051,"What's the theory on which they based the finding, if they even have a finding can you argue with that --"
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3473.051,3473.6,All right sir.
1968.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3473.6,3476.461,-- with the increased cost of operating in the North?
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3476.461,3482.498,"The theory, if there is a theory, is that they say that there is a difference."
1968.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3488.409,3489.436,Why?
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3489.436,3490.893,They don't give any reasons.
1968.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3536.1,3538.475,Which one do they claim has the most advantages?
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3538.475,3539.732,Sir?
1968.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3539.732,3543.81,Which one do they claim as the most inherent advantages or disadvantages?
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3543.81,3549.873,"Well, they claim that the North has the greatest disadvantage may it please Mr. Justice and --"
1968.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3549.873,3552.661,What is that disadvantage they point out?
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3552.661,3562.624,"The only disadvantage that we can ascertain from this record is one, perhaps an over capacity of railroad facility in the North."
1968.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3579.687,3581.241,Do you mean the competition was keen?
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3581.241,3592.535,"No sir, I mean that back in the day and times when the Northern Railroad System was first built, to be perfectly candid about it, all industry in this country was located in the Northern part of the country."
1968.13,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3712.186,3714.739,What's the difference in consequences?
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3714.739,3730.422,"The difference in consequences is that if you allow this situation to stand as it stands now with the preference in division, the difference in consequence is this."
1968.13,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3787.408,3794.562,"But Governor, what percentage of the total revenues of the southern railroads are we talking about here?"
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3794.562,3797.442,"We're talking about 3%, I believe."
1968.13,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3797.442,3798.823,"No, I mean overall?"
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3813.285,3813.52,20%.
1968.13,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3813.52,3815.658,-- the southern roads derive from the division then?
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3815.658,3817.028,"20%, Mr. Justice."
1968.13,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3817.028,3819.797,20% from all of their revenues?
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3819.797,3820.105,Yes sir.
1968.13,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3820.105,3821.873,Now the next thing I want to ask you is this.
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3828.913,3830.747,"Yes sir, I sure am."
1968.13,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3830.747,3836.152,And the question before us is whether we'll affirm the District Court order not whether we --
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3836.152,3836.308,Yes sir.
1968.13,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3836.308,3837.833,-- like what's happening or we don't like it.
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3837.833,3838.854,Yes sir.
1968.13,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3880.006,3881.91,Well provided it comes out right.
1968.13,2,20086,carl_e_sanders,,3881.91,3883.249,No sir.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4035.116,4037.381,May it please the Court.
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4094.221,4096.564,You mean about per mile?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4096.564,4098.093,"Per mile, yes sir."
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4107.872,4110.578,You say before the Commission acted the amount was equal?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4110.578,4111.734,50-50.
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4121.499,4124.314,Who filed the petition?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4124.314,4126.02,Northern Railroads.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4126.02,4137.678,"Mr. Trienens, do you on your side of the case, question the principle that if were so that the cost of the northern road in handling this class --"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4137.678,4138.602,This train.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4138.602,4146.497,-- was (Inaudible) and the southern (Inaudible) can make this kind of effect.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4151.532,4155.712,"We would question it unless they carry through, and did two more things."
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4178.321,4179.585,You mean necessary?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4179.585,4180.283,Necessary.
1968.13,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4184.211,4188.52,Or do you mean just they had to make a finding as to efficiency?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4188.52,4192.029,"Well, efficiency in this case is a somewhat slippery word."
1968.13,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4195.229,4196.164,Well you know they found that then.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4196.164,4200.444,They were operating the systems as they then existed with equal efficiency.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4375.909,4377.616,Well may I interrupt you there --
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4377.616,4377.709,Surely.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4377.709,4379.336,-- if you don't mind?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4389.83,4393.116,In so far as fixing relationships between north and south.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4393.116,4393.396,"No, no."
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4404.849,4415.89,"The Commission has in the past, and I can't say -- I can't look behind what they think of it, has in the past said that it did consider deficits from passenger service."
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4417.517,4419.027,"Pardon, go ahead and finish that sentence then."
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4419.027,4430.762,"It has also said that they've treated commuter deficits as a separate problem which should not be dealt with by the freight shipper subsidizing the service, but rather should be dealt with by the local community."
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4431.746,4433.561,The answer to my answer to my question yes?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4433.561,4434.32,The answer is yes.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4438.013,4454.421,"And you say there are Commission rulings to the effect that commuter service will -- deficits on commuter service as distinguished from passengers other intercity passenger service, will not be considered."
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4454.421,4456.254,As a matter of Commission policy.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4456.254,4457.652,In fixing freight rates?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4457.652,4458.778,Yes sir.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4459.117,4468.303,"But here, your point is that they have considered deficits on commuter service in fixing these divisions?"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4468.303,4468.777,That's right.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4506.173,4512.938,And you're saying that they have not used -- let me see if I can be precise about this.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4534.27,4535.333,Not quite sir.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4536.416,4538.381,Let me hear you state it.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4538.381,4544.477,They picked as their standard of this whole case the cost of north-south freight traffic.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4548.479,4551.128,I know that as to this case.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4551.128,4555.813,"-- or then as to this case, they nevertheless went in and put the whole passenger deficit into this --"
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4555.813,4557.731,I understand as to this case.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4575.497,4577.868,I can't answer that Your Honor.
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4651.875,4655.047,Does it mean how to pocket cost?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4655.047,4657.727,"In that case, they were showing both."
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4657.727,4664.063,"When you've been referred to cost, the Commission had been referred to cost, has it been out of pocket cost?"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4664.063,4664.849,No sir.
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4664.849,4666.273,What does it include?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4666.273,4668.916,It includes -- what I regard as a --
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4668.916,4670.629,Value of the property used?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4670.629,4674.449,The full cost of performing this north-south service.
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4688.835,4698.158,What you claim is that they take a shipment of oranges in Florida that the south now will get -- hardly going through the south.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4703.56,4708.88,"Yes sir, 17% less than the north for doing the same service."
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4846.064,4855.991,"Does the increase cost of the depot, the station and the tracks and the land of the railroad of the north and south enter into the competition?"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4855.991,4857.487,"They do enter, Your Honor."
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4881.41,4884.504,You say the car cost was 32% of it?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4884.504,4897.864,"You take the average car cost, meaning all the cars of all different kinds throughout the south and all the cars of all different kinds throughout north, and the average cost is 32% higher per mile than the north."
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4897.864,4903.415,Is that suppose to be due to the fact that they have better cars?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4903.415,4904.681,Well --
1968.13,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4904.681,4906.868,"Some of it is due to a specialized equipment, isn't it?"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4906.868,4908.77,Some of it is due to more specialized equipment.
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4954.314,4967.169,Would you deny if they actually had shown in the evidence that the cost is 35% more on the north that they would be entitled to a bigger division?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4967.169,4971.488,Well I would deny it because I can't conceive of it being so.
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4974.949,4975.555,That's it.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4977.966,4981.549,"If they did and if it was inherent, and I'm not making to do to avoid it."
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4981.549,4982.422,You mean natural?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4982.422,4987.15,"Natural, and the result of efficient operations as to these cars."
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4995.884,4999.816,Well is the main challenge then due to the findings?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,4999.816,5000.714,It's due part --
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5000.714,5002.897,Or of increased cost in the north?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5002.897,5015.437,"Partly to the findings which go to the -- where they don't go to the questions of how the cost could be higher on these cars in north-south traffic, partly the findings which don't respond to that and in large part to the evidence."
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5033.329,5034.795,Is that what the court found?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5034.795,5035.774,Yes sir.
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5083.719,5085.717,What does that mean precisely?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5085.717,5102.999,"It means that as to such things as the interchange work out here at Potomac Yard, they used territorial average cost of all traffic in the north and all traffic in the south, bulk of which had nothing to do with this north-south freight traffic."
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5146.506,5155.172,You don't -- you don't really deny the fact that on some segments of this traffic -- of their traffic in northern roads have higher cost.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5155.172,5155.897,Yes I do.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5155.897,5161.292,"Like for example car cost, on segments of traffic they really do have the substantially higher car cost."
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5161.292,5161.629,No sir.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5161.629,5164.564,Your point is that -- no?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5164.564,5165.344,No.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5167.757,5170.886,"No, I said on some segments of their traffic."
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5176.616,5176.857,Alright.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5176.857,5184.243,It's maybe to between New York and Buffalo carrying some kind of the traffic car cost or two or three times this high?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5184.243,5185.706,Or different cars on a different something else.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5185.706,5191.818,But your point is that that cost shouldn't be used major north-south traffic cost.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5191.818,5192.1,That's right.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5200.035,5200.389,Yes.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5200.389,5204.042,And it isn't that I say that somewhere else they spend more on these cars.
1968.13,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5221.863,5224.329,But can you tell us what page of the --
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5224.329,5228.072,"It's on 349 of the appendix, volume 1 of the appendix."
1968.13,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5228.072,5230.467,Thank you.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5230.467,5240.175,The Commission stated its exclusive standard to be the relative cost of handling the specific freight traffic to which the divisions apply.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5353.776,5358.838,How old is the cost material in this record?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5358.838,5361.885,1956 cost.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5361.885,5368.374,"And I suppose if this case goes back, the whole thing left be done over again, won't it?"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5368.374,5373.831,It took the southern line six months between the time the north completed their case to we completed our case.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5401.023,5404.503,This case was in the Commission nine years?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5404.503,5411.05,"Oh, 1959 was when the north got around to starting this really, to 1965."
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5412.025,5414.965,"Six years, and then in the courts since then?"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5414.965,5417.568,Yes sir.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5425.804,5434.41,"Well, they say the whole proceeding would've been over if you haven't decided before the Court."
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5434.41,5438.584,That's right.
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5581.115,5586.477,How long would it take for the Commission to make its study and use it through with the case?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5586.477,5589.376,"Well, Your Honor, the way I look at it this way."
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5619.186,5626.478,"But I say, how long would it take for them to have a full interview and make the kind of finding which you think should be made?"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5626.478,5637.297,I didn't find -- I think should be made right now until the northern lines or anybody presents some evidence that the costs are in fact higher on this traffic.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5640.33,5646.609,"So, your direct answer is somewhere between five minutes and 15 years, isn't it?"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5646.609,5652.408,"The lower court recognized, Your Honor that in saying that there wasn't substantial evidence."
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5676.269,5678.188,"Well, that didn't quite it, is it?"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5695.988,5698.981,District Court said that the -- that the --
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5698.981,5703.302,The District Court said the Commission's result was an error in making these adjustments.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5709.384,5710.3,Well I --
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5710.3,5710.725,"Alright, so that the --"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5710.725,5712.26,"No, I don't think it did either."
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5712.26,5729.074,"-- the parties here, the northern roads or whoever wants to do it has a right to obtain a Commission determination as to what adjustments would be necessary to make the rates fair and reasonable."
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5749.631,5753.068,I don't agree with that in this situation for this reason.
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5795.159,5797.125,You keep saying obtaining inflation.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5798.059,5803.921,I mean Your Honor that has contrasted with the way it was before this order where we were equal partners.
1968.13,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5804.51,5807.523,You mean if they want to insist on getting more than the south gets?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5807.523,5810.846,"If they want more than equal share, they ought to prove it."
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5811.474,5816.01,"You see the way this works out probably if they get a dollar you just get $0.50, is that right?"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5816.01,5816.977,Up until this order.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5816.977,5817.244,That's right.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5822.224,5828.729,"Well, specifically the way it's worked is that there are two scales, a northern scale and a southern scale."
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5833.824,5834.481,How do you get --
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5834.481,5838.699,$0.56 and $0.44.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5840.814,5841.18,Yes.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5841.18,5842.042,That's the way it works.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5842.042,5855.019,Well I suppose the same finding why the Commission looks for the increased rate with an increased joint rate?
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5855.019,5856.396,It didn't so indicate.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5856.584,5863.432,I mean that's normal (Inaudible).
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5863.432,5866.36,"No, I don't believe so Your Honor."
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5873.195,5874.058,The cost is --
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5874.058,5876.651,"Well, they have a very low --"
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5876.651,5881.728,"They thought, for example and said “Right, we are thinking it has to do this.”"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5881.728,5885.405,"Well they used to 15 years ago, yes sir."
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5897.957,5903.685,How it represents -- certainly some of the part of the revenue needs that the -- or --
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,5903.685,5904.756,"Well, some part of it yes."
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6088.45,6092.011,Just about a generalization that --
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,6092.011,6098.622,Many individual items of suburban service can be considered solely related as suburban.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6098.622,6102.737,"Well the same thing is true of intercity passenger cars, isn't it?"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,6159.597,6159.686,When this --
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6159.686,6177.593,"Don't you have to say that the right thing to do to make your argument, right thing to do is to take your common cost as between passenger or commuter and -- on the one hand, and freight on the other hand and then allocate it."
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,6177.593,6177.975,That's right.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6178.21,6182.434,And as between freight on the one hand and passenger plus commuter on the other hand.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,6182.434,6183.83,That's exactly what we argue.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6220.566,6232.587,"Mr. Trienens, didn't the Commission say that even if there are a lot of cost in the commuter service that are not common but solely related to commuter service, nevertheless they should be included and allocated?"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,6232.587,6233.663,That isn't the way I read it.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6245.707,6249.193,"Well, but they also conceded there were some solely related costs?"
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,6249.193,6249.804,That's right.
1968.13,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6249.804,6251.311,But they nevertheless included them.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,6251.311,6258.819,"Yes, and that's the point -- exactly the point on which the District Court said “You've given no reason of why you should flip in the solely related cost.”"
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6377.057,6377.928,Excuse me sir.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,6406.737,6407.433,Yes sir.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6407.433,6413.479,"Suburban passenger deficits however, required another matter."
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,6442.465,6442.882,Yes sir.
1968.13,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6449.858,6451.537,Well I haven't checked the testimony.
1968.13,3,28253,howard_j_trienens,,6453.863,6460.197,I'm saying that to the extent that you have to qualify this by the existence of solely related deficits.
1968.13,4,22627,edward_a_kaier,,6505.562,6507.272,May it please the Court.
1968.13,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6507.272,6508.063,Mr. Kaier.
1968.13,4,22627,edward_a_kaier,,6508.063,6515.909,Mr. Trienens agreed that the Form A cost formula is a good cost formula.
1968.13,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6694.87,6702.126,Is it true that the railroad rates in the north are higher than those in the south for the regular employees?
1968.13,4,22627,edward_a_kaier,,6702.126,6703.088,If Your Honor please --
1968.13,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6703.088,6705.713,-- to the unions?
1968.13,4,22627,edward_a_kaier,,6705.713,6709.108,Let me answer by reference to a decision of the Commission.
1968.13,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6745.423,6752.793,"The north in weight, as I had an idea that the rates of the employees that belong to the general and the national union are the same, is that it?"
1968.13,4,22627,edward_a_kaier,,6752.793,6753.275,No Your Honor.
1968.13,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6772.126,6778.64,I think we'll adjourn now.
