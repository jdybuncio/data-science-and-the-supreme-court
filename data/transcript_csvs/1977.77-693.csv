1977.77-693,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.039,"At 1 o' clock, counsel, we will hear the case of Will against the Insurance Company."
1977.77-693,0,35819,milton_v_freeman,,31.368,36.127,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,1578.723,1582.587,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-693,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.312,1603.157,We noticed who introduced Mr. Freeman here in Court so?
1977.77-693,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1603.157,1605.059,He could not be here without that.
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,1605.059,1609.221,I had little difficulty getting that motion granted.
1977.77-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1783.299,1798.793,"There are going to be some cases though Mr. Loss are there not where the Federal Court for one reason or another is going to say there are related proceedings pending in another Court and we are just not going to set a trial later, we are not going to have discovery for the next six months there?"
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,1798.793,1809.987,"Of course, Your Honor, we do not suggest for a moment that the Federal Court is completely without power to control its docket all of brother my associate justices."
1977.77-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1811.211,1836.695,"The Seventh Circuit really an issue in writ of mandamus, which I understood to entertain the idea that it was not a discretionary obligation of the judge at all but a mandatory duty under which could he labored, which could be enforced, by mandamus seems to me to have said that Judge Will you simply do not have that kind of part that you and I just said the Court does?"
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,1836.695,1865.907,"Not anymore, but I suspect that the reason the Seventh Circuit ordered Judge Will to proceed ?forthwith? is the amount of delay that had already occurred and Judge Will has already said, as far as I am concerned this decision by the State Judge that there is no security is res judicata so that the Seventh Circuit quite properly treated that as if it were a dismissal and my brother Freeman twice answered questions half hour ago by saying yes."
1977.77-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1884.288,1886.205,It is not who is going back to the Federal Court.
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,1895.498,1911.465,"But Your Honor he postponed it so indefinitely and so fully an so completely that the only question left for him if it ever gets back will be not was there a security which is the question that Congress intended him to decide, but is the State decision res judicata or a matter of collateral estoppel."
1977.77-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1911.465,1914.472,But these are questions of shading and degree.
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,1918.395,1944.266,"No your Honor the only thing that is enforceable by mandamus as this Court very recently said in Thermtron Products, Inc.against Hermansdorfer, is this, the Court said a traditional use of the writ in aid of appellate jurisdiction both the common law and in the Federal Courts has been to confine an inferior Court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so and I suggest it his duty."
1977.77-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1944.266,1947.29,In Thermtron there was a dismissal.
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,1947.29,1966.606,"Informed there was a dismissal and informed here there was a mere stay, but as the Seventh Circuit correctly held, I submit, a stay that has all the effect of a dismissal as this one does must be treated like a dismissal mandamus purposes and I cannot see how my brother can have it both ways."
1977.77-693,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1975.99,1985.149,Suppose a Federal Suit had never been filed until after the State Suit had been completed?
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,1985.149,1990.404,"At some point, Your Honor."
1977.77-693,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1990.404,1994.099,You must agree you cannot re-litigate the matter in the Federal Court.
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,1994.099,2003.625,"Of course, indeed we worry about res judicata and collateral-estoppel although we do not admit it, we worry about it in a good deal and that is why we are here."
1977.77-693,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.401,2015.564,"If a fellow with a defense if he does not want to get it tried in a State Court and even present it, is it?"
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,2015.564,2018.093,"Well, If I may say so we did everything we should have done."
1977.77-693,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.45,2024.336,And you certainly tendered it to the State Court.
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,2024.336,2027.458,We had to or we might have risk to default judgment.
1977.77-693,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.458,2031.268,"Maybe, but you also asked for your federal claim to be adjudicated?"
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,2031.268,2036.126,We had to Your Honor or we might have suffered a default judgment but on the very same day --
1977.77-693,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.126,2040.494,That is the defect in our system.
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,2040.494,2042.087,Rather than my answers to your question.
1977.77-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2042.087,2044.155,Mr. Loss how would you have suffered the default judgment.
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,2046.346,2056.806,"Well, I suppose we could have answered solely on the ground that awe had been induced to enter the contract by fraud."
1977.77-693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2059.956,2062.741,Not on the security issue.
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,2065.898,2070.61,But res judicata as I understand it applies to all the issues that should have been raised if the course action.
1977.77-693,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2070.61,2071.759,Could have been raised.
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,2071.759,2074.527,We are talking res judicata.
1977.77-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2074.527,2080.174,But that is the same case it is collateral-estoppel it applies in a different case.
1977.77-693,1,34747,louis_loss,,2080.174,2084.031,If it is basically the same case and this is all one case.
1977.77-693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2084.031,2084.838,But it is not.
1977.77-693,2,35819,milton_v_freeman,,2986.144,3009.979,"First I think I should make it clear that the reason that the State Courts have not acted in this case and have waited is that every action as I understand has been on a motion for stay by Calvert so that they are in a hurry to get justice, they are not in a hurry to get justice in the State Court to which Judge Will remitted them."
1977.77-693,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3119.263,3133.501,Do I understand Mr. Freeman that you agree that the federal jurisdiction was exclusive and that that exclusivity was lost by failure to move within 30 days to remove the case to Federal Court?
1977.77-693,2,35819,milton_v_freeman,,3133.501,3136.337,"No, Your Honor, there's two separate entirely."
1977.77-693,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3166.933,3168.221,Not only for damages.
1977.77-693,2,35819,milton_v_freeman,,3168.221,3169.107,Only for damages.
1977.77-693,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3169.107,3170.318,You agree with your brother Loss?
1977.77-693,2,35819,milton_v_freeman,,3170.318,3171.791,"Yes, we do."
1977.77-693,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3171.791,3173.078,An action for rescission and --
1977.77-693,2,35819,milton_v_freeman,,3173.078,3181.432,"That is the difference and as a matter of fact, his pleadings in the State Court are very clear on that point."
1977.77-693,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.351,3194.749,What was there a prayer for damages in the Federal Court?
1977.77-693,2,35819,milton_v_freeman,,3194.749,3203.218,"In the Federal Court, it was for rescission or in the alternative, for $2 million in damages."
1977.77-693,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3203.218,3234.326,"Mr. Freeman, a colloquy has developed up here between me and one of my colleague which may be wholly irrelevant but a case has come to me and cited in neither of your briefs and did not occur to me until now called Bruce?s Juices, decided maybe 20 years ago with the availability of a defense to enforceability of a contract made in violation of Federal Law, I take it that fact that cited in neither brief means that neither of you considered to be relevant here?"
1977.77-693,2,35819,milton_v_freeman,,3234.326,3236.209,I think it is irrelevant Your Honor.
1977.77-693,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3277.805,3279.918,I see why you would not cite it.
1977.77-693,2,35819,milton_v_freeman,,3279.918,3284.828,"In this case, it is conceded that the defense of 10b-5 can be raised, it has been raised."
1977.77-693,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3299.848,3300.432,Thank you gentlemen.
