2002.01-6978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.989,"We'll hear argument now on number 01-6978, Gary Albert Ewing versus California."
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,8.32,20.999,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In March 2000, Gary Ewing walked into a Los Angeles pro shop, took three golf clubs, stuck them down the pants legs, and walked out."
2002.01-6978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,24.662,25.918,What was the value of the golf clubs?
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,25.918,38.653,"--Because the value of the golf clubs was approximately $1200, it was grand theft under California law. For grand theft, as a general matter, California provides a maximum sentence of three years."
2002.01-6978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,74.986,75.895,Was it armed robbery?
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,75.895,78.182,--He was armed with a knife at that time.
2002.01-6978,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,96.143,112.254,"Would it be fair to add that another reason for the sentence was that the judge did not disregard the priors, and that was because the judge had the record in front of him and the record showed other... a history of other offenses?"
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,113.29,114.288,"It is correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-6978,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,130.089,131.945,They were all misdemeanors?
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,131.945,132.873,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-6978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,149.747,152.22,"Well, now, those surely are not misdemeanors."
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,152.22,152.683,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.01-6978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,160.266,161.68,"Oh, other than--"
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,161.68,162.655,--previous crimes that were misdemeanors.
2002.01-6978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,162.655,162.882,--other than the burglaries.
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,162.882,169.796,"I think that's... the sentencing judge relied on that, to some degree, in denying him any discretionary--"
2002.01-6978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,169.796,170.065,Now--
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,170.065,170.476,--relief.
2002.01-6978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,170.476,175.881,"--it actually went back to 1984, didn't it, with grand theft in '84, grand theft in '88?"
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,175.881,182.622,"Your Honor, the grand theft actually was a misdemeanor, as we've shown in the appendix to our reply brief."
2002.01-6978,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,188.041,188.92,That was the Ohio offense.
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,188.92,189.692,--I--
2002.01-6978,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,189.692,189.91,The--
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,189.91,190.372,--I'm sorry.
2002.01-6978,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.372,196.906,"--the one that was alleged to be a felony, I think, in the government's brief--"
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,196.906,198.452,Is in--
2002.01-6978,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,198.452,200.545,--I think that it was only a misdemeanor.
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,200.545,207.034,"--In fact, we've attached the governing court records as an appendix to our reply brief that shows it was a misdemeanor."
2002.01-6978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,207.034,210.329,"How many... how many convictions in all, felonies plus misdemeanors?"
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,210.329,219.321,"Your Honor, I believe that he had the four... the four prior convictions... the strike convictions, the felonies, and I think he had another nine misdemeanors, and then this present offense."
2002.01-6978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.175,234.434,"And the purpose of the three-strikes law, as I understand it, is to take off of the streets that very small proportion of people who commit an enormously high proportion of crimes."
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,244.474,249.309,--We got... we got--
2002.01-6978,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.309,250.426,"I mean, if that's a reasonable law."
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,255.976,262.749,"--Your Honor, we believe that the law, in itself, is not unreasonable and it could result in a proportionate sentence."
2002.01-6978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,278.368,282.361,"Well, Solem stands with Rummel and with Harmelin."
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,292.81,303.463,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that Rummel... the Court said in Solem... the majority opinion said that Rummel would be controlling only in a similar factual situation."
2002.01-6978,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,317.811,322.439,"Mr. Denvir, would you clarify whether your challenge is strictly as applied?"
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,347.975,348.963,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-6978,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.704,349.944,So--
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,349.944,359.055,"--and to answer your question, we are challenging only the sentence that Mr. Ewing received for the crime that he committed, that he was sentenced at."
2002.01-6978,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,379.286,388.369,"--But we... so we should leave out things like no washout, that someone who never served any time would subject to the three strikes--"
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,388.369,390.721,"I think that's correct, Your Honor, that they don't play into this case."
2002.01-6978,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,402.002,423.792,"--Well, when we're examining the constitutionality of the three-strikes law, as applied to this sentence, we should take into account, should we not, the purposes of the California law, which was to have a law which was... gave simple, clear notice of the three-strikes policy?"
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,430.631,432.812,"Well, Your Honor, I don't... I don't think that's true."
2002.01-6978,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,439.375,444.52,"Yeah, I was going to ask you about that, because you had said that the principal focus has to be on this sentence."
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,452.637,457.59,"Well, Your Honor, the... in Solem versus Helm, the Court, of course, had a recidivist scheme."
2002.01-6978,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,507.607,509.175,I'm just not sure how that works.
2002.01-6978,0,38478,quin_denvir,,513.917,514.642,Your Honor--
2002.01-6978,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,1748.074,1760.117,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: First, I think, in answer to Justice Breyer's question, I don't know what the statistics are under the old indeterminate sentencing law that was in effect in California until 1976."
2002.01-6978,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1803.298,1841.183,"So, tell me, am I fair to say assume there never, in the history of the United States, has been a person who... of the set... I'm only... I don't want to be pejorative; I want to characterize it your way, and I'll characterize it as taking the set of very serious criminals with very serious records, and a person in that set commits another crime, and the other crime is approximately theft of $1200... and am I fair in saying there hasn't been, ever, a sentence in the history of the United States in the last hundred years anywhere close to this one?"
2002.01-6978,1,21309,donald_e_de_nicola,,1920.24,1927.55,"Well, again, Your Honor, I... the... my answer is that I do not know what those records would have shown."
2002.01-6978,2,35610,michael_chertoff,,2965.821,2986.482,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the last series of questions which Justice Souter posed to Mr. De Nicola really framed the issue in light of this case's most recent pronouncement in Harmelin... this Court's most recent pronouncement in Harmelin."
2002.01-6978,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3041.935,3043.283,"Well, why isn't that this case?"
2002.01-6978,2,35610,michael_chertoff,,3061.487,3072.691,--Well--
2002.01-6978,3,38478,quin_denvir,,3545.084,3549.522,"Your Honor, the point I... I'd like to make two points."
2002.01-6978,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3619.712,3621.176,"Thank you, Mr. Denvir."
