2009.08-1151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We will hear argument this morning in Case 08-1151, Stop the Beach Renourishment v. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,10.222,28.083,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Today we ask this Court to expressly recognize that a State court decision, unpredictable in terms of relevant precedents, which redefines century-old property rights to no longer exist, violates the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution."
2009.08-1151,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,57.687,95.628,"I thought your basic position in the litigation in Florida was that the Florida legislation violated the takings protection, and so it's kind of strange to switch your target from the legislature, which enacted this measure, and then say, because the judiciary upheld it, the judiciary somehow is complicit in this violation by the legislature implemented by the administrative offices."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,95.628,97.028,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,172.545,174.997,Applied in a new situation.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,193.875,195.041,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.093,234.949,"Well, they're -- they're eliminated -- at least the right of contact with the water can be eliminated by an avulsion, right?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,250.459,252.411,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.661,254.394,"Well, why wasn't this an avulsion?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,254.394,264.302,"--Well, because the avulsion in this case, Your Honor, was the hurricanes that the State cites as the reason for the beaches being washed away, and -- and it was--"
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.302,265.552,"Well, well, well, well."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,278.626,286.463,"--That is right, Your Honor, but the -- there is no case law in Florida or no principle that says avulsion can occur by artificial means."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.35,294.386,"If there's no case law, it seems to me you've lost your case."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,294.386,301.289,"No, the case law specifically says that avulsion is a result of natural occurrences, by the action of the wind and the water."
2009.08-1151,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,307.043,307.926,They have a new situation.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,366.398,375.42,"--The response to that, Your Honor, is the doctrine of avulsion -- as part of the doctrine of avulsion is the doctrine -- or the right to reclaim what was lost by the landowner."
2009.08-1151,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,384.209,385.275,You didn't lose any.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,401.154,410.26,"What -- what was lost in this case, Your Honor, is the right to contact the mean high -- water line, and I think there's a distinction between the right to contact the mean high-water line and the water's edge."
2009.08-1151,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,414.962,421.032,"Don't you have a right to walk across and put your boat in the water and swim, and nobody can stop you?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,421.032,421.732,--Right.
2009.08-1151,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,426.167,427.917,Now you have that right.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,430.935,431.385,--That's correct.
2009.08-1151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,432.071,436.539,"If somebody wanted to put up a hot dog stand on this new land, would you have the right to tell them they can't?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,436.539,439.141,"--Absolutely not, Your Honor, and that's the point I was getting to."
2009.08-1151,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,439.141,439.758,"You say ""absolutely not""."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,456.7,460.587,I think the statute provides no permanent structures can be constructed on that new property.
2009.08-1151,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,460.587,462.454,It doesn't say anything about your right to peaceful enjoyment?
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,462.454,463.373,It certainly does.
2009.08-1151,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,463.373,464.373,And what does it say?
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,464.373,469.61,"It says that the -- you know, your regular common law uses that cannot be--"
2009.08-1151,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,469.61,476.781,So what does the statute say about your right to have peaceful enjoyment of your land?
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.781,480.399,"Well, you can have quiet hot dog stands during the daytime."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,480.766,481.585,--Yes.
2009.08-1151,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,486.203,487.739,"Injurious, okay."
2009.08-1151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,487.739,488.239,But do you have any--
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,488.239,488.922,"--Of course, now--"
2009.08-1151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,488.922,495.993,--Do you have any reason to suppose that that's a redefinition of -- of property that the legislature isn't free to change tomorrow?
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,495.993,499.647,"--Yes, the legislature can change this definition of property."
2009.08-1151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,509.652,524.578,"Counsel, before this legislation, in the seaward side of the land that belonged to the State, from the mean high-water mark, a hot dog stand could have sat in the water, correct?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,524.578,527.011,"--If somebody wanted to put one in the water, yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,527.011,536.736,"And someone could have stood there, a boat could have docked there, assuming that it -- it was a shallow boat."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,551.811,554.846,We had no exclusive right to exclude them from that property.
2009.08-1151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,558.981,572.373,"The ECL that has been created by this legislation -- you gave up any challenge to it -- it was established at that mean water mark, wasn't it?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,572.373,573.107,--Yes.
2009.08-1151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,587.817,599.792,"So, right now, we just have to assume that it was -- that it -- it has established the line at a point where the State owns all the land seaward of the ECL, correct?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,599.792,600.675,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,600.675,608.898,"So after this project finishes, that hot water -- that hot dog vendor will be on stateside land, correct?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,608.898,609.898,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,609.898,620.638,"No different than what exists today, before the legislation, which is if the hot dog vendor wanted to sit in a foot of water, it could have?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,620.638,622.907,It certainly could sit in a foot of water.
2009.08-1151,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,622.907,623.357,All right.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,651.241,653.36,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,654.509,666.417,"Of course, such -- such boats floating in -- in the water below the mean highwater mark are available with respect to all littoral properties."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,666.936,668.019,"--That is right, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,668.019,682.279,"But what can't happen with other littoral property is that folks can't come in and lay down beach blankets and occupy that sand, right, so that you have open sand in front of -- in front of your house?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,682.279,683.062,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.562,689.049,"And people pay a lot more money for beach -- beachfront homes, for that reason, don't they?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,689.049,690.482,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.018,700.155,"And that's quite different from having a house behind the beach at Coney Island, isn't it?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,700.155,701.44,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,702.856,708.01,"Well, can you -- can you explain something that's unclear to me from the briefs and the records?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,725.553,739.479,"--The foreshore, Your Honor, is typically the land area between the mean high-water line and the low high-water line, and depending on the tide cycles of the day, some of that foreshore is dry, and then at other times--"
2009.08-1151,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,739.479,743.665,And the -- and the public -- what -- what was the situation here?
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,749.3,758.323,"--There's -- the foreshore, Your Honor, which is periodically dry on any given day and periodically wet -- the public can use that, and they have always been able to use that."
2009.08-1151,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,805.554,806.304,Who owns that land?
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,825.016,826.467,"--Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,836.456,850.683,"No, I mean -- I mean, without condemning it, you say the title is held by the private owners even though the title was held by the State when the land was submerged."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,850.683,857.17,"No, Your Honor, I'm not saying that the landowners own that new 80-foot stretch of beach now, as it currently exists."
2009.08-1151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,893.259,904.282,"It would be -- what would your position be, assuming you still have title, you still have the right of littoral title, contact with the water?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,923.028,926.23,"--As the owner of the property, Your Honor?"
2009.08-1151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,927.247,928.33,No.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,930.782,930.782,Okay.
2009.08-1151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,930.782,931.798,It's still your property.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,941.821,943.34,"No, Your Honor, I don't think so."
2009.08-1151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,952.278,955.896,Sometimes -- and I don't actually know what the law is on this.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,982.13,985.432,"No, Your Honor, I don't think they would have any greater rights to that."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.073,1015.351,"The State gave you some quid pro quo for this, which is to say this new sand is projected to last 6 years, has to be replaced regularly, because your -- your property is being eroded, which is the reason the State went into this."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1027.659,1028.742,--ECL.
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.742,1029.709,The ECL.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1059.361,1076.471,"That -- that may well be the case, Your Honor, but, again, they haven't provided us the opportunity to go to that trial, that jury trial, to argue that these -- the value of this new 75-foot stretch of beach on top of the 200-foot stretch of beach provides value above and beyond the taking of the--"
2009.08-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1076.471,1078.089,Let me ask you this question on Florida valuation.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1138.711,1157.406,"--Yes, Your Honor, they are able to offset that, and the -- the statute provides for that offsetting such that in an eminent domain proceedings whatever value the landowners lost as a result of their -- losing their contact with the mean high-water line, that any benefit provided by the additional sand would be offset--"
2009.08-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1157.406,1164.596,So the enhancement from the post-project benefit is a credit to the State in the takings action?
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1164.596,1167.631,"--That -- that is according to the statute that was passed, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1167.631,1188.009,"Did any of these beachfront owners think this was a good deal, that the State has prevented further erosion of their land and, you know, the price they pay for that is that they have this 60-foot stretch that -- that the public can use, and that may wash away in 6 years anyway, and if they're lucky the State won't have enough money to put it back?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1204.054,1205.521,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.006,1208.406,Nobody -- nobody thought it was a good deal?
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1210.989,1213.624,"--With respect to the Petitioner's members, they thought it was a bad deal, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.624,1216.993,"Petitioner's members, but other people along -- along the same coast?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1233.771,1235.871,I think that's the fundamental misunderstanding in this case.
2009.08-1151,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1239.675,1247.079,But what happened?
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1249.612,1251.197,--With the exception of hurricanes.
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.921,1266.456,"It may not change the property line, but all of your property might be under water--"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1268.991,1272.193,--That's a risk that they -- Petitioner's members -- were willing to take.
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1273.409,1278.43,"Well, your members were, but I was asking whether some other people might not have thought it was a pretty good deal."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1278.43,1278.847,Sure.
2009.08-1151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1292.62,1292.953,Could the State--
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1292.953,1293.12,--in this case.
2009.08-1151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1293.12,1295.72,--Could the State sell this new land to somebody else?
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1295.72,1297.738,Yes.
2009.08-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1304.659,1310.313,"But it would be subject to the easement that the State acknowledges you have, which is the easement of access?"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1310.313,1312.248,"I'm not sure it would be, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1314.366,1315.116,"Well, but the -- the--"
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1315.116,1318.484,--so basically it's not an easement per se that inheres in our title.
2009.08-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1318.484,1319.634,"--No, no."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1336.227,1339.512,"Yes, but we don't have common law rights anymore, Your Honor, because we don't--"
2009.08-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1339.512,1339.929,"No, no."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1339.929,1340.679,--contact the mean high-water line.
2009.08-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1340.679,1345.916,"The -- the hypothetical is the State says that the property owner, the upland owner, has these rights."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1360.357,1367.995,"Under the supreme court's opinion, yes, because it purports to reserve common law rights across this new stretch of State-owned beach."
2009.08-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1373.999,1374.249,All right.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1407.82,1413.54,"Yes, Your Honor, that would be the test that we would suggest, as Justice Stewart noted in his concurring opinion in Hughes."
2009.08-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1428.467,1429.8,"Okay, I'm familiar with that opinion."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1469.758,1476.079,"Your Honor, I think the test-again, the fair and substantial support -- provides adequate deference to the State court."
2009.08-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1491.206,1495.742,"Well, it seems to me that, reading the opinion, I -- I can get there."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1512.266,1529.977,"--Yes, the case law, Your Honor, and the incremental changes that we are dealing with here that would be part of your test is the government or the State can gradually change these property rights or property laws so long as they leave the owner with the rights."
2009.08-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1536.881,1537.464,The State can do an accretion--
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1537.464,1537.764,--we're taking them.
2009.08-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1537.764,1538.531,--but not an avulsion?
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1538.531,1539.281,Right.
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1543.035,1552.474,"I thought Martin was -- the Martin case was -- was pretty close, the lake that -- that the State lowered."
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1552.474,1553.907,"Yes, the Martin v. Busch case."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1554.29,1554.79,Right.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1554.79,1560.425,"--That case, ironically, has -- has been relied upon by the State at the Florida Supreme Court level."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.425,1561.96,Did the -- did the Florida Supreme Court cite it?
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1561.96,1563.177,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.177,1563.729,Isn't that weird?
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1564.979,1575.935,"It's not weird, because in 1987 in the Sand Key case, the Florida Supreme Court said that the proposition that the State has cited that case for was not the issue there in that case."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1581.653,1582.653,Do you think that's true?
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1582.653,1584.003,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.003,1585.021,I know they said that.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1590.156,1594.71,"I do think that's true, because the majority in Sand Key said that it dealt with them."
2009.08-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.447,1602.164,A good lawyerly response.
2009.08-1151,0,21522,d_kent_safriet,,1602.164,1602.68,Thank you.
2009.08-1151,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1602.68,1603.196,Thank you.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1607.732,1615.504,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it the Court: Let me go ahead and address some issues that have come up about Florida law."
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1640.802,1644.754,I suppose it depends on -- or maybe not -- how quickly it all happens.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1652.177,1653.962,"Well, it would be an avulsion."
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1657.497,1660.699,"Well, is your view whenever the State does it, it's an avulsion?"
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1660.699,1663.835,"If it's on -- if it's on its property, that's absolutely the case."
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1663.835,1664.518,Why is that?
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1667.686,1668.202,"No, no."
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1686.398,1688.865,Why -- you're -- we're wandering off the point.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1695.169,1696.586,But it was done by the State.
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.638,1698.921,Is -- is--
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1698.921,1699.171,Martin--
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.171,1706.491,--You have a case for the proposition that an -- what would otherwise be an avulsion is an accretion if it's done by the State?
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1706.491,1707.508,"--Oh, no, no, no."
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1707.508,1708.277,Or vice versa.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1711.979,1712.529,"No, no, no."
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1715.481,1715.647,Right.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1715.647,0.0,"When the State adds to its side of the line, adds sand in this case, that's not a gradual, imperceptible--"
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1724.218,0.0,"No, no."
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1726.518,1727.234,What if it is?
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1727.234,1728.736,I don't recall how quickly things happened here.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1728.736,1728.986,"--Oh, well, sure."
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1729.569,1733.704,"But if it's -- if it's gradual, even though the State is doing it, it can be an accretion, right?"
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1733.704,1736.406,"--Well, if it's gradual and perceptible--"
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1736.406,1737.156,Yes.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1737.156,1738.056,--the answer would be yes.
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1738.056,1739.139,It's a foot a year.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1739.139,1739.472,It would be yes.
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1742.441,1743.191,"So, on these facts--"
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1743.191,1743.658,--On these facts--
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1743.658,1751.297,"--On these facts, if the State's project added sand at a foot a year, the landowner would win?"
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1751.297,1757.268,"--I would disagree with that, because what -- that is not a gradual imperceptible change."
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1758.218,1759.82,A foot -- are we dickering over the distance?
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1759.82,1762.152,"We are, I think, because in this case what happened--"
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1762.152,1765.854,"Well, then, wherever you want to say it's an accretion -- what -- it's an inch, 6 inches--"
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1765.854,1778.995,"--Well, that's -- but that's not the way it is under -- under Florida law, if the State comes in on its own property and adds to it, as it did in Martin, where it lowered the -- the water or in this case where they added the sand, it -- the State retains the right to it."
2009.08-1151,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1780.361,1781.294,And why isn't it a fundamental--
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1781.294,1781.711,"--So, you're--"
2009.08-1151,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1781.711,1789.3,--Why isn't it a fundamental change in Florida property law to extend these concepts of accretion and avulsion to things that are done by the State?
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1802.624,1803.507,"--No, absolutely--"
2009.08-1151,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1809.778,1810.213,"Well, what's the difference?"
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1821.771,1825.073,"--Well, maybe we're on Mars and Venus here because we're talking about a label."
2009.08-1151,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1826.606,1836.531,"Yes, talking about a label, and putting the avulsion label and the accretion label on something that the State does, doesn't -- doesn't eliminate the fact that there's been a fundamental change."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1843.184,1850.588,"--Well, there's no question under Florida law that the State has the right on its sovereignty lands to control those lands and use those for the public trust."
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1882.191,1886.344,--If I can -- we're arguing about the application of a doctrine to this case.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1891.063,1891.998,Sure.
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1891.998,1903.454,"The -- the -- let's say the legislature passes an act saying the boundary of beachfront property is now where the sand starts, and not the mean high-water mark but the mean high-sand mark."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1933.156,1935.925,I think under the scenario you're posing that's a possibility.
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1936.693,1938.877,Is it a possibility or is it a clear case?
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1938.877,1947.649,"--Well, I think it would -- if it -- if it's -- it sounds like this is the Cannon Beach situation, where the court judicially said, okay, you don't own to the mean high-water line; now you own up -- only up to the vegetation line."
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1950.934,0.0,"No, no."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1951.834,1952.55,Right.
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1952.55,1953.886,--I understand you have a different view about here.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,1959.088,1972.513,"Yes, I would -- I would countenance that -- that here we have a far different situation, which we have an act of the legislature that draws this line, and that the two attributes that they are claiming have no basis whatsoever in background principles of Florida law."
2009.08-1151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1975.899,1998.415,"Well, what they say is the following -- this is what they say, I think: They point to a case called Sand Key, and in Sand Key it says littoral property rights include the following vested rights: One, the right of access to the water, including the right to have the property's contact with the water remain intact."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2041.692,2044.544,"--Well, you're talking about the legislation."
2009.08-1151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2044.544,2044.96,No--
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2044.96,2045.81,I'm talking about the Sand Key--
2009.08-1151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.81,2049.495,--I'm giving you what I took was -- I don't want to characterize the answer.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2059.267,2059.584,"--Oh, sure."
2009.08-1151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2059.584,2065.605,"Tell me if I'm right, and if I am right, that that is meant to be the answer, justify it, if you can."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2065.605,2066.021,Sure.
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2096.957,2108.098,Sand Key's statement strikes one as -- as correct simply because I think that's -- that's the view of the common law.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2151.793,2152.143,--No.
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2171.355,2172.806,But that's not the question.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2191.784,2202.823,"--But -- but -- well -- but under this avulsive event where there is sand added seaward, the contact by the upland owner with the water no longer exists, and that's been on the books in Florida for--"
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2202.823,2207.208,"--Yes, but that's because you think the property line is the ECL rather than the MHWL."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2207.208,2208.81,"--I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2228.954,2232.806,Would that person still be considered a littoral owner?
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2232.806,2233.675,--That was my second point.
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.675,2243.947,"After there has been the avulsive event that separates him from the ocean by 60 feet of State-owned land, would he still be a -- a riparian owner?"
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2244.347,2245.53,"Absolutely, absolutely."
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2258.288,2262.023,"Well, but it's not -- it's not the same as the property right he held before, right?"
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2262.023,2264.142,"--I -- I would disagree with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2264.142,2266.51,So he can exclude people from the additional 60 feet?
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2266.51,2268.327,But it's not his -- it's not their property.
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2268.86,2269.712,"But, that's what the case is about."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2269.712,2271.728,"--Well, I -- I agree that's what they have tried to make it about."
2009.08-1151,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2277.249,2295.343,"Well, suppose that -- suppose that a city decided that it wanted to attract more students who are going to the beach in Florida for spring break, and so therefore it decided it was going to create a huge beach in front of -- of privately owned homes."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2316.238,2321.623,"Well, Justice Alito, in response, what I'd say here is keep in mind this is the Beach and Shore Preservation Act."
2009.08-1151,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2325.827,2339.001,"No, I understand that, but if the -- but the Florida Supreme Court said that there isn't any right -- if there is a manmade extension of the beach, there is no right to exclude people from it; it's -- the beach is owned by the State."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2341.119,2346.004,"--Well, not under the Act, because -- here's why: Under the Act, what has to be done is a survey."
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2346.92,2347.837,--He's not talking about the Act.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2359.645,2362.763,"--Well, if there was -- if there were some other act where the legislature passes a law--"
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2362.763,2363.097,Right.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2369.0,2369.966,--Well--
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.966,2370.866,Under your theory of the case?
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2370.866,2375.737,"--Well, they -- they would, but the point being is that they would have to preserve the littoral rights of--"
2009.08-1151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2375.737,2376.887,"Well, why do we have to say that?"
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2457.956,2459.956,"--No, well, there's -- there's even more, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-1151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.956,2461.241,"Okay, that's what I wanted to know."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2461.574,2473.381,"What the legislature in Florida did as well is to say that when they do the survey, as you see in the document attached in the joint appendix, they have to set out what the width of the berm will be, the sacrificial sand that's there to erode away over time."
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2481.635,2487.27,So why doesn't -- why don't you take your list and Justice Breyer's list and submit that in the just compensation hearing?
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2507.517,2513.405,"--Well, because, Mr. Chief Justice, under background principles of Florida law, they have no right to contact with the water, and this accretion right is--"
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2513.405,2518.408,"Again, that is what the whole case is about, whether they have a right to contact the water or not."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2523.795,2526.997,"--But under -- with due respect, under Florida law, they don't."
2009.08-1151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2527.78,2548.01,"Well, isn't the question here that the reason they don't under Florida law is in a situation where the law isn't clear, we draw the Florida law this way rather than that way, and that is a reasonable common law decision because of the six points that we've listed on the list?"
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2548.01,2548.96,--Absolutely.
2009.08-1151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2549.426,2550.695,So it's not that it's a taking--
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2550.695,2551.895,--Absolutely.
2009.08-1151,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2551.895,2557.266,"--and you're compensating; it is a reason why this is a -- I am somewhat putting words in your mouth, but I mean ----"
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2560.984,2564.586,"Well, certainly our position is that there's no--"
2009.08-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2564.586,2565.703,You won't disagree with that.
2009.08-1151,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2566.955,2573.359,Do you know the answer to the question that was asked of your colleague?
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2598.89,2606.163,"--Other than these Petitioners, Justice Ginsburg, no one has complained about this and said that -- and brought an action or -- or otherwise."
2009.08-1151,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2612.9,2622.171,"But the problem with the argument that I'm having is that in the last colloquy with Justice Breyer, we heard how reasonable this act was."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2653.774,2654.809,"--Sure, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-1151,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2667.55,2668.533,And this statute provides--
2009.08-1151,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2668.533,2668.816,So you--
2009.08-1151,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2668.816,2676.222,"--This very statute says if -- if what happens is a taking, then there's compensation."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2676.222,2677.389,--Right.
2009.08-1151,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2678.008,2687.864,"--And you think there's a taking as a matter of Georgia -- pardon me, of Florida law if enjoyment of the view and access is substantially impaired?"
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2688.764,2692.049,"--That's the law in Florida, Justice Kennedy, is that if there's a substantial impairment."
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2693.699,2703.005,"So on behalf of the State, you concede if any of this list -- these -- the list of good things that the land owner gets, if the legislature next year takes them away, that would be a taking?"
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2703.005,2711.36,"--Sure, if they took away the -- the swath of littoral rights or a substantial portion, that would be highly problematic and likely be a taking."
2009.08-1151,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2711.36,2721.401,Do you think that either all of the time or some of the time a public beach would -- that intervenes between the upland and the water would be a substantial impairment of the upland owner's rights?
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2721.401,2722.251,"No, no, no."
2009.08-1151,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2725.001,2726.969,That -- that's exactly my point.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2747.013,2747.547,Well--
2009.08-1151,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2747.547,2755.769,--But that takes away from your earlier argument that we don't need to worry because there can be no interference with substantial enjoyment.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2760.138,2763.459,"--Well, I believe the answer is that this is a facial challenge."
2009.08-1151,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2768.208,2773.593,I want you to talk to me about what the constitutional law ought to be in this case as a general matter.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2786.67,2805.647,"Well -- and the Florida Supreme Court was very careful in narrowing its decision and saying that the actual property owners may pursue, if they feel -- beyond this opinion, they may pursue an as-applied claim, where they -- this has no takings record before this Court whatsoever, and that would have to be developed, keeping in mind that much--"
2009.08-1151,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2805.647,2811.282,"But when they do, they're going to be met by you when you're in the trial court and you say the State owns the property."
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2811.282,2816.603,"--Well, just because the State owns the property doesn't mean there cannot be an impairment of the -- of the right."
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2820.74,2821.557,You can complete your thought.
2009.08-1151,1,38130,scott_d_makar,,2821.557,2821.89,--Sure.
2009.08-1151,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2832.647,2833.114,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2843.336,2857.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: From the outset, this case has been a challenge to the actions of the Florida legislature and its executive branch in enacting and implementing the Beach Restoration Act."
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2890.401,2892.769,"Mr. Kneedler, that's a clever ploy."
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2898.923,2903.975,"Well, but -- but, in fairness, first of all, that's how this case originated, was a challenge--"
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2903.975,2904.743,There's no choice.
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2909.629,2910.179,--No.
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2910.647,2912.364,"--and said, oh, we think we know that the court is going to change things."
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2912.364,2916.033,--My -- my point isn't -- isn't so much about whether it could have been raised earlier.
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2933.41,2935.012,Judicial -- judicial taking if that were the case?
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2935.012,2936.679,That -- that would be more like Hughes.
2009.08-1151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.083,2940.6,"No, no, no--"
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2940.6,2957.794,"--to come at this -- and this may even be suggested in -- in Justice Scalia's dissent in the Cannon Beach case -- is that the -- the usual principle that where State law is interposed in a way that would -- would defeat a Federal constitutional right, a court can look to see whether there is a fair and substantial basis for it."
2009.08-1151,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2963.163,2963.615,"Well, why not?"
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2971.285,2972.002,"--Right, and--"
2009.08-1151,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2972.002,2975.923,The court said: You've never had that right.
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3029.558,3048.602,"--And -- and maybe so, but -- but, again, I think it -- it would be possible to -- to review it under the general principle about whether a State interpretation of State law that would defeat a claim to Federal right would be without any fair or substantial basis, without -- without saying that the supreme court itself has committed an unconstitutional act."
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3084.109,3085.625,"Accretion -- accretion, of course, would change."
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3085.625,3086.209,--Accretion--
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3086.209,3089.311,It would take submerged State land and give it to the landowner.
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3089.311,3092.965,"--Accretion would, but -- but avulsion or rapid change would not."
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3092.965,3095.448,So a foot -- I'll get back to what I raised earlier.
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3101.768,3105.137,"I -- I don't want to quibble, but I think it depends."
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3142.593,3144.343,So it makes a difference whether it's done in a day or done in a month?
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3144.343,3151.263,"--Well, the -- the difference between accretion and avulsion is whether it's gradual and imperceptible or whether it's -- whether it's dramatic or--"
2009.08-1151,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3151.263,3162.154,"What authority is there in Florida law or in general law to say that the act of an -- an artificial person is an accretion or avulsion, instead of just an act of nature?"
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3164.772,3188.122,"--Well, the Florida Supreme Court's decision in the -- in the Peppe case relied on Martin v. Busch, which -- I agree with Justice Scalia, it's very critical here, where there was State action in draining the lake, which exposed the surface -- the -- the formerly submerged land, and the Florida Supreme Court said that land belongs to the State, it was action by the State in a dramatic way."
2009.08-1151,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3188.722,3190.174,But -- but did they call it an avulsion?
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3190.174,3191.774,"--They -- they did not there, but in -- but in--"
2009.08-1151,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3191.774,3194.442,That -- that -- so that doesn't answer my question.
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3194.442,3203.231,"--No, but my point was, in Peppe, where -- where there was actually an avulsion, the court characterized what happened in Martin v. Busch as an avulsive act."
2009.08-1151,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3214.622,3223.295,"Can I just ask you this, Mr. Kneedler, before your time expires, what -- I agree, Martin v. Busch seems to be the case that's most -- provides the greatest support for what the Florida Supreme Court did here."
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3226.247,3234.417,"--I -- I think it is surprising, although the Florida Supreme Court did discuss avulsion, but if -- if I could just make one point."
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3289.201,3290.237,"Counsel, what is your--"
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3290.237,3290.937,But once the land--
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3290.937,3291.42,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3311.234,3314.936,"--Again, I think I would analyze it under the fair and substantial basis."
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3323.641,3324.841,"Well, doesn't -- it's not pretextual."
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3324.841,3325.241,"--Not pretextual, but if there's--"
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3325.241,3326.843,"He says, I think they got the law wrong."
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3326.843,3332.48,--But -- but the phrasing the Court has used in the due process is whether it's unforeseen and indefensible.
2009.08-1151,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3366.634,3367.068,Counsel--
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3367.068,3368.201,--Martin v. Busch on that ground.
2009.08-1151,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3368.201,3380.711,"--Would you have answered Justice Scalia's question that there's a common -- a generally understood common law right, littoral right, to contact with the water?"
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3382.228,3391.484,"I would -- I would say there -- I would say it's tied up with the right of access, as long as the littoral property owner remains adjacent to the water."
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3414.449,3417.634,"It could be -- it could be adding an amusement park, though, under your theory, right?"
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3417.634,3420.919,"--No, it -- I don't think there's any universal theory of this."
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3424.138,3424.823,It's the State's property.
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3424.823,3426.223,"--Well, I--"
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3426.223,3426.757,It's the State's property.
2009.08-1151,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3428.673,3429.039,--No.
2009.08-1151,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3476.735,3479.437,--Let's see if there are any further questions.
2009.08-1151,3,21522,d_kent_safriet,,3486.424,3488.007,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3538.809,3544.879,"They wouldn't own to the mean high-water mark if there were an avulsion, if -- right?"
2009.08-1151,3,21522,d_kent_safriet,,3545.295,3546.462,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3546.462,3552.799,"--If by nature, this 60-foot beach had been put in, then their deed would be changed, wouldn't it?"
2009.08-1151,3,21522,d_kent_safriet,,3552.799,3572.213,"Temporarily, Your Honor, because under the doctrine of reclamation, they can reclaim the boundary line that they lost, just as if in a case where the hurricane washes sand away, the landowner, under common law, the doctrine of reclamation, can bring in sand where the water is to reconnect to that mean high-water line that would be underwater following a hurricane."
2009.08-1151,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3572.213,3574.065,"Now, how does that work?"
2009.08-1151,3,21522,d_kent_safriet,,3589.524,3594.043,"Yes, Florida law allows, under the doctrine of reclamation, which is what the Florida Supreme Court relied on--"
2009.08-1151,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3594.043,3595.062,Which is -- how does it work?
2009.08-1151,3,21522,d_kent_safriet,,3595.062,3596.378,--You'd have to remove the sand.
2009.08-1151,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3596.378,3597.578,You shovel away the sand.
2009.08-1151,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3597.578,3598.18,"Oh, no, no."
2009.08-1151,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3599.28,3599.914,What if it's going the opposite way?
2009.08-1151,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3602.282,3603.918,It's rock.
2009.08-1151,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3603.918,3604.534,--Yes.
2009.08-1151,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3605.134,3607.202,"Okay, so what happens?"
2009.08-1151,3,21522,d_kent_safriet,,3607.202,3611.071,I'm not sure the common law envisioned rock coming up to--
2009.08-1151,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3611.071,3613.106,It can happen.
2009.08-1151,3,21522,d_kent_safriet,,3628.996,3629.865,"--I think that's wrong, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3630.781,3631.065,Okay.
2009.08-1151,3,21522,d_kent_safriet,,3631.315,3635.667,"--Under the doctrine of reclamation, they can reclaim the boundary line."
2009.08-1151,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3649.743,3651.711,They can go on the State land to do that?
2009.08-1151,3,21522,d_kent_safriet,,3654.063,3658.615,"That wouldn't be State -- they can -- the common law allows them to reclaim what they're lost -- what they lost, Your Honor."
2009.08-1151,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3704.679,3706.479,Why did they drop out?
2009.08-1151,3,21522,d_kent_safriet,,3706.479,3709.131,"Lack of standing at the administrative hearing, Your Honor."

2009.08-1151,3,21522,d_kent_safriet,,3759.378,3764.515,"Well, they haven't gained property, Your Honor, because the State's claiming title to that new beach."
