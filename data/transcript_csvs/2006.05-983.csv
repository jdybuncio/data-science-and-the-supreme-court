2006.05-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.154,"We'll hear argument this morning in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District."
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,9.872,14.843,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-983,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,122.629,135.353,"If we say that the parents are the real party in interest and are entitled to sue in their own right, is that the end of the case, or do we reach the second... a second question as to whether or not they can represent the children?"
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,135.353,138.472,"I don't think you would need a reach a second question, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,167.241,182.251,What can the parents get out of this case other than reimbursement for the tuition they've paid to private schools and procedural rights that are given them by the Act?
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,194.458,206.968,"Well, clearly the relief primarily sought by my clients... in fact, if you look just at the relief section of the complaint that my clients filed, which is in joint appendix, page 19, the only relief they actually seek is reimbursement."
2006.05-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.051,217.157,What other possible relief could they seek other than giving them a procedural right accorded by the Act?
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,224.762,234.135,"--Of course, it's our position that parents are never acting as guardians, at least in the legal sense, or lay representatives of a child in a court action."
2006.05-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,243.391,250.478,It depends upon their being a party aggrieved.
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,257.733,258.951,Correct.
2006.05-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,258.951,278.664,"Now if the only remedies the parents are entitled to in their own right are reimbursement, which is at issue here, and procedural guarantees, why would not their ability to sue or to appear pro se be limited to those two categories?"
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,285.468,295.543,"Well, in... and this could be a very easy case if the Court wants to look just at the specific procedural violations that my clients assert and also the reimbursement claim that they assert."
2006.05-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.892,347.925,The child is.
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,369.507,387.219,"--We also believe that the parents have an interest in the education being appropriate for... in addition to the reason I just explained, that they may have to supplement education, but parents are also the co-architects of the individualized educational program that is eventually... that eventually defines the bundle of services that it provides the child."
2006.05-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,388.469,390.337,"Well, you say they're the co-architects."
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,395.639,401.709,"--I think they're given... I haven't counted them... but I think they're given 10, 12 of the 15 procedural rights outlined in the statute."
2006.05-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,410.732,422.189,"Isn't there a bit of... there's a leap from saying they have these various procedural rights and they're are a party aggrieved by the decision rendered after the hearing, that's a different question, isn't it?"
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,422.189,432.664,"--Well, typically a parent would file a due process complaint, challenging the bundle of services offered by the school district, and alleging a procedural violation."
2006.05-983,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,445.222,451.209,They are an aggrieved party for purposes of the administrative process.
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,490.267,492.786,"No, not at all, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,532.178,534.362,"Which just begs the question, doesn't it?"
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,539.433,546.937,"--Well, again, it is our position that they are because they're parties aggrieved by the administrative proceedings, so long as they have exhausted their claims."
2006.05-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,556.376,572.571,"I thought it was the unanimous view of the circuits that parents, as a general matter, do not have the right to represent their children in Federal court, that the provision of the judicial code that you cited does not confer on parents, generally, the right to represent children."
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,572.571,574.44,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,598.019,603.405,"You know, it's not an insignificant matter at issue here."
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,640.513,649.969,"Well, I'm not sure that the policy considerations would be relevant to the statutory construction question of whose rights are being asserted in a case like this."
2006.05-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,670.115,675.603,The statute already allows the shifting of fees to a prevailing party.
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,689.677,692.11,--Two responses Mr. Chief Justice.
2006.05-983,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,717.027,720.862,Was their an argument at any point in this case that the claim was frivolous?
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,720.862,722.314,"No, there was not."
2006.05-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,757.904,767.693,"Well, if they had that overriding intent, it would have been easy enough for them to make clear that this was an exception to the normal rule, that parents don't have the right to represent children in court."
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,776.965,778.482,"--Well, actually, if I could clarify one thing."
2006.05-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,791.474,797.109,"I know, but 14... is it 1415(f)?"
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,813.804,821.66,"But that's also... our position is they have the right to participate in the due process hearing as parties, in fact as the kind of plaintiff side parties."
2006.05-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,827.731,830.1,It doesn't say they have the right to participate as parties.
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,842.24,848.977,"Well, we thought that... we believe that Congress thought of it as the parents because of all the statutory references to the parents' complaint."
2006.05-983,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,888.102,910.735,"Before you do that, how much of a practical benefit would it be for children with disabilities and their parents, if you are successful here, in light of the complexity of the IDEA and the fact that this is an area where some parents are going to have difficulty maintaining any kind of emotional detachment from the litigation?"
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,929.179,938.201,"--Well, first of all, parents already have to get to know the statute and the applicable regulations when they bring these cases at the administrative level."
2006.05-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.057,965.435,"These disadvantaged parents that you are referring to who comprise the majority of parents, they're really up on section, you know, (h)(1) and all that stuff?"
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,981.695,985.766,"I'm not sure we agree, with all due respect, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1018.153,1022.955,"And do it right after reading pro se prisoner petitions, right?"
2006.05-983,0,28860,jean_claude_andre,,1025.891,1030.461,We think that the pro se parents are quite different from pro se prisoners.
2006.05-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1032.579,1040.316,"Thank you, Mr. Andre."
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1048.172,1051.958,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1081.41,1083.762,That argument proves a little too much.
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1101.224,1119.435,"--Well, I think that's right, Your Honor, but the difference here is that the statute in section 1412(a)(10)(C)(2), and this is on page 6A of Petitioner's brief, expressly provides a right to parents to seek reimbursement for the... for their... the educational expenses that they incur."
2006.05-983,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.835,1153.072,But then you would be establishing a right for the least needy.
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1179.972,1183.091,"Well, that's not the sum total of our argument, Your Honor."
2006.05-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1232.022,1233.607,I'm not following you.
2006.05-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.793,1238.511,I think you quoted from 4(a).
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1238.511,1240.511,--There's... That's correct.
2006.05-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1365.611,1378.936,"So their, their rights... so their right to proceed in Federal court should be limited to the rights that you've identified under the statute as opposed to the right to proceed on behalf of the child?"
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1378.936,1379.919,--That's correct.
2006.05-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1379.919,1387.857,"In other words, you think... you think their... their, their rights... the rights they can assert are only ones they can identify as their own as opposed to the child's?"
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1387.857,1395.547,"Well it, that is essentially our position although I would add that our position is that all of the rights of the statute are rights that are shared by the parent."
2006.05-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.063,1399.249,"Well, then you still haven't said anything."
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1422.281,1422.915,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.431,1424.899,"Well, you haven't said anything then."
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1424.899,1425.399,--Well--
2006.05-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.399,1429.684,You really haven't limited the scope of the parent's right to sue at all.
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1429.684,1436.624,--Well... well... just because I haven't limited the rights of the parents right doesn't mean that I haven't been trying to make a point about how to interpret the statute.
2006.05-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1461.406,1461.989,Fine.
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1472.528,1475.03,"Well, we think the way--"
2006.05-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.03,1481.367,It does give the parents the right procedures explicitly and the rights to reimbursement for... for private tuition.
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1481.367,1482.486,--The... that... that's correct.
2006.05-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.519,1513.338,"And that right, where... where is that right contained?"
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1516.39,1517.242,--The right to initiate--
2006.05-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1517.242,1533.935,"The right to initiate a suit solely on the basis... not that I was denied procedures, not that I, I paid money for private schooling, but I do not believe the outcome, the education given to my child in the public school was enough."
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1533.935,1553.582,"--Your Honor, what I would refer you to are the many provisions of the Act, and you can turn to pages 16 A and 17 A for example of Petitioner's brief that has these, in part, where the Act repeatedly refers to the parents' due process complaint, the parents' due process complaint, known as the parents' right to a due process hearing."
2006.05-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.537,1565.803,They have the right... they have the right to the hearing.
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1566.922,1567.772,--They have a right--
2006.05-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1567.772,1573.643,--Do they have a right in and of themselves... not as guardians... do they have the right to a particular outcome in the hearing?
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1576.011,1589.985,"--Our way of looking at the statute, Your Honor, says that if they are the ones that initiate the hearing, they file the complaint, they are parties to that hearing, then when, when their claims are denied, they are parties aggrieved within the meaning of the statute."
2006.05-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1597.691,1599.043,It is not... it is not just party aggrieved.
2006.05-983,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1608.316,1615.97,"Well, I... does say, it does reference back, in fact it references back to the complaint that's filed to initiate the due process hearing."
2006.05-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1652.845,1655.547,"Thank you, Mr. Salmons."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1659.932,1663.034,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1700.092,1703.111,How do you classify right to reimbursement?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1703.111,1706.73,"Your Honor, I would classify that as not a right, it's a remedy."
2006.05-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.37,1720.739,"The right to recover money, it's just a remedy, it's not a right?"
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1720.739,1725.207,"That's, and that's how 1412 is structured, the provisions about reimbursement."
2006.05-983,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1735.146,1740.383,What about the provision that says at no cost to the parent?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1740.383,1754.54,"Your Honor, certainly that has been one of the emphases by Petitioners, but the response to that is that the free aspect of the free appropriate public education does not give parents a substantive right to the education itself."
2006.05-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.1,1770.069,Why don't we go back to my other question to be sure I got your point.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1773.104,1775.954,--Your Honor--
2006.05-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1775.954,1778.406,The child or the parents?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1778.406,1780.508,--Our position is it would be paid to the child.
2006.05-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1786.962,1791.066,You reimburse the child for money that his parents spent?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1791.066,1797.469,"--And Your Honor, that is how the court, lower courts in the Third Circuit, where the Collinsgru rule prevails, that's how they apply it."
2006.05-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1797.469,1802.789,What would... what would happen if the child were deceased or incompetent?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1802.789,1810.11,"Well, that is, that is exactly the scenario in the Seventh Circuit case that they cited in 2007."
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1822.768,1832.643,"In an instance in which the money is paid to the... the reimbursement is paid to the child, how does the child get the money to the parents?"
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1832.643,1833.709,You've got to assume--
2006.05-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1833.709,1835.594,"Maybe, maybe these children don't."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1839.129,1842.831,"--Your Honor, I think it is no different than a basic attorney fee award."
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1852.806,1855.256,"No, I'm not talking about negating the award."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1866.964,1867.497,That's right.
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1867.497,1869.382,Which would be the parent.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1873.72,1885.693,"Well, because the claim would have to be brought on behalf of the child, because they would not have the capacity to bring the claim itself, the award would go straight to the, to the guardian, who may be the parent that is proceeding on their behalf."
2006.05-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1885.693,1890.745,But the guardian can't the funds that belong to the child.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1890.745,1896.633,"Well, but Your Honor, we believe that that's the pragmatic result that Congress intended here."
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1896.633,1897.301,All right.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1915.88,1916.313,"Well, Your Honor--"
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1916.313,1918.414,You can't have it... you can't have it both ways.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,1918.414,1921.08,"--Well, the guardian can certainly bring the claim on behalf of the child."
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1944.462,1951.901,"What is this to do... I mean, I'm... I'm puzzled about why we're talking about this complicated thing."
2006.05-983,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1960.074,1960.557,Yes.
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1960.557,1965.978,"And it says that the procedural rights, right at the beginning, are for both the children and the parents."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2013.959,2021.029,"Well, Your Honor, if you're talking about the distinction between the procedural and the substance in the Act, Congress made clear--"
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.029,2021.496,"No, I'm not."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2026.183,2026.666,--Right.
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2026.666,2027.968,And who writes the check?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2029.618,2030.67,"Generally, no, Your Honor."
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2030.67,2031.003,No.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2040.943,2041.359,Just--
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2041.359,2056.119,"So I'm looking at the particular words in the procedural section, and the particular words explicitly say that every subsection is both for parent, through child; and then we get to the Court one and it talks about person aggrieved."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2061.739,2063.224,--I'll do my best.
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2063.224,2075.366,"--You have to convince me that person aggrieved at the at the end of this section is meant to apply to only some of the people whom every other section talks about, namely just children, not parents."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2077.116,2079.484,"Well, let me try to explain, Justice Breyer."
2006.05-983,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.68,2125.632,What's that section you just alluded to?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2128.751,2130.434,"--I'm sorry, which section?"
2006.05-983,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2130.434,2131.953,--F--
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2131.953,2137.44,"Oh, 1415(f)(3)(E}, I'm focusing on 21 A of the blue brief, Your Honor."
2006.05-983,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.809,2140.359,--21 A or--
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2140.359,2143.943,"--21 A of the blue brief, Your Honor."
2006.05-983,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.943,2147.378,--And which is the statutory section again.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2147.378,2149.664,It's 1415(f)(3)(E).
2006.05-983,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.664,2150.68,I thought you said 14.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2150.68,2152.366,(f)(3)(E).
2006.05-983,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.366,2155.234,Are you sure it's not 18(a)?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2155.234,2171.244,"(f)(3)(E) is on 21a of my version of the blue brief, Your Honor."
2006.05-983,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.684,2183.719,"It's in 18(a) of mine, too."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2185.737,2189.122,"That's not my brief, Your Honor, I apologize."
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2251.63,2253.215,"Your argument, I guess, is this argument."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2264.039,2264.472,I would not--
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2264.472,2267.991,"He can't complain in court or... well, it sounds as if you were saying that."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2281.149,2287.369,"--Well, he can't decide against the parent because the only issue at stake is the right of the child."
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2287.369,2288.838,"Oh, well... right."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2299.546,2305.199,"Well, he won't have a right taken away from him because it's not... it's not his claim at stake in the due process hearing."
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.199,2308.151,"Oh, I would agree, we can be on the same grounds there."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2308.151,2308.584,Right.
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2308.584,2326.88,"I agree that if the parent isn't hurt, if the parent wasn't deprived of anything, the parents can go to court but doesn't have anything to complain about, you know, whereas another section of the statute says that reimbursement is something supposed to be reimbursement for the parent, so it would seem as if the panther has something to complain about."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2334.969,2336.052,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2337.152,2340.104,"--So, now it looks as if the parent has something to complain about."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2351.478,2351.961,Right.
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2365.788,2372.225,"Mr. Bergeron, I have a basic conceptual problem, both with that response and with your larger argument."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2465.187,2468.305,"--And here's how I would explain it, Justice Souter."
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2484.898,2493.604,Then why don't we say that they are the procedural rights of the child and the parents are simply stepping into the child's shoes to vindicate them?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2493.604,2496.992,"--That is exactly what 1415(m) says, Your Honor."
2006.05-983,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2517.905,2520.607,But that's when the child reaches majority.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2520.607,2521.057,--That's right.
2006.05-983,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2521.057,2523.975,"The child is no longer a child, the child is an adult."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2523.975,2526.475,And that's my... that's part of what I was trying to say.
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2526.475,2527.644,I'm sorry.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2528.144,2528.644,Oh.
2006.05-983,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.604,2555.928,"What if... what stands in the way of that analysis is the text, which says all other rights accorded to parents under this subchapter transfer to the child."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2563.1,2563.517,Right.
2006.05-983,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2566.469,2570.338,"But then you were denying them, as I understood the argument."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2570.338,2572.306,"Well, let me clarify then."
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2604.094,2605.161,Isn't that the problem?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2630.328,2636.815,"Your Honor, if you look at... I'll direct you to the DiBuo case and the Lesesne case, I'm probably mispronouncing both of them--"
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2636.815,2638.015,"No, but before you direct me to cases--"
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2638.015,2638.582,--Okay.
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2638.582,2642.034,--What's wrong with the analytical point that I just made?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2642.034,2646.502,"Well, Your Honor, the... that's what Congress was trying to clarify in 2004."
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2655.525,2661.611,"Yeah, but instead of saying they're not eclipsed, you're saying they are totally blocked out."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2688.229,2693.467,"Right, and I'm not saying that the parent... the parent's procedural rights are gone."
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2694.669,2708.809,"But if the parent's procedural rights are not gone, then the parents must be able to invoke those procedural rights based on what they claim to be a denial of some substantive entitlement."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2722.902,2723.469,--Yes.
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2723.469,2724.521,Okay.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2741.982,2746.6,"Your Honor, because that... again, that was what Congress was trying to clarify in 2004."
2006.05-983,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2762.244,2771.502,Does a parent have a right to bring a 1983 action if their procedural rights under this statute are interfered with by the state actors?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2771.502,2783.975,"Your Honor, if the parent would otherwise have a 1983 claim under 1415(l), if it relates to an IDEA claim, there would have to be exhaustion first."
2006.05-983,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2783.975,2795.617,"I think I understand your argument based on 3(E), but when I look at 21a of my blue brief there's another provision on attorneys' fees and it's phrased in a very curious way."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2817.281,2818.231,That's right.
2006.05-983,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.608,2861.143,What was the section you cited?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2861.143,2868.479,"1411(e)(3)(E), on 5a of the red brief."
2006.05-983,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.479,2870.248,(e)(3)(E).
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2870.248,2870.715,Yes.
2006.05-983,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2870.715,2871.315,Legal fees.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2887.293,2899.101,"What I'm saying is Congress recognized that when legal action is being brought to secure FAPE, just like it's the child's right to the FAPE under subchapter 2, it is being brought on behalf of the child."
2006.05-983,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2928.704,2936.81,"There's a section you pointed to that says disbursements under subparagraph (d), but your brief doesn't include subparagraph (d)."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2936.81,2945.831,"--It's the high cost, one of the high cost funds for states, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-983,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2947.031,2958.139,"Well then, if this provision is limited to subparagraph (d), how can you argue that it covers the waterfront?"
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,2958.139,2969.947,"--Well, Your Honor, I think it's indicative of what Congress appreciated the claim would look like on any level, and it's not simply saying that those funds aren't provided under subparagraph (d)."
2006.05-983,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3016.862,3024.749,Are attorneys' fees allowed to a parent who is bringing one of these cases on behalf of a child pro se?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3024.749,3025.7,No.
2006.05-983,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3025.7,3026.683,It's a convoluted question.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3034.989,3044.662,"That's what... I think there have been four circuits who addressed that in the context of attorney parents, and they've all said that they cannot get fees."
2006.05-983,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3044.662,3049.899,So how is the spending clause issue very significant in terms of the exposure of the school boards?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3049.899,3054.118,"Well, Arlington did not limit it to simply liability."
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3099.916,3111.389,"So I take it your argument is, your red brief argument is that Congress said, states, if you get some judgments against you and they award attorneys' fees, you pay for it, we won't?"
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3113.506,3114.775,No.
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3114.775,3116.741,"You don't pay for it, you can't pay for it out of the grant?"
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3116.741,3117.26,Right.
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3117.26,3117.627,Okay.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3120.345,3121.129,I'm sorry?
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3121.129,3122.879,States--
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3122.879,3123.645,Right.
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3123.645,3133.917,"--if some people bring claims against you under this because you didn't have a good plan for the child and your attorneys' fees are awarded against you, don't pay for it out of this grant."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3137.119,3147.676,"Well, Your Honor, it's a little bit different because part of the... part of the real issue here is not necessarily an award of attorneys' fees to the other party, but it's the incurrence of attorneys' fees defending--"
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3147.676,3153.045,"I thought what your argument was... and if it's not, forget it, it's just that I don't understand it."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3182.684,3183.567,--And... I think that's right.
2006.05-983,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3183.567,3184.167,Okay.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3185.134,3189.337,"And... and just to clarify, Congress hasn't provided any funds for this."
2006.05-983,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3238.584,3240.353,"Well, that's where I have a little bit of trouble."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3268.103,3276.526,"Well... and I think the answer to that is it's still not clear to me from... from listening to the argument today, I mean, Petitioner acknowledged the child falls out of the equation."
2006.05-983,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3288.351,3289.619,So if you agree we're talking about.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3315.334,3326.709,"--Justice Ginsburg, in litigating this case while the Winkelmans were pro se, we expended far greater than the $8,000 at issue in Arlington, on our legal fees defending--"
2006.05-983,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3326.709,3327.076,Right.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3355.145,3366.286,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, remember at the time the Congress reauthorized in 2004, every circuit that had addressed it besides the First had agreed that parents could not bring a pro se."
2006.05-983,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3377.059,3380.796,I'm not disputing that it results in additional exposure.
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3386.617,3394.786,"Well, if you, in the dissent in Arlington, they made... Justice Breyer made a basically materiality argument and the majority did not seem moved by it."
2006.05-983,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3405.661,3413.184,Could the court appoint the parent guardian ad litem and just the parent proceed as guardian ad litem?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3413.184,3423.956,"That wouldn't solve the issue of, under the common law the guardian ad litem would not have the ability to receive pro se on the common law fees, the same as the parent."
2006.05-983,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3425.942,3429.11,The guardian ad litem cannot proceed pro se?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3429.11,3429.494,--That's right.
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3436.965,3450.606,"Mr. Bergeron, on, one of the points you made on the spending clause argument, I thought, was that if there are lawyers representing the parents, the lawyers are going to screen out the more frivolous cases."
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3469.686,3476.673,"Justice Souter, we don't because most of the circuits were saying this is... we're not going to allow pro se--"
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3476.673,3478.458,We don't have any First Circuit numbers--
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3478.458,3478.825,--No.
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3478.825,3479.792,--versus other numbers?
2006.05-983,2,37712,pierre_h_bergeron,,3479.792,3481.994,"No we checked and couldn't find anything, Your Honor."
2006.05-983,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3481.994,3482.51,Okay.
2006.05-983,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3483.01,3484.362,"Thank you, Mr. Bergeron."
2006.05-983,3,28860,jean_claude_andre,,3487.648,3490.516,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-983,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3542.532,3550.238,"Are you claiming that hiring an attorney would be a cost, if the phrase"
2006.05-983,3,28860,jean_claude_andre,,3556.791,3557.374,Certainly.
2006.05-983,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3578.705,3587.078,"So why didn't Congress just add the provision making this very clear that the Senate had passed, why did the House boot it out of the conference bill?"
2006.05-983,3,28860,jean_claude_andre,,3587.078,3587.728,We don't know.
2006.05-983,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3655.288,3657.723,Why do you think it's totally inapplicable?
2006.05-983,3,28860,jean_claude_andre,,3657.723,3666.996,We think that this Court's spending clause jurisprudence is concerned with providing clear notice to states with respect to liability and certain fiscal obligations.
