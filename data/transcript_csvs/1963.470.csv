1963.470,0,38278,paschal_c_reese,,59.58,62.093,May it please the Court.
1963.470,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,89.953,100.674,Mr. Carlisle might be admitted for that purpose.
1963.470,0,38278,paschal_c_reese,,100.674,113.644,"May it please the Court, this is the second time that this case has been before this honorable body on petition for certiorari from the Fifth Circuit."
1963.470,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.695,757.093,"Who was, who was (Inaudible)"
1963.470,0,38278,paschal_c_reese,,757.093,758.762,"Sir, I didn't understand."
1963.470,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.762,771.039,"Which state -- would Florida require this insurance company to maintain a reserve to cover this kind of a loss, where the loss were covered by a policy issued in another state?"
1963.470,0,38278,paschal_c_reese,,771.039,777.019,Right they would if it was necessary under the Florida --
1963.470,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,777.019,784.715,Have they ever -- how would they ever know -- how would they ever know that this policy had issued?
1963.470,0,38278,paschal_c_reese,,793.521,807.421,"Well I think the insurance commission -- I am not too familiar with that sir, but I think the insurance commission -- it requires all insurance companies qualify to do business to retain a certain -- to have a certain reserve –"
1963.470,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,807.421,810.443,Measured by what --
1963.470,0,38278,paschal_c_reese,,810.443,868.167,"Measured by the report that's made to the insurance commissioner at the time that the company is qualified to do business in Florida and the insurance commissioner probably knows the amount of business being done, but nevertheless I realize at the objection of the insurance company of the appellee to this, is the fact that when the loss is reported, I think when the loss is reported to them, I am sure that they must set up I think out of their funds sufficient money to cover the loss until it needs to pay or some Court decides it is not a legitimate loss and I presume that, that's the purpose of the one year clause in policy is to give any possibility of a -- for a five year a five year statute limitation."
1963.470,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,938.532,942.672,Mr. Carlisle.
1963.470,1,29669,james_t_carlisle,,942.672,944.944,May it please the Court.

1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,1307.539,1315.579,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.470,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1362.684,1365.205,(Inaudible)
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,1365.205,1366.15,I beg your pardon sir?
1963.470,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1366.15,1369.68,(Inaudible)
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,1369.68,1372.379,I believe they were.
1963.470,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1513.615,1516.822,Was the policy cancelable?
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,1516.822,1517.778,Yes Your Honor.
1963.470,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1517.778,1520.201,Could it have been canceled when he left for Florida?
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,1520.201,1523.699,"Yes, Your Honor, had the insurance company known that he went to Florida."
1963.470,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1523.699,1524.571,Didn't they know it?
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,1524.571,1525.618,No sir.
1963.470,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1573.605,1578.31,(Inaudible) represented by a lawyer when that question was asked (Inaudible)
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,1578.31,1578.97,Certainly sir.
1963.470,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1578.97,1581.132,Did they ask anything about (Inaudible)
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,1581.132,1588.838,No sir.
1963.470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.556,1991.473,"(Inaudible) the interpretation of the statute that comes to us with the state interpretation, Florida really didn't intend this to apply this particular time of a situation which is just as though -- were written in the insurance code."
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,1991.473,2014.227,"As a matter of fact Your Honor according to what the Supreme Court of Florida has said about this statute, Florida has enough contact -- with the contract if you can bring suit on the contract in Florida."
1963.470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.514,2092.63,"Do you think this is a – this just isn't a question of choice of law or purposes of conflict of law at all of determining whether state has got enough contacts to apply its law to a case, the question of invalidating the provision of the contracts."
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,2092.63,2098.713,It's a question of whether or not the state has the power to invalidate this provision under the Due Process Clause.
1963.470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.713,2105.777,Which means there has to be you think some overwriting state interest expressed other than just some contact.
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,2105.777,2109.144,I will think they would have to be two things Your Honor.
1963.470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2141.483,2147.713,You certainly think there is -- you certainly would admit there are quite a few contacts there that the State of Florida has.
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,2147.713,2152.371,Your Honor consider Delta & Pine and the contacts there which were held in --
1963.470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.371,2161.173,"Let's forget Delta & Pine, what the legal significance of the contacts are, but there are significant contacts here."
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,2167.843,2170.796,"Well the insurance company was doing business there and in many other states, it's true."
1963.470,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.796,2172.906,Well but still there.
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,2172.906,2200.673,"But Your Honor the reason that I mentioned Delta & Pine is that rather than have my own characterization of the importance or significance of the contact I would rather use this Court's characterization because in Delta & Pine, I can list many more contacts that Mississippi had with the insurance contract than Florida had with the Clay contract, may I for just one moment."
1963.470,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2200.673,2203.764,(Inaudible)
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,2203.764,2205.654,Delta & Pine.
1963.470,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2257.184,2265.605,To whom all your Chicago – people who take insurance policies and move either to California or Florida or --
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,2265.605,2267.712,I don't know about or I suppose not maybe (Inaudible)
1963.470,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2267.712,2270.705,May be they all wouldn't want to?
1963.470,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2270.705,2276.486,"When you issue a policy of this kind in Florida, what is your statute of limitations?"
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,2276.486,2283.33,"Under the terms of this policy, it would have to be the five years, because --"
1963.470,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2283.33,2290.712,"Now you also issue this kind of a policy in Illinois with the one year limitation, do you not?"
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,2290.712,2290.943,Yes sir.
1963.470,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2290.943,2303.288,"Are your premiums, comparably cheap than Illinois, cheaper than Illinois than in Florida, or do you charge the same rate?"
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,2303.288,2315.832,"I would be certain that the rate is not the same, but I would not undertake to make even a guess as to how they come here because --"
1963.470,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2315.832,2319.189,If it's different (Inaudible)
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,2319.189,2333.112,"Well here is why I would not even want to guess because in the city of Chicago the risks of fire are greater, burglary."
1963.470,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2333.112,2334.354,You think it be a little more (Inaudible)
1963.470,2,17531,bert_cotton,,2334.354,2337.666,It might be I just don't know and I would not want to answer that.
1963.470,3,38278,paschal_c_reese,,2461.051,2500.486,"May it please the Court in reply to the Mr. Cotton, the -- this last case the Circuit Court, the last case he referred to the Circuit Court granted the insurance company a decree and the matter was reversed after the Clay case had gone to the Court of law, to Supreme Court and was reversed by the District Court."
