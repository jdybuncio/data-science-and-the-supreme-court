2007.06-1413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.272,"We will hear argument next in Case 06-1413, Mead Westvaco v. The Illinois Department of Revenue."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,10.722,20.829,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The ruling of the Illinois Appellate Court in this case radically expanded the Court's operational function test."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,54.232,60.053,"You are saying to me, Ms. Brinkmann... we talk about an asset, an investment."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,84.918,92.174,"--Well, Your Honor, the fact that it's a division does not mean that it meets either the operational function test or the unitary business test."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,96.592,108.35,Do we have any cases... do we have any decisions that go against the state taxing authority that involve divisions as opposed to subsidiaries?
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,108.35,114.437,"--No, but the Exxon case involved divisions, and it went in favor of the state taxing authority."
2007.06-1413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,174.574,178.693,Can I go back to sort of a fundamental question I'm not quite sure I know the answer to.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,193.62,203.994,"If it was a capital gain, Your Honor, on the sale of investment, the Court's longstanding cases teach that it is the domicile that taxes that commercial gain."
2007.06-1413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,203.994,205.194,I'm assuming it's not the domicile.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,221.472,230.995,If there was... the domiciliary State generally is the State which has the authority to tax an income on a capital gain--
2007.06-1413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,230.995,231.861,--Assume it's not the domiciliary State.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,231.861,239.851,"But what the Court explained in Mobil, for example, if it is under the unitary business principle, then the State in which--"
2007.06-1413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,239.851,242.053,Could we get an answer without reference to cases?
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,247.707,254.611,--If the... there was sufficient nexus to the company doing business--
2007.06-1413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,254.611,257.745,"Millions of dollars of business in Illinois, that's my assumption."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,257.745,266.501,"--Yes, they would be able to tax the ongoing business activity in that State."
2007.06-1413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,266.501,266.851,No.
2007.06-1413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,266.851,269.286,Could they tax the sale of the business?
2007.06-1413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,269.286,270.536,I have the same--
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,270.536,273.838,The sale of the business would be to the domicile of the seller.
2007.06-1413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,274.774,276.974,You're saying only the domicile could impose a tax?
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,276.974,289.284,"--Yes, unless, as the Court recognized in Mobil, there is this unitary business exception, because the State's ability to tax begins at the starting point at the territorial limitations of the State."
2007.06-1413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,290.084,294.336,"But if they owned a truck instead of a business, they could tax that transaction, I suppose?"
2007.06-1413,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.336,298.739,You can't have a unitary business... a person who is a unitary business.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,309.528,310.394,--That's the area--
2007.06-1413,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.394,318.3,"Once you put it into a personal taxation scheme, it seems to me the whole unitary business notion has no application at all."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,318.3,319.817,"--Well, I agree with you, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,325.137,330.774,What is... what does the domicile State... we have Ohio.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,343.449,344.984,"--That's right, Your Honor, unless--"
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,344.984,355.909,Does Ohio... would Ohio give credit for the tax that its sister State thinks is due?
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,367.147,376.322,--Ohio would allocate the entire gain as a capital gain on an intangible that was sold in the State of Ohio.
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,399.386,402.889,Can I have an answer to a very simple question?
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,413.178,418.315,"--Not if Ohio had the constitutional right to allocate that tax to Ohio, as it does."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,418.315,421.867,Do we know what... what Ohio does in these situations?
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,421.867,422.217,Yes.
2007.06-1413,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,463.261,464.261,What has Ohio done--
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,464.261,465.23,That's not the situation here.
2007.06-1413,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,465.23,469.432,--What has Ohio done up to this point with respect to this transaction?
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,469.432,474.152,Under Ohio's laws this would be allocated to that State.
2007.06-1413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,474.152,474.986,To Ohio?
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,474.986,480.223,"Yes, because it's a capital gain on a sale of an investment."
2007.06-1413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,480.223,488.495,"Ms. Brinkmann, you begin your brief by saying this, a paper company, that happens to own a data processing company."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,493.713,494.565,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,498.101,503.671,"Well, and Lexis/Nexis has been a data processing company since whenever."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,503.671,507.123,But under the Court's unitary--
2007.06-1413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,507.123,513.294,"It's not the oldest... whichever is oldest isn't the one that gets to be regarded as the dominant partner, is it?"
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,513.294,513.693,--No.
2007.06-1413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,518.515,524.519,"Is General Electric a light bulb company or, since it owns NBC, a media company."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,524.519,528.57,"--I would have to know many more facts in order to answer that question, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,529.905,531.038,Why isn't the answer both?
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,542.296,545.432,--It's an analytical construct that we're doing here.
2007.06-1413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,559.673,561.542,"Well, that's because they sell paper in Illinois?"
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,561.542,562.508,Yes.
2007.06-1413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,562.508,565.86,"Well, Lexis sells data services in Illinois, too."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,565.86,566.095,Yes.
2007.06-1413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,589.509,595.763,"Well, why doesn't... I mean, you just said, as I understand it, Illinois has the right to tax Lexis under business activities in Illinois."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,617.526,621.794,"Your Honor, that is a belated argument that the State of Illinois has raised in this Court."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,651.148,655.284,They're raising it in... in support of the judgment.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,671.227,675.631,"Well, that would certainly be a matter for the Illinois court rather than for this Court, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,702.948,705.484,--I think this is part of the substance.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,719.042,719.827,"--No, Your Honor, I'm sorry."
2007.06-1413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,730.1,730.666,I see.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,730.666,731.884,--of the investment.
2007.06-1413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,759.202,761.054,"Well, isn't it kind of like futures hedging?"
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,775.228,775.813,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,791.273,794.375,Are you saying this is a passive investment?
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,794.375,794.892,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,794.892,812.404,"How can you call it a passive investment, not only when there was... I think undisputedly... as... as much interest and activity in Nexis's business planning by the Mead people?"
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,875.16,886.552,"Your Honor, that's contrary to the Court's long standing recognition that something that enriches the taxpayer is not necessarily part of the unitary business's operational function."
2007.06-1413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,886.552,887.385,That's... that's right.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,928.379,933.099,Because that isn't the operational connection that justifies a State--
2007.06-1413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,933.099,935.484,The gain alone certainly is not.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,966.42,971.891,"--Your Honor, I think not, if we look at Allied-Signal, we look at Woolworth, and we look at ASARCO."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,983.263,985.882,"It was a sale of stock in that case, wasn't it?"
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,985.882,986.215,--Yes.
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,986.215,987.917,It was the sale of a subsidiary.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,998.874,1005.212,"In Allied-Signal, the investment there was also doing business within the State."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1022.84,1036.064,"You told me that there was no case that the tax... taxing authority lost that involved divisions of a single company and sale of assets, rather than the sale of stock."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1036.064,1036.597,That's correct.
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1049.824,1062.215,"Well, we're talking about what Due Process permits States to do, and you're asking us to declare a restriction that, as far as I know, has never been declared in any case."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1062.215,1064.901,"It has, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1079.243,1087.316,"It's not just that it's an investment, it's not just that it's holding on to the shares in another company."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1099.49,1103.042,"Yes, the operating income within the State's apportioned."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1138.199,1141.401,Weren't those foreign corporations?
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1141.401,1142.117,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1142.117,1147.738,So running them as... as a single company would have been a little harder.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1147.738,1172.705,"Well, no, in fact there were also some foreign subsidiaries, I believe, involved in the ASARCO case, for example, Your Honor, and the same analysis applied... you know, whether it was vertically integrated and whether or not it met... the unitary business test goes back to three core principles, and this Court has said at least four if not five times that the unitary business principle is the linchpin of apportionment."
2007.06-1413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1175.657,1181.728,"Don't we start... I don't mean to cut off your argument, but don't we start with the assumption that this is not a unitary business?"
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1184.93,1185.63,"That's right, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1187.063,1189.415,"You can say it if you want, but I wanted to make sure--"
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1189.415,1193.702,There is no virtual integration; there is no sharing of centralized management; there's no economies of scale.
2007.06-1413,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1196.237,1198.637,Am I thinking about that part correctly?
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1240.766,1241.282,--We would--
2007.06-1413,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1241.282,1244.951,"And if that's so, there is no second test."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1275.171,1276.272,--It's contributing to the business.
2007.06-1413,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1276.272,1277.556,"And if it doesn't, it doesn't."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1299.555,1310.177,"Well, Your Honor, there... on this record, there's no question that the Lexis/Nexis cannot meet the unitary business test."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1310.177,1312.213,"Yes, there is, Ms. Brinkmann."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1351.071,1357.075,"Well, our position is on the record here, Your Honor, the stipulated record, that it's unassailable."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1357.658,1361.293,--All we know is that a trial judge said that was so.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1361.293,1370.984,"--And then that's our position, obviously, on the record, Your Honor; but we agreed this was properly raised in the appellate court, as opposed to the other argument which was not."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1415.68,1427.404,"Maybe when we're talking about Due Process and Commerce Clause limitations on what States can tax, we ought to ask ourselves if those three... is that it?"
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1467.396,1467.815,No.
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1472.367,1475.252,But Lexis/Nexis is gone.
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1475.252,1477.504,"Well, Lexis/Nexis continues to operate."
2007.06-1413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1493.28,1499.767,"Suppose it had been Delaware, and there was nothing there in Delaware except it was a Delaware corporation."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1499.767,1501.702,"--That's not the commercial domicile, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1508.856,1513.527,"Ms. Brinkmann, one thing that concerns me is how this will complicate the process."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1542.112,1546.664,"--Your Honor, this has been going on since at least 1992 in the Allied-Signal case."
2007.06-1413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1602.751,1606.535,"I don't like to intrude on the white light, but if I could just ask one question."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1621.731,1622.347,We think that the finding is that it is not unitary.
2007.06-1413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1622.347,1622.597,"No, no."
2007.06-1413,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1632.937,1639.341,"Yes, if it were unitary, but we think there's no way this record could meet the standards compared to Woolworth, ASARCO."
2007.06-1413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1642.978,1646.179,"Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,1646.979,1652.933,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Illinois is not attempting to tax income earned outside its borders."
2007.06-1413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1674.097,1680.101,"Well, if you did not proceed on the unitary business there, let's take that off the table."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,1686.321,1687.506,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1688.373,1699.481,"It seems to me that, under your theory, you could tax the sale, even if Lexis were not in Illinois at all, just because Mead is."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,1699.481,1706.668,"--If this... if they were unitary, yes, then Lexis's presence in Illinois would be irrelevant to this case, if they met the unitary business doctrine."
2007.06-1413,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1706.668,1707.687,That's not the question.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,1799.93,1806.167,"Under... under those bare facts, probably there would be not a sufficient connection."
2007.06-1413,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1806.167,1806.6,All right.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,1823.476,1824.109,"Because, Your Honor--"
2007.06-1413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1824.109,1834.884,"And if I can just add on to that same question: If you're going to have the unitary tax theory, that's... that's very helpful."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,1848.959,1852.295,"--There's a two part answer to that question... those questions, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1880.578,1891.536,"But Mead didn't receive... pardon me... Lexis didn't receive the money for the sale, Mead did."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,1891.536,1892.12,--Right.
2007.06-1413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1892.12,1901.578,"Unless, again, if Mead's presence or nonpresence is simply irrelevant to what happened here, absent a unitary theory."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,1901.578,1902.444,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1934.215,1950.159,"Do you think that if there had been a separate corporation and that Lexis was a subsidiary corporation and the subsidiary was... it was sold, that, again, absent a finding of unitary, Illinois then could have had a tax?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,1950.159,1950.592,--Yes.
2007.06-1413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1952.511,1953.177,All right.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,1957.063,1961.632,"--But the... but the point, Your Honor, is that Lexis had a presence in Illinois."
2007.06-1413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1966.953,1970.988,That gets back to Justice Stevens's initial hypothetical.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,1981.446,1981.88,--No.
2007.06-1413,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2056.094,2062.648,"If you traded places with Ohio, how would you have treated this transaction under your tax laws?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2062.648,2063.697,Under our tax laws--
2007.06-1413,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2063.697,2082.578,"Say that Mead was domiciled in Illinois but Lexis/Nexis operated in Ohio, would you have just taken... would you have allocated or would you have claimed that... the right to tax the entire capital gain?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2082.578,2088.982,"--This would have probably, I think, Your Honor... I believe this would have been apportioned as business income under Illinois law."
2007.06-1413,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2088.982,2092.434,Do you know what... or did you know what Ohio did in the--
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2092.434,2094.453,I don't know what Ohio did.
2007.06-1413,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2108.963,2119.635,"--Well, what would you say... I mean, we talk about apportioning income and allocating income, allocating to the commercial headquarters."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2136.48,2142.384,"Different States have different rules, Your Honor, and these are State-law rules, not constitutional rules, about allocation and apportionment."
2007.06-1413,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2184.727,2190.115,"Mr. Barov, I just want to go back to an earlier answer to see how far you would go with the position that you took."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2246.717,2247.601,"Yes, they would, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2257.759,2265.179,"Well, but that would be, in effect, the portion of the Nexis business, total business that took place in Illinois, total sales, total payroll, however you do it."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2265.179,2267.115,"Right, and then that would be put... that would be put into--"
2007.06-1413,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2267.115,2267.581,Okay.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2276.821,2277.687,"--Yes, it would be."
2007.06-1413,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2277.687,2278.256,Okay.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2278.256,2279.039,"It is, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2279.039,2286.86,"Counsel, why isn't your friend correct that you have waived any argument based on the presence of Lexis in Illinois?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2286.86,2295.115,"Your Honor, two reasons: First, under the... they have cited basically two basis grounds for waiver, one under Illinois law and under this Court's rules."
2007.06-1413,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2321.533,2340.746,"And... and I'm not following your argument, because I thought that the argument that this was a unitary enterprise was made in the Illinois appellate court, and the appellate court recognizes that it was made, and said we are not going to reach it because we have this operational function test?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2340.746,2341.246,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2342.546,2350.685,"Well, but that's... they are very different from your current argument, which you emphasize that whether they are unitary or not, Lexis/Nexis was in Illinois."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2350.685,2351.685,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2351.685,2352.054,Okay.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2370.032,2370.932,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2380.138,2381.94,"Well, it wasn't in Allied-Signal."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2389.494,2389.977,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2424.067,2434.189,"May I ask this question just... it shows my ignorance, but if the unitary business approach to taxation was not applied in this case, how did you compute the amount of the tax?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2434.189,2443.379,It was computed... what the department did in this case is it... it took the entire gain that put... that went into Mead's apportionable tax base.
2007.06-1413,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2460.006,2464.894,So you use a different formula from the normal three factor formula to compute the tax?
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2464.894,2465.31,--Right.
2007.06-1413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2470.381,2474.666,But it seems to me that those factors are wholly irrelevant to the fact of sale.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2495.596,2498.381,"--No, Your Honor, it wasn't."
2007.06-1413,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2513.308,2518.529,"Well, that's why it's even more dramatic to me that you didn't raise the argument based on the Lexis connection to Illinois."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2530.769,2538.942,--the trial court... actually the appellate court ruled on whether the State law tests had been met at the time.
2007.06-1413,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.426,2572.429,"In the Illinois courts, they did argue that as a matter of Federal constitutional law the tax is impermissible, didn't they?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2572.429,2573.365,"--Correct, yes."
2007.06-1413,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2583.737,2589.125,"We couldn't do anything more if we said you haven't waived it, we couldn't do anything more than send it back."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2594.362,2595.845,"Yes, it is in the record."
2007.06-1413,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2616.375,2617.575,Where is that?
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2617.575,2629.785,"That is... I don't have the page cite handy, Your Honor, but the appellate court did make a finding that it was undisputed that the--"
2007.06-1413,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2629.785,2632.737,I just... usually appellate courts don't make findings.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2633.537,2634.087,--I'm sorry.
2007.06-1413,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2634.904,2645.812,"Was there any sort of stipulation between the parties to say what each, what Lexis/Nexis was doing in Illinois, what Mead was doing in Illinois?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2645.812,2663.006,"There was, there was a long stipulation, yes, Your Honor, and plus there was exhibits attached to the stipulation, which are reflected in our briefs, that discuss in detail what Mead and Lexis were both doing, at least their relationship to each other."
2007.06-1413,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2663.006,2679.316,"Let me ask you about the theory that both the trial court and the intermediate appellate court went on, this operational function test, which has been brought up in a few of our cases, but I don't know any that was decided."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2688.657,2689.874,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2692.708,2693.108,Yes.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2720.376,2723.145,"--I guess on that point I would disagree with you a bit, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2738.154,2738.687,What?
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2774.911,2775.694,"--I agree, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.694,2795.074,"Well, if you agree with that, do you really agree, because if you agree with that there's no such separate test, this court was wrong to consider it separately, the lower court, and they should have reached the question they didn't reach, which was is this whole thing one single business, which is normally called the unitary business test?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2795.074,2797.174,"Your Honor, on that point I disagree."
2007.06-1413,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2797.174,2797.674,Good.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2798.109,2823.407,"I think there is... I mean, they're both ways of reaching the overall unitary principle, whether you can show the intangible flow of assets... of value between a company... I can give you an example, say, of a company that would be unitary but where the operational function analysis wouldn't apply is the Container Corp. Type fact pattern, where you have a domestic... a domestic parent providing value out to the foreign subsidiaries, but there is nothing sort of flowing back to the domestic parent."
2007.06-1413,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2895.689,2926.559,"--So say you... but you would be asking us, if you were going to go on that operational function, to take two examples that were given in Allied-Signal that are quite different from what's involved here, and to make that a doctrine when you recognize that we have never used that theory to hold for a State taxing authority in the context of a multi state enterprise?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2926.559,2929.761,"Your Honor, I don't think you have to create a separate doctrine again."
2007.06-1413,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2961.398,2962.232,May I ask this question.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2968.802,2970.321,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2970.321,2973.423,"As far as we know, Illinois is out on its own here?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2973.423,2978.526,"I don't know, Your... I don't know the answer to that, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.961,2986.046,"You'd not wager, however, right?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,2986.046,3002.391,"--In any case, Your Honor, as you said, as I've said, there are two possible ways that... two different constitutional paths or theories that we can go down in this case to meet the... that allows Illinois to apportion."
2007.06-1413,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3021.803,3039.515,"If Illinois... if Ohio is, in fact, taxing the whole gain at its full rate on the theory that this entire income should be allocated to Ohio, then you do have an element of double taxation, right?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3039.515,3047.784,"That's possible, Your Honor, but it's... first, there is no... there's no evidence that Ohio in fact did that."
2007.06-1413,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3098.117,3100.486,"--I thought... I've been looking, too."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3106.473,3106.84,Right.
2007.06-1413,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3112.394,3114.163,"No, only 46 million."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3114.163,3115.529,I'm sorry.
2007.06-1413,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3115.529,3117.015,"It said 46, not hundreds of millions."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3117.015,3117.698,I'm sorry.
2007.06-1413,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.574,3137.678,"You're taxing Mead, not Nexis/Lexis?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3137.678,3138.161,--Correct.
2007.06-1413,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3138.728,3144.915,So what relevance is it that Nexis/Lexis has business in Illinois?
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3144.915,3145.598,It's--
2007.06-1413,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.598,3147.484,I mean that's fine if that's who you're taxing.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3147.484,3158.358,"--Well, it's relevant if, only if, this Court finds that there was no operational relationship between Lexis and Mead."
2007.06-1413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3182.557,3183.957,And that is different--
2007.06-1413,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3183.957,3184.975,I might say that I don't follow that.
2007.06-1413,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3195.014,3196.916,"There was no ""it"" to tax, right?"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3196.916,3198.116,That 's correct.
2007.06-1413,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3216.027,3222.914,"At the time of this sale of Lexis/Nexis assets, there was only one taxpayer; it was Mead."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3222.914,3223.683,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3245.93,3270.412,"Do you have any case like that where your ability to tax a surviving corporation has to do with, not whether the surviving corporation itself has sufficient contacts with the State, but whether some other corporation that has disappeared now but that merged into it had sufficient... it seems to me you have to establish connection with the taxpayer."
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3274.549,3279.018,--You have to establish a connection with the taxpayer's activities in the taxing State.
2007.06-1413,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3292.927,3293.944,That's fine.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3293.944,3298.764,So that provides the taxing... the ability--
2007.06-1413,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3298.764,3303.652,But that isn't established by the mere fact that Lexis/Nexis did business there.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3314.341,3314.943,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3343.01,3350.449,"--But the proration, it seems to me... that should have nothing to do with the extent of Lexis in Illinois--"
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3350.449,3350.899,Exactly.
2007.06-1413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3350.899,3352.399,--nor does it have to do with the extent of Mead in Illinois.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3352.399,3354.501,"Well, no, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3411.071,3420.193,Can you tax me on stock... on stock that I own on companies that do business in Illinois?
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3420.193,3422.895,"--In the abstract, yes, you could, Your Honor."
2007.06-1413,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3422.895,3424.247,Do you know any State that tries to do it.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3424.247,3426.897,"No, Your Honor, but again, Your Honor--"
2007.06-1413,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3426.897,3427.733,That's extraordinary.
2007.06-1413,1,17456,brian_f_barov,,3437.355,3456.05,"--Your Honor, this is... but Your Honor, International Harvester is the perfectly precise fact pattern where this Court upheld a tax on a... on investors, on the shareholder's investment in a State in which they were not present, so... but in this case Mead had an independent tax presence also in Illinois."
2007.06-1413,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3459.587,3460.437,"Thank you, Counsel."
2007.06-1413,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3462.456,3464.439,"I have four very quick points, Your Honor."
