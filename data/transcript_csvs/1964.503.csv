1964.503,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,10.307,"503, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, petitioner versus Estate of Marshal L. Noel, deceased, et al."
1964.503,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,15.236,18.699,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1964.503,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,127.892,129.53,Finding that she had paid the premium?
1964.503,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,129.53,141.714,"Yes, it's a sentence of the record -- it's at page 49 of the record just says she paid and I'm not sure that they were aware in the Third Circuit that they were making a finding which the tax court have refused to make."
1964.503,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,141.714,143.354,And of what significance would this be?
1964.503,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,143.354,145.122,It would be at significance if he --
1964.503,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,145.122,148.973,"If he did not have any incidence of ownership it might be of significance, is that right?"
1964.503,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,148.973,150.13,That's right.
1964.503,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,160.342,161.482,It has no present significance.
1964.503,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,161.482,164.815,"No, present significance."
1964.503,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,356.576,362.23,Is there is a legislative history on that statute Mr. Jones that's convincing that --
1964.503,0,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,362.23,368.24,The legislative history is quoted in the opinions below.
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1243.0,1247.138,May it please the Court.
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1495.726,1511.166,How about the kind of a policy that the people sometimes take out during the -- when they borrow money which is a short-term life insurance policy to be sure that that will be paid if they die during [Inaudible]
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1511.166,1511.957,Yes sir.
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1511.957,1516.764,Now there is -- where would you think that would fall if it's some kind of a policy?
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1516.764,1525.128,"I would think that since that is truly life insurance that, that would fall within 2042."
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1525.128,1528.42,"Of course, the statute doesn't say life insurance."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1528.42,1530.286,The statute says insurance on the life.
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1530.286,1530.708,Yes.
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1530.708,1550.942,"But reading that statute in the light of the congressional intent, it is clear we submit that the only kind of insurance that could have been useful and could have been meant in thwarting the concept which the Congress was trying to avoid was through life insurance."
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1550.942,1559.786,"Well, and that's the reason I asked you my question, because that kind of an insurance is not covered by the congressional intent, is it?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1567.493,1570.172,It may not be specifically covered by the congressional intent --
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1570.172,1578.374,I mean that kind of life -- that kind of insurance on a person's life is not within the contemplation of Congress and it uses [Inaudible]
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1578.374,1602.546,"Probably not sir, but since general life insurance company was -- life insurance policies were certainly included under this intent, then I must say that this type of insurance even though it's taken out for the purpose of insuring a creditor is still life insurance and the same treatment would be accorded."
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1602.546,1605.47,Even though it's 30 days or 60 days [Inaudible]
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1605.47,1612.449,And may I answer Justice Harlan's question about term insurance.
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1640.433,1649.248,"But without cash value, very little with to do with the policy which you say Congress had before it?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1649.248,1650.929,No Your Honor.
1964.503,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1719.537,1727.442,Would your argument would be the same if this was an annual policy instead of the single roundtrip policy?
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1727.442,1728.034,Yes Your Honor.
1964.503,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1728.034,1731.634,It will.
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1731.634,1733.359,There was an annual policy in this case.
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1736.328,1737.261,Yes sir.
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1737.261,1738.464,And what happened with the plan?
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1740.533,1744.877,"No Your Honor, payment had been made on that policy and I think it was a mistake."
1964.503,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1744.877,1746.78,"What was the answer, I didn't get it?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1746.78,1753.875,"I said that policy was included by the department, and payment of the tax made, I think it was a mistake."
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1753.875,1757.395,You could have sued for a refund.
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1757.395,1759.831,"I hope we're not too late, we might still do so."
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1759.831,1769.179,"Well, the fact of the matter, at least so far while you say you would make the same argument with respect to an annual policy, the fact is at least so far you haven't made, is that right?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1769.179,1769.92,We haven't made it.
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1773.052,1780.701,"Your argument would be different if this was just a straight payment for death rather than an injury, wouldn't it?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1780.701,1790.843,"My argument would be different if this was a straight payment for death from any cause; heart attack, disease or any other cause --"
1964.503,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1790.843,1798.765,I mean if it was just a straight policy for death by -- which resulted in here accident.
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1798.765,1801.333,"No, my argument would be the same."
1964.503,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1806.781,1811.839,Then how life insurance continues from that kind of a policy?
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1811.839,1820.172,Life insurance is distinguished from that kind of policy because there is a certainty of death.
1964.503,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1852.322,1857.684,That would be dangerous to say if there's almost a certainty of no death.
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1857.684,1860.24,We like to hope so Your Honor.
1964.503,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1928.425,1936.984,"Your argument however would apply to any accidental death policy, whether it's the automobile or airplane or anything else, would it not?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1936.984,1937.598,Yes Your Honor.
1964.503,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1937.598,1949.634,"And there we have a very substantial incident, while it's true with what you've said about airplanes is true, accidental death by automobile has assumed the largest proportion in the country."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,1949.634,1960.092,"That may be true Your Honor, but it has not as yet gone so far as to have Congress declare a different intent."
1964.503,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2027.959,2037.31,"If you were to prevail in this case, would that money be subject to taxation by anyone?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2037.31,2048.13,"That question if it pleases the Court is whether or not the beneficiary might have to pay a tax on that money, income tax or otherwise."
1964.503,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2071.594,2076.574,It cannot constitutionally do so?
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2076.574,2106.665,"I would say sir in this type of policy, it cannot do so for the reason that there is no significant value in the policy which I suggest is necessary for the decedent to have at the time of his death in order to enable the government to tax a transfer."
1964.503,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2143.654,2147.976,How about the double indemnity clause in a life insurance policy?
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2152.735,2169.475,"Your Honor that is, in someway, there are some similarities, but in a double indemnity policy attached or part of, inherently part of a life policy, the basic contingency is death."
1964.503,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2297.761,2306.061,"[Inaudible] that form of life insurance is taken out, but the fact that they've said it."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2339.574,2340.717,I did sir.
1964.503,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2340.717,2342.06,What is the term?
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2342.06,2356.794,"The economic interest in every life policy is the value, the built-in value emanating from the fact that the insured, every insured has an expectancy of death."
1964.503,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2404.944,2423.214,"Now suppose your decedent had one of these tuition plan policies, are you suggesting that while there accident policies is not being suitable, whatever is balance owing to the extent they are still owing tuition, to that extent this would be included, is that it?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2423.214,2427.027,"Yes, assuming that he had the right to change the beneficiary --"
1964.503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.027,2437.654,"But in common insurance there is no expectancy of death within term, the credible life insurance there's no expectancy of death within the period of the said obligation."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2437.654,2438.195,There is no --
1964.503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.195,2448.417,"In a year-to-year term policy, it may or it may not happen, just like in an accident policy which includes death."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2451.575,2452.5,But your --
1964.503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2452.5,2455.292,Because death may or may not happen as result of an accident.
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2455.292,2486.218,"But if the Court pleases, in the life policy, even if it be for a term of one year, there is a definite expectancy of death and not that the death is going to happen within the year necessarily, but that there is that expectancy on the basis of tables which is measurable but you don't have that at all in a flight policy where there is no definite assurance that --"
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.218,2490.695,"I think has to Mr. Ball, both you and my brother White have gotten away a little bit in your arguments."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2505.023,2505.582,That is my --
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2505.582,2513.492,"Both the term policy and an accident insurance policy cover, insure against death but -- and in neither one is there any certainty of death."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2518.218,2522.712,And that's why I'm trying to make the point to --
1964.503,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2522.712,2526.866,"I know, but this certainly insures against death through a accident, doesn't it?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2526.866,2541.996,This insures against death through the accident but the possibility of death by accident is poles apart from the possibility or the probability of death of every human being based on his life expectancy.
1964.503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.775,2548.702,"What if I just buy a policy, a life insurance policy for a year to satisfy my creditors."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2557.853,2569.642,"The expectancy of dying within in a year is far less than the expectancy of dying within 25 or 30, the life of expectancy but it's still there."
1964.503,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.642,2579.415,"Still there, and also there's, I suppose you could figure mathematically that what the chances are of dying accidentally within the year."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2579.415,2582.555,Well I'm not sure of that.
1964.503,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2612.606,2625.813,"[Inaudible] and I don't find any reference to death at all in these policies, am I wrong in that?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2625.813,2627.089,Yes Your Honor.
1964.503,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2627.089,2634.989,"Now, these policies basically only cover injury."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2639.661,2641.313,Because the government --
1964.503,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2641.313,2652.694,"I know a death occurred but the policy on its face only purports to cover indemnity for injury, is that correct?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2652.694,2656.527,"Indemnity for injury, and it fixes a --"
1964.503,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2656.527,2672.467,"If there are policies that talk about accidental death, we can have some of those policies, but both of these policies, I looked at them again and say that they are for injury accidental, bodily injury."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2687.347,2689.413,That's the argument that I'm trying to make sir.
1964.503,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2689.413,2705.338,"But you did not distinguish, that's why when Mr. Douglas asked you, do you distinguish between the policy which falls for reimbursement for injury and the policy which for death, you said you didn't distinguish."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2705.338,2708.688,Well then that was my error.
1964.503,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2714.152,2715.941,"I know, you have been arguing otherwise."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2745.966,2748.21,Had he been injured in certain ways sir?
1964.503,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2748.21,2753.508,"Yes, lost arm, lost a leg and bodily injured, he could have recovered under this policy."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2753.508,2754.539,That is correct sir.
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2754.539,2764.999,"Well I think Mr. Ball that the debit for which my brother Goldberg refers, I guess the excerpts comment that, are they not?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2764.999,2765.67,That's correct sir.
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2765.67,2774.2,"And this was the life policy, this did pay, each one of these paid $62,500 in the event of death on this roundtrip airplane."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2774.2,2776.992,By accident or pay the principal sum.
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2776.992,2782.773,And in addition it paid specific sums for loss of an arm or a leg or eye or an ear.
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2782.773,2785.885,"Not an addition, either/or."
1964.503,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2785.885,2802.849,"If there were no death that paid to be insured himself for the loss of a hand, as I say, or an eye or an ear, but if he died on this roundtrip on a flight it paid, each one of these paid $62,500 to the beneficiary, i. e., the widow."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2802.849,2805.766,As a result of an accident.
1964.503,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2805.766,2825.217,Mr. Ball I -- bearing on the question as to purpose and intention of Congress I understood from Mr. Jones that the government has been collecting taxes on such moneys since the Ackerman case in 1929.
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2892.773,2922.233,"But the only regulation that was before Congress during these years is the regulation which said insurance, life insurance of every description and there was nothing before Congress, of course we know which talked about the proceeds from accidental death policies at all and there was no evidence of any great controversy."
1964.503,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2927.592,2935.028,"Well did the government collect the taxes during that period, all these periods since Ackerman, on the theory of the government is now arguing?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2935.028,2939.658,I don't know how much taxes it did collect in this context.
1964.503,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2939.658,2943.6,"Whatever the taxes were they were collecting them on this theory, were they not?"
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,2943.6,2961.194,"Yes, but in the absence of controversy or in the absence of awareness by Congress it would seem that it can't be said that Congress intended that this section which by its terms did not include proceeds from accident policies should be included."
1964.503,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3037.038,3048.843,"Well if you have a sentence or two to complete your thought, go ahead, but if you want to extend time all right."
1964.503,1,26548,harry_norman_ball,,3048.843,3065.037,That incident of ownership test throughout the cases really covers a situation where there was a right to change the beneficiary plus some economic advantage in the policy which I adverted to before now.
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3104.162,3106.452,Mr. Jones.
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3106.452,3107.895,Mr. Chief Justice.
1964.503,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3128.179,3128.644,Could you do that?
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3128.644,3130.123,-- I don't believe there's any dispute.
1964.503,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3131.026,3133.258,[Inaudible]
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3133.258,3138.113,"I think not, that this thing had resulted at the airport and the only other --"
1964.503,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3138.113,3147.133,Mr. Jones this policy would not have covered had the passenger died of old age on the trip and the airplane had landed safely.
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3147.133,3147.474,No it would not.
1964.503,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3147.474,3149.035,It was only for accidental death.
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3149.035,3151.791,"That's right, in the manner specified."
1964.503,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3151.791,3152.495,What manner specified?
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3152.495,3156.198,"Well alighting from an aircraft, being hit by another aircraft."
1964.503,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3156.198,3160.929,Either in flight or you know the matter specified in connection with this airline?
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3160.929,3165.341,"I don't know whether it would cover the situation if another passenger shoots him or not, I just don't know that."
1964.503,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3165.341,3167.82,It wouldn't cover death from natural cause.
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3167.82,3169.469,Clearly it would not cover that.
1964.503,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3169.469,3170.271,On the trip?
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3170.271,3171.179,That's right.
1964.503,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3171.179,3175.34,The policy could be redefined [Inaudible]
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3175.34,3176.048,They will be complete --
1964.503,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3176.048,3179.079,[Inaudible]
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3179.079,3180.78,That's correct.
1964.503,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3180.78,3183.184,[Inaudible]
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3183.184,3185.862,I apologize to the Court for that.
1964.503,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3233.475,3246.228,"Mr. Jones, suppose in addition to naming the beneficiary the insured has written across the face of the policy “I hereby assign all my right, title in this policy to the beneficiary” change this?"
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3246.228,3248.508,I think it would turn on whether the company would accept that.
1964.503,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3269.043,3272.192,Well what would be the estate tax?
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3272.192,3277.374,If that would be binding on the insurance company then it would take it out of the insured's estate.
1964.503,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3280.387,3282.009,"A simpler way, isn't it?"
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3282.009,3288.482,"Well, a simpler way is for the insurance company to put a form out there and just say check here if you wish to assign the rights of the beneficiary which is being done."
1964.503,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3288.482,3289.79,They do have a form.
1964.503,2,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,3289.79,3294.117,"They do now have such a form, they did not."
