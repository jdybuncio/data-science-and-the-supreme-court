1966.673,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.039,"The Second National Bank of New Haven, Petitioner, versus the United States."
1966.673,0,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,10.426,15.438,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court pleases."
1966.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,252.951,259.099,He certainly had the general problem in mind when he wrote the codicil.
1966.673,0,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,259.099,260.625,When he wrote codicil --
1966.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,260.625,272.836,"Because the codicil was obviously for the purpose of giving the residuary bequest to the widow, the benefit of the marital deduction generally, wasn't it?"
1966.673,0,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,272.836,273.293,Yes.
1966.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,276.706,277.434,That was the --
1966.673,0,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,277.434,280.1,"That was the purpose of the codicil, yes."
1966.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,280.1,282.485,By giving her general power?
1966.673,0,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,282.485,282.722,Yes.
1966.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,282.722,283.717,For its right.
1966.673,0,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,283.717,285.091,That's right.
1966.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.999,678.466,Do the executors take the position on them when they petitioned the probate court?
1966.673,0,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,678.466,688.724,The executor's were required by statute to file a proposed computation of the prorates.
1966.673,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1159.57,1163.992,Well he did include this position on page 12.
1966.673,0,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,1163.992,1164.762,"Pardon me, Your Honor."
1966.673,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1164.762,1170.519,I said the testator did include that provision on page 12 of the record.
1966.673,0,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,1170.519,1172.983,That was -- that was in his will.
1966.673,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1172.983,1173.204,Yes.
1966.673,0,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,1173.204,1174.281,Yes.
1966.673,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1179.745,1200.095,Well that presents troublesome problem because that provision does say that is flatly as a loose language could that the provisions of any statute require a proration of taxes should be without effect in the settlement of a man's estate.
1966.673,0,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,1200.095,1217.972,"Well, the answer to Your Honor's question or as I understand it has really been made by the Court of Appeals of New York where there was a case that is very similar to this that arose in connection with Mr. Schubert's will."
1966.673,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1707.877,1711.882,Mr. Levin.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,1711.882,1715.358,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1726.683,1730.02,How do you know it's erroneous?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,1730.02,1736.121,That of course is -- is what my brother here has argued here at some length.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.601,1771.472,As a matter of Connecticut law?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,1771.472,1774.185,As a matter of Connecticut law.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.185,1781.561,"You would agree, I suppose, that if this decision had been appealed and had been affirmed that the case would be over."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,1781.561,1795.679,"Well, in deciding -- in deciding what Connecticut law is certainly a decision of the Connecticut Supreme Court or of the Connecticut Appellate Courts intermediate appellate courts would be very relevant."
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.851,1801.707,Would you say it would be binding or not?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,1801.707,1807.366,"If this case went to the Connecticut Supreme Court, it would certainly be binding."
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.366,1810.165,For the purposes of this tax case.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,1810.165,1815.246,"Yes, for the purposes of this tax case and I should think that for the purposes of determining Connecticut law in any case --"
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1815.246,1817.72,Because I would assume you would think that --
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,1817.72,1818.22,Yes.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1818.22,1820.185,-- you would say it is a matter of Connecticut law.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,1820.185,1821.084,That's correct.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.084,1828.254,"And you say if it had been an adversary proceeding in the probate court, it would be binding in this case or should be held binding."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,1828.254,1834.566,We would accept it as binding if it had been adversary in the lower court.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.566,1836.101,Even though in your view erroneous?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,1836.101,1838.284,Even though in our view erroneous.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1848.575,1851.862,And even though it had not been appealed beyond the probate court?
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.862,1852.98,That's correct.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1854.154,1864.693,"In other words, you would accept as conclusive for this purpose a judgment of the Connecticut Probate Court provided that where an adversary proceeding such a proceeding --"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,1864.693,1870.199,Let me state my position at a slightly greater length because it's -- it's not that easy to state.
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1892.611,1893.705,Not if it's true.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,1900.658,1903.856,But they're not binding on the party as I've said.
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1919.583,1921.724,That if that -- well alright.
1966.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1923.944,1927.705,Did the state court have jurisdiction here?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,1927.705,1928.553,Yes.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2033.461,2039.418,And why do you think that -- I take it your position in the lower courts was the Erie position.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2039.418,2043.613,"In the lower court, we -- we presented both positions."
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2043.613,2047.285,And which position do you think the Court of Appeals took?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2047.285,2054.248,The Court of Appeals I think took the -- tended toward the Erie position though not adopting the full scope.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2054.255,2065.043,Then why shouldn't -- why -- why shouldn't the Court of Appeals -- why shouldn't be the rule be the same that the tax cases as other cases where the matter is to be governed by state law?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2065.043,2068.19,"Well, the rule for other cases being --"
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2068.19,2070.38,Ordinary diversity cases.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2070.38,2078.167,"Well, because in the ordinary diversity case, the very parties before you have not litigated the issue."
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.167,2080.195,I don't understand that.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2080.195,2088.539,"Well, in an ordinary diversity case, if A and B are litigating an issue, the federal court looks to state decisions --"
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.539,2088.9,That's right.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2088.9,2090.51,-- between X and Y --
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.51,2090.65,That's right.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2090.65,2092.376,-- to determine what the law is.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.244,2113.486,The Erie doctrine also applies that those two parties attempted to get the question settled in a state trial court.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2113.486,2118.889,"Well, I think that there is some question as to whether the Erie doctrine applies there or not."
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.911,2130.953,"Well, why shouldn't it?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2130.953,2137.707,Well let me -- let me try to present the issue in the context of a federal tax case.
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2570.858,2575.97,What's the purpose of all this third greater that it take insofar as the issues in this case are concerned?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2575.97,2596.993,"The purpose is to illustrate hopefully -- hopefully without getting into too many numbers, the fact that what we have in most of these cases, and they arise quite frequently, the purpose is that when you have this probate court decreased, you have intrafamily shifts of property."
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2596.993,2610.899,"Yes I know but the -- there are two issues here, two questions, was the Connecticut Probate Court correct as a matter of Connecticut law and (b), whether correct or incorrect is its decree binding?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2610.899,2611.805,Yes.
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2611.805,2615.439,"Now, what's -- what's -- those are the issues and what's that going to do with either one of those issues?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2615.439,2622.764,"Here's -- if you would have to argue the correct as the probate court decree first, that's a question of Connecticut law."
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2677.603,2695.272,"Well, Mr. Levin, you're taking the position if I understand you that even if the Connecticut court is wrong, that you'd be bound by Connecticut by its decision, provided these were an adversary proceeding, isn't that right?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2695.272,2695.277,Right.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2695.277,2698.558,"Now, what if it's wrong has got to do with anything?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2698.558,2700.196,Let me try to answer why.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2725.786,2728.446,"Well, it's in effect that you -- we don't need all that --"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2728.446,2728.869,Alright.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2728.869,2730.996,-- but that's an effect that you say --
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2730.996,2731.185,Assume for --
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2731.185,2734.21,-- the Government's perfectly willing to accept --
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2734.21,2734.693,Alright.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2734.693,2741.069,"-- if this was a bona fide proceeding in the probate court, isn't that right?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2741.069,2742.222,No.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2746.838,2751.562,"Well, let's try and get a little more -- let's say a leeway."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2751.562,2753.212,"Well, here's what I mean by that."
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2785.155,2789.687,Where in service made on the district director of IRS here?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2789.687,2792.491,The district director was given notice that a proceeding would be held.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2792.491,2794.384,At a probate court proceeding.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2794.384,2794.728,That's correct.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2794.728,2797.368,And a decision was made not to participate.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2797.368,2799.326,That decision was made over 20 years ago.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2799.326,2803.084,"I don't know when it was made but whenever it was made, the decision was made --"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2803.084,2803.093,That's right.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2803.093,2804.607,-- not to participate.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2804.607,2805.188,That's right.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2805.188,2812.747,"Now, I take it on the other side that in the probate proceeding, I have forgotten what Connecticut probate procedure is."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2823.639,2824.278,"Well, I --"
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2824.278,2824.811,I don't know whether you do that?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2824.811,2827.471,"He would -- they did not purport to join him as a party and of course, they did not have jurisdiction to sue him."
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2827.471,2831.38,But they did -- but they did serve?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2831.38,2834.637,They gave him a piece of paper which told him that the hearing would be held.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2856.445,2884.648,"Oh but it seems -- but it seems to there, I understand that there are lots of time here and that the Government's position may have changed that you come -- you come in here now and say that if it's an adversary position, you would accept the decision of the Connecticut Probate Court, good, better, indifferent, right, or wrong, and the district director in our opportunity to litigate this question."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2887.764,2889.587,"No, the Government's position was the same."
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2889.587,2889.663,It was?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,2889.663,2892.62,The Government's position was the same and it was formulated.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3094.972,3116.115,"Is there any other situation in which important governmental decision that you know of, a decision federal government as to whether it will or will not accept the state court decision turns on the question of whether the proceeding is adversary in the sense that you describe here."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3116.115,3125.114,"Well I -- the only area that I was able to come up with as discussed in our fairly lengthy footnote, the social security area."
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3144.054,3151.257,It's a question of deciding whether a proceeding is truly as distinguished from formally adversary.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3175.644,3191.17,"It -- in many respects, divorce law of course is different because divorce is a status which -- which one can wonder whether the judiciary should get into in the legislative branch, and the executive of course have made these decisions in many states, every state that they should get into it."
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3237.963,3255.196,There's a great deal of difference between saying that probate proceedings should be -- should not be accepted as finding for tax purposes because it is nonadversary.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3294.747,3296.556,We don't ask them to fight.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3296.662,3298.6,I mean what could -- what could have happened if --
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3298.6,3302.403,We just say that if they don't want -- if they don't determine it among themselves.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3309.941,3313.051,But they have determined that among themselves.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3328.814,3332.509,I'd be happy to go further and say that the Commissioner should never accept it.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3433.98,3446.889,Is there any doubt that these parties once this probate decree was over were bound by at themselves in the sense that -- in the sense that the grandchildren were going to get $3 million instead of $4 million?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3446.889,3450.277,"Well, that's not an easy question to resolve."
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3470.191,3471.058,"Well, assume it doesn't --"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3471.058,3471.496,-- Connecticut law --
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3471.496,3471.675,Assume that --
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3471.675,3472.251,-- is not clear on --
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3472.251,3474.886,Assume it doesn't?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3474.886,3474.995,Yes.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3474.995,3481.451,Assume this probate court doesn't -- in the -- are the parties precluded by the judgment?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3481.451,3483.288,Precluded from what?
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3483.288,3494.967,"Well, is there -- is there any way that the grandchildren -- let's say the grandchildren changed their minds now but the Court didn't, is there anything the grandchildren can do about it?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3494.967,3505.282,"Well, certainly the grandchildren if they all agreed to do so could reverse themselves the decision originally made."
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3514.544,3516.045,"Well, that's maybe the way you put it."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3526.684,3528.684,Second Circuit of course came out the other way very clearly.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3528.684,3538.824,It isn't what I asked you -- I just asked you whether -- whether the Second Circuit said -- whatever the Second Circuit said and may not have any effect or whatsoever on this -- these probate proceedings.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3550.039,3553.294,"I could give the money back, I suppose."
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3553.294,3554.227,Who's to give the money back?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3554.227,3556.527,"The grandchildren, to give the money back if they have control."
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3556.527,3561.067,Although they want more than the $3 million.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3561.067,3562.653,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3588.965,3589.307,Yes but does it make any difference --
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3589.307,3589.94,How do you --
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3589.94,3594.382,"-- on how much -- how much the grandchildren get, doesn't it?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3594.382,3607.594,"It would also make a big difference if the grandchildren being ignorant of federal estate tax law had come in and filed a renunciation said, ""We renounced to the extent of $1 million."""
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3609.494,3609.972,I gather your --
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3609.972,3610.576,-- then --
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3610.576,3619.281,-- your answer is that the grandchildren as a result of this decision in the probate court is going to get $3 million and has got nothing to do about it now.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3619.281,3623.274,That may be very true if the probate court will not reverse itself.
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3637.066,3642.466,"Your position that this was a nonadversary proceeding, I gather from what you have kept saying during the arguments."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3642.466,3648.185,"I think the record clearly shows that no one presented any other view.Everyone came in at filed briefs, saying that --"
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3648.185,3653.455,So that's -- you're taking quite a different position from the ones taken in your brief.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3653.455,3654.481,"No, I don't think that's (Voice Overlap)."
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3654.481,3663.284,"Well, I thought in your brief -- I thought in your brief you made very clear that you want us to remand it to the District Court to determine whether or not this was an adversary proceeding."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3663.284,3668.788,"Well, if this Court -- let me put it this way."
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3713.184,3716.632,"Well, I know that, but I'm talking about your position in this litigation."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3716.632,3727.282,"If this Court binds that whether the proceeding was adversary in the Connecticut State Probate Court is a relevant fact, then I think the Court has to remand for determination of that fact."
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3727.282,3732.407,So well now -- so in other words you think it say it remains an open question.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3741.486,3748.439,"The evidence in the record now so far, there's a very strong and that this was a nonadversary proceeding."
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3755.411,3762.988,I'm asking these questions not be -- not to be technical about whether what your position is and whether or not you've changed it.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3774.107,3782.471,There doesn't have to be any belligerency what we're -- with adversary proceeding as we explain it in our brief means that two sides come in.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3795.108,3797.078,"Here, you're exactly saying the same thing."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3799.013,3799.091,That's right.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3799.091,3806.893,"-- in order for it to be an adversary proceedings but suppose there's not, then they can't be an adversary proceeding."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3806.893,3808.083,I think that's correct.
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3835.759,3837.635,Do you think that's true about probate courts generally?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3852.463,3852.516,Well I --
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3852.516,3855.756,In which usually there's not a family fight.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3855.756,3861.197,"I think that in many of those cases, you don't have everyone appearing and taking the same position."
1966.673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3869.26,3876.058,And certainly as Mr. Justice White suggested the -- the probate court decrees are binding at all parties.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3876.058,3876.997,Yes.
1966.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3879.955,3886.835,"Mr. Levin, there's another million dollars I gather has to be paid for the Government?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3886.835,3887.885,It's already been paid.
1966.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3887.885,3903.428,"Alright, the Second Circuit for if -- now you have $4 million -- $7 million on the proration statute up here, the black gap between the widow and their grandchildren, now it's going to be only $6 million."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3906.715,3910.881,"Well, I think that's up to the probate court to decide, I suppose."
1966.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3910.881,3911.286,In -- in other words --
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3911.286,3913.099,It's a Connecticut law question.
1966.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3913.099,3921.946,"And this -- this Connecticut decree now in consequence of the Second Circuit decree is now revisable, is that it?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3921.946,3926.708,I think that's a question of Connecticut law.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3944.277,3956.012,"That something has to give because at the time the final distribution is granted, there's not going to be $7 million dollars to satisfy the probate court's formal -- former decree."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3956.012,3959.576,The probate court has not entered a final order of distribution yet.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3963.555,3966.18,That's right but the consequences --
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3966.18,3968.066,It has and yet said there will be $7 million.
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3968.066,3973.491,There's not enough money to satisfy the -- with consequences of that order.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3973.491,3977.46,And I don't -- I don't think the order says $12 million and then work it down to $7.
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3984.093,3986.589,How old is this grandmother?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3986.589,3986.886,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3986.886,3990.311,How old is this grandmother?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,3990.311,3992.047,I don't believe the record shows her age.
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4001.039,4006.202,"What happened when this decree, so-called decree was rendered?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4008.443,4009.778,No.
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4009.778,4019.062,Was there any agreement between the grandparents and the others that as to what decree should be added?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4019.062,4023.879,"The -- since this is a summary judgment proceeding, the record doesn't show anything with regard to agreement."
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4073.807,4087.401,"And was it understood at that time, members of the family agreed among themselves are acted in such a way that a certain conclusion was reached?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4095.84,4096.756,"Oh yes, Your Honor."
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4105.868,4114.602,Who was there to prevent the Government from loosing its million dollars tax by the family arrangement?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4114.602,4115.721,There was no one there.
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4118.788,4130.867,"Now, why does the decree have to be binding upon anybody except the family if the others were not represented in any fashion by somebody who will look after their interest?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4130.867,4134.609,"That's exactly the position which we take, Your Honor."
1966.673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4138.836,4140.386,"But that isn't your position, is it?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4148.587,4152.533,Our position is a two-fold one.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4196.206,4203.739,"Well, where is it in your brief within that Mr. Levin in support of what you have now described as the Commissioner's position."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4203.739,4224.464,"Well we state in our brief, in the footnote on page 27 that we advocate this nonadversary rule as set forth in the brief because we believe that it better accommodates the conflicting interest more consistent with Congress' purpose, etcetera."
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4269.072,4280.583,Have the probate court ever been considered throughout the nation as the court to settle Government tax claims than proceedings between members of the family?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4280.583,4282.055,No.
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4409.273,4414.878,"Well, there might not have even been adversary to one another and that the grandmother and the children?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4414.878,4418.002,"Well, there's certainly no evidence that their adversary did to each other."
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4430.62,4440.151,"You already suggested that the United States Commissioner be forced to try its tax claim in that Court, that way."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4442.055,4444.919,"Well, it was the petitioner who served it unnoticed."
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4444.919,4446.696,Who is the petitioner?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4446.696,4453.097,Petitioner was the executor of the estate who is the petitioner in this case.
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4458.535,4462.993,"Well of course, it's the rule of the probate proceeding that were handled by the executor --"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4462.993,4463.2,That's correct.
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4463.2,4466.438,-- who handles the executive and who handles the federal?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4466.438,4468.788,That's right.
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4468.788,4474.063,Sign of an intrafamily arrangement which would save over a million dollars tax.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4474.063,4476.129,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4476.129,4484.197,"Mr. Levin, just what disposition do you suggest would it make for this case?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4484.197,4497.716,The disposition which we suggest is that this Court adopt the nonadversary view and remand the case for findings as to whether this was a nonadversary proceeding or not.
1966.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4534.931,4544.903,"Well, suppose when it went back, the Court merely said was merely answered your question and said that this was not an adversary proceeding."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4548.293,4565.353,Then the -- then the question which is already been determined by the Second Circuit would be is the Government correct on its interpretation of Connecticut law and the Second Circuit has already clearly answered that said that this is the proper interpretation of Connecticut law.
1966.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4573.766,4588.143,I should think that in your position certainly isn't trying to contribute the purpose stating federal court relationships if you have to try out in the federal court whether or not the state court proceeding was a proper proceeding had led to a judgment.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4597.569,4598.858,That is one of our positions.
1966.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4598.858,4601.24,"Or it is binding, one or the other."
1966.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4619.061,4619.659,I know but do you --
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4619.659,4620.281,-- litigation.
1966.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4620.281,4622.364,Do you think that no merit in my suggestion that that does not only --
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4622.364,4623.286,I think there's a great deal of merit.
1966.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4623.286,4628.036,"-- contribute to harmonious federal state court relationship, doesn't it?"
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4628.036,4636.523,"Well, I don't think that it contributes to harmonious federal state relationships if the probate court is determining in effect estate tax disputes."
1966.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4659.377,4670.828,"Well, I'm only suggesting that for the purposes of the decision of this case, I would think it'd be preferable either to say that the revenue is bound by the state court judgment."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4670.828,4671.099,And we think --
1966.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4671.099,4676.543,Of all instances or that the revenue is never bound by the state court --
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4676.543,4676.599,We --
1966.673,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4676.599,4677.6,-- at any instance.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4677.6,4689.179,We think that the clear inference from the code and from the legislative history precludes us from taking the former position as well as common sense.
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4718.372,4739.602,I find this very difficult position that the courts said because -- well I think I would pretty clearly conclude that the federal government cannot be compelled to accept the result of the state courts in the tax fee.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4768.501,4768.539,I don't -- I don't --
1966.673,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4768.539,4775.868,And the provision that's been put to us is the brief and argument is it seems to me distinctly equivocal.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4775.868,4777.46,"No, I don't think our brief goes that far."
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4805.193,4825.569,"Do you think that it's possible that any local probate judge of the United States who in the lawyer for their family and the executor came to him said, ""Look here, is this million dollars tax estate paid to you by this family."""
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4844.271,4850.774,"No, Your Honor, I don't know of a single instance in which it's happened and I can't conceive of one from my limited experience with a probate court."
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4850.774,4857.554,Could the Court do that which the parties and the members of the family had agreed on this?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4857.554,4857.575,That's right.
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4857.575,4859.491,For the right lawyers?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4859.491,4860.305,That's right.
1966.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4860.305,4863.641,You mean even if the will was to the contrary?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4863.641,4868.584,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I think it's difficult to say just how contrary the will has to be."
1966.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4868.75,4870.375,Oh I didn't ask that.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4873.131,4873.193,Yes.
1966.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4873.193,4876.245,Would you say that even if the will was to the contrary?
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4876.245,4882.458,I think that intelligent lawyers can frequently make ambiguity --
1966.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4882.458,4887.153,I didn't ask you that.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4887.153,4887.179,You mean --
1966.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4887.179,4892.657,You may not answer if you don't want to but I just ask you what I thought was a fair question.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4892.657,4906.477,"If the will said I leave all my property to Mr. X and the family all came in and said, ""By Mr. X, you really meant Mrs. Y is who happens to be his widow"", I really can't answer whether a probate judge would do that."
1966.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4914.921,4925.024,"Well you answered very -- very lively and very quickly that no judge would consider the Government's interest, didn't you?"
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4932.71,4940.989,"I was asking you about the fact of this case, this case, with this will."
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4940.989,4941.474,I understood --
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4941.474,4943.04,And that matter.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4943.04,4952.527,I understood that I was answering on the basis of a -- of this case or a case like it where there was of very slight room for ambiguity.
1966.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4963.642,4965.23,And that's all I asked you.
1966.673,1,32920,jack_slevin,,4965.23,4967.401,Yes.
1966.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4970.511,4970.704,Mr. Thompson.
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,4970.704,4974.455,May I answer Mr. Justice White's question?
1966.673,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4974.455,4977.276,Would you step over to the lectern where we can all hear you?
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,4977.276,4995.048,"In answer to Mr. Justice White's question about the effect of the probate decree, the probate court adjudicated the property rights of the widow and the grandchildren, and the remainderman of the cost."
1966.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5008.583,5018.091,"Well, what -- I'm just wondering what happened if the Government gets these extra million dollars and what happens to the distribution made by the probate court?"
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,5018.091,5020.249,"Well, the grandchildren will get less."
1966.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5020.486,5031.12,"You know that it will come out of them so that they'll now get $2 million instead of $3 million, is that it?"
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,5031.12,5033.674,The Government has received the million dollars.
1966.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5047.948,5048.402,Well that's it.
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,5053.178,5056.238,"Yes, Your Honor, unless the decree is reversed."
1966.673,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5056.238,5060.71,The distribution has not been made yet.
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,5060.71,5063.123,The petition --
1966.673,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5063.123,5066.346,The distribution of the estate had not been finally bound --
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,5066.346,5068.573,"I think it's been made largely, Your Honor."
1966.673,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5093.471,5096.413,"But the state hadn't been well done, does it?"
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,5097.848,5099.369,"Not entirely, no."
1966.673,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5103.015,5109.357,And this is still an ongoing proceeding in the probate court.
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,5113.228,5116.182,But we have -- we pay all of the taxes that --
1966.673,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5116.182,5116.713,Be paid.
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,5116.713,5117.794,-- around the horizon.
1966.673,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5117.794,5118.767,Yes.
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,5118.767,5126.636,And we had paid all of the taxes at the time that the probate decree was entered with the exception of this deficiency.
1966.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5126.636,5128.249,Is this a refund suit?
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,5128.249,5130.083,This is a suit for a refund.
1966.673,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5130.083,5130.762,Yes.
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,5147.484,5151.16,A refund --
1966.673,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5151.16,5152.246,For one-third or for --
1966.673,2,20184,curtiss_k_thompson,,5152.246,5158.301,The probate decree has said charge these taxes against the grandchildren.
1966.673,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5188.716,5215.699,"Number 673, Commissioner of Internal Revenue -- versus Petitioner, versus the Estate of Herman J. Bosch."
1966.673,3,32920,jack_slevin,,5221.062,5226.085,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.673,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5639.506,5644.986,The question was whether you can make a partial release of the general power of appointment before you have the -- the --
1966.673,3,32920,jack_slevin,,5644.986,5645.479,Power to exercise.
1966.673,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5645.479,5646.915,The right to exercise the power.
1966.673,3,32920,jack_slevin,,5646.915,5648.175,Under New York law.
1966.673,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5649.438,5650.19,Yes.
1966.673,3,32920,jack_slevin,,5650.19,5652.544,That's right.
1966.673,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5652.563,5654.947,Do you say the Court was wrong in citing that --
1966.673,3,32920,jack_slevin,,5654.947,5655.208,Yes.
1966.673,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5655.208,5656.404,The New York Court was wrong in deciding that.
1966.673,3,32920,jack_slevin,,5656.404,5657.268,That's right.
1966.673,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5785.857,5788.225,This was not the surrogate's court?
1966.673,3,32920,jack_slevin,,5788.225,5788.832,That's correct.
1966.673,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5790.159,5790.873,Right.
1966.673,3,32920,jack_slevin,,5790.873,5799.807,"They went here and initiated what was in essence a declaratory judgment in the county proceedings, something of that nature in the Supreme Court for New York County."
1966.673,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5799.807,5802.025,To determine the validity of this partial release.
1966.673,3,32920,jack_slevin,,5802.025,5805.34,And as I understand it this was decided in -- in the motion part.
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,6912.429,6914.496,May it please the Court.
1966.673,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7277.381,7278.372,I understood you Mr. Burke --
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7278.372,7278.565,Yes sir.
1966.673,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7278.565,7286.957,"-- so to say there were some circumstances, some cases where he would be entitled to adapt to another procedure."
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7289.544,7289.56,Yes sir.
1966.673,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7289.56,7291.244,-- might be?
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7291.244,7306.307,"If there is any evidence of fraud, I say that the district judge in the competent federal controversy involving taxation should ignore the judgment just as to any other party might ignore it."
1966.673,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7314.892,7323.917,Would you say a lack of consideration to one of the parties and still a consent with the -- would be tantamount to that?
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7323.917,7328.928,I would exclude all consent judgments.
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7588.513,7589.82,May I ask you?
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7589.82,7590.841,Yes sir.
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7590.841,7600.763,Do you think that there was any legal duty on the part of the United States Commissioner to go in until they could have an adversary proceeding?
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7602.988,7614.535,"I suggest that Your Honor, a person with such an interest in a million dollars should be vouched in or should be allowed to come in to present his views."
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7614.535,7619.295,But suppose the Government doesn't want this case filed in that jurisdiction.
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7623.309,7630.855,It has been traditional in our system of government to have property rights determine of the state jurisdiction.
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7630.872,7646.522,"And has it been -- has it been traditional to have cases that involved tax question, decided the federal tax, decided in the state court without the federal government's consent."
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7661.884,7672.147,"Well, I suggest Your Honor that in cases of this import like the case of the preceding one, the Commissioner should come in and assert this --"
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7672.147,7674.943,He should but what law requires it?
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7674.943,7676.938,It doesn't -- no law requires but no law --
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7676.938,7677.51,But if no law requires --
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7677.51,7678.188,-- forbids it.
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7678.188,7679.695,-- then how can he be force to do?
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7679.695,7690.454,"He is as my adversary said in the Third Circuit, the Government comes in and defends -- and litigates these issues of state law."
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7704.031,7709.405,But that reaches before us now was that Third Circuit is right.
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7709.405,7715.484,Well would -- I don't know if anything that would prevent the Commissioner have been doing it otherwise he wouldn't be there.
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7715.484,7719.737,Why does the Government tried the tax cases?
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7719.737,7720.588,I beg your pardon sir.
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7720.588,7727.095,Why does the Government elect to try its tax cases when it sues for tax cases?
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7727.095,7730.862,It will sue for taxes only in the United States District Court.
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7730.862,7732.323,Why?
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7732.323,7741.108,Because the Government should be in control of its own fisc in respect of the taxability of something in the interpretation of a statute.
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7748.65,7755.769,"How can it accept the determination if there a -- if there's a question about the house, only issue of a house."
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7763.795,7764.142,That's --
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7764.142,7779.114,-- deciding a law of that case but it's quite different when you try to drag the Government in to try a case in state court which basically as far as the Government is concerned involved nothing but it'd like to collect the tax.
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7779.114,7782.249,"Well that's our situation, Your Honor."
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7790.367,7794.737,"But then you say it is and they gave that to exempt it, a decision."
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7794.737,7808.455,"Your Honor, if it involves the construction of a federal statute, the -- the state court has no powers whatever."
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7816.886,7817.668,"No, hold it --"
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7817.668,7817.846,-- as I --
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7817.846,7822.224,But this is a question on which government tax depends.
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7822.224,7835.972,Well I can think of a situation suggested by Mr. Justice Fortas that our fisc could be controlled at a measure by a Mexican judgment.
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7851.658,7854.298,Does the federal government go in as a defendant in it?
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7854.298,7855.371,The Commissioner of our --
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7855.371,7856.485,In the divorce case?
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7856.485,7857.433,"No sir, it was a divorce suit."
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7857.433,7862.002,That they have dragged him into the divorce case because it was going to affect the Government's taxes?
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7862.002,7869.172,But the Government could have inquired into whether this was adversary or nonadversary and made its regulation depending upon --
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7869.172,7871.786,I'm not talking about the Government agreeing to go in and try.
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7873.814,7874.342,But if --
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7874.342,7880.397,I'm talking about the Government being forced to come in and against its will.
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7880.397,7884.851,"Well, if I had a million dollars at stake, I'd be there somehow."
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7884.851,7893.743,"You might and you might not because you might not only try in that jurisdiction that the jurisdiction amounts to, allowed it on a certain law."
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7893.743,7903.85,"But the -- if the Government were a party, it would have all the rights of appeal right up to this Court perhaps."
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7905.315,7905.762,Well it might --
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7905.762,7906.274,I --
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7906.274,7918.882,It might choose to be so but where do you get your authority and in its federal statutes purports the Government to go in and litigate it because it incidentally involved its tax --
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7918.882,7919.222,All I can ask --
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7919.222,7920.295,-- in the state court.
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7920.295,7930.853,"All I can answer to that question, Your Honor is that the Commissioner does just that all the property does that on the Third Circuit."
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7932.819,7939.821,"But sure, but that's the issue we have before, seven other circuits have decided the point here, have they not?"
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7939.821,7941.41,Oh yes.
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7941.41,7942.558,And that's one circuit?
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7942.558,7944.183,Yes.
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7944.183,7957.061,Now what I'm asking is where they got their power to force the federal government to go in and litigate its tax question which incidentally affects its tax in the state court.
1966.673,4,29299,john_w_burke,,7957.061,7959.439,I can give you no answer except what I -- a tip that --
1966.673,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7959.439,7961.997,Well that's what I wanted to find out.
1966.673,5,32920,jack_slevin,,8256.233,8262.341,"In the very brief time that I have remaining, I'd like to make just two of perhaps three very short points."
1966.673,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8331.495,8336.683,"I must say I didn't get that impression from Mr. Burke's answer to my question, Mr. Levin."
1966.673,5,32920,jack_slevin,,8336.683,8336.968,Well I --
1966.673,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8336.968,8342.288,"I thought he says the matter how it got there, if in fact there were an appellate decision."
1966.673,5,32920,jack_slevin,,8361.977,8367.474,"Well, that's certainly not -- not the decision stated by the parties, detectors, and either these cases in their briefs."
1966.673,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8367.474,8368.672,"Well, perhaps I misunderstood that --"
1966.673,5,32920,jack_slevin,,8368.672,8369.034,Their position --
1966.673,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,8369.034,8371.021,"-- about that going, he answered my question."
1966.673,5,32920,jack_slevin,,8371.021,8386.482,"Their position and the position of the Third Circuit and of the Second Circuit in this case is that a decision of the state lower court, the state probate or trial court is final and binding."
1966.673,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8399.601,8402.577,If there's wrong on that.
1966.673,5,32920,jack_slevin,,8411.919,8413.883,The decision as to --
1966.673,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8413.883,8418.493,If it be true that question is open for us to decide in this case.
1966.673,5,32920,jack_slevin,,8418.493,8419.931,"Which question, Your Honor?"
1966.673,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8419.931,8425.387,The question as it was raised about what the law of the State of New York.
1966.673,5,32920,jack_slevin,,8425.387,8430.693,Well we did not ask this Court to decide the law of the State of New York.
1966.673,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8465.176,8479.887,"Well that's -- but if it be true, because what the purport of Brother Brennan's question, but that question is open now, here, why should it be remanded for that purpose?"
1966.673,5,32920,jack_slevin,,8479.887,8486.064,"Well, I think that this Court may well decide that question."
1966.673,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8490.48,8491.505,I understand it.
