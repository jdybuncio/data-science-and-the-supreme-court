1980.79-1128,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.466,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Montana et al. v. United States.
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,12.824,18.494,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,92.088,94.01,Is the dam inside the Reservation?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,94.01,94.932,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,155.657,161.639,"Now, you say, Montana owns it, which they use?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,161.639,163.169,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,163.169,165.543,"Who uses it, the people of Montana?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,165.543,173.01,The State of Montana in a sort of a parens patriae position owns the--
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,173.01,174.039,Montana owns it in fee?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,174.039,175.352,"--Yes, it does."
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,175.352,177.804,And who uses it?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,177.804,190.846,"Fishermen, various non-Indians or Indians, whoever wants to use that particular piece of property to gain access to the Big Horn River or fish the waters of the Big Horn River."
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,190.846,194.485,"By license, by permission, or is it just open?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,194.485,202.075,"Well, with regard to nonmembers, of course the State of Montana has consistently required a state hunting or fishing license."
1980.79-1128,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,202.075,203.06,Nonmembers of what?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,203.06,207.401,Nonmembers of the Crow Indian Tribe.
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,208.464,213.649,"But not any particular permission to go on the property, is that it?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,213.649,214.133,No.
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,218.741,221.661,"And that's been true up until this litigation, anyway?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,221.661,222.286,Yes.
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,374.614,375.443,Why?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,378.02,380.565,Because he's a nonresident and a nonmember of the tribe.
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,535.707,542.126,"Of course, the very existence of a treaty implied the sovereignty of the Indian nation, didn't it?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,544.501,546.985,"--Well, that's correct."
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.966,556.37,"Between us and England, say?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,556.37,557.62,--Between us and England.
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,563.055,568.725,But you don't make a treaty with somebody who doesn't have some sovereign qualities?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,568.725,569.288,Yes.
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,569.288,571.599,"In other words... otherwise, you just pass a law."
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,571.599,573.63,That's correct.
1980.79-1128,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,593.044,594.841,Mr. Roth?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,594.841,596.684,"Yes, Mr. Justice?"
1980.79-1128,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,596.684,603.632,"In the United States v. Finch case, in the report in Fed. Supp. are a number of maps."
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,609.178,611.145,"Yes, I do, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-1128,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,688.239,701.609,"Before you get to that, Mr. Roth, are you going to touch at some point in your oral argument on the Equal Footing doctrine of Pollard v. Hagan?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,701.609,702.702,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-1128,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,908.12,909.62,"And where is this, Mr. Roth?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,909.62,913.555,--It appears at pages 30-31 in Vol.
1980.79-1128,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,993.148,993.71,Mr. Roth?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,993.71,995.132,"--Yes, Justice Blackmun."
1980.79-1128,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,995.132,1003.065,"In these treaties, however, with the Indians, do you think that the Crow understood the meaning of the Equal Footing Doctrine?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1003.065,1004.424,"No, I don't think they did, Your Honor."
1980.79-1128,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1004.424,1011.108,"Well, isn't the understanding of the respective parties to the treaties rather important, then?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1011.108,1012.905,"Well, I believe so."
1980.79-1128,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1031.789,1041.894,What is the value of a treaty or any engagement if we're going to probe into the understanding?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1041.894,1042.768,I beg your pardon?
1980.79-1128,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1042.768,1051.905,What is the value of a treaty or a contract if we're going to undertake to probe into whether the parties understood the contents?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1051.905,1062.917,"Well, at times this Court appears to have indicated that it is relevant as to what the understanding of the parties was in the circumstances."
1980.79-1128,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1062.917,1063.995,Special Rule as to Indian Treaties?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1063.995,1065.182,"Yes, that's correct."
1980.79-1128,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1219.806,1221.212,"That's a matter of state law, isn't it?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1223.711,1224.789,That's correct; that's correct.
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.789,1225.523,Mr. Roth?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1225.523,1227.414,"Yes, Mr. Justice White?"
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1227.414,1248.28,"Do you think the claim here that's been sustained in favor of the Tribe indicates that they own not only the bed of the river but the water in the stream, in the sense that they could control, if they wanted to, the navigability of the stream?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1248.28,1250.076,I won't concede that point.
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1252.199,1264.508,Do you think the judgment below would enable the tribe not only to regulate fishing in the river but the navigation of it?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1264.508,1267.615,"I would concede that they will assert that right, Your Honor."
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.615,1270.38,"Well, how do you read the holding below?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1270.38,1276.986,I read the holding below as conveying to them ownership of the entire stream.
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.986,1277.814,Of the entire stream?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1277.814,1280.126,"Yes, presumably regulatory power."
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1280.126,1287.075,"Because, after all, there is no necessary connection between ownership of the bed of the stream and control of navigation."
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1287.075,1287.887,Absolutely not.
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.902,1296.651,"Furthermore, there's no necessary connection between ownership of the bed of the stream and the ability to fish in the water."
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1296.651,1308.396,"Well, other than the statement in Shively v. Bowlby that the navigational servitude includes the right to travel, the right of commerce, and also the right of public fishing."
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1308.396,1324.375,"Well, but, as you well know, in the western states there is certainly a major controversy between those who claim they own the bed of the river and people who want to float the river."
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1324.375,1325.359,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1325.359,1332.699,And I suppose that the holding below would indicate the Tribe could keep people from floating the river fishing?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1332.699,1333.527,Yes.
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1338.088,1341.039,As long as they didn't get on the banks or the bottom of the stream?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1341.039,1341.461,--Yes.
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1345.803,1347.458,"There's a rule in some states, you know."
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1347.458,1355.034,"They can float the river but they can't cast their line into the water and catch a fish planted by the State of Montana, is basically a part of that issue."
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1355.034,1360.704,"Well, the holding below would say the Tribe could prevent floaters on the river?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1360.704,1363.453,"Not floaters on the river, no."
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1363.453,1364.015,Why?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1364.015,1364.656,Because--
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1364.656,1366.92,"They can control navigation, you told me."
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1366.92,1368.247,"--No, I didn't."
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.886,1373.323,"No, under the holding below, they could."
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1373.323,1376.431,"No, I don't think the holding below went that far."
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1381.789,1390.614,"Do you think the court below then said, well, the treaty gave the bottom of the river, but it didn't give the river?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1399.204,1404.157,I think that the lower court actually didn't deal with the navigational servitude.
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1409.622,1410.403,I'm not talking about a servitude.
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1414.933,1416.993,"--No, I don't think the lower court went that far."
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1416.993,1428.443,"Well, if it didn't, why would the treaty give the Indians the bottom of the river but not the power to control navigation?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1432.816,1433.316,Precisely.
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.972,1473.971,"Well, the question is the effect of the treaty in that respect."
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1473.971,1474.221,Yes.
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1474.221,1479.422,The boundaries of the Reservation included the Big Horn River.
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1479.422,1481.64,It did include the Big Horn River.
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1481.64,1484.061,And the argument is that therefore they had the bottom of the river.
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1487.591,1493.619,I don't know why the respondents... but they have... conceded that issue to us.
1980.79-1128,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1496.135,1498.008,I'm not sure I understand.
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1506.942,1510.331,"By ""they"", Your Honor, is the Tribe?"
1980.79-1128,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1512.346,1517.984,But you link that with the ground below.
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1533.182,1536.65,"No, you could do that, but I think you'd have to do it with definite language."
1980.79-1128,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1539.225,1547.112,"I thought you... I got the impression that you were saying just that, that they could not separate these two?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1547.112,1556.437,"Well, I think they would not separate the two because, in the first instance, there isn't any treaty language that would even approach that kind of an intent."
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1576.821,1580.414,"Well, the question in the case is... one of the questions in the case is fishing in the river."
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1580.414,1581.476,--That's correct.
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1581.476,1595.268,"It isn't taking things off the bottom of the river and if they don't have control over navigation in the river and the use of the water in the river, what is the authority to prevent fishing in the river?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1595.268,1597.827,"Your Honor, that is our argument."
1980.79-1128,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.755,1679.061,"Well, how can one reconcile that concession in Namen with the holding of the 9th Circuit in this case that the State of Montana does not own the bed of the river in question?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1679.061,1682.076,"I don't think one can, because I do believe it creates a paradox."
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1691.931,1695.008,"Well, where is the Flathead case now?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1695.008,1697.492,"It's in the 9th Circuit, however not--"
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1697.492,1700.663,"Well, what do you think is going to happen to Judge Jameson there?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1700.663,1712.096,"--Well, first of all, Namen I upon which I rely has already been to this Court on a petition for certiorari by the Flathead Tribe and certiorari was denied."
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1717.39,1719.951,So that case is settled?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1721.06,1723.106,That case is settled and the Tribe--
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.106,1723.809,--in the 9th Circuit?
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1723.809,1724.418,--That's right.
1980.79-1128,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.416,1742.145,"Well, apparently the 9th Circuit doesn't think there's anything inconsistent between the Flathead case and the Big Horn case?"
1980.79-1128,0,43520,urban_l_roth,,1742.145,1742.614,Apparently.
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2456.265,2458.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2478.772,2481.225,"You say, Mr. Claiborne."
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2523.27,2524.145,--Indeed.
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2535.048,2535.265,Right.
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2535.265,2536.734,--was the issue here?
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2557.943,2560.037,"Fish aren't in the bed of the river, they're in the river."
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2560.037,2565.863,That is the premise on which the petitioners have argued this case throughout.
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.863,2569.283,"Well, it didn't sound like you... in this Court, Mr. Claiborne."
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2569.283,2585.916,"Mr. Justice White, it seems to me there was a somewhat change of emphasis under perhaps prompting from the Court, but the briefs in all courts and the arguments until today were entirely premised on that concession."
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.916,2604.253,"Well, Mr. Claiborne, the easy answer... not the easy, but one answer to Justice Stewart's question is that if you... if someone owns the riverbed but someone else has a right to fish in the river as long as he doesn't touch the bottom, he can be prosecuted for trespass if he gets out of his boat and--"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2610.75,2630.32,"Well, the federal statute 1165 has been construed as covering not merely trespassing, touching the bottom, either with the hook or with the feet, but also of fishing the overlying waters if the underlying land is tribally owned--"
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.32,2631.133,Do you think that follows?
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2631.133,2635.708,"--It has been the understanding, the interpretation--"
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.708,2636.193,In this litigation?
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2636.193,2637.787,--of Section 1165.
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.074,2666.618,"Well, do you think it would violate... how about just floating the river without fishing?"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2670.725,2671.522,No.
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.457,2688.673,"Well, the river is within the tribal boundary, within Reservation boundaries, and the statutes say that they can exclude people from the Reservation."
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2688.673,2691.484,"--Indeed, Mr. Justice White, but just as the State--"
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.484,2692.607,"Not on the river, eh?"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2693.185,2710.007,"--Only because of the paramount federal navigational servitude which, arguably at least, has a corollary for the benefit of the public at large, that is a public right of navigation on navigable rivers up through the United States."
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2710.007,2712.241,"So, there's a right to navigate, but not a right to fish?"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2712.241,2714.505,That is so.
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2714.505,2715.801,"I mean, that's your claim?"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2715.801,2716.942,Yes.
1980.79-1128,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2716.942,2721.861,And what is your response to the Equal Footing argument?
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2721.861,2735.716,"Well, we begin with the Shively case followed in any number of cases, the most recently affirmed in this Court in the Choctaw case, that there is, in the words of Shively,"
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2767.358,2769.03,"That is, the power of the United States?"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2769.03,2769.811,The power of the United States.
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2769.811,2774.246,"Within at least some limitations, at least, according to Shively?"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2774.246,2775.636,Indeed.
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2777.355,2779.088,Ordinarily.
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2779.088,2821.071,"--and clearly, though, it is perhaps proper to say that the extent to which the presumption against its being done varies according as the beneficiary is an individual private person who would be obtaining a special privilege by a piecemeal grant of some part of the river bottom, as opposed to a political society, a point made in the Choctaw opinion, such as an Indian tribe granted a large territory from which the white public was specifically intended to be excluded."
1980.79-1128,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2821.071,2824.304,"Well, how do you distinguish the Corvallis case, then?"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2824.304,2854.277,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I recognize that there is language in the Corvallis case which may cast doubt on what had otherwise been thought to be settled law but the Corvallis case in its holding does not in any way question the power before statehood of the United States to grant away the beds of navigable rivers, as I understand the case."
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2862.696,2874.611,You would agree with Mr. Roth that there is some tension between this aspect of the Equal Footing Doctrine and cases such as Choctaw?
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2874.611,2879.11,"There is some tension, yes, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3001.701,3007.636,"Isn't that generally what follows from the navigational servitude, a public right of access to navigable streams to traverse a stream?"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3007.636,3044.356,"But it may be, Mr. Justice Stewart, that in the case of an entire territory which is sealed off, as this was intended to be, with an explicit promise by the United States to let no one enter except by permission of the Tribe, that the public right to come on this relatively small river, which may not have been so clearly viewed as navigable, was to some degree diminished."
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3044.356,3048.667,"Or maybe the navigational servitude was eliminated too, extinguished."
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3060.209,3064.395,"It may have different aspects, as we know from the Kaiser Aetna case."
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3084.668,3089.463,"Well, generally, that is what the federal navigational servitude implies, is it not?"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3089.463,3091.791,"--Well, it does have two aspects."
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3194.764,3203.901,"Mr. Claiborne, do you accept the 9th Circuit's ruling with respect to nonmember fee owners?"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3203.901,3206.446,We do accept that ruling.
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3206.446,3209.508,"Although it is somewhat inconsistent with your basic theory, is it not?"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3209.508,3210.039,Yes.
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3211.975,3213.038,You accept it because you--
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3213.038,3236.889,"--We approach it much as the 9th Circuit did, that there is a tension between the exclusive reservation for the benefit of the Tribe of this territory and what can be viewed as congressional invitation to nonmembers to enter upon and purchase lots within that reservation."
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3242.84,3253.287,"--Well, when you accommodate them, what do you do about the riverbed in those places of the river where the riparian owners are fee owners, nonmember fee owners?"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3253.287,3264.814,"We do not concede that the riparian fee owner has a right to fish in the river, and I may say that the Namen case--"
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3264.814,3267.031,Didn't the 9th Circuit say that they did?
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3267.031,3269.359,"--No, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3273.748,3274.623,"Well, that's what I mean."
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3274.623,3279.574,--But they have no riparian subsoil ownership or--
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3279.574,3280.871,How can you fish on land?
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3280.871,3285.493,"--Well, there are fishing places within... the lands."
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3285.493,3286.446,"Well, that's what I, now--"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3286.446,3287.289,Nonnavigable.
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3287.289,3293.271,"--Let's assume that on both sides of the river there's a nonmember fee owner, and that they both live on their property."
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3300.034,3303.877,If this is nonnavigable?
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3308.656,3309.406,We're talking about the Big Horn River.
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3309.406,3317.825,"Well, according to the 9th Circuit the ownership of the bed is in the Tribe or in the United States Government for the Tribe."
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3317.825,3319.856,But the riparian owners may nevertheless fish in the river?
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3319.856,3323.088,"No, not under the 9th Circuit's holding."
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3323.088,3329.758,I thought you said that they can fish on their own land?
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3329.758,3339.878,"On their own land if they have a fishing pond or if it's a nonnavigable stream, such as the Little Big Horn, to which they are riparian, and where they would own to the middle... of the river."
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3339.878,3340.081,I understand that.
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3347.812,3377.144,"Indeed, the 9th Circuit explicitly said the opposite, and so had the... in the Namen case involving the Flathead Reservation, where the 9th Circuit upheld the Tribe's claim to the bed of the Flathead Lake, just as it did here, and while it conceded the riparian right of the fee owners to wharfage and to access for navigation to the lake, it denied them the right to fish in the lake."
1980.79-1128,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3377.878,3381.518,But the riparian owners here on the Big Horn may navigate?
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3381.518,3397.012,They may put their boats in the river but they may not fish because that fishery is a part of the reserve that was originally set apart for the tribe.
1980.79-1128,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3528.052,3538.595,Do you suggest that the result in this case would have been different had it been brought by non-Indian residents and owners of land on the Reservation?
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3538.595,3545.874,"--It would certainly present a much more attractive case from the point of view of the plaintiffs, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1128,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3574.159,3576.299,"Well, the plaintiff is the State of Montana, isn't it?"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3576.299,3582.312,But the State of Montana has not mentioned these outsiders in any of it's briefs.
1980.79-1128,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3587.185,3593.418,"Well, it talks about the State, about the State, and I guess implicitly it means all the residents of the State."
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3593.418,3603.631,"--But it is to be noticed that non-owners... they speak about absentee land-owners, but they never speak about total outsiders, total strangers--"
1980.79-1128,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3603.631,3604.037,The general public.
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3604.037,3607.677,"--They never speak about State lands, except for the bed of the river."
1980.79-1128,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3760.069,3770.582,"Well, what do you do with the language from Shively v. Bowlby about, upon which you apparently rely, where the Court says,"
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3793.603,3828.463,"Well, the very case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, says, we cannot doubt that Congress has the power to make grants of land below high water mark of navigable waters in any territory of the United States whenever it becomes necessary to do so in order to perform its national obligations, or to effect the improvement of such lands for the promotion and convenience of commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, or to carry out other public purposes appropriate to the objects for which the United States holds the territory."
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3850.988,3853.675,And that is the presumption in the absence of a conveyance?
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3853.675,3855.002,"--Yes, indeed."
1980.79-1128,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3855.002,3855.924,Isn't that it?
1980.79-1128,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3855.924,3871.665,"But it is only a presumption and it can be overridden, at least provided a public purpose is involved; and certainly confirming the diminished territory of the Crow Tribe was such a purpose."
1980.79-1128,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3873.603,3889.549,Mr. Lynaugh.
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,3889.549,3895.344,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4072.506,4073.975,Is it stocked?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4073.975,4075.598,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1980.79-1128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4075.598,4076.223,By whom?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4076.223,4082.956,"Your Honor, it is now stocked by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife in conjunction with the Tribe."
1980.79-1128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4087.329,4089.219,"Prior to this decision, who did it?"
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4089.219,4091.327,"--The State of Montana has done it, Your Honor."
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4091.327,4097.107,So there wouldn't be any fishery at all in the absence of stocking?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4097.107,4100.652,"There was a fishery, Your Honor, but--"
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4100.652,4102.183,"We're talking about a trout fishery, aren't we?"
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4102.183,4102.683,--That's right.
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4103.183,4106.276,"And there wouldn't be any at all in the absence of stocking, isn't that correct?"
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4106.276,4107.54,--That's correct.
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4107.54,4109.477,Because there's no propagation?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4109.477,4114.412,"No, Your Honor, not that I'm aware of."
1980.79-1128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4142.542,4150.912,"What authority do you have, or what do you think the basis is for the tying of ownership of fishing to the ownership of the river bottom?"
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4171.186,4180.573,"--I think the negotiations of the treaty pointed out that the fishing, Your Honor, and the hunting, the sustenance that can be derived from the sources within the reservation was very important to the Tribe."
1980.79-1128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4180.573,4183.977,"That doesn't address my question, does it?"
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4183.977,4190.397,I think it does from the standpoint that the total grant made to the Tribe included the river for that purpose.
1980.79-1128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4190.397,4193.052,"Well, I would think you would make that argument even if the State owned the bottom."
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4193.052,4197.535,"That is our second argument that I was row addressing, Your Honor."
1980.79-1128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4197.535,4208.046,"Well, so again, I'm asking you, why in this case has the ownership notion been tied to the fishery?"
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4216.308,4220.15,There are... the issue is addressed--
1980.79-1128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4220.15,4221.306,Except this one?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4221.306,4236.003,"--The issue is addressed in the Alaska Fishery case, I believe, where the beds of the rivers around the island were given to the tribe and that the tribe was allowed the right to exclude the public from fishery."
1980.79-1128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4244.921,4255.417,"But you could either... do you also concede, as I gather the United States does, or states, that the Tribe could not exclude the people from floating the river?"
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4255.417,4256.449,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4264.774,4268.724,Does that mean the right of the general public to navigate the river?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4268.724,4271.833,For purposes of floating?
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4271.833,4273.333,For any purpose.
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4273.942,4281.421,"I think it does, but I would like to add, Your Honor, that there is... this is not an artery of commerce."
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4284.343,4284.749,It's a navigable stream.
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4284.749,4285.546,--of fishing.
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4285.546,4286.218,It's a navigable stream?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4286.218,4286.701,"Yes, it is."
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4287.701,4292.199,And you concede the Federal Government has a navigational servitude?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4292.199,4293.324,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4293.324,4299.478,"And generally a navigational servitude implies a right of the general public to traverse the navigable stream, does it not?"
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4299.478,4301.008,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4301.008,4302.992,And do you concede that exists here?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4302.992,4303.477,"Yes, I do."
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4305.428,4310.567,"And... but with no right to... the right to traverse, but no right to fish in the water, is that it?"
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4310.567,4311.614,--I don't see--
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4311.614,4312.707,Except by permission of the tribe?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4312.707,4313.551,--That's correct.
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4313.551,4338.104,"And why, since I've already interrupted you, why... and this is maybe the same question that my brother White asked you, but perhaps a little broader, why does ownership... why isn't ownership of something quite different from the power to exercise regulation or control over it?"
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4346.818,4353.034,I think we felt that it was a separate theory and on--
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4353.034,4353.549,"They are separate, aren't they?"
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4358.361,4364.03,--I think we believed it was a right that went along with ownership of the riverbed itself.
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4364.03,4368.371,"But it may exist even without ownership, may it not?"
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4368.371,4370.949,The property right in the hunting?
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4370.949,4372.746,"No, the power to regulate?"
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4372.746,4373.902,That's correct.
1980.79-1128,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4375.415,4377.274,Without any ownership whatsoever?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4377.274,4377.711,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1128,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4377.711,4383.255,Then why so much emphasis on the ownership argument?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4403.827,4421.773,"I think one answer to the question, Your Honor, If I may, is that the ownership issue is relevant from the standpoint that if the bed was owned by the Tribe, then it would fall into a trust status, and I think it would fall under, then, the purview of--"
1980.79-1128,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4421.773,4422.679,--It's the converse--
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4422.679,4423.711,--1165.
1980.79-1128,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4423.711,4425.944,--The converse of that I'm driving at.
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4441.892,4442.453,No.
1980.79-1128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4442.453,4449.669,Is any part of the Big Horn Lake on the Reservation?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4449.669,4453.808,Are you talking about an area--
1980.79-1128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4453.808,4460.165,Any part of the lake above the dam?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4460.165,4473.409,"--It's within the boundaries of the reservation, but part of it, taken for the construction of Yellowtail Dam, above the dam site, but there is no--"
1980.79-1128,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4473.409,4477.985,So that the bottom of the lake is not involved in this case?
1980.79-1128,2,42971,thomas_j_lynaugh,,4477.985,4478.907,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1128,3,43520,urban_l_roth,,5028.451,5030.717,"If it please the Court, I do."
1980.79-1128,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5152.84,5153.48,How about limits?
1980.79-1128,3,43520,urban_l_roth,,5153.48,5155.73,"No limits, Your Honor, absolutely none."
1980.79-1128,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5196.775,5206.834,"No, but to my knowledge, if the game is being taken for food, that's as distinguished from sport."
1980.79-1128,3,43520,urban_l_roth,,5208.146,5208.974,"--Yes, there is."
1980.79-1128,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5328.847,5330.004,"Thank you, gentlemen."
