1998.98-727,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.147,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 98-727, Teresa Cunningham v. Hamilton County, Ohio."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,9.769,12.922,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-727,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,50.766,54.139,"But there are exceptions to that rule, are there not, Mr. Goldstein?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,54.139,66.847,"Mr. Chief Justice, there is an indication in this Court's precedents that there are a class of persons known as quasi parties who may appeal, but the quasi party cases do not determine whether or not that appeal should be brought at the end of the case or not."
1998.98-727,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,86.011,103.722,"Mr. Goldstein, you have recognized that, if the client had been sanctioned as well, the client would have to wait till the end of the line and presumably the lawyer, too, and the lawyer, although not a party, could then appeal, so that seems to be inconsistent with your position."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,103.722,118.68,"The circuits that have confronted this question uniformly agree, and so do we, that when that sanction merges into the final judgment, practicalities require that the sanction itself come up together, because it would be injudicious--"
1998.98-727,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,118.68,128.107,"But we have a nonparty, the attorney, who could take an appeal then, so the Chief asked if that rule is without exception."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,134.571,141.628,"--That is correct, but we do believe that that position is consistent with our views of Rules 3 and 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure."
1998.98-727,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,146.489,158.457,"If you're wrong about the possibility of the attorney appealing the sanction at the end of the line, if you're wrong about that, then I take it you concede that you could not prevail here."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,158.457,159.708,"Respectfully, no."
1998.98-727,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,169.184,178.37,"Before we get to those, I'm sort of perplexed by the inconsistency at the other end."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,187.124,188.877,--The--
1998.98-727,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,188.877,198.833,"--but... I mean, would be a party, treated like a party for purposes of appealing immediately, but would not be a party for purposes of appealing at the end of the case?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,201.416,211.852,"--It requires this Court to track Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, and that rule instructs that you may appeal from an order or a judgment to which you are a party."
1998.98-727,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,222.988,232.145,"Well, so you're saying she could appeal the... on the basis of the order, in... but she couldn't appeal from the final judgment."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,233.835,244.313,"Mr. Chief Justice, this Court has been quite clear that the final judgment itself has to be looked at in isolation, and you determine whether or not the appellant is a party to the final judgment."
1998.98-727,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.313,245.673,But she's not appealing the final judgment.
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,253.55,265.147,"That is correct, the difference being that under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure she is precluded from appealing the sanction order more than 30 days after it's entered."
1998.98-727,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,292.105,303.152,"Mr. Goldstein, there are all kinds of orders that are made in the course of a trial proceeding, orders that are not immediately reviewable, and you don't lose out because of the 30-day limit."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,308.264,309.706,That is correct.
1998.98-727,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,354.285,367.223,"Well, if the Court should decide that no such line was ever drawn and that it would make no sense to draw it, that is, the judgment is the occasion, as Justice Scalia said, it answers the when question."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,395.062,395.943,--Exactly.
1998.98-727,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,442.724,444.163,"--Well, in this case it was stayed."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,446.344,447.175,"--Respectfully, no."
1998.98-727,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.383,478.447,"Does that mean that the order could not be stayed, in your view?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,478.447,479.366,--No.
1998.98-727,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,483.179,486.181,"Well then, that takes some of the injury out of it."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,486.181,505.005,"If a district court were to do so, if the district court were to announce to an attorney, I believe you have contravened my ruling, I believe you have engaged in irresponsible conduct and at the end of this case I am going to sanction you $1,500, $10,000, what have you, that order would not be immediately appealable."
1998.98-727,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.984,509.706,"Well, that isn't staying the order, that's not entering the order until later."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,526.988,527.939,--I take that distinction.
1998.98-727,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,574.809,587.228,"Is there any reason... I mean, assuming that the language is open to your interpretation or the other, which I'll assume for the moment, is there any good reason why we should make this so complicated?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,605.768,609.281,"There is no harm in a clear, single rule, and that's--"
1998.98-727,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,609.281,629.106,"Or the clear, single would be, you'd lose, because the clear, single rule would be, everybody... if you're sanctioned, the time to appeal the sanction order, just like an attorney who is still in the case, the attorney who isn't appeals it at the end of the case, and if you don't like the order in the meantime, ask for a stay, and if he won't give you a stay, go under Rule 8, get the court of appeals to do it."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,629.106,632.655,"--Respectfully, that's... two... we should make two points."
1998.98-727,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,641.461,663.868,"Oh, well, why wouldn't it give rise to the problem of, in many sanctions cases, when they get to the court of appeals it would be mixed up with the merits, and all of a sudden you discover that this attorney was sanctioned for bringing a frivolous this or that, and the court of appeals, the parties will think, my God, we'd better be up there arguing about this, because it has to do with the merits of the case."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,663.868,665.078,"--Respectfully, no."
1998.98-727,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,684.611,688.385,"Well, I suppose on that point, in a serious case, could you get a writ of mandate?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,688.385,692.395,--The Court has been very clear that writs of mandamus--
1998.98-727,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,692.395,697.979,"I mean, it's a million dollar fine, and the judge refuses to stay it."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,705.325,707.325,"--Respectfully, we do not believe so."
1998.98-727,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,726.078,752.225,"I'm sorry, why can't... I would think this would be an odd case that it would ever happen that if a lawyer is sanctioned in the middle of the case, and the lawyer withdraws, so that he's not still representing the party, and you say, judge, I want to appeal, I can't appeal to the end, would you mind staying the payment until the end of the case, and the judge would say no."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,762.851,771.046,"--The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and its stay provisions, including Rule 8, are not triggered at that point because there is no timely notice of appeal."
1998.98-727,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,771.046,778.452,"Where does it say that Rule 8, to get a stay, you have to have filed a notice of appeal?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,785.957,803.908,"We do read the rules to not permit it, and in fact we have studied every single interlocutory attorney sanction appeal that has been brought in the last 20 years, and a court of appeal has never, ever allowed a writ of mandamus or Rule 54(b) certification, a 1292 certification."
1998.98-727,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,815.916,826.794,"Mr. Goldstein, when Justice Breyer asked you, you could read it one way, you could read it the other way, why shouldn't the tie breaker be 1292(e)?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,848.076,867.591,"Justice Ginsburg, the Court has... and you have pointed this out in an earlier opinion for the Court that that option is open to this Court to begin the rule making process, which respectfully, it has never seen fit to do, and there are no less than a dozen splits in the circuits about when various interlocutory orders may be brought to this Court."
1998.98-727,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,876.547,881.65,"What is the... I mean, you're being very picky about, you know, Rule 4, Rule 8 and so forth."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,886.231,891.567,The textual authority does lie squarely within 28 U.S.C. 1291.
1998.98-727,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,901.051,906.527,"It's a judicial elaboration in Cohen upon the term, final order."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,906.527,908.528,"There is no term, final order for--"
1998.98-727,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,908.528,911.302,"Final decision, excuse me."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,911.302,911.62,--Yes.
1998.98-727,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.246,923.07,"Well, if it's just a matter of practicality, I mean, we're making it up under Cohen, essentially."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,945.263,949.206,--We believe that the practical considerations do favor petitioner in this case.
1998.98-727,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,956.69,957.401,Why didn't she try?
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,968.108,970.738,That's correct.
1998.98-727,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,985.14,988.881,"Well, what did she have to lose, because it seems that would put her in the best position?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,988.881,990.883,"That is not correct, respectfully."
1998.98-727,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1004.301,1004.812,Where?
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1006.593,1009.244,--For filing an improper notice of appeal from the final--
1998.98-727,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1009.244,1023.285,"You are envisioning that the court of appeals, when someone is in this bind, says the law is uncertain, so I filed a notice of appeal at the interlocutory stage, I filed one at the end of the line, a court of appeals would sanction a lawyer for doing that?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1023.285,1049.292,"--At the... it is a concern that the attorney, even if she is not going to be sanctioned, should still appeal when it's appropriate and should not be filing unnecessary protective appeals, but it is worth returning to our argument under Rule 4(a)(2), and that is that the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure explicitly contemplate that if you file too early your notice of appeal automatically functions to be protective."
1998.98-727,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1049.292,1060.858,"May I ask in... picking up on your last colloquy with Justice Scalia, do you acknowledge that this is a Cohen problem at all?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1064.741,1066.172,That's absolutely correct.
1998.98-727,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1085.396,1094.051,"May I ask, when you talk about the closest analogue, is there anything we can learn from the procedure when a lawyer is actually held in contempt, as opposed to just sanctions?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1095.441,1096.763,"Respectfully, yes."
1998.98-727,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1129.575,1136.707,"And is it true that the contempt cases we've reviewed have been reviewed on the interlocutory stage, rather than after the final judgment?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1136.707,1137.328,--Yes.
1998.98-727,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1152.599,1160.904,But isn't an attorney given considerably more procedural rights in the case of a citation for contempt than for a sanction?
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1160.904,1181.337,"--Rule 37 requires that there be a notice and opportunity to be heard, but civil contempt cases do not draw a greater distinction, and in particular, again, Rule 16(h) allows the district court to simply deem this to be a contempt, and so does Rule 37(b), which also deals with discovery sanctions."
1998.98-727,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1216.422,1218.512,"Well, that would be a pretty risky thing for an attorney."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1233.452,1248.943,"Respondent has suggested that this rule that we propose would lead to lots of attempts to appeal, that attorneys might get themselves sanctioned in order to have the right to take an appeal, and we hope the Court will take the same practical view of that as well."
1998.98-727,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1248.943,1276.41,"Mr. Goldstein, can I ask you, if you say that Cohen is really not implicated here, then there really is no way to handle the case where you have an interlocutory appeal and it is intimately bound up with the merits of the case, that really whether there was a sanctionable conduct or not depends entirely upon how you view the merits of the case, which seems to me not at all an unusual situation."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1277.822,1279.632,"Well, Justice Breyer--"
1998.98-727,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.632,1284.775,"Since we're not applying Cohen you can't say, well, although most of these things would be interlocutory, this one won't be."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1287.756,1290.819,--This is briefed at length in the case.
1998.98-727,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1306.52,1327.773,"Yes, but the ones I've actually seen, where we had appeals, they... the argument would be that the attorney, for example, asked too many questions or something in a deposition, way out of line, and the defense would be something like, well, if you really understood this case you'd understand that these questions aren't out of line."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1358.753,1360.566,--There are two answers.
1998.98-727,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1441.447,1452.606,"Are there instances, in your experience, where there are repeated multiple sanctions put on an attorney, an attorney is just really being obstreperous?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1452.606,1453.906,It happens--
1998.98-727,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1453.906,1460.13,"He's fined $50 on 1 January, $500 on the 1 February for something else?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1460.13,1460.741,--Yes.
1998.98-727,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1461.352,1464.013,"And you obviously know where I'm going, if there are multiple appeals."
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1464.013,1464.634,--That's correct.
1998.98-727,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1491.94,1501.768,But each time the court of appeals shoots them down it's another piece of appellate business that really is contrary to the policy against piecemeal appeals.
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1501.768,1510.243,"As a practical matter in the court of appeal, those appeals will be consolidated by the court of appeals under Rule 3."
1998.98-727,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1517.927,1524.031,"So is a disqualification order, and why isn't that the closer analogy than a contempt citation?"
1998.98-727,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1524.031,1526.713,--There are two keys to the disqualification cases.
1998.98-727,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1542.603,1543.915,"Very well, Mr. Goldstein."
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1546.307,1551.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-727,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1600.674,1608.428,"Well, this attorney was also removed from the case, so is no longer acting as attorney, right?"
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1608.428,1609.427,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.98-727,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1609.427,1610.608,That might make a difference.
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1615.811,1617.083,I believe--
1998.98-727,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1617.083,1618.295,--when it's a nonparty?
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1618.295,1625.158,"--I believe the analysis is different, because the interests of a pure party and the attorney are different."
1998.98-727,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1648.002,1656.009,"Oh, no, once the attorney is removed, it makes the person much more of a nonparty than when the attorney is still in there representing the client."
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1656.009,1661.723,"But it does not affect the jurisdiction of the appellate courts, respectfully."
1998.98-727,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1687.739,1690.07,Why would mooting of the case affect it?
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1690.07,1690.691,I'm sorry.
1998.98-727,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1690.691,1701.418,"The case might moot out later, but the basis for the attorney sanction would not be eliminated by the mooting of the case on the merits, would it?"
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1701.418,1706.102,"When I said that, I was referring to the attorney sanctions may become moot at a later time."
1998.98-727,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1710.032,1717.038,You weren't saying that mooting of the case by some later event necessarily moots the attorney sanction issue that arose before it.
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1717.038,1717.769,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.98-727,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1717.769,1718.15,Okay.
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1733.501,1742.635,"In my experience, at some point in time there is going to be some document filed in the district court which says, this case is dismissed, this case is reversed, whatever."
1998.98-727,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1746.598,1753.583,"But there would be no notice given, presumably, to an attorney who had been removed in the interim."
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1758.024,1779.4,"--That may be true, and that may impose a slight burden upon the attorney to essentially monitor, if you will, to calendar in a tickler file, to review periodically the status of that case every 30 days or so, and I suggest that that burden is significantly less than the burdens which will be placed on the parties and the appellate courts by repeated or multiple interlocutory appeals."
1998.98-727,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1779.4,1783.591,Why isn't the contempt sanction the closest analogy?
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1793.697,1803.545,"The contempt sanction is different, we believe, because contempt sanctions are typically imposed against non parties who are unrelated to the case."
1998.98-727,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1805.536,1807.947,"Well, there's a lot of cases where the lawyers are held in contempt."
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1821.157,1824.67,--Because their interests are different from that of a pure nonparty.
1998.98-727,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1837.008,1848.615,"Well, my question is, why shouldn't it be treated like contempt, which is sometimes used as a way of getting interlocutory review of a discovery order?"
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1856.379,1867.977,"Yes, Your Honor, but to treat the cases differently we suggest supports the underlying reasons behind the rule of finality, and that is, we don't want to have multiple appeals."
1998.98-727,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1889.722,1894.284,You say a contempt might not be appealable until the end?
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1894.284,1894.985,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.985,1898.837,"Why... I'm sorry, I haven't followed you."
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1905.031,1908.603,It is a more severe sanction imposed against the--
1998.98-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.603,1909.665,"Well, that's true, but--"
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1909.665,1918.129,"--client, and it is treated differently, I think, by the courts, in the case of a party as opposed to the attorney, and the reason--"
1998.98-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.129,1921.001,"--Well, let's say... I'm talking about contempt citation of an attorney."
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1923.354,1926.477,"--In not every case, Your Honor."
1998.98-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.477,1927.906,Not in every case?
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1927.906,1928.707,Not in every case.
1998.98-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1928.707,1930.538,What cases would it not be?
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1930.538,1940.977,"For example, in the situation where the... there is a substantial congruence of interests between the nonparty, or the attorney, and the party to the action."
1998.98-727,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1940.977,1943.897,"What is this case, the case that you're relying on?"
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1943.897,1969.994,"I would refer the Court to a decision of the Ninth Circuit, the coordinated pretrial proceedings in Petroleum Products antitrust litigation case, a 1984 decision of the Ninth Circuit, where the Attorney General, I believe of the State of Oregon, was sanctioned, or was found in contempt, and his interests were so congruent, or so substantially similar to that of the State of Oregon, that the court ruled that the appeal was not immediately... may not be taken immediately."
1998.98-727,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1969.994,1979.171,"But I thought in all of the... at least all the contempt cases I know, taking Hickman v. Taylor, the lawyer's interest was... he was serving his client."
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,1988.487,2003.487,"To do so, Your Honor, if the Court allows even an appeal of a contempt citation immediately, will cause the appellate courts to become entwined in reviewing more and more the facts of the underlying litigation."
1998.98-727,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2003.487,2007.688,Now you're arguing that we should not allow interlocutory appeals of contempt citations.
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,2007.688,2008.219,I am.
1998.98-727,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2008.219,2014.104,"And I'm inclined to agree with you, that if we agree with you we shouldn't allow interlocutory appeals of contempt citations."
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,2015.045,2018.737,"That's an extension of the rationale that applies to this case, yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-727,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.737,2033.835,"Well, frequently, and I think this Court has admonished trial judges that if you're thinking of holding a lawyer in contempt, either tell him that you're thinking about it, but wait awhile."
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,2053.039,2057.822,"Yes, it would, because it would at that point merge with the final judgment of the case."
1998.98-727,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2057.822,2077.882,"Well, what discretion does a trial judge have to defer the effectiveness of an order of sanction, or to defer... what discretion would a court of appeals have to defer holding any hearings on it until the end of the case?"
1998.98-727,1,28771,john_j_arnold,,2077.882,2095.266,"Well, the trial court does, of course, have the discretion to decide when they are going to make that decision, when they are going to impose that sanction, or even if they... and the courts below have seen the situation where the court has found, or ordered, I'm going to sanction you for this conduct, but has not determined the final amount of the sanction."
1998.98-727,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3194.799,3196.74,"The Hickman example, Justice--"
1998.98-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3196.74,3200.873,Did the Court discuss appealability at all in Hickman?
1998.98-727,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3200.873,3205.576,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice, and the Court is very clear that there aren't implicit jurisdictional holdings."
1998.98-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3210.318,3213.921,Because Hickman didn't say a word about jurisdiction.
1998.98-727,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3213.921,3214.742,I believe that that--
1998.98-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3214.742,3216.673,"It was an opinion by Justice Murphy, so--"
1998.98-727,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3221.956,3225.659,"--Justice Ginsburg, I believe we are beyond my familiarity with Hickman and Taylor."
1998.98-727,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3245.811,3254.507,"Well, there are a lot of cases that have held that if a lawyer is held in contempt for failure to comply with a court order, it's immediately appealable."
1998.98-727,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3254.507,3256.52,We have not seen contrary authority.
1998.98-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3256.87,3259.993,"But I... that's what I was asking you, Mr. Goldstein."
1998.98-727,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3284.729,3286.09,--Nonappealable.
1998.98-727,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3293.936,3302.371,And you already told me in response to the earlier colloquy that that would be true of the lawyer as well if the lawyer and the client were jointly sanctioned.
1998.98-727,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3302.371,3302.782,--Yes.
1998.98-727,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3311.895,3316.72,"So if everything else is the same, but the magistrate says, you and your client."
1998.98-727,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3316.72,3320.661,"--Yes, and remember that the magistrate is making a conscious decision."
1998.98-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3364.061,3368.453,"Well, if you say the contempt rule has been here for more than 100, you must know some case."
1998.98-727,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3368.884,3370.834,--That is correct.
1998.98-727,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3397.974,3409.582,"Well, as a practical matter in this case we were just told that in fact there was continuing activity involving this lawyer, and that's what accounts for the subsequent $29,000 sanction."
1998.98-727,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3409.582,3417.035,The attorney's conduct in... the petitioner's conduct that was sanctioned at the end of the case involved her activity as counsel.
1998.98-727,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3422.792,3423.432,"Thank you, Mr. Goldstein."
