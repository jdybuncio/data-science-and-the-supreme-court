1997.96-1590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.169,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-1590, the Federal Election Commission v. James E. Akins."
1997.96-1590,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,40.578,42.514,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,174.931,186.426,"General Waxman, I... you're addressing the merits, and do you mind if I raise a preliminary question before we really wade into the merits of the major purpose test?"
1997.96-1590,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,186.426,187.207,"I'd be grateful, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.207,205.652,"Has the FEC changed its notion of who are members within the meaning of the statute so that the expenditures that were made here might be ones that were for publications that went to members, in which case the statute wouldn't be involved at all?"
1997.96-1590,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,205.652,218.367,"Justice O'Connor, a great deal has happened with respect to the membership issue and the law relating to who consti... what... who is or is not a member since the FEC made its decision in this case, and let me--"
1997.96-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.367,228.05,"Under the FEC's current interpretation and application of who's a member, would the mailings here have gone to members?"
1997.96-1590,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,228.05,258.209,"--The FEC has recently within the last 3 weeks issued a proposed... a notice of proposed regulation in which it has set out for public notice and comment an alternative set of definitions of membership, and what constitutes a member, and under one of the alternative definitions that the FEC is proposing, the AIPAC members, insofar as the record existed in this case at the time, would not qualify as members, but as--"
1997.96-1590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.209,261.38,"In that case the statute wouldn't be invoked at all, if that were--"
1997.96-1590,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,261.38,268.971,"--Well, no, what... I guess what I... what I meant to say is, the FEC has not yet settled on a firm definition of membership."
1997.96-1590,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,283.417,294.585,"--Well, in that case I thought that the... I thought that the Chamber of Commerce case intervened between the threejudge panel in this case and the en banc in this case, is that not--"
1997.96-1590,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,294.585,295.788,"--That is correct, and--"
1997.96-1590,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,295.788,314.765,"--So at the time you were arguing political committee at the en banc, the D.C. Circuit had already decided the membership question in the Chamber of Commerce case, and to me it was just a total mystery how come these two never met from the same court."
1997.96-1590,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,314.765,352.344,"--Well, I... I agree that it is, like many other things in this case, somewhat mysterious, but I think what the en banc court of appeals concluded, and I think correctly, is that for purposes of deciding this case, the FEC's determination was that the people that AIPAC considered members were not, in fact, members, and that the FEC is now in the process of determining... of fixing on a definition of membership which it has not yet done, but still takes the position that membership can be defined in a way to exclude all people who pay 50 dollars a year in dues to AIPAC."
1997.96-1590,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,352.344,357.232,But wasn't AIPAC itself always taking the position that it was a membership organization communicating with its members?
1997.96-1590,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,357.857,358.263,Oh--
1997.96-1590,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,358.263,359.513,--It was not in this litigation.
1997.96-1590,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,360.013,379.864,"--Absolutely AIPAC took that position, and in fact the joint... the general counsel's brief and report that are reprinted in the joint appendix devote a very substantial portion of time addressing AIPAC's contention that these papers... these people were just its members, and therefore these weren't expenditures or contributions in any regard."
1997.96-1590,1,21566,daniel_m_schember,,1656.145,1665.547,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1590,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1710.81,1728.428,"What about cases such as Heckler v. Chaney and Linda R. S., where we've said that citizens don't have... or perhaps someone more than... you don't ordinarily have standing to require that a person, an agency or a prosecutor commence a prosecution?"
1997.96-1590,1,21566,daniel_m_schember,,1728.428,1729.911,"--Well, Linda R. S. certainly is a standing case."
1997.96-1590,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3053.21,3097.411,"I'm hoping against hope I have more than 1 minute, but let me just say that the consequences of allowing... on the merits of allowing the court of appeals opinion to stand is that every group in this country, including my family, and any association, whether it's incorporated or not, is now... has to live under the very real chill of knowing that if they... in the course of a year, a group like the Catholic Conference of the United States, in the course of a year, makes more than a thousand dollars in either contributions, independent expenditures, coordinated expenditures, or inkind contributions, all of its other disbursements and receipts have to be disclosed and--"
1997.96-1590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3097.411,3100.003,"Well, can they set up a special segregated fund to do that?"
1997.96-1590,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3100.003,3118.121,"--Only corporations can set up segregated funds, so it... but for the fact that AIPAC happens to be incorporated it could not, but even if it could, that really doesn't get at the chilling effect that I think this Court was addressing in Buckley and Massachusetts Citizens for Life."
1997.96-1590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3118.121,3118.871,"Thank you, General Waxman."
1997.96-1590,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3118.871,3119.354,Thank you.
1997.96-1590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3119.354,3120.037,The case is submitted.
