1971.71-452,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,35.59,38.192,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1802.189,1805.177,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2103.859,2104.568,Mr. Ahern.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2104.568,2104.8,Excuse me.
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2104.8,2109.987,Do you recognize the fact that this school is governed by the Fourteenth Amendment?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2109.987,2116.443,"Yes, I do Justice Marshall."
1971.71-452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2116.824,2142.161,"Mr. Ahern, it was my understanding from Mr. Wulf’s argument that he conceives that a college is perfectly free to deny recognition to all political organizations and he says if you granted to one, you must granted to all but, I would think quite consistently what you’re saying a college if it didn’t want any of these, I think you could deny recognition to all political organization."
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2142.161,2151.02,"I think it could deny political campus recognition to all political organizations, I don’t think they can stop political organizations."
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2155.319,2178.813,"But the claim is general that unless there is campus recognitions, there can’t be a meeting any place on the campus or any such organization and appendix 16 and 17 seems to support that view, talking about the meeting of proposed meeting of November 6, 1969 in the Devils’ Den?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2178.813,2183.522,I think that notice has been misrepresented to the Court if it please Mr. Justice Stewart.
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2183.522,2196.232,Such meeting may not quite to take place in the Devils’ Den or the Students’ Center nor in or on any other property of the college since the CCSC-SDS is not a duly recognized college organization?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2196.232,2197.425,That’s correct Justice Stewart.
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2210.195,2210.568,Right.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2210.568,2217.979,That is all together different than a casual meeting of the group of students to discuss the President’s denial of recognition.
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2225.17,2226.48,"Well, now in their brief."
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2237.877,2238.83,As an organization?
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2238.83,2238.927,Yes.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2238.927,2239.243,That’s correct.
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2239.243,2240.811,"And you don’t deny that, do you?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2240.811,2241.467,"No, I don’t Your Honor."
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2241.467,2249.664,"So, to that extent at least First Amendment rights as they’re called are implicated, aren’t there?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2253.687,2254.133,"Well, they --"
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2254.133,2256.629,Anywhere on the property of the university or the college?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2256.629,2265.356,"I think, there’s a distinction Justice Stewart between the organization, meeting as an organization and individuals meeting together to have discussion, political or otherwise."
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2271.444,2276.675,"No, I'm -- I was just referring to that particular meeting as seeming to confirm the general statement."
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2286.412,2287.0,That is correct.
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2287.0,2287.878,On the campus of this --
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2287.878,2289.489,It has no status on the campus of --
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2289.489,2291.442,And cannot meet on the property?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2291.442,2294.026,"That’s correct, as an organization."
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2294.026,2298.463,"Mr. Ahern, can people meet in the chapel, it’s alright?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2298.463,2299.728,That’s correct.
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2299.728,2308.637,"But can people have meeting in the chapel as the students for no action, they could not meet unless they were approved?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2308.637,2310.202,You mean a no action organization?
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2311.634,2314.724,"The same group, they could not meet?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2314.838,2316.099,That’s correct.
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2337.309,2341.205,"Well, the students with no action is like – don’t like to meet prior."
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2343.307,2345.675,"Well then, they should seek official campus recognition."
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.675,2348.494,And if it is denied they can’t meet?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2348.494,2360.116,"If it’s denied on the basis that the -- they are affiliated with the national organization that advocates violence and disruption, I think that is a legitimate prohibition."
1971.71-452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2360.116,2360.601,Mr. Ahern --
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2360.601,2373.067,"Regarding the fact that all of them are members, are sons and daughters of the most respectful people in the world just because the name is a name that school doesn’t like?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2373.067,2375.299,I don’t think it’s a question of the school of not liking it.
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.021,2385.348,"If you don’t see any First Amendment problem in the right to associate together, do you?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2385.348,2386.641,"As an organization, no."
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2390.082,2396.799,"So that when you decided whether or not it is an organization, then that takes it out of the First Amendment?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2396.799,2403.908,"Well, I question whether or not the SDS national organization is basically a political organization."
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2403.908,2408.837,But is the -- they in this case?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2408.837,2409.22,Pardon me?
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2409.22,2410.57,The national organization in this case?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2410.57,2412.393,"They are not a party to this case, no."
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2412.393,2414.92,Is there anything in the record about it?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2414.92,2415.936,There is something in the record concerning national SDS.
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2415.936,2419.972,"One said, which said they want to be affiliated with that and that’s all."
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2419.972,2420.83,That’s correct Mr. Justice.
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2420.83,2422.822,And that’s enough?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2422.822,2424.518,"Certainly, that opens up the area of --"
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2424.518,2425.766,"No, no, no."
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2430.321,2431.094,I do not follow you.
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2431.459,2434.067,Do you have any other reason not to recognize this group?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2434.067,2434.702,Yes.
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2434.702,2435.483,What’s the other reason?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2435.483,2442.966,Because the petitioners have never divulged the purposes and aims of the national which they adopt.
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2443.304,2446.668,"Well, if they divulge a name, the purposes of their organization?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2446.668,2448.426,That’s correct.
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2448.426,2450.397,And that’s what you’re dealing with?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2450.397,2460.871,"That’s what we’re dealing with, but the purposes and aims as they set forth in their statement of purpose have a different perspective when they affiliate themselves with the national organization."
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2460.871,2463.328,So you really keep the national organization out?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2463.328,2467.086,"No, we’re keeping a local chapter of the national organization out."
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2474.6,2477.056,Supposed they don’t know.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2477.056,2482.152,Well then how can they organize a group if they don’t know what their aims and purposes of the?
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2482.152,2485.404,Do you listen to the future or you are looking to the present?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2485.404,2487.572,We are looking to the present.
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.572,2490.398,Didn’t they tell you what their organization was?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2490.398,2493.648,They told us that they were a local chapter of the national SDS.
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2493.648,2495.766,That’s right.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2495.766,2498.479,So that I think the President of the college unreasonably --
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2498.479,2506.481,They were denied their right to meet together as a local chapter of SDS?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2506.481,2507.266,I didn’t follow that Justice Marshall.
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2507.266,2512.61,They were denied the right to meet together.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2512.61,2515.618,"As a local chapter of the SDS, that is correct on the campus."
1971.71-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2515.618,2517.022,And you don’t see any First Amendment violation?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2517.022,2518.719,"No, I do not."
1971.71-452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2518.719,2519.712,Mr. Ahern?.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2519.712,2520.139,Yes?
1971.71-452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2520.139,2536.113,"Supposing these petitioners after they have been turned down went to the rooms of one of them say in university housing and wanted to discuss it, would they have faced any disciplinary sanction for doing that?"
1971.71-452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.113,2538.741,"No, they would not Justice Rehnquist."
1971.71-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2559.594,2570.75,"Mr. Ahern, I am looking at pages 94 and 95 that we were discussing after Mr. Wulf focused some action on them."
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2570.75,2571.088,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2571.088,2575.693,You’ll have to watch that microphone that’s very sensitive.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2586.129,2590.748,There were two meetings of the – you’re talking now of the Student Affairs Committee.
1971.71-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2590.748,2591.955,"Student committee, yes."
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2591.955,2593.121,There were two meetings.
1971.71-452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2647.645,2660.246,Was there any further inquiry about whether they would or would not follow a policy of disruption or violence?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2660.246,2661.266,There was a --
1971.71-452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.266,2665.372,"This passage on 95, the only thing in the record about."
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2665.372,2665.652,No.
1971.71-452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.969,2682.3,And made no other statements?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2682.3,2686.539,Made no other statement and did not object to their introduction at that time as I understand the record.
1971.71-452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.539,2694.006,"So the record -- as the record stands this is the organization as a response to those inquiries, final response to those inquiries?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2694.006,2700.09,That is correct Justice White.
1971.71-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2797.406,2829.562,"On that score this is connection with the national movement, I noticed on page 90 and before and after 90, are these exhibits, committee exhibit number 1, etcetera which quotes “Leader of the SDS are saying we will have to destroy at times even violently in order to end the establishment power and we are going to build a guerilla force and we are engaging in sedition.”"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2842.313,2844.893,"These documents were introduced, no."
1971.71-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2868.894,2876.233,And this was part of the basis of the District Judges decision as distinguished from faculty or the school?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2876.233,2891.16,"These -- initially, when this matter was heard by the District Judge, the Judge raised the ambiguity which appeared on the face of the application, and sent the matter back for an administrative hearing to clear up the ambiguity."
1971.71-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2897.361,2900.865,Well then the applicants had an opportunity to meet it and explain it?1
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2900.865,2902.34,The applicants?
1971.71-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2912.044,2935.281,"And how close in point of time was that to the colloquy that appears on appendix 95 in which some student, one of the petitioners apparently said that they would not know whether they would use violence or not."
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2935.281,2943.503,I think the student affairs committee meeting was on October of 1969 and the Court structured administrative hearing took place the following May.
1971.71-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3092.725,3097.308,That might be a little more convenient if you of course give a copy to Mr. Wulf.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3097.308,3105.246,"A copy was given to Mr. Wulf at the time the single appendix was printed, Your Honor, Chief Justice."
1971.71-452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.246,3121.587,"What would you say that if an organization is asked, what is your policy about disruption and the organization says, none of your business, that it could be denied recognition?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3121.587,3125.925,"Justice White, I don’t think a college president is required to buy picking a paw?"
1971.71-452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3126.161,3129.036,"Yes, so your answer is yes, they could be denied recognition?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3129.036,3138.188,"If they don’t simply state to the administrator just about their aims and purposes are, and if they are affiliated with an organization --"
1971.71-452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3138.188,3151.671,"Let us assume there is nothing about affiliation, they just end the question is do you anticipate that you would use a violence and disrupt classes and the answer is none of your business?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3151.671,3154.158,I think they can be denied campus recognition.
1971.71-452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3154.158,3156.075,Do you think this record is equivalent to that?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3156.075,3167.81,"Yes, I do Justice White."
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3383.215,3384.494,General Ahern.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3384.494,3385.011,Excuse me.
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3385.011,3396.204,Do you think the same standard should apply to a college university that applies to a public high school?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3400.335,3405.412,"Well, in view of the fact that the Tinker case decided by this Court reached down I think one of the Tinker boys is eight years old."
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3405.412,3408.062,Below the college level.
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3408.062,3409.618,Down to a primary grade.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3409.618,3409.943,Right.
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3431.88,3474.49,"And do you think in considering the requirements of the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, there should be a difference in a college or university which has sort of a captive population which is of somewhere in the country with and where all the students leave on the campus on one hand, a distinction could and should be made between that kind of institution and an institution where the students are only at the university for classes and go home and have plenty of places and time available off campus for whatever association or speech rights they want to indulged in?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3474.49,3476.704,I don’t think that would be a basis for distinction.
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3481.271,3485.351,"Well, and the distinction would be on campus or off campus regardless of --"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3485.351,3485.793,Off --
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3485.793,3491.589,Regardless even if you had a situation where if they wanted to organize at all.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3495.491,3498.475,"Well, the school administrators have no control of the students off the campus."
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3498.475,3516.724,"Yes, but they are campuses which as I say, it was sort of captive population where everybody lives on campus and where there -- at by contrast with the place like I gather this college may be in New Britain, Connecticut where many of the students live at home or at least off campus, is that correct?"
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3516.724,3518.086,That is correct Justice Stewart.
1971.71-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3518.086,3524.564,You think that you are not suggesting that there should be any flexibility at all?
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3524.564,3527.182,"Oh, when you say there, I am not suggesting any flexibility."
1971.71-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3569.102,3596.738,"This position of the state that you’ve suggested, would that interfere with the right of the individuals that are before the Court and any in their friends to past out belief that saying this evening at eight or tomorrow evening at eight, we will meet down at Morris place, in the basement off campus."
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3596.738,3599.367,I don’t see how we could stop it.
1971.71-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3600.265,3603.378,I am not sure where the Morris place is on or off the campus at the moment.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3603.378,3605.716,"At this point, it’s off campus."
1971.71-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3607.29,3611.099,I see.
1971.71-452,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3611.099,3611.792,Thank you.
1971.71-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3611.792,3613.88,"Mr. Wulf, you have just one minute left."
1971.71-452,2,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,3613.88,3622.835,I would just like to close by saying that Mr. Ahern’s arguments confirms are fundamental claim that the respondent is not arguing this case.
1971.71-452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3625.306,3640.147,"Mr. Wulf, assume that your organization when asked about their policies including the policies with respect to whether they would engage in violence or disruption said none of your business?"
1971.71-452,2,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,3640.147,3642.776,I do not think that make any difference Mr. Justice White.
1971.71-452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3643.189,3648.968,"Well, as I understood, you thought that the -- awhile ago that the secret society could be force to state its purposes?"
1971.71-452,2,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,3648.968,3656.546,I think that they have a minimal responsibility to describe what the purpose of their -- what purpose of the organization is.
1971.71-452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3656.546,3660.968,"Is it your purpose to engage in violent disruption, none of your business."
1971.71-452,2,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,3660.968,3672.996,"If they have made a prima facie showing on their application that they intent to engage in protected political activity, they cannot add be ask that question if they don’t volunteer it."
1971.71-452,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3690.957,3712.983,"Mr. Wulf, in relation to what Mr. Justice White has put to you at pages 95, I think it was in the appendix would appear to be an answer, none of your business, uttered in a more circumspect way, would you agree with that?"
1971.71-452,2,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,3712.983,3725.248,"No, I think that that was very short hand way of expressing a philosophical view that rejects non-violence."
1971.71-452,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3768.576,3770.107,"Very well, Mr. Wulf, thank you."
