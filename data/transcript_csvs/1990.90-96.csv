1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.967,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-96, Frederick A. Siegert v. H. Melvyn Gilley."
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,9.186,15.521,"Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,105.48,108.602,I guess all that's not true if you're a public figure however?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,108.602,124.233,"I think that if Frederick Siegert were a public figure, he would be able to bring a claim of this sort, because actual malice would be shown."
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.585,199.674,"Ms. Kraut, the first question presented in your petition for certiorari is the extent of discovery which you should be allowed where there's a defensive qualified immunity."
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,202.886,204.727,"Well, we think it does, Your Honor."
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,282.487,285.78,You will eventually get to the question presented then?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,285.78,286.669,"I will, Your Honor."
1990.90-96,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,381.78,383.613,Where is Dr. Siegert now?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,383.613,399.433,"Your Honor, he... it's not in the record, but if the Court wants it off the record, Dr. Siegert is employed in a private HMO plan... sort of a... I don't know exactly what they are... but it's an HMO private institution."
1990.90-96,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,403.086,405.667,Is he engaged in clinical psychology at all?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,405.667,408.098,--He is engaged in clinical psychology.
1990.90-96,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,437.149,439.681,"Well, that happened to me when I cub in an office."
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,440.169,448.917,"Well, I think that... my sympathy, Your Honor."
1990.90-96,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,507.685,526.076,"May I ask right at this point, on the question whether there was a clearly established claim before, as I remember the Government's position is that the procedural due process claim was clearly established, but that the record indicates he did have a fair opportunity for a name-clearing hearing, which is all the Constitution guarantees."
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,527.848,532.711,"Your Honor, this is not a procedural case, and there is no process that can clear his name."
1990.90-96,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,533.532,539.875,"And it is clear that... is it clear that if it's not a procedural case, that there was a clearly established nonprocedural right?"
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,542.326,547.029,"--Well, Hearn, Your Honor, I think Hearn v. the City of Gainesville, which I cited."
1990.90-96,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,555.344,557.267,"Well, Paul against Davis is procedural."
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,557.267,567.926,"--Well, it is, Your Honor, but in terms of substantive, I think that if I could use Justice Souter's case in New Hampshire that he decided in 1988, Richardson--"
1990.90-96,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,567.926,568.947,I'm not sure you'd better do that.
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,569.346,571.319,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1990.90-96,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,571.319,573.279,Because that was a procedural due process case.
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,573.279,599.676,"--Your Honor, I... that's true, but in Richardson... in the Richardson case, Your Honor did refer to the fact that that case could have been a substantive due process claim and referred specifically to Meyer v. Nebraska and to Schware as establishing that substantive due process... that substantive due process claim."
1990.90-96,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,600.176,603.048,I'd better go back and give that one a second thought.
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,603.048,603.779,"--I have it right here, Your Honor."
1990.90-96,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,684.362,697.3,"But isn't... isn't the point though that those cases, just as you just said, identify the interest which is subject to protection, but they don't define the manner in which the interest will be protected."
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,723.388,743.33,"--Your Honor, I think that I... what... what I think has to be looked at here is... first of all, Richards... Anderson states, I think quite explicitly, that the precise character of the right does not have to be set forth in precision."
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,794.843,801.819,"Ms. Kraut, you have spent half of your oral argument now on a question which you say is subsumed."
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,911.401,912.081,"Yes, I am, Your Honor."
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.878,938.339,Is that consistent with what the district court did here?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,938.339,956.08,"--This rule is... we think what the district court did was to take all of our allegations, which I began to read but haven't finished... all of those allegations he applied... Judge Sporkin applied the heightened pleading standard, not this standard."
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,990.655,992.825,And so he would have allowed some discovery?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,992.825,1019.944,"He allowed... and what he ordered in fact was discovery on two issues, and I think it's at page 52 or 54a of the appendix... he specifically ordered limited discovery on the issues of falseness and malice when he ordered the depositions of Siegert, of Gilley, and of Colonel Smith."
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1033.141,1035.654,"And under your standard, he should have ordered more?"
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1035.654,1036.223,"No, that--"
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.223,1040.016,"No, that was all... that... what he did conformed to your standard?"
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1040.016,1045.44,--What he did conformed to the present standard that now exists to this heightened pleading standard.
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1045.44,1047.971,"Yes, but my question was under your standard, the one you're proposing?"
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1047.971,1050.425,"Well, absolutely, if it... if it conformed to their--"
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1050.425,1050.782,Absolutely what?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1050.782,1054.886,--Absolutely it conformed to our standard if it conformed to a higher standard.
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1056.038,1065.222,So what you're saying is that he went... he went part of the way that your standard would have required him to go but not as far?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1065.222,1065.633,--No.
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1134.479,1148.937,"I still don't understand your answer to my question, which was whether the district court's order in this case went as far as one... as a district court would go applying the standard you're proposing to this Court?"
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1148.937,1157.122,"He went further, because... he went further in terms of the findings that he made."
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1183.199,1186.44,And does that... does that comport with the rule you're proposing?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1186.44,1188.414,This rule I--
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1188.414,1189.953,Can you answer that yes or no?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1189.953,1200.371,"--Uh, no, it is a lesser... less rigorous standard, and it is less rigorous, Your Honor, because it is a pre-discovery standard."
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1200.371,1205.585,So the district judge's standard applied here was less rigorous than the one you would apply?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1205.585,1214.33,"The district judge's standard that was applied, that was actually applied in this case was more rigorous than the one that I am suggesting, Your Honor."
1990.90-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.17,1218.953,What... what did the court of appeals do with that?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1226.809,1227.73,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1245.833,1246.373,And what--
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1246.373,1251.606,"And therefore, they found that we had not met the heightened pleading standard and we were basically out of court."
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1280.595,1287.039,"--But they're not... they're not... in summary judgment cases, they're not supposed to be resolving any questions of fact."
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1287.039,1294.164,But they... what they do need to do is make some determinations as to whether or not a suit is frivolous.
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1309.695,1314.09,So you say there is a judgment factor there even though they're not making factual findings?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1314.09,1317.031,"Yes, Your Honor, there has to be a judgment factor."
1990.90-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.031,1336.993,"How do you... how do you ever stop a suit from proceeding beyond the summary judgment stage if there is an intent element, and if we follow your rule that there's no heightened pleading standard, that all the... that all the plaintiff has to come in and say is, this was done with malice."
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1336.993,1337.604,"No, Your Honor."
1990.90-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1355.797,1360.329,So you agree with the D.C. Circuit's standard?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1360.329,1368.324,We don't think that the... that this rule is a heightened pleading standard in the same way that the D.C. Circuit's rule is.
1990.90-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.324,1369.205,It's a lower heightened pleading.
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1369.205,1370.297,It's a lower heightened pleading.
1990.90-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.037,1375.939,But I thought your objection in principle is to a heightened pleading standard?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1376.339,1377.048,--Your Honor--
1990.90-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.048,1381.392,"--once, once you abandon what the rules says, it seems to me why should I prefer yours to theirs?"
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1381.392,1398.454,"--Your Honor, because... because the D.C. Circuit's rule calls for what they call direct evidence as well as... which we think has absolutely no merit at all, as the Government agrees."
1990.90-96,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1451.498,1460.283,"So the Federal rules of civil procedure are inapplicable, or not inapplicable, but there's a stricter standard than is required in Rule 9(b)?"
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1460.283,1471.531,"I think that, given the qualified immunity policy considerations, Your Honor, I think that after a complaint is filed... and I'm not... I think--"
1990.90-96,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1471.531,1472.382,Is the answer yes?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1472.382,1481.819,"--The answer is yes, after a complaint has been filed and where unlawful... and where lawful conduct has been alleged."
1990.90-96,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1482.83,1487.322,"Well, I suppose it's always after a complaint is filed that we judge whether or not it's sufficient."
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1487.322,1506.174,"--Well, that's true, Your Honor, although I've certainly read cases that get thrown out at the complaint stage because allegations... for example, I remember one case that dealt with deliberate indifference in the medical field for prisoners where the plaintiff was given two or three bites of the apple and said--"
1990.90-96,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1506.174,1508.466,So you don't rely on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)?
1990.90-96,0,37167,nina_kraut,,1508.466,1520.755,--Only for complaints which come in... where there is unlawful conduct alleged... already unlawful conduct alleged and malice is a part of that.
1990.90-96,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1535.453,1536.963,"Very well, Ms. Kraut."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1540.206,1547.322,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-96,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.436,1613.627,"You say this is a pleading requirement, Mr. Lazerwitz?"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1613.627,1617.76,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in strict terms it really isn't."
1990.90-96,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1677.159,1680.359,And you don't take the position that it has to be in the complaint?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1680.359,1681.04,"--No, I--"
1990.90-96,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1681.04,1684.753,It can be dealt with as a summary judgment motion?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1684.753,1685.594,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-96,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1687.665,1689.385,With affidavits and so forth?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1689.385,1703.926,"--Yes, if the plaintiff has this information, it would be... it probably would behoove the plaintiff to put it in the complaint, but the plaintiff doesn't have to, because as this Court held in Gomez, the qualified immunity of defense is an affirmative defense that has to be pleaded by the defendant."
1990.90-96,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1703.926,1706.238,So how do you see a case like this evolving?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1715.234,1720.817,This is... this is actually a fairly representative case and... except for the colloquy before about the claim.
1990.90-96,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1754.878,1760.332,This is the way you get around the last sentence of Rule 9(b).
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1770.46,1780.985,The complaint that the plaintiff alleges it follows Rule 9(b) and alleges malice... avers malice generally.
1990.90-96,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1791.343,1794.325,"Well, you're really nullifying that last sentence then, aren't you?"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1794.325,1801.348,"--No, we're not, Justice Blackmun, and this... the problem is in a sense created by Bivens and Harlow."
1990.90-96,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1839.485,1853.545,"Well, Mr. Lazerwitz, do you take the position that in some circumstances, some limited discovery can be had by the plaintiff to deal with this question of malice?"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1853.545,1862.509,"Oh, yes, there's... there's... I believe the petitioner is overstating or misstating both our position and the position of the court of appeals."
1990.90-96,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1872.926,1879.73,"Well, here in this case, the district court said the plaintiff could depose the defendant."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1885.524,1887.384,Not at least... not on the showing the plaintiff made.
1990.90-96,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1943.891,1952.407,"Well, you don't agree, do you, with the CADC's holding that there has to be direct evidence of malice?"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1952.407,1962.174,"As we stated in our brief, we do not read the court of appeals' judgment or opinion as requiring direct evidence as we understand it."
1990.90-96,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1962.174,1966.058,"Well, if we read it that way, is that something you agree with or not?"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1966.058,1969.09,"If the Court were to read it that way, no, we do not."
1990.90-96,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1984.129,1987.361,Was there a motion for summary judgment made in this case?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1987.361,1992.164,"Yes, Your Honor, we... the defendant moved for summary judgment and/or dismissal."
1990.90-96,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1992.164,2001.18,It seems to me you're on much stronger ground with a motion for summary judgment with respect to Rule 9(b) than you are... a motion to dismiss.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2018.291,2034.43,"Well, this particular case, technically speaking, the Court doesn't have to reach the motion to dismiss at this stage, because given the way this case was handled by the lower courts and given the submissions that petitioner presented, it is a summary judgment case."
1990.90-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.741,2037.535,Except that then you come up with another problem in the rules.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2044.628,2044.978,--Right.
1990.90-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.659,2048.451,So you're sort of... you have a... one leg in each of two boats--
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2048.451,2049.241,--Right.
1990.90-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.241,2050.222,--and they're going in different directions.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2050.222,2073.255,"And our... but our position is that given the substantive defense of qualified immunity that our... that the approach adopted by the lower courts and that we are urging the Court to accept is perfectly consistent, whether it's under Rule 12 or under Rule 56, because of the problem that the lower courts have identified as a result of the intersection between Bivens actions and Harlow."
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2106.438,2110.672,May I ask you... perhaps I'm missing something fairly fundamental here.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2139.721,2144.534,"Well, the other claims the Court is... has before it, the Eighth Amendment case."
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.965,2149.755,"Well, where you've got the riot situation in prison."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2149.755,2150.146,--Right.
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2150.146,2150.806,That would be the one.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2150.806,2156.701,The other... the most common I think would be the First Amendment context... the whistleblower type.
1990.90-96,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2156.701,2160.474,"Well, what about a deliberate indifference allegation?"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2160.474,2160.754,"Yes, or--"
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2160.754,2162.946,"Well, that doesn't require malice, so that's less than malice."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2162.946,2164.696,"--Well, it's... it's not just malice."
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2170.28,2172.363,Any kind of subjective motivation.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2172.363,2178.516,So the most... I guess the one that comes to mind most quickly is equal... equal protection case.
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2178.516,2188.871,"And in any case like say a prison riot case, the prisoner who claims that there, you know, that there was this extreme subjective motivation, it would have to have direct evidence of the--"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2188.871,2190.103,"Well, again we don't--"
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2190.103,2193.155,"--Not direct, but hearsay or direct evidence."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2193.155,2206.403,"--The way the lower courts have treated this and the way we urge the Court to look at this, the one thing you can't do is walk into court and say, he acted... he had malice intent."
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.067,2294.27,I don't see why the case would be different if he could prove... he had the actual records that he gave everybody else an A rating and he gave this fellow an F.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2297.562,2305.48,"--Well, I think in this particular case it's even more acute because the... in the recommendation context, it's hard to say that a recommendation is false."
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2330.475,2340.783,"xxx you say malice was part of the cause of action, what was... the cause of action was libel?"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2340.783,2357.271,"Well, just to clarify our position, this case comes to the Court under the assumption that the cause of action was a defamation... a libel plus stigma in violation of the due process clause."
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2358.743,2359.913,So what does malice got to do with it?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2359.913,2365.918,"--Well, there cannot be a cause of action without malice."
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.009,2368.789,"Well, what are you talking about malice... ill will or what?"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2368.789,2371.481,"--Well, I think in this context it's knowing that it's false."
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2372.242,2374.034,So you're really talking about--
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2374.034,2381.098,"--It is a... it's a defamation-plus type case, but again, I'd like to just make sure the Court is clear on our position."
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.318,2417.983,"--Well, then you're saying... you're saying there just wasn't even a clearly established right."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2417.983,2421.155,"--That... that's right, Justice White, and on the due process component--"
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.155,2436.423,"And level... and even if there was, you say that you're entitled to qualified immunity if a reasonable officer would believe that he was not violating this clearly established right."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2436.423,2436.944,--Right.
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.114,2443.659,The kind of malice you're talking about is knowledge of falsity?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2447.532,2449.473,"--Well, as we... it's not--"
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2449.473,2450.773,Or is just ill will?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2450.773,2461.571,"--I believe in this context it's got to be... although as I read petitioner, it might be ill will, but it makes more sense to me to think of... he knew it was false but he lied."
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2478.48,2487.667,"Well, why didn't you win... did you lose on your claim or did you make the claim that this complaint didn't state the cause of action?"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2487.667,2488.218,We... we--
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.218,2490.169,Did you lose on that or--
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2490.169,2491.311,--The district judge--
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.311,2491.741,--Mainly--
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2491.741,2493.641,--The district court--
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2493.641,2499.285,"--You should have... you should have... if there wasn't such a right... isn't any such right, you should have won on the--"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2499.285,2500.117,--We should have won.
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.546,2503.987,--You lost on that?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2503.987,2509.961,The district judge denied those claims and instead ordered this limited discovery.
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2513.503,2515.526,Did you claim in the court of appeals there was no such right?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2515.526,2516.205,Yes.
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.205,2517.787,And you lost on that?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2517.787,2522.109,The court of appeals ruled that it... the court of appeals was of the position--
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.109,2525.412,The case would have been over if you'd won on it.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2525.412,2531.325,"--Yes, the court of appeals thought that it didn't have jurisdiction to reach the merits, and we disagree with that."
1990.90-96,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2535.86,2539.43,"Well, but the questions we granted certiorari on did not deal with the merits."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2539.43,2539.701,--Right.
1990.90-96,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2607.514,2610.807,Getting back for a moment to the allegations of the complaint.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2623.827,2626.558,"No, Justice Kennedy, not at all."
1990.90-96,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2626.558,2629.831,So it is well grounded in fact and yet it can't proceed?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2629.831,2634.832,"Well, it may be well grounded in facts, but the facts aren't presented to the court."
1990.90-96,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2639.356,2646.371,"Well, if under your theory, she can't even, even proceed, then why can't you say that it's not well grounded in fact?"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2646.371,2648.461,--Because it very well might be.
1990.90-96,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2652.104,2655.087,"Well, your... your position is that at this point it must be dismissed."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2655.087,2660.131,"--Yes, because that's the essence of an immunity defense, that there aren't going to be cases."
1990.90-96,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2669.155,2680.892,"Well, if it were dismissed and there were subsequently motions by the defendant for Rule 11 sanctions, would discovery then be allowed that you say wouldn't be allowed on the merits?"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2680.892,2691.851,"--That's a whole different ball game, but I... again the difference is, and what shouldn't be lost on the Court, is the qualified immunity defense."
1990.90-96,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2712.154,2714.986,"Mr. Lazerwitz, may I go back just to clarify something."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2746.916,2747.517,Yes.
1990.90-96,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2747.517,2748.138,All right.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2769.841,2771.112,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-96,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2771.112,2772.254,Okay.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2772.254,2784.793,"It's... again, we concede it's a little bit funny in the sense that when you talk of pleadings, but the way the qualified immunity defense has to work, if you're going to have suits like this, is the way the lower courts have handled it."
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2817.865,2820.005,May I ask you another question?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2846.062,2853.278,--Under our... under our position I think your hypothetical is somewhat implausible.
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2853.876,2854.687,Why is it implausible?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2863.513,2873.991,"--I think to be perfectly candid with you, Justice Stevens, that the... an immunity defense is a defense to the Federal cause of action, and he's... and the defendant in those circumstances is entitled--"
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.991,2880.505,Even though the record after... after the issue is raised develops sufficient factual material to show--
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2880.505,2880.855,--Sure.
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2880.855,2881.406,--that if the defense should fail?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2881.406,2884.047,"Sure, but that's a by-product of an immunity."
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2887.02,2888.172,"No, no, no."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2894.406,2895.287,"--No, we... again--"
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2895.287,2896.657,You'd still say you can't look at those facts?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2896.657,2897.007,--Right.
1990.90-96,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2903.511,2915.62,"No, but it doesn't... in Justice Steven's hypo, it seems to me that it doesn't mean anything, because the reason for the immunity at the stage we're talking about is to prevent the litigation, not merely recovery, but to prevent litigation."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2932.43,2934.071,"Well, there... I mean, two responses."
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2975.678,2981.841,"Mr. Lazerwitz, I have to take issue with your statement that on a hypothetical I give you the defendant has a right not to be sued."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3003.427,3018.277,"--Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, I... we take the position that it means a little bit more, that that is in essence what the immunity is all about, that you have the right... you have the defense not to be in court."
1990.90-96,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3049.596,3051.679,"Of course, if they'd taken a deposition right away, it probably would have been."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3051.679,3053.28,"Yes, but again--"
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3097.488,3111.156,"Well, if, if the malice you're talking about is what you said before, namely knowledge of falsity, is the... must the plaintiff be stuck with... if you're making a motion for summary judgment supported by an affidavit."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3119.802,3126.436,"Well, the plaintiff then has to present some facts that would tend to call into question that assertion."
1990.90-96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.518,3128.379,Without any discovery?
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3128.379,3141.637,"--If the plaintiff can't do that, then the plaintiff has to file a Rule 56(f) affidavit, which wasn't filed in this case, and show the court why types of facts the plaintiff intends to get that would tend to undercut the immunity."
1990.90-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3146.228,3150.883,So that's really all you're arguing for.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3154.285,3156.175,Not much.
1990.90-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3156.175,3160.019,"And that's the only thing wrong with this case, that it didn't get to the 56(f) stage?"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3160.019,3164.841,"Well, we took the case to the court of appeals to fight that discovery."
1990.90-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3164.841,3165.342,Gee.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3165.342,3166.754,"But no, we are asking in the question--"
1990.90-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3166.754,3169.055,"We're not arguing about a whole lot then, really, here are we?"
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3169.055,3169.974,--In--
1990.90-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3169.974,3175.079,"All this plaintiff had to do was to come in and say, hey, how can I possibly prove malice unless I get some discovery."
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3175.079,3176.228,--But that--
1990.90-96,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3176.228,3177.41,I think... that's the mistake here.
1990.90-96,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3184.245,3186.308,"--No, that's what petitioner seems to say this morning."
1990.90-96,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3210.612,3211.874,"Thank you, Mr. Lazerwitz."
1990.90-96,2,37167,nina_kraut,,3215.296,3216.586,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.90-96,2,37167,nina_kraut,,3227.125,3228.743,xxx he's right about that.
1990.90-96,2,37167,nina_kraut,,3228.743,3229.444,"--All right, Your Honor."
1990.90-96,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3301.604,3306.215,"Of course, if you're right on that contention, the mere writing of the letter is enough to prove malice."
1990.90-96,2,37167,nina_kraut,,3306.215,3307.577,--Absolutely.
1990.90-96,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3319.215,3324.637,Did you argue to the district court that this is sufficient to prove malice because job performance has this limited reading?
1990.90-96,2,37167,nina_kraut,,3324.637,3336.416,"--Your Honor, I think that in our material facts in issue we stated that Gilley was a nonpolicy-making supervisor."
1990.90-96,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3344.631,3346.531,What kind of malice are you talking about?
1990.90-96,2,37167,nina_kraut,,3346.531,3352.266,"We're talking about knowledge of falsity, deliberate... false... the knowledge that the information--"
1990.90-96,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3352.266,3355.316,"What does the court of appeals' talking about when it said ""unconstitutional motive""?"
1990.90-96,2,37167,nina_kraut,,3355.316,3359.61,"--I think they're talking about the same thing, Your Honor, and if you look at White--"
1990.90-96,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3359.61,3360.391,Well--
1990.90-96,2,37167,nina_kraut,,3360.391,3372.95,"--If you look at White v. Nicholls, a case that we cited in our reply brief at page 5, there's a very interesting discussion there about what constitutes motive, what kind of information must be presented to show malice."
1990.90-96,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3378.952,3385.397,"--Why... why does... why does knowledge that job performance has this technical meaning, why does that prove malice?"
1990.90-96,2,37167,nina_kraut,,3385.397,3386.428,Because--
1990.90-96,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3386.428,3393.871,"I mean, why... I thought... I know it has its technical meaning, but this guy is really bad and I really think he's really bad, and in addition to this job performance information, they ought to know that."
1990.90-96,2,37167,nina_kraut,,3396.733,3398.235,"--Well, because if you look... you can't just look at one thing."
1990.90-96,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3418.038,3421.906,"I think you've sufficiently answered the question, Ms. Kraut."
