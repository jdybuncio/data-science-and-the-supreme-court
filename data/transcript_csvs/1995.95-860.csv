1995.95-860,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.587,"We'll hear argument next in number 95-860, Barbara Smiley v. the CitiBank of South Dakota."
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,20.295,30.931,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-860,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,124.252,138.253,"Well, Mr. Donovan, if... if the term ""interest"" is open to some interpretation, there either is or is going to be, I gather, a comptroller's interpretation of the term."
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,138.253,141.605,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-860,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.605,147.548,"Do we owe any deference to that, where it will expressly include late fees?"
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,147.548,161.137,"The question of deference to the comptroller ought to be looked at initially by looking at the Statute itself, to determine whether the Statute itself addresses that, so as to whether there should be any need to turn to the comptroller."
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.43,231.292,"That's still done now, isn't it?"
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,232.624,233.114,--No.
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,259.302,266.454,"Well, that... that shows that it does include that kind of interest, the... the normal kind, but it doesn't show that it excludes the other kind."
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,296.755,303.691,"Well, taking your question, Justice Scalia, as, Why... why would Congress do something like this?"
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.669,321.8,So any bank could charge 10 bucks a week on the outstanding balance?
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,321.8,324.023,"Well, Congress--"
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.023,331.187,"Not... not matter what the outstanding balance was, you pay $10 a week to the bank; they could do that under this provision?"
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,331.187,335.04,"--That... Your Honor, that would be, under our view of ""interest"", an interest charge."
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.973,340.073,"Well, it's not based on--"
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,340.073,340.784,It would be a time-based charge.
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.207,346.086,--You have to do both; didn't you say you have to do--
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,346.086,346.506,"--You would have to do both, yes."
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,346.506,347.888,--So it wouldn't be covered by your provision?
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,347.888,348.269,No.
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.649,350.66,It doesn't make sense to me.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,350.66,360.846,"How... however, a State could not authorize that type of charge if it just was across the board, if the $10 did not vary based upon the outstanding balance at all."
1995.95-860,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,372.464,394.298,"Mr. Donovan, suppose that CitiBank, instead of having a flat $15 a month late payment said the late payment is 1 percent on arrears, but not less than $15; would that then qualify as an interest rate?"
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,394.298,400.273,The... let me see if I understand the... Your Honor's question.
1995.95-860,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,400.273,410.729,"Instead of the $15 a month... you're in arrears, the $15 a month no matter what the balance is... instead, the provision is 1 percent, but not less than 15."
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,414.101,424.029,"If the 1 percent, Your Honor, were calculated on the amount of the late payment, not on the entire outstanding balance of the revolving account."
1995.95-860,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.582,429.912,It would.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,441.119,442.231,--The 15 would be the ceiling?
1995.95-860,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,442.231,445.473,"Not less than, the floor."
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,446.742,447.063,The floor.
1995.95-860,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,492.383,498.237,"Given your answer to Justice Ginsburg, why don't you try... why don't you challenge the 50-cent charge in this case?"
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,498.237,503.821,In terms of the cash advance fee or the minimum finance charge that is involved here?
1995.95-860,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,503.821,505.541,"I... I think it's the minimum finance charge, isn't it."
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,509.764,512.385,That... that is CitiBank's practice.
1995.95-860,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,515.798,523.251,"But that... if you're correct, that... that is forbidden, too, or that is not covered by the... by the Statute?"
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,523.251,539.835,The... the 50-cent charge that is the minimum finance charge for when a borrower chooses to revolve is... would be a charge that would not fit our definition of interest rate.
1995.95-860,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,539.835,542.035,Just like the $15 in Justice Ginsburg's example?
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,543.976,544.337,It--
1995.95-860,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,544.337,551.081,And it's... it's a floor without reference to... to a particular amount over a particular time.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,551.081,551.542,--Yes.
1995.95-860,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,551.542,555.002,"So it would be outside the Statute, just as the $15 would be, isn't that right?"
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,555.002,577.398,"The difference, Justice Souter, would be that the $15 charge, if it is imposed looking backward, based upon a default, as opposed to looking forward, which is... which is what the 50-cent charge is... the 50-cent charge is a charge that when you do not clean up your revolver at the end of the month, the minimum that you're going to have is... is 50 cents."
1995.95-860,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,577.398,578.269,Yes.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,578.269,588.775,"And that's a going-forward charge, because it's anticipated that for each day that you revolve that balance, that you will then be accruing a finance charge at the 19.8 percent interest rate."
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.029,594.589,Maybe California didn't prohibit that.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,596.181,599.921,"At the time, we focused on the late fee here, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,605.666,610.38,May I ask you a... a slightly changed version of Justice Ginsburg's question.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,626.009,630.373,"--No, it would not, Your Honor, because that 1 percent charge would not vary based on time."
1995.95-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,630.373,630.924,Okay.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,630.924,632.563,If the arrearage were only 2 days--
1995.95-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,632.563,632.964,I understand.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,634.146,636.147,"--Yes, that... that is... that is our position."
1995.95-860,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,637.488,648.665,But I... I thought that interest historically a payment for damages... originally... was a payment for damages for the money that wasn't paid in time.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,671.22,672.521,"--No, Justice Kennedy."
1995.95-860,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,710.376,719.611,"We'll accept that in... in the context, I suppose... I don't know if the argument has been... been made... of ease of administration."
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,730.488,745.959,"The distinction, Your Honor, is that here the flat charge is imposed in addition to a daily accruing finance charge, an interest charge that's measured by time and amount, which is accruing on the entire detained balance."
1995.95-860,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,757.586,762.077,Why should there be a difference if it's in addition in... in... in... or in lieu of?
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,766.292,767.581,If--
1995.95-860,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,767.581,769.564,Why does it cease to be interest?
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,771.324,773.996,--I'm not suggesting that it's in lieu of.
1995.95-860,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,900.669,902.471,"But you wouldn't object to a flat amount as a ceiling, would you?"
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,918.479,921.051,No.
1995.95-860,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,922.012,926.677,"Two percent of the arrears, but never more than $50 a month."
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,926.677,927.687,--Yes.
1995.95-860,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,951.533,952.204,On the arrears.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,952.204,959.376,"--And... and if the arrears are paid back on the 2nd day of the month, do I have to pay the entire 2 percent for the... for the 30 days?"
1995.95-860,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,959.376,959.666,No.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,966.021,966.932,Understood.
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.916,992.499,"But Mr.... Mr. Donovan, you're... you're hinging your... your whole argument upon ""at the rate allowed""."
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1017.405,1021.738,One hundred dollars per loan you would have.
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.729,1026.132,"--You would know what the maximum rate it allows, assume a... assume a 1 penny loan."
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1050.077,1059.244,"--Justice Scalia, to be sure, after the fact here a rate can be calculated once you know... once a late fee is imposed--"
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.244,1059.614,Right.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1059.614,1060.744,--and you know what the balance is--
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1060.744,1061.214,Right.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1061.214,1061.986,--that it's being imposed against--
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.986,1062.396,Right.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1074.074,1082.538,"--Here the fact is that you cannot calculate that rate until after the fact, after the imposition of the charge."
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.92,1085.901,Why is that crucial?
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1087.461,1111.648,"--Because... I'm sorry, Your Honor, because if you cannot calculate that rate after... until after the charge has been imposed, one, it's a rate looking backwards and not forwards; and, two, it's not a rate that somebody can anticipate, either borrower or a bank, in order to determine whether the charge is complying with Section 86's usury ceiling."
1995.95-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1125.615,1128.197,"--But, Mr. Donovan, don't you have a simpler answer to that example?"
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1132.481,1133.741,"Well, in this--"
1995.95-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.741,1134.972,Isn't that your... your basic answer?
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1134.972,1135.363,--Yes.
1995.95-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1135.363,1136.492,It's a one-time charge.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1142.737,1143.428,Yes--
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.428,1156.257,"But my point is that you... you derive that argument from the word ""rate"", and that it... that... it need not be derived from the word ""rate"", because you can convert a flat charge into a rate, once you know what the amount that the flat charge is applied to."
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1156.257,1169.356,"--Well, Justice Scalia, here the... the rate that... that you're deriving is a rate that is only applied after the number of days have already been identified, after the imposition of the charge has been imposed."
1995.95-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.9,1175.361,I understand.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1190.869,1204.859,"That maximum rate allowed by State law, Your Honor, would make it very difficult for a bank to know what that maximum rate is, because it would obviously vary, in this instance, by each consumer with whom the bank dealt."
1995.95-860,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1211.412,1235.098,"Mr. Donovan, are we talking about something that would be eminently fixable by CitiBank if it said, forget Federal law, we're going to put a choice-of-law clause into every application, credit application, and we're going to say that all terms and conditions of this agreement shall be construed in accordance with the law of South Dakota."
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1242.443,1248.587,"First, Your Honor, there is such a clause that says... that's similar to that in the CitiBank agreements."
1995.95-860,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1438.393,1440.824,Have we required that sort of thing before we defer?
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1440.824,1444.297,"--You have, Your Honor, in your post-Chevron line of authorities."
1995.95-860,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.611,1470.546,One thing the controller gave as a reason: I think the banks want this.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1471.745,1484.435,"--I would submit... I would submit, Your Honors, that... that this Court would hold that that is not a reasonable construction of the Statute; that that is an irrational, biased construction."
1995.95-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.58,1497.16,Why would it be irrational if the banks want it?
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1508.931,1515.083,"Well, in... in the economic sense, it's rational for the banks, because it makes them better off."
1995.95-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1528.913,1533.675,"Well, what you're doing is taking out the expertise of the agency in regard to what's good for the banking industry and so forth."
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1535.826,1536.797,No.
1995.95-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.797,1537.718,That's what you're saying.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1537.718,1539.368,"No, I don't mean to imply that, Your Honor."
1995.95-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1539.368,1539.849,Fine.
1995.95-860,0,35710,michael_d_donovan,,1539.849,1548.995,What I mean here is that what the agency has not done is it has not gone and looked at what is the economic basis or the functional characteristics of these charges.
1995.95-860,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.134,1640.576,"Very well, Mr. Donovan."
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1641.468,1650.641,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.85,1663.73,I don't think that's right.
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1670.505,1675.558,"But if it's stated as a percentage as a function of time, he would say--"
1995.95-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.558,1676.54,"Right, if it's a function of time."
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1676.54,1685.686,"--So... so, to begin with, he would say that if CitiBank were to charge 100 percent interest--"
1995.95-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1685.686,1688.728,Per period of time.
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1688.728,1689.057,--per unit of time.
1995.95-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1689.057,1689.558,Right.
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1689.558,1693.309,"And I'd like to address in a moment, Justice Scalia, the question of the unit of time."
1995.95-860,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.579,1744.852,"Well, I'm... I'm not sure that that analysis is entirely consistent with the Statute."
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1778.461,1787.397,"The case law of the time and the statutes of the time when Congress enacted the National Bank Act deal directly with this issue, Your Honor."
1995.95-860,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.684,1863.969,"I take it you're talking about the State statutes as of 1864, when this was enacted?"
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1863.969,1865.479,That's correct.
1995.95-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.528,1960.461,"Mr. Kendall, I think... the biggest problem I have with... with your... with your case is that I don't see how the... how the alternative set forth in the Statute makes sense unless you're dealing with a charge that is expressed as a rate."
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1995.604,1996.335,I... I do.
1995.95-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.782,2039.193,Right.
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2039.193,2041.984,"--CitiBank would have to act in just the following way, Your Honor."
1995.95-860,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2053.449,2053.891,The alternative--
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2061.158,2067.411,--When--
1995.95-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.572,2071.804,"Right, right, it happens to find itself in a State, how about that?"
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2072.525,2072.906,It happens to find itself.
1995.95-860,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2072.906,2077.658,In that banking metropolis of Rapid City.
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2079.07,2101.253,"We... in... in complying with a percentage rate ceiling, whether it would be a Federal one or if were in a State that had a percentage rate ceiling, would simply have to analyze what is the total interest charged and compute it against the rate cap to see whether it had been exceeded."
1995.95-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.773,2104.255,"Convert to a rate, in other words, as... as I was discussing earlier with--"
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2104.255,2104.646,--That's right.
1995.95-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.362,2148.504,"--But before you go on, let me ask you how that works if... suppose you have a State that, on all loans, allows a 5... no matter what the amount of the loan, anybody can charge a $500 loan... loan servicing charge or whatever."
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2168.707,2169.728,--You wouldn't be able to--
1995.95-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2169.728,2179.795,"And my... and that means that the alternative ""or"", you know, the... my goodness, the State... the State interest would... would have no usury limit at all then, right?"
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2179.795,2194.696,"--If you were in a State that provided for a charge that would, if computed against a Federal rate cap, would cause you to exceed the cap, you simply couldn't charge the charge."
1995.95-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.656,2214.467,I don't see how it works.
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2236.762,2237.212,Well--
1995.95-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2237.212,2247.469,"Or do you have to consider not interest in gross, but you have to say, oh, only flat charges of the same type that the State allows can be charged at that rate?"
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2247.469,2261.478,"--Well, let's not mix up now what a State is allowing, because that's a question you answer under the first clause of Section 85, with what the Federal Government alternative rate would permit."
1995.95-860,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.901,2353.919,"Well, does this mean that every... every charge made by the bank against the $1,000, say, that's loaned, has to be considered interest?"
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2367.787,2377.675,"In your example, yes, Your Honor, because it is the price that the bank is charging for making available the credit and the use and... and money on the terms provided."
1995.95-860,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2383.148,2389.202,"Well, what... what if the bank says you're going to have to pay $40 for an insurance premium on your life?"
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2389.202,2394.676,"Your Honor, we would argue that that is not for the extension of credit."
1995.95-860,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2405.481,2408.864,And how... how can you tell which is the separate service and which isn't?
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2413.676,2427.747,"Well, to take the credit card example as one, after you get a credit card, you'll often find... or after you get a mortgage, you'll often find you'll receive in the mail solicitations from people who will say, We'd like to give you insurance in case you are disabled."
1995.95-860,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2433.712,2437.833,I can understand that when the thing comes in the mail after the loan is complete.
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2442.157,2459.728,"If it... if it was a condition of providing the credit in the first place, it was required and it is integral to the making available of the credit, then in that situation... which is not the ordinary case... in that situation it might be interest."
1995.95-860,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2480.132,2488.586,"Well, how do you answer Mr. Donovan's argument that you could put all these extra charges in, and you could call everything interest, it would all fit into your definition?"
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2488.586,2514.283,"If... if what Mr. Donovan is saying is that our definition is inclusive of all charges that are for the use or detention of money, then we would say that that definition has a proud history in the usage of the term ""interest"", the usage of the term ""rate"", the statutory history, the statutory purpose, and the administrative agencies' interpretation."
1995.95-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2536.398,2542.782,May I ask you to tell me again why you think the Citizens National Bank opinion by Holmes helps you?
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2542.782,2543.443,Yes.
1995.95-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2543.443,2545.564,I'm not sure I caught your point before.
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2545.564,2547.685,There are two... two ways in which it... it helps us.
1995.95-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2596.608,2598.99,Because that's where the law of the State prohibited rather than permitted it?
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2598.99,2599.759,--Correct.
1995.95-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2599.759,2600.189,Yes.
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2601.321,2605.514,"And then, of course, Donnell also makes another point which is very important."
1995.95-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2759.503,2762.815,Along with the rate goes the manner.
1995.95-860,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2772.922,2775.003,"That's right, Your Honor."
1995.95-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.003,2776.445,Okay.
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2779.337,2798.198,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-860,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2817.942,2825.807,"Just as a matter of curiosity, Mr. Gornstein, I've been on the Court 23 or 24 years and heard a number of these cases."
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2833.101,2836.754,Do I know of any case in which the Comptroller has ruled against--
1995.95-860,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2836.754,2840.486,I mean gave an interpretive regulation which was adverse--
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2840.486,2841.067,--Adverse to the banks?
1995.95-860,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2841.067,2841.957,--Yes.
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2841.957,2852.124,"Well, I... I would suggest that this very regulation that you find here favors the banks in some respects and does not favor the bank in other respects."
1995.95-860,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2865.213,2874.377,Why is... why is this a matter that the Comptroller must resolve for himself in performing his duties under the Act?
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2874.377,2886.987,"The Comptroller has the responsibility to make sure that national banks comply with all provisions of the National Bank Act, including the limit set on taking interest in Section 85."
1995.95-860,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2894.362,2896.222,And he has enforcement responsibility?
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2896.222,2896.683,He does.
1995.95-860,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2896.683,2898.744,So he must interpret it in the course of executing that?
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2898.744,2899.184,That... that's right.
1995.95-860,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2915.725,2918.426,Does the Comptroller actually monitor these rates?
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2922.98,2926.594,"I... I don't know the answer to that question, Justice Souter."
1995.95-860,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2929.496,2936.818,"Does the administrative fee, the $15, have to bear some reasonable relationship to the administrative cost?"
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2936.818,2948.628,"--Under the Statute, it has to be based on the law of the State in which the bank is located to determine whether the fee is excessive or not, once it is interest."
1995.95-860,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2948.628,2953.571,Suppose it bears no relationship to the administrative cost associated with the lateness.
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2953.571,2969.37,"It is still interest, and it is excessive interest by some States' standards... perhaps California's... but it is not excessive interest when judged by South Dakota's standards, where the national bank is located."
1995.95-860,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2971.043,2990.664,"If... if you're breaking out of the 9 percent they normally charge that portion of the 9 percent that reflects not the payment for refraining from consumption, but the payment for the associated administrative costs, and charging it in the form of a flat fee... if that's the theory of what's going on, how could you justify an excessive amount?"
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2993.626,3002.922,"--On a late fee, it is... the Comptroller concluded that a late fee does two things, at least."
1995.95-860,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3027.369,3041.157,"Suppose the State does not allow a late fee, how do you decide whether, in charging a late fee, a bank violates the rate specified in the Statute... namely, 1 percent above whatever it is?"
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3042.519,3046.36,"--Well, I think that... that you... again, there are two--"
1995.95-860,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3046.36,3047.352,The State rate is the alternative.
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3055.757,3058.137,--You do not look to State law to determine that.
1995.95-860,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.392,3062.732,Okay.
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3062.732,3071.478,"--together with whatever late fee they impose, to see whether that exceeds the percentage ceilings set under the Federal standard."
1995.95-860,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3074.27,3075.511,Okay.
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3084.415,3085.286,I believe it hardly ever operates.
1995.95-860,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3208.826,3213.842,"--Mr.... Mr. Gornstein, this Statute came on the books, I guess, what, 1864?"
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3213.842,3214.33,Yes.
1995.95-860,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3214.33,3219.255,And the Comptroller never had a... a regulation until February of this year?
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3219.255,3220.394,That's correct.
1995.95-860,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3230.331,3234.655,Is that the one in February 1955?
1995.95-860,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,3234.655,3238.465,I... I cannot give you the date on the other regulation.
1995.95-860,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3321.039,3322.271,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
1995.95-860,3,35710,michael_d_donovan,,3324.673,3329.237,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1995.95-860,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3390.386,3391.906,"Thank you, Mr. Donovan."
1995.95-860,3,35710,michael_d_donovan,,3391.906,3392.286,Thank you.
1995.95-860,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3392.286,3393.052,The case is submitted.
