1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,0.0,93.557,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Respondent's conviction for mail fraud and false statements was reversed by the Court of Appeals because the prosecutor in his rebuttal argument to the jury expressed his personal opinion that Respondent had committed fraud."
1984.83-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,173.525,177.631,Is this the case where there was no oral argument in the Court of Appeals?
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,177.631,182.24,"Your Honor, I'm not aware of whether there was oral argument."
1984.83-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,182.24,185.113,"In one of our cases today, there was no oral argument."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,213.461,213.836,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,271.048,297.068,"What I'm getting back to, a long, long time, but I recall in my own experience as a trial judge that somebody in summation, whether prosecutor or defense counsel, stepped outside proper limits, his adversary had better get up and object to give me a chance to say to the jury, ignore it, or forget it, or something like that."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,299.396,312.844,"Your Honor, I do think that that's a sensible rule, and I believe that it may often be the appropriate course for the prosecutor to take, to object rather than to pursue a fair response."
1984.83-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,315.561,320.23,"Well, in fact, isn't that the best rule for both sides at the trial court level?"
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,350.0,358.982,"--Your Honor, I agree that for the prosecutor to have lodged an objection was an appropriate course."
1984.83-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,361.84,364.168,Why isn't it the preferred course?
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,364.168,367.869,--There are several reasons why it may not be.
1984.83-469,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,399.013,401.902,"Mr. McConnell, you can't have it both ways."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,405.635,409.68,"Our position is, in fact, that the defense argument was improper."
1984.83-469,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,409.68,412.476,"Then was there not a duty to object, as Justice O'Connor suggests?"
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,412.476,414.054,There is a duty--
1984.83-469,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,414.054,422.661,"If he wants to take advantage of it, to object rather than waiting until it's his turn to argue and then making an improper argument in response."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,422.661,427.613,"--Your Honor, the question here is whether the Respondent was denied a fair trial."
1984.83-469,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,427.613,432.658,"I understand that ultimately, but we're talking, first of all, about what would be the proper procedure in the trial court."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,443.949,448.838,"I would agree that under many circumstances, that that would be the preferred course."
1984.83-469,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.838,449.869,In this case.
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,449.869,452.523,But there are problems with--
1984.83-469,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,452.523,459.803,"In this case, because you're relying on what you say was improper argument as a justification for the response."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,459.803,470.003,"--In this case, Your Honor, remember that as the defense argument goes on, there isn't... it builds upon itself."
1984.83-469,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,475.485,478.515,"I understand all that, but can't we agree that the argument was improper by defense counsel?"
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,481.231,483.044,I think we can agree to that.
1984.83-469,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,486.309,489.556,"I mean, and that would be the government's position in this case, wouldn't it?"
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,489.556,491.025,"--That's right, but there is--"
1984.83-469,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,491.025,493.665,"And therefore, should not the government have objected?"
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,493.665,495.399,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,526.183,530.025,"But, if you take that position, does that authorize you to do wrong?"
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,530.025,534.492,"No, Your Honor, but it may very well authorize--"
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,534.492,547.644,"If you voluntarily pass up your opportunity to object, can you then use that as the bulwark of doing wrong in your argument?"
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,547.644,550.564,"--Your Honor, I would suggest that it is not a matter of doing wrong."
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,556.671,558.295,Shouldn't the judge do that?
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,558.295,561.451,"--Well, Your Honor, I would suggest--"
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,561.451,564.229,And the judge can only do it if you object.
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,564.229,577.162,"--Your Honor, I would suggest to you that many defendants would, in fact, prefer to have the prosecutor discussing the integrity of the prosecution, rather than having the trial court--"
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,577.162,582.176,Is it part of your position that the defendant failed to object to what you said?
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,582.176,583.801,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,583.801,588.158,"Well, then can't the defendant raise the point that you didn't object?"
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,592.125,593.921,"Your Honor, two points."
1984.83-469,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.862,631.64,"I thought one of your positions anyway was that when the defense counsel opens the door, the government is entitled to respond."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,631.64,632.624,"That's right, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,632.624,636.294,"Well, an objection wouldn't have done defense counsel any good."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,647.213,649.978,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.366,653.71,Right.
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,654.46,660.239,"But had there been an error, if Iawn v. United States--"
1984.83-469,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,660.239,660.926,Aren't you going to argue that there was no error at all?
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,660.926,661.426,--I'm sorry?
1984.83-469,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.426,663.893,Aren't you going to argue that there was no error at all?
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,663.893,664.549,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,680.949,686.869,"Well, aren't you entitled to take the position that the prosecution had its option?"
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,706.281,708.093,"Yes, Your Honor, that is our position."
1984.83-469,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,724.088,728.445,"Interruption of closing argument, though, is something that often doesn't sit well with a jury."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,746.359,747.327,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,767.617,776.33,"Well, the trial court is certainly in a position to advise the jury that the prosecutor's belief in the veracity of a witness is irrelevant."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,776.33,781.47,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,787.936,791.34,But the trial is in a better position than you and I.
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,791.34,793.856,"That's right, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,811.536,818.174,"I think we'll resume at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. McConnell."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,845.742,854.225,"Mr. Chief Justice, before lunch, you asked whether this was a case in which oral argument was dispensed with before the Tenth Circuit."
1984.83-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1226.682,1236.692,"Mr. McConnell, what if the defense counsel got up and argued something along the following lines: The defendant has nothing to hide."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,1250.236,1255.998,"Your Honor, I would not think that that particular instance would constitute an invitation."
1984.83-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1269.165,1269.571,That would constitute so-called plain error.
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,1282.348,1287.081,I can imagine responses that would constitute plain error.
1984.83-469,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1311.992,1321.426,"When you say ""fair"" and ""permitted"", we're talking basically about what, the supervisory rules for federal courts?"
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,1321.426,1332.702,"Yes, Your Honor; although in the extreme, I would think that there would be a due process component as well, but we are talking here about the federal court system."
1984.83-469,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1332.702,1349.445,"Mr. McConnell, do you think it would ever be appropriate for a court of appeals, in the exercise of its supervisory power with this kind of an issue, to take into account similar comments in other cases."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,1359.926,1365.064,"Your Honor, I think that it is perfectly permissible for that to be taken into account."
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1428.117,1430.053,I thought your position was it wasn't error.
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,1430.053,1433.286,That's our position as well.
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1433.286,1437.207,"At one time you say it's not error, and another time it's not plain."
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,1437.207,1438.253,"That's right, Your--"
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1438.253,1439.378,You take both positions.
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,1439.378,1440.909,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1462.602,1463.305,Isn't that equaled out?
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,1470.132,1472.959,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1472.959,1475.191,Both sides gave up the right to object.
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,1475.191,1485.562,"--In which case, one would expect that the conclusion would be that the conviction would stand because there's no--"
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1485.562,1488.295,Not in my book.
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,1488.67,1494.886,--There is a requirement in appellate procedure of preserving the error for appeal.
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1508.444,1509.771,Improper and unethical.
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,1519.454,1523.656,"That certainly is the usual rule, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1601.703,1608.497,"What has that to do with the appellate process, the right of the trial judge to move?"
1984.83-469,0,35622,michael_mc_connell,,1610.856,1613.667,"--Well, yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1760.656,1765.529,Mr. Bailey.
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,1765.529,1775.244,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Bill Young's defense was that he had no fraudulent intent whatsoever."
1984.83-469,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1960.794,1967.448,How does this bear on the legitimacy of the comments of either counsel?
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,1967.448,1973.664,"It's because of the issue of good faith, Your Honor, and that was the issue in the closing summation."
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.579,2037.403,"Well, isn't it a perfectly permissible inference for a prosecutor in a fraud case to say that people are victims of fraud?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2040.636,2046.29,"I think a great deal of latitude should be permitted if there is any evidence to support it, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.626,2083.26,"Are you saying that in order for a prosecutor in a closing argument in a fraud case to refer to the public as a victim, you would have to put someone on the witness stand and say, yes, the public is a victim of this fraud that we allege?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2083.26,2087.384,"Oh, I don't think that, Your Honor, but there should be some proof that someone lost something."
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2109.656,2110.265,So then what did you do about all this?
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2110.265,2110.749,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2149.922,2151.171,"But you also said,"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2154.935,2158.715,"Yes, I did, under what I've just described, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.59,2164.901,And you said your client was the only one in this whole affair who has acted with honor and integrity.
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2164.901,2168.118,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2225.359,2225.812,"Well, which ones?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2230.53,2230.795,--I will.
1984.83-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2246.945,2250.569,"Do you think... he talked about the evidence, and then he says,"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2256.331,2259.159,"--I think that's an improper comment, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.528,2274.059,Right.
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2274.059,2276.151,"""Well, I was sitting there, and I think he was. """
1984.83-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.469,2306.452,Was your objection that he just misstated the evidence?
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2306.452,2310.95,"--Well, that he gave his opinion of guilt, which we think is grossly improper."
1984.83-469,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2313.823,2321.805,"But that was responsive to your statement that nobody believed, including the prosecutor or himself, in your client's guilt."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2321.805,2326.663,"--I think if he had stopped there, Your Honor, that it would be a closer case."
1984.83-469,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2339.11,2348.653,"May I ask why no objection was made by you, as defense counsel, to anything that you thought he said was improper at the time?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2348.653,2361.476,"Our understanding of the Tenth Circuit rule was, if he objected to my closing statement, then that was the way he preserved his record, and I was not obligated to object to his because it was plain error."
1984.83-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.965,2391.589,But you didn't think you were making an error or making any kind of an improper statement.
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2391.589,2392.417,--I did not.
1984.83-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.417,2398.555,And perhaps the prosecutor didn't think you were doing anything improper.
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2400.226,2401.304,"Well, that could well be."
1984.83-469,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2401.304,2411.863,"And it's also possible, isn't it, to approach the bench and make an objection outside the presence of the jury, if you really thought the prosecutor was getting out of line?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2411.863,2412.894,"Oh, it could have been done."
1984.83-469,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2412.894,2415.596,"But none of that was done, of course."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2415.596,2416.439,That was not done.
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2423.92,2437.414,"Well, what is the reason that it is said... and I know it's said by other people... that a prosecutor's expression of his personal opinion of guilt is improper?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2437.414,2440.819,"--Your Honor, there are a number of reasons advanced for that."
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2454.627,2461.217,"Well, if they're not immediately at hand, perhaps you could come up with it later in your argument."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2461.217,2461.404,Yes.
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2486.785,2488.894,Does that make any sense to you?
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2498.092,2501.669,"Well, Your Honor, it's just totally unethical."
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2501.669,2502.387,Why?
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2502.387,2505.871,"Well, because it makes the prosecutor a witness."
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2505.871,2512.696,"But when the defense lawyer expresses his view that his client is not guilty, then it must make the defense lawyer a witness."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2512.696,2516.539,I think it's improper for a defense lawyer to say his client's not guilty.
1984.83-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.539,2521.662,"You think it's perfectly all right though, to change the words a little and say,"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2526.253,2530.065,I wouldn't think that would even be proper.
1984.83-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.797,2539.825,How do you make a factual argument and suggest that the facts refute the guilt?
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2539.825,2548.744,"Well, the statement here from Mr. Drinker, writing on legal ethics in this case, which is quoted, I think addresses that point, Your Honor:"
1984.83-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.864,2565.926,"In my example, he didn't say what his personal beliefs were."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2571.11,2573.39,"I think that's slightly different, Your Honor, and I--"
1984.83-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.39,2576.561,"""The evidence in this case clearly shows that my client is not guilty. """
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2576.561,2580.654,--I think that one could get by with that sort of statement.
1984.83-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.902,2585.449,"Well, the prosecutor should say,"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2590.18,2592.055,"I think that's very different from saying,"
1984.83-469,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2599.349,2600.646,Mr. Bailey.
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2600.646,2601.38,"Yes, Your Honor?"
1984.83-469,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2601.38,2611.577,"Suppose in this particular case, after you made this statement that everybody at this table agrees to this, and the prosecutor got up and said,"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2620.886,2628.852,I think it would be a more appropriate response than what was done.
1984.83-469,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2636.662,2638.708,"No, I said he makes that whole statement."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2642.864,2645.394,"Well, I think it is clearly reversible error, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2649.438,2653.014,"I mean if he gets up and... if you get up there and say,"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2662.057,2671.163,"--I think there would be, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2671.163,2671.366,Yes.
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2671.554,2674.881,"I would take the position that there would be, but that's not this case."
1984.83-469,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2678.239,2679.207,"--Well, what's wrong with it?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2682.767,2692.076,"I think his objection is, Your Honor, we object to counsel stating what is in the minds of others."
1984.83-469,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2699.824,2702.307,He's no more a witness than you were.
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2702.307,2704.494,"Well, I don't... Your Honor, I agree."
1984.83-469,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2716.582,2723.628,What was your intent in saying nobody at this table believes thus and so?
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2723.628,2728.499,"--It was meant to be a comment on the evidence, that there was no evidence of any intent to defraud, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.718,2730.404,"Well, that's your personal opinion, isn't it?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2743.993,2756.8,"I don't recall saying anything quite like that, Your Honor, but I think that if there was such a statement made, the prosecutor has an obligation to protest it if he doesn't like that."
1984.83-469,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.287,2793.864,"Of course, Mr. Bailey, we don't know."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2802.626,2804.344,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2804.344,2809.968,"Therefore, do we not have to assume that if you had made an objection, that the trial judge would have sustained it?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2809.968,2817.886,I think you'd have to assume that.
1984.83-469,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2817.886,2822.26,"And, therefore, I can't understand why you didn't make the objection, because I don't see how that could have possibly hurt you."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2822.26,2824.352,"Well, there were two."
1984.83-469,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2830.662,2836.597,But you certainly aren't going to gamble on a reversal by the Court of Appeals rather than getting your client off.
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2836.597,2841.204,--There was the deep concern that this would only emphasize this to the jury.
1984.83-469,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2862.29,2883.0,"Do you not agree, or do you agree that a lawyer objecting to argument of another lawyer, interrupting, takes considerable risk of having the jury have a negative reaction to the interruption?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2883.0,2884.281,"Very much so, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2886.592,2891.543,"So that probably explains why you didn't object, and why the prosecutor didn't object."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2891.543,2893.012,"I think that's very true, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2901.228,2912.566,"Does that not suggest, then, that lawyers and trial judges should be allowed quite a latitude in that respect?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2912.566,2918.923,"Oh, I think they should be allowed latitude, considerable latitude, and I think that that's done all the time, and properly so."
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2935.074,2939.431,Do you think that would have hurt him with the jury or helped him in Oklahoma City?
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2941.758,2949.927,"--I think that's in with what they refer to as aura, the power and prestige and legitimacy that is very strong."
1984.83-469,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2977.118,2980.008,"But, Mr. Bailey, again if I may just throw this thought out."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,2987.911,2988.583,No.
1984.83-469,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3024.724,3027.956,What about... did you make a motion for a new trial on this ground?
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3027.956,3028.3,No.
1984.83-469,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3029.472,3036.188,You mean you wanted to let the error stay in the record without giving the trial judge a chance to correct it?
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3036.188,3036.516,No.
1984.83-469,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3038.11,3047.262,"Mr. Bailey, what's happened in this case, what I understood was the Tenth Circuit rule, that if you didn't object, then you're foreclosed from raising it."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3063.366,3079.656,"My understanding of the Tenth Circuit rule has always been that the prosecutor is obligated to object to defense counsel's statements and cannot respond to them improperly, and if they do so and express their own opinion, it's plain error."
1984.83-469,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3086.606,3089.12,That is exactly what the result was in this case.
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3089.12,3090.042,That's correct.
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3090.042,3091.698,"Now, you said a moment ago."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3104.443,3105.177,No.
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3143.974,3154.796,"Don't you think that the appellate court would be perfectly capable of perceiving that the jury proceedings had been fatally infected beyond the point of curative instruction if, in fact, that was the case?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3154.796,3155.953,"I certainly hope so, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3158.779,3163.34,"If, at the close, as part of the instructions, the trial judge had said,"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3175.523,3178.022,"Not in my judgment, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3246.432,3255.647,"Well, that isn't necessarily the case, because it depends on how the question or statement were... if I say... I'm the prosecutor and I say,"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3268.017,3276.296,"Your Honor, that's just... with all due respect, that's just totally improper and--"
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3276.296,3278.061,What's totally improper?
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3278.061,3280.325,--For the prosecutor to do as you say.
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3280.325,3292.429,"But it must be improper for some other reason than indicating that there's a lot of evidence outside the record that would support it, because the prosecutor is expressly negative, that inference, in his statement."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3292.429,3298.615,"Well, I think I see what you mean."
1984.83-469,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3302.831,3303.113,Yes.
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3303.113,3306.064,It still makes the prosecutor a witness.
1984.83-469,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3335.38,3342.66,"Well, didn't you suggest that the prosecutor not only lacked faith in his own case, but didn't believe in it at all?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3342.66,3345.267,"I think that's... I think that's too strong, Your Honor."
1984.83-469,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3347.953,3348.828,That's the way I read your statement.
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3348.828,3364.18,"--that Billy Young intended to defraud, based on the evidence developed at trial; no suggestion that the case was not brought in good faith, but what had occurred in the courthouse at trial."
1984.83-469,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3364.18,3367.242,"Mr. Bailey, can I ask one other procedural question?"
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3367.242,3367.414,Yes.
1984.83-469,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3367.414,3371.882,"As the Chief Justice pointed out, this case was apparently not argued with the Court of Appeals."
1984.83-469,1,17413,burck_bailey,,3375.24,3389.656,"My recollection is, Your Honor, that both I and the other side had a conflict, and I don't recall who said that we would like to move it to another docket, and the court said well, it will just be submitted."
1984.83-469,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3396.232,3397.106,Very well.
1984.83-469,2,35622,michael_mc_connell,,3398.981,3402.214,I'd be happy to answer any questions.
1984.83-469,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3403.633,3404.602,Apparently not.
