2007.07-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.103,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 07-219, Exxon Shipping Company versus Baker, et al.."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,9.106,28.317,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989, the resulting spill of 11 million gallons of oil was one of the worst environmental tragedies in U.S. maritime history."
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,89.558,94.093,"Mr. Dellinger, how was that rule settled?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,114.856,124.981,"--Justice Ginsburg, The Amiable Nancy is the only maritime case, but this Court in Lake Shore in 1893--"
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,124.981,127.516,That was on land on the railroad.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,127.516,139.074,"--Yes, but this Court's unanimous opinion by Justice Gray in Lake Shore cites with approval The Amiable Nancy decision and the maritime context."
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,149.196,153.583,"You are talking about maritime law, and relying on The Amiable Nancy."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,168.426,186.137,"Justice Ginsburg, the issue has been so well settled, and Courts of Appeals have so long recognized, that punitive damages are not available in vicarious liability in maritime cases that the issue, understandably, doesn't... doesn't come up."
2007.07-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,186.454,188.521,And we thought so in Prentice.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,188.521,189.673,--Yes.
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,204.433,211.52,"Well, the Lake Shore case, if I remember right, did not involve a managerial employee."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,214.622,217.007,--That's... that's correct.
2007.07-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,232.866,240.439,"So the shipowner is, I suppose, the owner of Exxon or the hundreds of thousands of shareholders, right?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,244.824,245.343,--No.
2007.07-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,265.756,269.125,So it's not quite correct to say only the owner.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,293.007,309.516,"--The one thing that, traditionally, if you look at all the Courts of Appeals cases and all of the tradition and maritime law, is that the captain or the pilot, anyone on board the ship, does not implicate in punitive damages the company, or the shipowner."
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,309.516,309.952,You mean the captain--
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,309.952,310.435,--or the ship owner.
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,310.435,313.087,--is not a managerial officer for any purpose?
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,321.76,334.668,"I think the tradition is clear, Justice Kennedy, that if it's a... that the maritime tradition is that, while you are liable for all of the harms caused by that, the decisions made on the ship do not implicate in punitive damages."
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,334.668,339.37,"Well, I'm... I'm asking about the concept of the managerial officer in general."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,356.164,357.599,That is correct.
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,357.599,367.372,And it seems to me a large part of that inquiry turns on what a managerial officer is and what... was Hazelwood not a managerial officer for any purpose at all?
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,367.372,375.395,"You know, I can't rule out the possibility that someone in that position might be, but he did not set company policy."
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,375.395,378.097,But I thought that you're talking about a different level.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,402.712,403.212,That is correct.
2007.07-219,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,413.786,414.736,Why should that be?
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,435.599,438.651,"--Well, there are two responses to that question."
2007.07-219,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,458.299,467.005,"Well, isn't... isn't part of the reason, at least for the assumption that there's a distinction, something that I think was mentioned in The Amiable Nancy?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,509.998,515.301,"--There is no question, Justice Souter, but that communications have... have improved."
2007.07-219,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,531.847,540.084,"That may be an argument for no punitive damages, but I don't see why it's an argument for distinguishing between maritime corporations and others."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,547.773,563.116,"--Well, to the extent that one doesn't see that the tradition of... of what's worked in maritime law in its own system of law for 200 years should be different, it is not at all clear why the maritime law rule ought not be the rule on land."
2007.07-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.984,570.805,"Well, I had not understood you to concede that... that the land rule was different from the maritime rule."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,578.744,579.328,--That is correct.
2007.07-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.082,586.948,Which was a land case.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,586.948,588.2,--And the policy behind it--
2007.07-219,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,588.2,591.635,"But you are right, and I want to make... let me just make clear one other point."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,598.489,599.241,--That is correct--
2007.07-219,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,599.241,599.424,Okay.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,599.424,616.017,"--although there are some States that have the Restatement position that may read ""managerial employee"" in the way that maritime law does, and that is a person who is in a position to set relevant policy for the company and not just the branch manager at a... at a Wal-Mart."
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,616.017,619.119,But there aren't many States that follow the Restatement position.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,619.119,620.155,That is correct.
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,653.792,664.748,"Am I right, Mr. Dellinger, that in the railroad case the court was dealing with the concept of respondeat superior?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,675.555,685.827,"It was dealing with someone who was at the level of a conductor, I think, exactly on par with the captain."
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,685.827,689.881,But I don't recall that they made anything about managerial.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,694.35,694.933,Yes.
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,696.635,700.837,But I don't think the conductor is on a par with a captain.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,721.215,723.681,--For punitive damages.
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,727.601,731.503,"Of course, we are talking about punitive damages but at the concept of a ""managerial officer""."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,735.372,740.442,"--Well, for two reasons: One, he was unable to set policy for any of these issues."
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,791.375,792.394,Are you--
2007.07-219,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,792.394,795.696,"May I ask this question, Mr. Dellinger?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,795.696,796.346,--Yes.
2007.07-219,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.346,803.667,"In some punitive damages cases, the liability attaches because the person has hired someone who is obviously incompetent."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,815.224,818.711,Not against the company that owned the ship.
2007.07-219,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.728,825.198,"And if he was hired by a shore based personnel, then, would that be the difference for you?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,825.198,831.019,--The... only if the company at a policymaking level is implicated would the company--
2007.07-219,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,831.019,837.84,The one... the company says the captain hires the crew members who could cause all sorts of damage.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,843.744,854.301,"--Oh, well, I think if the case arises in a maritime context, there would not be... there would not be a different rule, whether a decision was made on shore or not."
2007.07-219,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,857.253,864.74,Would there be vicarious liability or not in the case: Negligence in hiring an incompetent crew member?
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,864.74,870.311,--Not unless the decision was made by someone at a policymaking level.
2007.07-219,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.311,874.013,"Well, he has the authority to decide who to hire."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,876.215,876.581,No.
2007.07-219,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.102,916.323,Recklessness in hiring the employee who caused the damage can be a--
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,916.323,917.441,"--Yes, absolutely."
2007.07-219,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,937.319,943.925,"--In hiring the third mate here, if he was negligently hired by somebody on shore, there would be liability?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,947.877,948.677,No.
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,976.227,978.662,--There was... there was sufficient evidence of that.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,979.145,979.745,--Yes.
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,979.745,994.689,"--The jury could have found that Exxon knew that this captain had a severe alcohol problem; and, yet, they let him stay on voyage after voyage and did nothing about it."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1010.281,1011.864,"Yes, and I want to be clear about that."
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1050.589,1050.941,It was a jury question.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1060.778,1061.23,That is correct.
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1061.23,1076.224,"And, I take it, next time around the jury would get a special verdict and be asked: Was Exxon, itself, reckless in allowing this captain to stay on the ship?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1076.224,1076.54,That is correct.
2007.07-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1076.54,1081.291,"That is only true if you lose on your second and third questions as well, right?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1081.291,1081.608,Yes.
2007.07-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1081.608,1085.179,The answers to your second and third questions preclude a new trial?
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1085.179,1085.845,That is correct.
2007.07-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1087.881,1105.426,"Do you want to get... looking at this case of Lake Shore, as I read... as I read that case, I'm thinking that they looked back to the admiralty case, but they're saying this isn't an admiralty rule."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1140.147,1140.514,--Yes.
2007.07-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.514,1140.766,All right.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1168.333,1183.359,The only place it would remain is in statutory settings where the court has to supply the answer to a question of whether punitive damages are an available remedy in a Title VII case.
2007.07-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1185.211,1186.461,"Well, what's happened?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1215.895,1226.936,"--Well, the... of course, with the... with the replacement of the Arrowsmith versus Tyson by Erie against Thompkins, it was no longer a broad area."
2007.07-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1226.936,1227.336,I know.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1228.888,1234.357,In the lower courts the rule has continued as a maritime law rule.
2007.07-219,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1245.08,1246.23,Let me just interrupt.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1253.086,1263.858,"--It is in the absence of a... in the absence of a Federal rule, but here the... there are... there's not uniformity among the States."
2007.07-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1306.221,1313.641,"Well, the City of Milwaukee involved the displacement by Federal statutory law of Federal common law."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1343.66,1348.564,"--Well, the reason I think that's not... not the case is twofold."
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1472.357,1486.683,"Mr.... Mr. Dellinger, before we get into the merits of that issue, the Clean Water Act did not enter this case until 13 months after the jury verdict."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1534.58,1545.286,"--Justice Ginsburg, that sort of concern has much more force if you are talking about issues that go to the substantiality of the evidence."
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1547.055,1548.238,No.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1560.815,1561.215,--Right.
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1561.215,1565.2,And what is the basis in the Federal rules for that motion?
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1565.2,1570.42,The motion was made before the entry of judgment.
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1570.42,1572.622,13 months after the verdict.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1572.622,1589.148,"That... the motion was not on... on... the court of appeals held... not only did the court of appeals press... not only was the issue pressed and passed upon by the court of appeals, the court of appeals held that the district court was wrong in assuming that it was waived."
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1593.702,1595.402,But I... that's not my question.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1602.892,1611.08,"--It was under rule 59, under rule 49."
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1611.08,1613.03,49 is on special verdicts.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1615.382,1615.865,I'm sorry.
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1620.667,1623.202,"Rule 50 is pretty strict, isn't it?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1658.625,1662.41,"--Justice Ginsburg, there are several answers to the waiver question."
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1692.929,1694.798,And you didn't appeal on that.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1700.285,1702.768,--That would be the case if we hadn't raised it all.
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1714.712,1715.078,Statutory.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1718.914,1721.881,--That is correct.
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1756.955,1771.898,"As you know, there were or at least some strong amici briefs in this case that have asked this Court, tell the court of appeals that's no way to operate vis a vis district courts."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1771.898,1782.07,"--Well, the... even Professor Miller recognizes that this is not jurisdictional and that the court has the power to do it, the power to hear this case."
2007.07-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1789.526,1792.378,"Mr. Dellinger, did you say you had a second and a third point?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1792.378,1792.794,--Yes.
2007.07-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1792.794,1793.71,You going to get to them?
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1793.71,1797.746,"Oh, uh... yes, indeed."
2007.07-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1797.746,1798.096,All right.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1798.096,1829.9,"The... the Clean Water Act, the reason it's an important issue, is that the one thing that Congress has not done, whether it's in TAPAA, in the Clean Water Act or the Oil Pollution Act, is they have not provided for punitive damages but moreover, they have never had any remedy that is uncalibrated, that is limitless, that is not carefully measured so that it respects the need to protect the interests to be protective by those laws, by the interest in clean water, with a decision not to overdeter."
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1843.743,1845.593,You're talking about tradition.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1856.2,1865.656,"--Even on civil fines, even on other aspects of it, there is... there is a careful calibration."
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1928.381,1931.449,"Well, perhaps that's a segue to point No. 3."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1932.285,1932.801,--No.
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1933.868,1934.335,--to cut you off.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1934.486,1935.069,--Even if the--
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1935.069,1936.686,--On point No. 3--
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1936.686,1936.986,--I'm sorry.
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1937.804,1947.56,--My only question is this: Assume that there will be punitive damages applicable to Exxon under maritime law in in case.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1974.295,1977.429,"Well, I think surely that's right."
2007.07-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.858,1999.929,"You would say one of those factors is the Clean Water Act, wouldn't you?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1999.929,2000.545,--Yes.
2007.07-219,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2000.545,2008.285,"Even if it is not pre emptive as a matter of law, it's one of the factors that you can bring to the Court's attention, I suppose."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2008.285,2008.868,That is correct.
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2008.868,2019.056,"And I take it, under that, you would point to the double... the provision for a fine double the amount of the damages?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2020.842,2022.258,The--
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2022.258,2024.06,"I mean, if we're looking for guidelines--"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2024.06,2025.527,--Yes.
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2025.996,2031.614,--double general damages is a factor that we could... that we could follow in the maritime framework?
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2031.614,2037.285,"--Yes, but you would look to what the criminal penalty is that's actually imposed."
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2075.393,2082.683,What about looking at what this Court said in TXO was proper in a punitive damages case?
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2101.377,2116.97,"Well, there was... first of all, it would be different to look at potential harm if the potential harm were attempted by the defendant, and the defendant had been unable to carry out the--"
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2116.97,2117.789,--But it wasn't--
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2117.789,2118.656,--the planned harm.
2007.07-219,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2118.656,2119.189,--a factor here.
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2127.528,2131.397,That was not even the basis of liability that was put before the jury.
2007.07-219,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2198.374,2206.064,"What would be the formulation of the rule if the Court thinks that any added amount would not deter, and how do we know that?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2211.016,2214.92,"--Well, it is absolutely essential to formulate some kind of rule."
2007.07-219,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2234.497,2236.666,May I go back to your civil penalty point?
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2236.666,2237.183,--Yes.
2007.07-219,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2237.183,2251.426,"Isn't the problem with the civil penalty argument is... that the civil penalties were calibrated for environmental damage, and what we are dealing with here is individual economic damage?"
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2254.711,2264.0,"Well, two responses: First of all, the $150 million penalty did... the purpose of the Clean Water Act also includes protection of property."
2007.07-219,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2276.141,2278.326,To the... for lost trade or something?
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2278.326,2278.793,--Right.
2007.07-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2345.254,2359.112,"But the... I mean, the obvious kind of thing would to be say that the standard would depend upon the reprehensibility of the conduct of the officer of the corporation, including the captain, if you lost on that."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2389.666,2390.333,--Well--
2007.07-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2390.333,2391.283,Then why wouldn't you--
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2391.283,2391.799,--Keep in--
2007.07-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2391.799,2392.251,--Why wouldn't you--
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2392.251,2396.92,"--Keep in mind that the largest award in the history of punitive damages was an award for 500,000."
2007.07-219,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2398.022,2404.009,"--You're going to say... you're going to hear in two seconds... they're going to say this is the company that makes the most amazing profit, et cetera."
2007.07-219,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2411.33,2420.119,--I... I say that this... that the amount is enough to deter anybody for anything when it is $3.4 billion.
2007.07-219,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2435.612,2437.564,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2447.936,2455.776,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Each of the three rulings at issue here rests firmly in the mainstream of American tort law."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2544.5,2555.891,"What if it's the lookout posted... I don't know if they have one... but the lookout posted in the front of the ship, and he is drunk, and doesn't see the reef or something?"
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2558.343,2560.795,"Not for punitive damages, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2570.484,2573.436,So you regard the ship as a business unit?
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2573.436,2576.804,"--That's what Exxon regarded the ship as, and so that's what the record says."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2579.238,2586.494,That's different if they say that it's... depending on how they categorize the different units tells whether they are liable or not?
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2586.494,2588.529,"--Well, I don't want to rest primarily on labels."
2007.07-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2603.121,2607.657,"In respect, I mean, the janitor has authority over an aspect of the corporation."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2610.025,2612.227,"--Well, I think the authority--"
2007.07-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2612.227,2619.381,I assume the test is the person has to be high enough that it justifies holding the entire corporation.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2628.171,2630.504,--There are about 20 vessels like the Valdez.
2007.07-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.504,2631.456,Twenty vessels.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2631.456,2639.376,"Now, I think Mr. Chief Justice had it right when he said it's no answer to say it can't be the master; it has to be the corporation."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2650.933,2654.702,"That was a question that I asked, not a statement."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2665.01,2666.243,He may not be.
2007.07-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2718.562,2729.035,"I thought the Lake Shore... well, I thought the Lake Shore and Amiable whatever it is principle was that a captain ain't one of those."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2732.154,2734.187,--There was no captain at issue in Amiable Nancy.
2007.07-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2817.527,2825.331,Do any of those cases say the managerial agent is liable if he violated express instructions from an employer?
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2825.331,2833.437,"--No State tort case that we're aware of, Justice Kennedy, adopts... I think what you're referring to is the Kolstad policy exception."
2007.07-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2833.437,2838.341,Because that's what the last part of your instruction 33 says.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2857.485,2860.604,"Well, I think I want to say two things."
2007.07-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2874.597,2879.501,But they have not conceded the accuracy or correctness of instruction 33.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2885.322,2905.116,"--Well, if you were to adopt a rule that no other State has adopted, which is to say there was a policy defense in ordinary tort cases, which unlike Kolstad do not rest on the subjective knowledge of the actor, even then, we submit, we tried that issue in this case, Justice Kennedy; and there was... Exxon had every opportunity to argue policy."
2007.07-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2914.555,2915.007,No.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2921.078,2922.278,"--That's right, Justice Kennedy."
2007.07-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2924.197,2934.052,"So the corporation's responsibility or complicity or culpability is simply not relevant under your theory of the case, even though that's what you talk about in your brief."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2934.052,2943.241,"Well, I don't want to act like a dog chasing his tail here, Justice Kennedy, but the idea is to ask whether the corporation is culpable, you have to ask which people."
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2949.945,2957.001,That's... that's why I'm interested in the same question I asked on the other side.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3074.995,3076.245,"--Three reasons, Justice Breyer."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3172.825,3182.447,"Mr. Fisher, you... your friend says in his reply brief that you cannot cite one U.S. maritime case that has allowed vicarious liability for punitive damages."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3185.215,3186.751,"No, it would not be, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3187.117,3188.551,What's your best case?
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3188.551,3208.331,"--What we did our reply brief... I'm sorry, what we did in our red brief is cite to Professor Robertson's article in saying that he collected the cases, and which he did; and so our best cases are the City of Carlisle case, the Ludlow and Ralston against States Rights is very close."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3211.2,3213.319,"Well, let's take... take the Ludlow."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3220.139,3222.555,--We don't think that's the right reading of the case.
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3255.562,3260.514,"And so it differs from Sand, for example, where they are like two cases?"
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3260.514,3261.08,Pardon me?
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3261.08,3262.716,It differs from Sand?
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3285.164,3285.664,Yes.
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3285.664,3287.747,Why do you say there is no stare decisis problem?
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3287.747,3295.203,"Well, because neither Amiable Nancy nor the Lake Shore case, which are the only two cases from this Court, dealt with a managerial agent."
2007.07-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3334.228,3336.68,"That, and $3.5 billion."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3338.363,3341.399,"--I said one of the reasons, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-219,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3341.399,3344.703,"There's some confusion, Mr. Fisher, about this Kolstad."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3378.507,3383.975,Kolstad starts from the proposition of managerial agent is the proper way to implement a complicity rule.
2007.07-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3432.907,3441.513,"So in your theory of the case, instruction 33, if the superior had told Hazelwood don't pilot the ship today, Exxon would still be liable?"
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3443.699,3444.699,On the--
2007.07-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3444.699,3448.234,"Or the last part of the instruction 36, I think."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3448.234,3456.257,"--On the first part of the case in phase one that was our... that was the legal theory, Justice... you're right, Justice Kennedy."
2007.07-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3470.849,3473.551,"Well, but that... that goes to measures, not to liability."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3473.551,3474.034,Absolutely.
2007.07-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3474.034,3474.968,That was the first phase.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3479.038,3486.792,"Well, I... I accept that, and I think I've explained that by distinguishing an ordinary tort case from the situation in Title VII."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3509.025,3517.93,What is your position of how to look at the case if you have a managerial employee who acts contrary to corporate policy?
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3521.032,3523.334,"--In a tort case, Your Honor?"
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3523.334,3524.217,In a case like this.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3524.217,3524.701,Yes.
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3527.936,3535.709,So what can a corporation do to protect itself against punitive damages awards such as this?
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3535.709,3539.577,"--Well, it can hire fit and competent people who it decides--"
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3539.577,3544.315,"Well, and assume it has a policy that we will hire fit and competent people?"
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3544.315,3544.865,--Well--
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3544.865,3547.683,And you're saying... that's the question I'm asking.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3576.386,3580.154,"--Apart from adopting a policy, they need to implement it soundly."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3597.115,3602.936,"At that level... at that level, the president, I think you would have an argument that the policy was being changed."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3608.673,3612.625,"--Well, in some... I think in some respects we're back to the argument of where you draw the line."
2007.07-219,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3626.802,3629.019,Let me throw this thought on the table.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3637.924,3638.876,I don't think so.
2007.07-219,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3638.876,3643.661,"It seems to me we have this problem, the president of the company is the same as the vice president."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3643.661,3646.38,I think that's the point that I was trying to make.
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3646.38,3650.084,I suppose that would go to how consistently and how effectively the policy is enforced.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3664.944,3678.567,"Well, if we're to the point where the question is whether or not the policy was enforced, we'll very happily rest on the record in this case, because that was what we tried to the jury: That there was no serious alcohol policy that was enforced."
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3703.635,3705.921,That wouldn't... you might win on that one.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3709.873,3710.473,I think you assume--
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3710.473,3711.689,--for purposes of this argument?
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3711.689,3716.626,"--Well, two... two points, Justice Breyer: On answering the first question presented--"
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3716.626,3716.942,Yes.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3718.061,3718.578,--you assume--
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3718.578,3718.961,That's fine.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3718.961,3722.18,--unless we can show... unless we can make an overwhelming harmless errors--
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3722.18,3723.965,"On the second and third, this is what--"
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3723.965,3726.667,"--The second and third, I think you assume the facts--"
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3726.667,3730.452,--some time available.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3809.202,3812.737,"--Well, I think this is the perfect segue from the first and third questions."
2007.07-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3909.382,3910.068,Correct me if I'm wrong.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3921.708,3924.493,I think that's a constitutional holding.
2007.07-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3926.843,3935.682,"Well, then, a fortiori, it gives us the right and the duty to do so as... sitting as a common law type court."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3935.682,3936.049,--Yes.
2007.07-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3981.996,3985.198,What about... what about looking to the Clean Water Act?
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4037.998,4040.082,"I think I accept what you said, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4095.335,4096.118,Yes.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4134.91,4139.962,"--Well, I think it would be because that's... they never made that argument in the district court, and they didn't make that argument to the--"
2007.07-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4139.962,4142.081,They don't have to make every tiny little argument.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4176.385,4187.274,"--Well, they didn't make that argument, but if they had, I don't think it ends up being any different than their pre emption argument because... remember their pre emption argument isn't a pure pre emption argument."
2007.07-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4206.404,4207.137,It's close.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4207.137,4208.273,But it doesn't--
2007.07-219,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4208.273,4219.664,"But it doesn't really say pre emption, and so it's... it's just another factor to consider when you decide what the evolving law of admiralty requires."
2007.07-219,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4219.664,4224.882,--There was a statute that was raised in the district court.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4243.779,4244.662,"--That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4266.894,4271.846,A while ago you were about to make a point on the Limitation of Liability Act.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4271.846,4272.146,Yes.
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4272.146,4278.702,But I was... I would have thought that cuts heavily against you on the third point.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4304.15,4309.471,"Well, as I said, I agree you should look to it, but you should do it in a way this Court's Miles decision instructs."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4333.419,4340.34,"Well, that means they don't get the really quite extraordinary protection that the limitation of liability gives."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4348.179,4356.785,"--Well, I think... I think you should look to it and understand that Congress has declined to give the protection."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4369.009,4372.561,The argument is not that the Limitation of Liability Act should apply.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4392.208,4396.243,"--Well, we don't think we're asking for any kind of expansion of liability."
2007.07-219,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4408.601,4426.596,"Mr. Fisher, the problem I have... maybe it isn't a problem I have, but a question that that argument raises is this: We know something now that Justice Story did not know, and that is we've had an awful lot more experience with punitive damages practice."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4524.962,4529.097,"--Well, I think it would... I'll stick with unwise, Justice Souter."
2007.07-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4540.437,4548.841,"But the... the United States Code, the general criminal code, 18 U.S.C. 3571, has exactly that number."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4570.207,4572.14,--We think that's one place this Court can look.
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4615.983,4616.517,Why?
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4623.636,4624.422,But the theory--
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4624.422,4631.909,"And that really the money ought to go to the people generally in the State or it ought to go to other people, rather than those people who have already been compensated."
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4633.544,4634.144,--I think that's--
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4634.144,4637.33,That exhibits the difficulty for me of trying to figure out how to do it.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4637.33,4644.317,"--I think the theory of the States, Justice Breyer, is that if you hurt lots and lots of people, it's a worse act than if you only hurt one or two."
2007.07-219,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4655.042,4657.342,But isn't the measure what is necessary to deter?
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4660.843,4663.897,"--Well, I think you've looked at punishment and deterrence, Justice Kennedy."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4740.129,4741.195,It was a different jury.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4743.581,4746.366,"--There was no jury, of course, in the criminal case."
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4746.366,4747.049,Right.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4747.049,4747.799,But there was a jury in our case.
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4784.705,4791.475,"This is the same judge who approved the instruction that said Hazelwood's negligence and recklessness is automatically imputed to Exxon, right?"
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4791.475,4792.008,--Yes.
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4792.008,4794.943,So he was operating that under understanding of the law.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4794.943,4798.831,"Well, not when he was reviewing the size of the award, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4901.613,4901.779,What is the relevance?
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4901.779,4903.429,--deterrence.
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4903.429,4910.969,"What's the relevance of the leg that we're assuming Exxon, other than the captain, did bad things?"
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4910.969,4911.669,We submit that--
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4911.669,4914.269,You seem to be now talking about the evidence that they did bad things.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4915.387,4920.006,--The district judge said that this is what he deemed a critical factor supporting the punitive award.
2007.07-219,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4920.006,4924.06,"--Well, doesn't that show, then, that there had to be a finding that they did the bad thing?"
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,4924.06,4924.427,No.
2007.07-219,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5056.06,5056.56,Mr. Fisher--
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5056.56,5057.81,--and the amount of money that they've had to pay.
2007.07-219,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5057.81,5059.679,--your time is running out.
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5086.627,5094.65,"By definition, Justice Ginsburg, this is a mandatory punitive class, so this is the one and only time Exxon will face the respect of punitive damages."
2007.07-219,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5094.65,5103.589,"So you don't have the problem of litigant A getting these punitive damages and than B, C and D all wanting to--"
2007.07-219,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5103.589,5103.923,Right.
2007.07-219,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5155.973,5157.556,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
2007.07-219,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5161.275,5185.307,Let me begin by noting that it's... I do not think the Court will find in the record that Exxon said this was expected and approved the... you can look at that excerpt on the DVD and see for yourself what was... what was meant by that.
2007.07-219,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5314.689,5323.011,"Just as a class, if you take them individually, each individual, did Mr. Fisher say 15,000 something?"
2007.07-219,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5323.011,5332.951,"Well, from the stand... first of all, from the stand point of a company it doesn't matter whether you pay one person 500 million dollars or a lot of people 500 million dollars, in terms of punishment and deterrence."
2007.07-219,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5442.355,5443.938,"Thank you, Counsel."
