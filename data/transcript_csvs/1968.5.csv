1968.5,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,7.787,Sydney Street Appellant versus New York.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,9.936,15.636,Good morning Mr. Chief Justice.
1968.5,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,15.636,27.094,"Before you start, I should have said that the orders of the Court have been certified by the Chief Justice and filed with the Court below will not be announced thoroughly."
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,30.38,33.926,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.5,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,180.749,189.322,"Mr. Goldstick, Judge Fuld and his recital of the facts and his opinions for the Court of Appeals."
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,206.235,220.524,"Now, we don't know if factual error then and I'll tell why Mr. Justice, because they also testified that he came over after the burning and that he questioned the person street there at the corner."
1968.5,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,239.755,249.004,I went to the record pretty carefully yesterday and I didn't see that there was anything to support the statement that you're client as he was burning the flag --
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,249.004,249.084,"Oh, that's quite so."
1968.5,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,249.084,252.314,"It put it off, so he came told the small crowd that he collected --"
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,252.314,253.495,Oh that's quite so.
1968.5,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,522.423,535.461,"You know really, do you really argue that State of New York could not constitutionally outlaw the defacing of the flag by physical acts?"
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,535.461,537.221,I do not Mr. Justice Fortas.
1968.5,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,538.183,538.898,You don't take that position?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,538.898,540.652,I do not.
1968.5,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,540.652,547.882,"So, it's a speech element here that or the speech or so called “symbolic speech” about issue you here."
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,547.882,564.94,"It bothers me very much and it also bothers me that a statute on its face that is so restrictive goes far beyond the limited powers that Mr. Justice Fortas is referring to, and that even if we assume that it could do what Mr. Justice Fortas says, I quite agree with you and all likely we're going to probably could."
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,570.42,575.208,"Now, Mr. Goldstick, I didn't quite understand, what position do you not take?"
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,575.208,580.939,I do have the position that the State of New York had not regulate conduct towards the flag.
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,592.514,595.786,I didn't understand your brief to take that position.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,595.786,622.542,"You know, last night I really struggled with this problem myself because I've been struggling with it for two years, and I must confess to Your Honor that I have been back and forth on the power of the state to regulate conduct towards the flag, and I have to take the position that in this case it makes no difference, whether or not we were to decide that the State of New York does have such power."
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,626.487,629.408,Just for this branch of your argument or your whole case?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,629.408,640.011,"I'm willing to concede for the entire case that there is a limited amount of power that the State of New York has to regulate conduct, conduct towards the flag."
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.011,647.099,I take it though you would say that power ends as just the moment that the conduct is communicative.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,647.099,648.906,Absolutely.
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.906,654.77,Even though and it ends as soon as there is a claim that is communicative?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,654.77,663.56,"Well, I would say first, we may not even have to reach that point because the statute on its face, obviously, restricts communicative acts."
1968.5,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,730.322,741.254,"Let me see if I follow you because your concession doesn't dispose in a matter for this Court, but I want to get your position clear."
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,771.919,775.794,I do not.
1968.5,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,775.794,777.402,I'd like an addition to that.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,781.597,783.323,I'm sorry Mr. Chief Justice --
1968.5,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,783.323,789.369,"But if an addition to burning the flag, he uses some language such as he does here?"
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,792.042,793.175,"That is the nub, isn't it?"
1968.5,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,793.175,793.659,I beg your pardon.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,793.659,799.537,"That is the nub of the problem isn't it, because that is exactly what we are saying."
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,820.836,825.333,Don't you think there'd be any First Amendment problem and the case put to you by Mr. Justice Fortas?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,825.333,826.401,Not necessarily.
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,835.995,838.468,What if he has not saying anything?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,838.468,839.117,No words?
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,839.384,840.777,Don't you think there's First Amendment problem?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,840.777,842.774,"No, I don't see where the communication is."
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,845.299,847.81,Don't you think that's a communication ended up itself?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,847.81,851.8,"Not necessarily, if I filled myself with a couple of statute, I'm sorry."
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.8,853.387,But it is.
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,855.9,857.567,That's right.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,857.567,859.658,Could it be.
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,861.812,868.052,You mean that we have instead of word here that same word with -- it is like you --
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,868.052,871.214,If Street had not said a word -- not necessarily.
1968.5,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,926.656,942.622,"Yes, I might question which you've answered, I assumed that I postulated that the statute did not contain, did not contain any reference to verbal statements but the New York statute does since you pointed out?"
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,942.622,944.838,I agree with Mr. Chief --Mr. Justice --
1968.5,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,944.838,947.261,I'm not indicating in the attitude of the --
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,947.261,948.255,I understand.
1968.5,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,948.343,958.863,-- or in the language of the New York statute in this respect does and does not make a difference but you answer to my question was very carefully restrictive.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,958.863,959.989,Thank you.
1968.5,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,960.097,965.647,May I ask you a connection with the precise argument you are now making.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,992.163,1004.247,"Mr. Justice Black, I hope by the time I finish today, and after this Court has seriously considered the merits of this case that that statement would not be the law of this land."
1968.5,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1004.247,1006.451,"In other words, we'd have to overrule this."
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1006.451,1016.53,I'm not saying that because you don't even have to reach that question because we have a statute on its face that it breaches freedom of speech that you don't even have to reach that problem.
1968.5,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1017.267,1027.874,"Why don't you have to reach it, if you say that the conduct itself did not violate the Constitution, but it does violate it because of the language use at the time?"
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1027.874,1054.57,"The reason Mr. Justice Black, I say we don't have to reach it is because, Street was convicted under a statute that is unconstitutional on it's face as being a obvious restriction on verbal speech, it says you can't use words and that he has a right I believe, to attack that statute and thereby attack his conviction even though New York may well have the right to outlaw exactly what he did."
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.643,1112.409,May I just ask you about it?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1112.409,1113.837,Yes.
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.837,1131.483,I noticed that Judge Fuld's opinion doesn't deal with your argument which I gather as an argument of overbreadth that because the statute deals both with conduct and words this appellant has standing to attack constitutionally of the statute on its face.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1132.334,1133.062,Yes it is.
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1133.062,1136.104,"Now, why is it that Judge Fuld's opinion didn't deal with that?"
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1136.104,1139.216,He dealt with it only on a footnote.
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.511,1144.813,Which footnote?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1153.175,1153.884,We did.
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1169.744,1171.389,But how bout the trial court?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1171.389,1177.082,"And well, at the trial court, I might point out that if you have an examination of the record."
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1203.193,1206.884,So?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1206.884,1223.699,"I would -- it would be my understandings provided any issue on First Amendment infirmities raised and in any manner what so whether, whether be overbreadth or void on its face or improper application of the statute would still be a First Amendment objection and properly raised --"
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1223.699,1240.748,"Well, what would you say if we have -- we taught we had to read Judge Fuld's opinion as not twiddling of a question because as a matter of State Law your failure to raise a trial included any right to have it consider in the appellate courts."
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1243.57,1265.659,But I -- of course if you read it as if I did not raise it but it was raised that you see raised in my motion at the trial court I raised First Amendment objections I said the statute is void for First Amendment problems and Judge Fuld pass on First Amendment problems and there whole question of overbreadth is First Amendment not a vagueness or due process problem.
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1265.659,1274.264,What if the Court disagree with you on that and since said that you have to raise a little more precisely --
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1274.264,1279.799,I have no argument with Mr. Justice White if that is your decision certainly under the rules of this Court --
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1279.799,1283.012,It is First Amendment raises all issues under the First Amendment?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1283.012,1284.698,I would believe so that it does.
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.698,1288.546,Do you have to – is that – do you have to rely on that?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1288.546,1291.041,"No, not to and this case?"
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.859,1299.312,As far as overbreadth is you have to rely on that position?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1299.312,1301.109,"Yes, I would."
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.109,1316.116,Did you think them as this is the rule of New York that – is it the general rule at to that the appellate court doesn't consider things is not – that their not believe in that one?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1316.116,1323.552,Not so because the Court of Appeals are considered the vagueness question which was not raised at the Criminal Court level.
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.666,1349.066,"Well, except there's something else that the fact is bothered me Mr. Goldstick and that reason I ask you about your answer to Justice Fortas question."
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1378.921,1398.134,"In due deference to Your Honors observation, I again refer back to page 8a of the opinion as to the construction and the statute and it seems to me that the language by discouraging contemptuous and insulting treatment of the flag in public is a construction given to this statute by Judge Fuld and I might--"
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1398.134,1415.597,"What do you think for that first footnote means the last phrase in it, “That the provision was meant to apply to public mutilation of the American flag.”"
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1415.597,1416.761,I can't answer that question.
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1416.761,1421.552,"Well, it means obviously its means something you and I would have to agree."
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1421.552,1433.537,"Of course, it mean something but I think there's another – there's another answer to your question Your Honor and that is simply that the construction of the Court of Appeals was not available to the Criminal Court judge when he tried the case."
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.537,1442.017,"Now, I suppose you could -- the whole of your function that page the --"
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1442.017,1443.075,Page 13 a
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.075,1448.564,"Oh, this is it, before we plead to this case I'd like to make a motion of dismiss, is that it?"
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1448.564,1449.073,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1449.542,1455.354,"And what is it in that motion that you say, raises the overbreadth question?"
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1455.354,1467.013,Simply the reference the First Amendment that day -- we were engage in the First Amendment activities.
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.013,1473.029,Under the First Amendment -- am I correct so this is the only reference is in it the First Amendment?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1494.236,1496.24,"Absolutely, Your Honor and I might say we have had it in a --"
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.24,1503.482,"Well, I must say in the face of it Mr. Goldstick that reached to me something like an argument base on symbolic speech."
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1508.339,1518.561,I might add Your Honor that we also had it in a trial memorandum when we made the motion and the trial memorandum had a full point on overbreadth.
1968.5,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1610.76,1636.166,"I thought Chief Judge Fuld's opinion had to be read some what differently that is to say that, assuming that this is within the embed of the First Amendment the statute and prosecution here are within the embed of the First Amendment the conviction was never the less justified on the trial acclaimed present danger principle."
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1653.839,1669.736,"Mr. Justice Fortas, this Court I recommend to your reading the record and of course under your power you have the right to review the record with regards to the finding of the Court of Appeals and I simply submit that Judge Fuld's observations are not supported by those--"
1968.5,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1669.736,1679.013,I'm not unless I don't argue of that as my reading in your judgment is my reading of what Judge Fuld was saying incorrect.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1722.109,1742.364,"Well, his analysis if I understand it, would be on base upon the power of the state to make some regulations even though they may fly in the face of First Amendment problems and the issue then becomes where is the line drawn between what the state can do with regards to First Amendment problems."
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.508,1786.424,Are we to lead everything that Chief Judge Fuld said against the background of its opening sentence in the opinion?
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1796.045,1798.843,"I can't answer that question, I don't know."
1968.5,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.74,1814.205,We often it to so our opinion with a statement of the question hoping the opinion will then be read as bearing on as answering the question that so with which the opinion open.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1824.13,1834.034,"Oh, I see what the point of Your Honor and I seem to feel it that that maybe so but does not mean that the point was not properly raised or perhaps we -- perhaps just discarded."
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1840.301,1840.938,Mr. Goldstick.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1840.938,1841.295,Yes.
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1841.295,1851.456,"You haven't' --I think I'm right to saying that you haven't mentioned in your brief or in your oral argument that the possibility of mootness in this case, do you think that's a problem?"
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1851.456,1858.404,It was brief Your Honor in the -- in our appeal to this Court.
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1858.404,1859.053,In your appeal --
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1859.053,1859.093,Yes.
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1859.093,1859.921,-- but not in your brief on the matter.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1859.921,1871.453,"Yes, and it really is not moot from Mr. Street point of view because if this conviction is affirmed, we have a hearing waiting for us back before the New York City Transit Authority on this man's job."
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1876.643,1880.912,"Although, he was given a suspended sentence and the period is now past --"
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1880.912,1881.042,Yes.
1968.5,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1881.042,1884.59,-- I understand it during which he any other sentence could have privacy impose.
1968.5,0,20919,david_t_goldstick,,1884.59,1892.164,That is quite true but I have a letter in my file from the Transit Authority they're holding up the hearing waiting the determination of this Court.
1968.5,1,26586,harry_brodbar,,1897.272,1897.43,Mr. Chief Justice --
1968.5,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1897.43,1899.45,Mr. Brodbar.
1968.5,1,26586,harry_brodbar,,1899.45,1902.736,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.5,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2077.842,2080.175,"Mr. Brodbar, how many people are there?"
1968.5,1,26586,harry_brodbar,,2080.175,2082.411,"30 to 40 people, Your Honor."
