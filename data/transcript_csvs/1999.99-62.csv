1999.99-62,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.327,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-62, the Santa Fe Independent School District v. Jane Doe, et al.--"
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,10.551,13.137,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-62,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,55.639,60.294,"Restraints, are they not?"
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,60.294,70.068,"--I think it's similar to the topical restriction that you would see in a limited public forum case, a Rosenberger, for instance, in the situation there, where it had to be related to educational mission."
1999.99-62,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,70.717,74.325,"Well, it's a little more precise and constrained than that, is it not?"
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,83.002,84.354,--I would think the school district--
1999.99-62,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,105.304,113.287,"Would it not... rather than an Establishment Clause problem, what if somebody chose to speak on the subject that, all religion's bunk?"
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,113.287,114.29,--We--
1999.99-62,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,114.29,122.573,"I mean, does that comport with the... I'm not sure what solemnizing a football game is, but assuming there is such a process--"
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,123.796,133.51,"--Well, I think that in a situation like that it would be perfectly appropriate, if the student felt that was going to create the appropriate environment for competition, to engage in that kind of speech."
1999.99-62,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,137.167,146.548,"Then what does... just tell me... maybe this is not important, but what is it, what would it be to solemnize a football game?"
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,154.615,154.955,"--No, I--"
1999.99-62,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,154.955,158.144,What is solemnization here?
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,158.144,163.857,"--Solemnization is bringing about respect, honor, and dignity, and a secular invocation, even, could take place."
1999.99-62,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,166.956,168.078,What is a secular invocation?
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,168.078,174.036,"--Let every one here... I ask everybody's participation for student safety, and let's encourage good sportsmanship."
1999.99-62,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,175.971,179.415,"Well, that's a nice speech, but it's not what we normally mean by invocation."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,179.415,180.472,But even--
1999.99-62,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,180.472,195.331,"And one of the problems, it seems to me, with your case, and one of the problems with the premise of your argument is that it assumes that this language, which we see on the face of the policy now, is descriptive of what, in fact, is going on."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,237.012,246.083,"--First, this is a facial challenge, and the respondents bear the burden here of establishing that there's no basis upon which the policy can be implemented in a constitutional way."
1999.99-62,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,248.389,258.021,"But the... on a facial challenge, we are not required to close our eyes to the context in which the language has come to be."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,262.586,264.532,Hail Mary would probably be appropriate.
1999.99-62,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,264.532,270.687,"--But we don't wait for that, but we don't close our eyes to the context in which the policy arose."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,270.687,294.816,"I think that's correct, and the context upon which this policy arose was after the decision in Lee v. Weisman litigation in this case arose, this school district, pursuant to a district court order, adopted a policy which was actually broader than the district court's order, and here I think it's important to emphasize that the individual student selected, if, in fact, there is a decision to have a student give a message, that that student is the circuit breaker."
1999.99-62,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,298.755,298.98,Let me ask you about that--
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,298.98,299.454,"Yes, Justice."
1999.99-62,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,299.454,303.57,"--Mr. Sekulow, and to conserve your time I'll just state my concern--"
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,303.57,304.867,Sure.
1999.99-62,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,304.867,306.486,--rather than ask a series of questions.
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,360.876,361.794,There's two responses--
1999.99-62,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,361.794,363.271,And if... and I'll just finish.
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,368.493,370.868,"--Well, there is not a majority vote on prayer in this case."
1999.99-62,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,382.373,395.63,"But the point of the question, of course, is that there may well be a campaign among students to be chosen and, if that's the situation, then how do you respond to Justice Kennedy's question?"
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,395.63,402.411,"The district court... and this policy came out of the context of a district court order, which specifically stated that there would be no campaigning allowed on campus."
1999.99-62,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,405.848,407.176,But it could be off campus.
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,407.176,426.075,"--Sure it could, certainly, but again there is an independent speaker here, and that is the student and no one knows, whether they campaigned or not, what that high school student might say, and I think specifically to strike this policy down requires that the Establishment Clause now place an affirmative obligation on the school district to censor only the religious message of the student and that--"
1999.99-62,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,426.075,429.462,Do you think there's a First Amendment problem in a rule that prohibits campaigning?
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,429.462,431.586,"--Well, that would be a different case, and--"
1999.99-62,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,431.586,435.199,But it would be rather strange to be relying on such a rule.
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,435.199,440.059,"--Well, that's the policy that the district court issued and that is... the order, rather, that the district court issued."
1999.99-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,440.059,452.386,"Well, I guess Justice Kennedy's problem would be eliminated if the school simply said, the captain of the football team shall deliver the solemnizing message or invocation."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,452.386,455.739,"I think it would be... again, as long as it's a neutral criteria--"
1999.99-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,455.739,461.437,"And if that's the only thing that's... you know, that has to be fiddled with in this arrangement we haven't achieved a whole lot here."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,461.437,462.799,"--Well, I suspect that--"
1999.99-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.799,470.917,"Or perhaps they could say the student with the highest grade, or something else, and then you wouldn't have the election, and then it would be okay."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,470.917,471.88,--As long as there's a neutral criterion.
1999.99-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.437,481.523,"Now, before this, I guess before Lee v. Weisman the school used to have somebody deliver a... an invocation--"
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,481.523,483.309,--There was a chaplain.
1999.99-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.309,487.422,--which was... was it nonsectarian religious?
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,487.422,493.637,"There is nothing in the record regarding the specific content of the prayers under this policy, and there's nothing in the record really about--"
1999.99-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.637,494.645,"It could have been, though."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,494.645,494.936,--It could have been.
1999.99-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.297,501.201,"Whereas under this policy you must allow the student, if he wishes, to invoke Jesus Christ, or--"
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,501.201,502.394,That's correct.
1999.99-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,502.394,503.591,"--or say a Hail Mary, or anything else."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,503.591,504.14,That's correct.
1999.99-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,504.14,505.766,That's a real advance.
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,505.766,507.497,The school district has taken a hands off approach here.
1999.99-62,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,523.241,533.638,"Well, when the student goes to the community as the representative of the school, I should think we would want to have some ongoing supervision by the regular faculty."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,556.376,556.746,--That's correct.
1999.99-62,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,556.746,557.115,--if we can.
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,557.115,558.447,And we stay neutral.
1999.99-62,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,570.654,572.046,"Yes, but what do we do about the history?"
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,572.046,592.134,"I think the history is relevant only in this context, that before there was the decision Lee v. Weisman, school districts like this one and others around the country, there was prayer going on and speeches going on in sporting events, or at sporting events and, in this particular case, this school district is trying to comply with this Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence by adopting a neutral--"
1999.99-62,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,592.134,610.095,"Mr. Sekulow, would it comply equally well if the school district said, now, football is a big event in this school district and everybody comes to the game Friday night, so we want to have everybody, all the registered voters... there are more adults than the school students."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,627.887,632.238,"--Well, I think the question first would be whether the... a school district would have the authority to call a general election."
1999.99-62,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,635.636,642.751,"Whoever... the school district says, we would like this to be as democratic as possible, so we want to use the democratic process."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,642.751,647.87,--If it's... it would depend... it's too late in the day to argue that facts and circumstances don't have an impact.
1999.99-62,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,673.867,678.766,"Mr. Sekulow, I don't think that... perhaps I didn't convey clearly enough what I meant."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,701.716,716.316,"--Justice Ginsburg, students and adults and members of the community vote throughout both the student's academic life and when they're an adult, and I think if a school district was trying to inculcate the idea of a democratic society and participation, that it would encourage a student voter."
1999.99-62,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,724.843,740.983,"Well, we had a case decided just this term dealing with submitting to student election the participation and use of student fees for certain purposes and expressed some concerns about that mechanism, didn't we?"
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,740.983,747.448,"--That's correct, and in Southworth the concern was the issue of viewpoint neutrality in regard to majoritarian vote."
1999.99-62,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,754.447,764.721,"Well, I don't have too much... in Southworth we'd already... our predicate was there'd already been invasion of First Amendment rights, and this was just a corrective, and here the whole question is, ab initio, what are the--"
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,764.721,765.529,That's correct.
1999.99-62,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,766.197,779.954,"--the rights of this... it seems to me what we're concerned about is avoiding the schools becoming a forum for religious debates, and one thing we could do is say, it is unconstitutional, illegal to say a prayer at all."
1999.99-62,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,785.65,787.335,--There would be very serious First Amendment issues.
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1010.83,1017.596,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.99-62,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1072.993,1089.648,"General, do you assert that this facial challenge has to fail simply because it is not necessarily the case that whatever student is selected will deliver a prayer or a religious invocation?"
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1092.397,1093.548,"No, Your Honor."
1999.99-62,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1119.318,1123.125,"I thought your answer to Justice Scalia would be yes, it's completely sufficient."
1999.99-62,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1124.672,1125.62,--You surprised me.
1999.99-62,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1125.62,1126.832,Maybe nobody will--
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1127.461,1130.585,I misspoke if that was my answer.
1999.99-62,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.133,1158.421,"As soon as it's in place once and they give one prayer, then the case is back."
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1158.895,1167.138,"--I think not, Your Honor, and let me just... unless the Court is going to say the school district must engage in viewpoint discrimination--"
1999.99-62,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1167.138,1169.435,But that's your basic substantive argument.
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1191.355,1194.223,"--Well, the only reason we believe--"
1999.99-62,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1194.223,1194.622,"I mean, it's--"
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1194.622,1199.299,--that this policy is constitutional is because it is neutral with regard to the message.
1999.99-62,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1199.299,1199.818,--General Cornyn--
1999.99-62,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1199.818,1200.117,--All right.
1999.99-62,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1200.396,1204.96,"--on the neutrality, may I ask you, that's been repeated by Mr. Sekulow and you."
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1246.285,1280.258,"Of course, this facial challenge, the policy that has yet to actually be applied, we can only be left to speculate, but let me suggest that in Bethel v. Fraser, Matthew Fraser, who was disciplined for making a sexually explicit speech when nominating a fellow student for student council, was later elected by his peers to speak at the graduation ceremony, and I think respondent's argument is really just wrong in that it assumes what the nature of the speech will ultimately be, the criterion upon which the student will be selected."
1999.99-62,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1280.258,1291.682,"General, I assume that that statement in Rosenberger, which said the full spectrum of political speech, focused on political speech because that's what the policy that the school put in place was intended to foster."
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1335.264,1348.284,"Under Cornelius and other cases by this Court the school officials can keep the students on topic for the purpose for which the opportunity to speak is allowed, but solemnization--"
1999.99-62,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1348.284,1364.874,"--Let's assume that they stay on topic and, taking Justice Ginsburg's question as limited to that, I think she's asking a factual question, not a question about precedent but a question about fact, what could be expected, and let me just add a footnote to her question."
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1374.393,1379.891,"--I just don't think any of us know, and I don't think the Court should have to guess."
1999.99-62,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1379.891,1406.985,"But the question is, do we have reason, if we're going to apply this definition of neutrality, and assuming it's appropriate, do we have reason to believe that, over time, that kind of a spectrum of expression on religious subjects is going to occur here, and I mean, the point of my question is, I don't think there's any reason to expect that there's going to be a speech at those football games saying religion is bunk."
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1406.985,1411.041,"Respectfully, Your Honor, we just don't know, and I don't think--"
1999.99-62,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1411.041,1411.421,Well--
1999.99-62,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1411.421,1417.835,"--That's what's worrying... look, from an Establishment Clause point of view, this is a mechanism."
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1459.756,1473.636,"--Your Honor, in a world where free speech is valued, where private free speech is valued, we are all inundated by messages we disagree with and find ourselves in a minority status from... on a daily, perhaps hourly basis."
1999.99-62,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1473.636,1491.827,"That's true, but the purpose of the Establishment Clause is to allow families to raise their children in the religion of their choice, and we have schools favoring one religion over another, and giving that kind of message, isn't that very contrary to the purpose?"
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1491.827,1494.16,"Respectfully, Justice Breyer, I disagree."
1999.99-62,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1501.04,1513.583,"Well, but it is through the mechanism of the school organizing a majoritarian vote to determine it, which is a very unusual sort of an arrangement."
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1516.632,1528.382,"Justice O'Connor, of course, as this Court's observed, there are always going to be interaction between school officials and religious expression, and it's impossible to totally separate the two."
1999.99-62,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1528.681,1546.673,"Well, presumably if this mechanism is approved here the same thing could be done in every classroom every day, and let the students decide each day on a speaker for the day to start the class and so forth."
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1552.758,1564.553,"--We certainly do not submit that this could occur in the classroom which, as the Court observed, risks the appearance of Government entanglement, and with compulsory education requirements and the like."
1999.99-62,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1566.145,1568.41,"But may I ask this question, just to be sure I have it in mind?"
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1568.41,1569.028,Yes.
1999.99-62,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1569.028,1575.011,"The person who's elected gives the solemnizing invocation for every football game at home, right?"
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1575.011,1576.638,Message or invocation.
1999.99-62,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1576.638,1586.243,"Whatever it is, but repeated messages, so that if the school disapproved of the first message that the person gave, the person could continue to give the same message over and over again?"
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1591.091,1592.343,"Yes, sir, they could."
1999.99-62,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1600.782,1603.909,And supposing he made an appeal to one particular denomination.
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1612.955,1615.42,--If it was not on topic--
1999.99-62,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1615.42,1622.035,"Well, it's right within... squarely within the language of the policy."
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1625.537,1627.594,--May I answer the question?
1999.99-62,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1627.594,1628.806,"Yes, you may, shortly."
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1628.806,1636.67,"It would be impermissible for school officials to edit or censor the content of the speech, as long as it was on topic."
1999.99-62,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1636.67,1638.361,Even if it's overtly sectarian?
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1638.361,1640.337,"As long as it's on topic, that's correct."
1999.99-62,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1640.337,1641.479,"Thank you, General Cornyn."
1999.99-62,1,29486,john_cornyn,,1641.479,1642.567,Thank you.
1999.99-62,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.567,1644.521,"Mr. Griffin, we'll hear from you."
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,1644.521,1651.412,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.99-62,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.219,1671.155,Could I ask you about that?
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,1680.957,1685.982,"One parent is... one parent, one group of plaintiffs were Catholic, a Catholic family."
1999.99-62,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1688.292,1691.874,Do people have rights to sue anonymously in Federal court?
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,1701.267,1722.257,"I think the jurisprudence is, if there is a threat of intimidation, if there's a threat of violence, if there's a threat... and I think there was testimony that... within the temporary injunction when the case first started that there was this threat, and the district court had entered an order instructing not to ferret out the names, and when there was an attempt to ferret out the names--"
1999.99-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1722.257,1723.899,"Well, how does the district court have authority to do that?"
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,1723.899,1731.717,"--Well, he had an attempt... he had the authority to protect the plaintiffs, in other words, from any threat."
1999.99-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1735.689,1736.989,What was the threat?
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,1736.989,1756.369,"The threat was, we had information that certain children were intimidated, certain children were pushed, certain plaintiffs, certain people who were not plaintiffs had to pull their children out of the school because of protesting the prayer policies that existed in Santa Fe, and that there was a intimate threat that the district court saw it necessary to protect."
1999.99-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1756.369,1761.029,"Well, do you think the district court just has complete discretion to grant anonymity that way?"
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,1761.029,1779.959,"I don't think the district court has the complete discretion, and I think that one of the issues that we briefed at the trial court below was that issue, and when we got to the... into the hearing of July of 19 and 96, the district court said, now that we're going into a hearing, these names must be revealed, but we will do it under protection."
1999.99-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1786.229,1787.167,Their names ultimately were--
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,1787.167,1787.824,--Yes.
1999.99-62,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.048,1897.689,"--Of course, it wasn't clear at the time... in fact, it still isn't clear, is it +/?"
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,1921.157,1934.758,"--Justice Scalia, I think that's a good point, but one of the things... we oftentimes speak to our lawyers, and one of the things we cited in our briefs was, the lawyer for Santa Fe admitted to the district court that Lee v. Weisman had not been extended... excuse me."
1999.99-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1958.922,1969.872,Is that so strange that an attorney would want to press a particular decision the way his clients wanted to go as far as it could be pressed?
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,1969.872,1986.641,"--It's strange in this context, that you have a official policy that's still in existence in 1996, 1995 that defines a chaplain to do prayer at all events and all meetings, and that's a student officer."
1999.99-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.641,1988.579,"That isn't the present policy, is it?"
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,1988.579,2007.668,"Well, it changes, and if I can address the Court's... what, in fact, occurred, Chief Justice, what in fact occurred is, after the lawsuit was filed, the school district then said, let's conduct a vote to determine whether there's prayer, in other words, majoritarian vote."
1999.99-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.602,2012.399,"Well, what's that got to do with it?"
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2012.399,2026.075,"Well, they then changed the policy, and they changed the policy in September of 1995, and in September of 1995 they changed it to read, prayer... excuse me."
1999.99-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2058.562,2059.081,Mr.--
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2059.081,2060.273,--an invocation.
1999.99-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2060.273,2071.308,--I'm curious to know why you're going into these antecedent details when the question we granted certiorari on is the present policy.
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2071.308,2073.952,"Two reasons, Your Honor."
1999.99-62,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.458,2095.485,And how does that bear on your argument?
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2095.485,2096.849,"Well, two points."
1999.99-62,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2128.141,2132.657,"Well, I'm not saying that you can't try your case or argue the case that way."
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2156.731,2157.929,Yes.
1999.99-62,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.908,2167.821,"Well, it can be majoritarian prayer, and you expect that in most cases it will be, but it need not be."
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2167.821,2168.175,No.
1999.99-62,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.175,2169.158,"I mean, on it's face, it need not be."
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2169.158,2173.844,"On it's face, it's majoritarian prayer, that in fact the school board comes in--"
1999.99-62,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2173.844,2177.806,"No, but the majority can elect somebody who does not want to give a prayer."
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2177.806,2178.864,--They can.
1999.99-62,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2178.864,2182.184,So then it's not necessarily majoritarian prayer.
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2182.184,2190.424,"And they can elect to give, they can elect a person to give a prayer for the next 10 years who will not give a prayer."
1999.99-62,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2190.424,2195.321,But you can't say that in every case it's going to produce a prayer.
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2229.05,2231.92,"Well, we... well, may I address that, Justice Scalia?"
1999.99-62,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2231.92,2232.933,I hope you will.
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2232.933,2233.5,Okay.
1999.99-62,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.421,2280.409,"Why... I don't think that you have to show, in order to prove this is a neutral law, that somebody can get up and say religion is bunk."
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2310.311,2325.59,"Student initiated prayer in my mind has it that if I have a different faith, or faith, I can pray before the football game, I can pray after the football game, I can even pray during the football game."
1999.99-62,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2336.21,2337.264,So you would--
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2337.264,2338.013,That's not the concept--
1999.99-62,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2338.013,2356.505,"--So you would say that even if these speakers were chosen by lot, and they were widely representative speakers on a statistical basis, that if, by chance, one out of five were giving prayers, that it would be an unlawful exercise one... that one fifth of the time?"
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2356.505,2360.425,"--It depends on, Justice Kennedy, what the policy would say."
1999.99-62,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2367.251,2371.87,They're chosen by lot to represent the school and give the school a good name.
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2371.87,2374.513,Tougher question.
1999.99-62,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2385.289,2387.35,"Well, I'd like to know just a little bit about that."
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2402.596,2410.1,I think oftentimes when there's disaster people bond in their churches.
1999.99-62,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2430.524,2431.593,"Well, let me ask you this."
1999.99-62,2,16090,anthony_p_griffin,,2450.465,2451.979,I still think that it's problematic.
1999.99-62,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3325.558,3327.054,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-62,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3356.753,3361.517,"Well, there is only one speech under the policy that the school board has adopted."
1999.99-62,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3373.348,3380.916,"Well, in that context, the Equal Access Act was triggered if there was only one noncurriculum related student group, so the fact that it's one speaker--"
1999.99-62,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3380.916,3383.138,Then there... there's another to have equal access.
1999.99-62,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3386.368,3391.291,"--And that one student, that one student determines the content of their message."
1999.99-62,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3425.234,3441.181,"If under this policy it turned out that every speech was an invocation, including of the Deity, then what would you say about an as applied challenge?"
1999.99-62,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3441.181,3449.171,"--Well, I would say this is a facial challenge and that would be an as applied challenge, and there would have to be empirical evidence that, in fact, there was forum domination."
1999.99-62,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3478.676,3487.065,"But the student speaker, at least on this record that we have, and we have a brief to that effect, says, I'm not going to try to disguise what I'm doing."
1999.99-62,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3495.502,3518.851,"--The Court's referring to the Ward litigation and interesting, there, the school district was actually sued because, in trying to comply with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, they adopted a guideline that said, message only, and specifically stated that there would be no religious message being allowed to be given at all, and a district court judge issued a temporary restraining order saying that that's viewpoint discrimination, which is exactly our point."
1999.99-62,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3518.851,3521.145,But you're switching from the point that I was making.
1999.99-62,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3530.858,3533.035,"Mr. Chief Justice, I see my time has expired."
1999.99-62,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3533.035,3534.894,"Thank you, Mr. Sekulow."
