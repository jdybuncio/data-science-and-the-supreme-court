2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.538,"We'll hear argument next in case number 01-131, Gary Gisbrecht vs. Jo Anne Barnhart."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,18.826,54.036,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We are asking this Court to recognize a simple principle that a federal statute requires that an attorney fee be contingent on success in litigation, that when the court determines an attorney fee pursuant to that statute, an attorney fee should reflect the contingent nature of the fee, thus because 406(b) requires a contingent fee in Social Security cases, when the district court determined the reasonable fee pursuant to 406(b) that attorney fee must reflect the contingent nature of the fee."
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,54.036,62.787,"Let me ask you a question about the limits of the extent of the prohibition, whatever is in 406(b)."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,71.786,86.275,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it's possible to interpret the statute in a way that would not criminalize charging a claimant a noncontingent fee, however the existing practice in the bar is to take it as prohibiting charging a noncontingent fee?"
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,86.275,91.022,"Well, there anything more authoritative as the existing practice of the bar that would lead to that conclusion?"
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,91.022,100.31,I would direct the Court's attention to the 406(b)(2) where it sets forth the criminal penalties for violation of the statute.
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,128.711,130.775,Because that's how they get counsel?
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,130.775,131.889,Absolutely.
2001.01-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,139.941,154.924,"Well, if the statute, 406(b) reads as though when there is a judgment favorable to the claimant, the court may allow a reasonable fee."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,160.496,166.319,--I believe this Court's decision in Christenberg Garments is relevant.
2001.01-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.017,199.756,"Well, it suggests perhaps that the court would allow a fee, but it seems open-ended that it will allow the court to determine the fee any way it wants on the lodestar method or via, by some other method."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,199.756,217.976,"--Justice O'Connor, I believe the statute should be interpreted relative to the legal context in which it was enacted in 1965, which additional role of state courts rule on contingent fee agreements was to decide where the agreed upon amount between the parties was excessive or abusive."
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.976,221.88,"That wasn't personal to any statutory mandate, was it?"
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,226.71,235.172,"Yes, the federal courts in the early '60s, in 1965, doubted whether they even had the authority to rule on the appropriateness of a contingent fee."
2001.01-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.812,253.914,"Well, you think the language of the statute requires a contingent fee?"
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,257.546,264.399,--That any attorney fee has to be contingent on success in the litigation that could be different fee agreements.
2001.01-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.924,295.978,But you think that the implication of this statute is that the court has to base it on the agreement of the attorney and the attorney's client?
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,295.978,296.35,--Yes.
2001.01-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,297.853,299.489,Because it done say that.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,308.694,310.096,"--But, Justice O'Connor."
2001.01-131,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,325.7,334.45,"Well, before lodestar, there were other descriptions for reasonable fees that depended on hours, degree of difficulty, etcetera etcetera."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,336.93,337.589,--Yes.
2001.01-131,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,360.418,375.318,"I think this is a very difficult case because either way, we are going to be, I mean on which circuits involved, we are going to be upsetting standard arrangements, contingent fees in some cases."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,384.484,386.713,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2001.01-131,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,422.295,426.753,"Well, but, of course, that assumes that you are correct here."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,436.041,437.816,Yes.
2001.01-131,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,437.816,440.499,Quite without reference to your statutory argument?
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,440.499,441.077,Yes.
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,460.729,468.819,But it seems to me you have got to get back to the statute and say why the statute should be read the way you want it to.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,501.634,507.085,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that the practice before 1965 is relevant."
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,540.067,544.442,"But it doesn't say anything in (b)(1)(a) about contingent fees, does it?"
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,544.442,545.102,No.
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.161,555.216,"Well, if you get a favorable judgment--"
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,555.216,555.587,Right.
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,555.587,556.702,--You can get a fee.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,556.702,557.528,Yes.
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,557.528,559.014,Which isn't quite the same thing.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,559.014,568.136,We believe that the purpose of the statute expressed by Congress is fully implemented by our view.
2001.01-131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,568.136,570.82,Let me... I'm having trouble following your argument.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,583.33,584.649,Yes.
2001.01-131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,584.649,587.788,"All right, so we all assume in that sense every fee is contingent."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,587.788,589.313,Yes.
2001.01-131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,589.313,610.655,"But then I thought we were trying to distinguish within that universe between some circuits that say the way we should calculate that is by looking to what they call the lodestar, and other circuits that say the way we calculate it is we look to the agreement and if the agreement is for 25 percent of the recovery, that's where we start."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,612.513,613.461,"Yes, justice--"
2001.01-131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,613.461,614.287,All right.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,621.635,625.062,"--Well, there are significant variations of the lodestar method."
2001.01-131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,633.689,634.517,All right.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,676.127,679.015,"Justice, I believe there are variations."
2001.01-131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,679.015,682.443,"And there are some variations, but those are the two basic things."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,686.734,701.018,"We ask the court to, to specify that when a district court determines a reasonable fee under 406(b) it should start by asking first the question what is the agreed upon amount and is the agreed upon amount--"
2001.01-131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,710.056,701.018,Okay.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,719.799,728.072,"--I believe, Justice Breyer, that there could be possible, you could allow different circuits to do things in different ways, but the interest is in uniform federal law."
2001.01-131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,764.836,767.642,"Mr. Schnaufer, can I ask you this question?"
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,784.443,784.982,Yes.
2001.01-131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,785.475,791.669,So the agency sets a fee and it doesn't matter what the parties have agreed to before the agency.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,817.963,821.141,"Justice Scalia, I believe that the statute does not say."
2001.01-131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.286,839.967,"Well, it requires them to ignore it if it goes beyond what the agency determines is the maximum amount that ought to be charged."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,839.967,840.793,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,855.199,859.202,What about the provision at the administrative level that does refer to an agreement?
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,865.23,869.521,--Yes.
2001.01-131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,869.521,874.601,"--It controls with a cap of $4,000 at the agency level."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,874.601,876.58,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.01-131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,909.828,915.673,"May I ask, just a question of what this fee is composed of."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,937.426,944.28,"Justice Ginsburg, it depends on whether or not the claimant was represented during the administrative proceedings."
2001.01-131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,952.842,955.881,"--After winning in court, so they would be completely different."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,955.881,956.457,--Yes.
2001.01-131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,965.29,973.425,I believe there is another scheme I think that's more adhered than this Social Security scheme.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1002.608,1005.376,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.01-131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1051.361,1058.996,"So you are saying this is a more... this same statute came later, but that essentially, that they operate the same way?"
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1058.996,1061.392,"Yes, but with important differences."
2001.01-131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1121.7,1131.321,"If you place an objection to the lodestar method, you said this becomes a litigation that is embarrassingly longer than the litigation over the client itself."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1131.321,1138.297,"Justice Ginsburg, our objection to the lodestar method depends on how you, what you mean by the lodestar method."
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1149.358,1157.737,"The district court here relied on the bar fees in the Portland area, didn't it, for lawyers that have been practicing a certain amount of time?"
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1157.737,1159.678,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.08,1181.886,"Well, every fee is in a sense contingent on success."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1189.854,1190.802,Yes.
2001.01-131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.632,1233.61,"Mr. Schnaufer, here's my problem with, with your basic argument, which is look at the parties who negotiated a fee in another context, that negotiated fees with what the court begins with."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1247.168,1248.282,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1248.282,1258.419,"And there is testimony in this case that that is the universal practice, the universal practice of all the lawyers that represent these kind of, these kinds of clients."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1258.419,1259.699,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1259.699,1263.992,"And that, that 25 percent of back benefits is the maximum allowed by law?"
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1263.992,1265.561,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.561,1274.849,"Now, what, what reason is there to believe that this is a, you know, an honest evaluation by the two parties of what the, of what the lawyers' services are worth?"
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1305.042,1315.799,"Justice Scalia, I believe that if the statute specified a 5 percent maximum fee or 10 percent maximum fee, the attorneys would also generally charge, almost universally charge that same five or 10 percent."
2001.01-131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.344,1335.323,Sometimes it would be a larger part of the benefit.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1346.347,1353.322,"I think that, Justice Scalia, I think in this case it's useful to look at an example and see what that 25 percent cap actually does."
2001.01-131,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1383.499,1387.215,But your multiplication assumes a fictitious market.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1412.106,1414.335,"Justice Kennedy, I believe the hourly--"
2001.01-131,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1414.335,1421.227,"You, you, you made the assumption of a, of a fictitious market."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1421.227,1436.627,"--Justice Kennedy, I believe that the government concedes that there is a preloss in a typical Title II case and also the government's position was that the appropriate noncontingent win, lose or draw hourly rate was $125 for one of these attorneys."
2001.01-131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1465.81,1466.553,"Well, it will be--"
2001.01-131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1466.553,1470.351,--Let me ask you a question I have been trying to get in for a while here.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1490.247,1498.503,"--Justice Stevens, I believe that that would accomplish the goal readily, a local district court could adopt such a rule which would be consistent in 406(b)."
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1511.607,1520.506,"Well, the district court here expressed, perhaps it was a magistrate judge, expressed some skepticism as to the number of hours, I think, put in on one of these cases."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1520.506,1527.649,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that the district court judge disputed whether there was any special expertise involved."
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1534.458,1542.154,"Well, the fact the government didn't contest it doesn't mean that perhaps we shouldn't pay some attention to the view of the district judge."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1542.154,1546.241,The district court judge did award the number of hours requested.
2001.01-131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1552.828,1558.129,Why should we consider the separate fee under the equal access to justice act?
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1565.294,1575.219,--The statute concerns how much the client will actually end up paying his or her attorneys that the Equal Access Justice Act--
2001.01-131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1575.219,1577.348,And it says that they should pay a reasonable amount.
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1577.348,1579.412,--All right.
2001.01-131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1606.161,1608.019,How does it work under the fee-shifting--
2001.01-131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1608.019,1611.734,"--What you're saying in that view is that the equal access to justice fee is for the benefit of the lawyer, rather than the client."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1611.734,1624.26,"The EAJA itself, the offset provision states that the attorney should keep the larger of the 406(b) and the EAJA fee so the statute itself contemplates that the attorney is entitled to the larger fee."
2001.01-131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1624.26,1634.275,"In the context of a fee-shifting statute where EAJA applies, the lawyer gets the fees from the Defendant under EAJA."
2001.01-131,0,23240,eric_schnaufer,,1644.799,1645.625,Yes.
2001.01-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1673.656,1674.975,"Very well, Mr. Schnaufer."
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1676.75,1691.489,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: For three reasons the Court should use the lodestar method to determine and award a reasonable attorney's fee under the Social Security Act."
2001.01-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1712.665,1717.95,Does the lodestar method take into account the contingent nature of the recovery?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1717.95,1739.991,"Your Honor, the lodestar method permits district courts to take a number of factors into account in determining the reasonable hourly rate and the reasonable fee under this Court's decision in Dague, however, courts are not permitted to increase what would otherwise be a reasonable fee based on the mere fact that it was contingent."
2001.01-131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1739.991,1749.196,Would it be a reasonable fee if it included in the hourly rate reference to the fact that there is only a 1/3 success rate?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1762.571,1763.935,"No, Your Honor."
2001.01-131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1767.112,1775.368,Then that's a false market the district judge is using in order to award the fee.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1792.375,1797.205,"--Your Honor, I think there are at least the three responses to that."
2001.01-131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1807.774,1813.43,"What in that case, what statute were we interpreting?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1813.43,1815.698,"That involved Section 1988, Your Honor."
2001.01-131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1815.698,1816.319,Yes.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1817.062,1817.888,That's correct.
2001.01-131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1817.888,1828.329,"Not cases like this where there is a low success rate, and where the language of the statute says a reasonable fee."
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1828.329,1829.982,Your Honor--
2001.01-131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1829.982,1841.294,"I mean, why isn't the court, why can't the court determine it as it wishes, so long as it finds at the end of the day it's reasonable?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1854.79,1865.936,"--Your Honor, I think the statutory language is open to this Court and to courts generally to construe a standard that best furthers the purposes of the act."
2001.01-131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1868.082,1875.845,Do you think the statute requires that one particular method be selected or does it leave it up to the judge?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1875.845,1880.137,"--Your Honor, it certainly leaves it up to courts."
2001.01-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.026,1901.397,"Well I'm not, I'm not sure that fee-shifting statutes are necessarily an appropriate analogy here because perhaps there is no reason for requiring a Defendant to pay a lot of money because of an arrangement between the plaintiff and his attorney was contingent, and the attorney doesn't win many cases."
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1909.654,1935.699,"Your Honor, I think actually to the contrary in the contempt of fee-shifting statutes this Court has long recognized that the purpose of those statutes is merely to encourage lawyers to undertake that litigation, and nevertheless, this Court has said that a contingent enhancement is not necessary to provide that extra inducement that a lodestar calculation is adequate and appropriate in striking the balance that Congress intended when Congress only intends to encourage litigation."
2001.01-131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1947.382,1955.761,I can't understand your position that a reasonable fee must be determined without regards to the realities of the special practice.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1956.875,1960.113,"--Your Honor, that, that is simply not our position."
2001.01-131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1962.902,1966.346,Is one of the realities that you can win only a third of the time?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1966.346,1969.961,"Well, those numbers obviously vary."
2001.01-131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1972.457,1976.732,Let's assume that that is a given in the particular community and in the particular practice.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1976.732,1978.589,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1986.984,1994.11,"In the case that I put, can the judge or cannot the judge take into account the fact that the attorney is going to win only a third of the time?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1996.711,1999.85,"Your Honor, if what you mean by take into account--"
2001.01-131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1999.85,2002.162,That the hourly rate--
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2002.162,2018.426,"--That the court can increase the hourly rate in order to provide a subsidy from prevailing Social Security claimants to losing Social Security claimants, I think that would be inappropriate under this statute and under this Court's decisions in Dague, which although it is a different context, I think the difference is quite strongly in favor of applying the same rule here."
2001.01-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2018.426,2019.373,--It's not a subsidy.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2041.56,2043.234,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2001.01-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2043.234,2045.175,And it sounds to me so far there is no answer.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2045.175,2052.356,The point I was making is that it certainly is available to this Court to set a standard for courts to apply.
2001.01-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.356,2054.379,"If it's available, why wouldn't we do it?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2054.379,2056.237,"That's what I was trying to address, Your Honor."
2001.01-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.237,2056.897,All right.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2056.897,2064.699,I think the reason why this Court should not adopt a rule that would require the shifting of benefits in effect from successful Social Security--
2001.01-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.699,2065.525,That's what I asked.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2090.333,2092.646,"--But Your Honor, that's not necessarily true."
2001.01-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2096.195,2100.653,"Smith is paying, Smith is paying for the work done for the two guys who lost."
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2100.653,2101.851,That's correct.
2001.01-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2103.997,2104.701,One way to word that.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2104.701,2106.187,--That's the way this Court addressed it.
2001.01-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2106.187,2106.68,Okay.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2107.962,2109.01,That same analysis--
2001.01-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2109.01,2115.037,But why should we look at it that way since Smith is also paying for what it costs to serve Smith?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2115.037,2130.148,"--Your Honor, I think that the reason this Court should view contingency enhancements in this context as inappropriate is because of the purpose of the statute primarily designed to protect the benefits of successful Social Security claims."
2001.01-131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2130.148,2137.207,"Well but the statute itself speaks, sets a kept, a contingent fee of no more than 25 percent."
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2140.301,2141.87,"The statute has... that's correct, Your Honor."
2001.01-131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2150.043,2154.873,"That does not suggest that there can never be a contingency factor, does it?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2154.873,2157.019,"--It does not necessarily suggest that, no."
2001.01-131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2185.254,2188.227,"Well, is the purpose to give fair compensation to members of the bar?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2188.227,2197.515,"--That is, that is a purpose, but I would submit, Your Honor, that in regards to the language we are focusing on of the reasonable fee, that is not the primary purpose."
2001.01-131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2205.333,2212.171,Suppose you had a good friend and he said I'm going to go into Social Security work.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2220.92,2223.438,"Your Honor, that would probably depend on what some of his alternatives were."
2001.01-131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.327,2239.292,May I ask you in a way what you mean by the lodestar method.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2257.058,2263.934,"Your Honor, that would certainly be a one way to interpret a statute that I think on the text of the statute there is nothing that would prohibit it."
2001.01-131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2267.443,2269.096,"Well, the guidance is--"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2269.096,2270.499,For federal rules.
2001.01-131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2270.499,2278.96,"--You should take into account the hours, the general charge that he makes and the success in the case and whatever contract he has made and then you would know the case, you decide the reasonable fee."
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2292.912,2296.256,"I do agree that's desirable, but I think the lodestar method is the best way to do that."
2001.01-131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2296.256,2302.079,And I'm just wondering if what I propose to be a sufficient compliance with the lodestar method to satisfy the government?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2302.079,2310.456,"Your Honor, I think it would largely be in compliance with lodestar method, although not under this Court's decision in Dague which has prohibited the consideration of contingency enhancements."
2001.01-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2310.456,2325.772,"Did that, did that prohibition of contingency enhancements apply in the context such as this where it was only legally possible to charge when you win?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2325.772,2329.032,"No, Your Honor, that was not the context of 1988."
2001.01-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.032,2331.8,Might not that make a difference?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2361.233,2376.298,"Your Honor, I think this Court should adopt the same rule and it's because the reasons this Court adopted the rule that it did in the context of fee-shifting statutes was not because there was still some possibility that lawyers could negotiate fees even that won on a contingent basis."
2001.01-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.298,2389.69,"What's the government's position, supposing one of the Social Security lawyers has a very wealthy client who feels he is entitled to Social Security as a course he is just like everybody else."
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2403.048,2404.534,Um--
2001.01-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.534,2407.301,He doesn't want to get it out of the judgment at all.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2409.63,2419.849,"--Your Honor, the commissioner does interpret 406(b) to require only contingent fees, that it prohibits a lawyer from charging fees when there is no award of back benefits."
2001.01-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.849,2421.502,A maximum wouldn't make any sense otherwise.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2430.519,2441.686,"We think that in light of, of the terms of 406(b), its purpose is in the structure with, with the provision that would make it in fact a crime to charge more."
2001.01-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2447.796,2451.224,Has the commission ever issued an opinion to that effect?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2451.224,2452.46,"No, Your Honor."
2001.01-131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2473.265,2478.428,So the statute says all fees are contingent and the government says there can be no contingent fees?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2479.475,2482.143,"No, Your Honor."
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2489.035,2491.364,But all fees are contingent on success.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2511.715,2512.358,--That is correct.
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2512.358,2513.184,Okay.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2573.082,2576.813,"Your Honor, let me if I may address your last point first."
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2618.491,2619.977,You mentioned EAJA.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2648.872,2665.962,"Your Honor, I think the only thing unfair in that sense is that Congress here has determined that the market for legal services in the Social Security context was failing to carry out the purposes of the Social Security Act, and that lawyers had unequal bargaining power and were charging inordinately large contingency fees--"
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2665.962,2671.368,"But those were the days you were talking about 50 percent contingent fees so Congress cut it back to 25, so why... what--"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2671.368,2672.028,--That's correct.
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2672.028,2689.451,"--What... you just said well, 25 not in every case, maybe only work two hours, it would be unreasonable, but instead of having the judge and the lawyers go through this whole thing, I mean, EAJA is available only if the government's position was not substantially justified, right?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2691.718,2692.256,That's correct.
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2698.489,2711.037,"Does the government... I don't know how it works, but when someone is seeking benefits from the government, government has prevailed all through the agency, loses in court, does the government just sort of concede that the government's position was not substantially justified?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2711.037,2712.895,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2731.432,2734.072,"Well, shouldn't there about, you say you look at the law of the particular circuit."
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2747.036,2786.91,"My point, Your Honor, is just one of the things I think that's keeping, is important to keep in mind in these cases is that they, by their nature, tend to be very routine and so both in terms of awarding EAJA fees and in terms of awarding 406(b) fees, it is not very difficult for courts to develop practices in these cases that, that result in a very expedited process, and that in fact, that is, that is the way the lodestar method is applied and I, and it seems to me, Your Honors, that the alternative that's being proposed would largely frustrate the purpose that Justice Stevens was identifying of the need for some sort of expedited procedures here."
2001.01-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2810.112,2816.799,Does the government have any statistics as to how often an award of attorneys fees by a district judge is appealed to the Court of Appeals?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2816.799,2820.447,"Your Honor, that is, in the context of 406(b) cases?"
2001.01-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2820.447,2821.09,Yes.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2821.09,2838.263,"There are no... the agency does not specifically keep statistics on that, although I did discuss that with the relevant agency personnel and was informed that in fact the agency very rarely seeks an appeal unless the case involves some broader legal principle that the agency determines is important to litigation."
2001.01-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2838.263,2839.212,How about the attorney?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2839.212,2842.062,"I do not have any figures on that, Your Honor."
2001.01-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2842.062,2845.693,"Mr. Salmons, another question of statistics."
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2924.084,2966.437,"Your Honor, I'm not aware of any statistical or other information that's directly on point, although I could think it is important to keep in mind that the standards of review among other things have a lot to do with the outcome of these cases, and that, and that the general statistics that the courts provide through, for example, the federal judiciary home page that tracks different types of cases in different circuits, for example, shows that there has been dramatic increases in the number of Title II disability lawsuits that are filed initially in district courts between the period of 1990 to 2000."
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2967.636,2974.982,"Does that have anything to do with what the rate is because these are all cases that lost at the administrative level, right?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2974.982,2975.642,That's correct.
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2975.642,2985.219,"Is there any, any showing that maybe in the prior period, there were more cases winning at the administrative level, therefore fewer getting into the court?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,2985.219,2987.259,Not that I have seen.
2001.01-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2997.479,2999.336,I don't understand the point were you driving at.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3003.423,3006.29,I surely don't want to overstate it.
2001.01-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3006.29,3008.214,I don't understand what you were driving at.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3011.036,3012.794,"The point I was attempting to make, Your Honor--"
2001.01-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.794,3017.169,"Is this the result of those, of those jurisdictions that have allowed contingency to be considered?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3017.169,3017.995,--No.
2001.01-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3027.2,3032.773,"And likewise, I take it there are no statistics on how the different compensation approaches are having an effect?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3032.773,3033.971,--That's correct.
2001.01-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3048.748,3051.599,Do you have any flooded in the other jurisdictions?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3051.599,3052.547,No.
2001.01-131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3062.578,3063.692,Then why don't we leave it alone?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3065.261,3068.522,That is certainly an option that is before this Court.
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3081.442,3096.014,"But that is a pretty big swing if you say if the judge can go up to 25 percent if that's reasonable, here what was the percent, the lodestar percent, the lodestar yielded what percent of the past two benefits in these cases?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3096.014,3099.647,"--Your Honor, I don't have that figure."
2001.01-131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3104.355,3106.5,Wasn't it about half of what the contingency would have been?
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3106.5,3108.275,"Even less, I think."
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3108.275,3110.875,"--It varied in the, in the cases."
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3110.875,3111.718,I think it was under 10 percent.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3111.718,3129.551,"I think one way to sort of try and track that is that what the claimants lawyers in these cases did was because they recognized they were in a lodestar circuit, they had, they kept the same number of reasonable hours they would use for their EAJA fees which the government did not contest and then they just divided that by the 25 percent figure and came up with an hourly rate."
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3136.055,3138.839,But those were chopped down by the judge.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3138.839,3139.771,That's correct.
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3139.771,3145.715,"Because they were not supposed to, at least this Court, the Court here did it."
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3153.683,3156.283,"That's right, Your Honor."
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3157.315,3161.03,"So I'm not talking about the rates that the lawyers asked for, I'm talking about the rates that they got."
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3183.404,3186.089,"--Your Honor, let me make two points very quickly."
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3219.404,3225.858,"Are you recommending that we say let the judge do it, no matter what?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3233.355,3235.13,"That is the government's position, Your Honor."
2001.01-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3239.382,3242.81,Your position is that we do not want to subsidize bad suits?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3242.81,3243.386,Yes.
2001.01-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3244.212,3253.045,"It is not in the best interests of anybody, the country or anybody else, to encourage lawyers to bring bad suits and then get paid for it when they win a good suit, right?"
2001.01-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3253.045,3255.563,I was wondering if you had spent a lot of time--
2001.01-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3255.563,3257.049,--This is certainly a way to get lawyers in the good suits.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3257.049,3259.733,"But, Your Honor, there is no, there is no evidence of that."
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3282.85,3285.739,Why not make it run the same way the veterans' benefits do?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3301.731,3305.513,"Your Honor, that would certainly be an alternative availability to Congress."
2001.01-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3334.947,3342.665,"Well, if that's so then the judge in all the circuits that follow the contingent method would reduce the award."
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3354.282,3361.529,"I disagree, Your Honor, because of the court's experience, the lodestar method, I think that's the most efficient way for courts to determine the fee."
2001.01-131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3361.529,3371.106,"Beyond the record, do you have any statistics on how often contingent fees are reduced in the contingency circuits?"
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3371.106,3372.963,"I do not, Your Honor."
2001.01-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3377.587,3382.417,Do you have any sort of egregious examples where there was a lot of delay in those circuits just to build up the recovery?
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3385.473,3390.962,"--Your Honor, the agency has not experienced any particular problem under either of these standards."
2001.01-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3436.0,3439.837,That wasn't even established until Hensley against... whatever it is.
2001.01-131,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,3450.777,3456.805,"--Your Honor, courts used a variety of standards before as they did under other fee statutes."
2001.01-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3470.756,3472.159,"Thank you, Mr. Salmons."
2001.01-131,2,23240,eric_schnaufer,,3474.349,3476.7,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-131,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3607.475,3608.301,"Thank you, Mr. Schnaufer."
