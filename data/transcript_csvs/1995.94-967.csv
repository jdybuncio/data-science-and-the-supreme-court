1995.94-967,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,8.007,"We'll hear argument in Field v. Mans, Number 94-967."
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,10.248,13.07,"Justice Stevens, may it please the Court:"
1995.94-967,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,73.64,80.073,"At common law, must the reliance be justifiable, however, for fraud?"
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,80.073,82.366,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-967,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,92.822,98.645,Do you think there is a requirement of justifiability at least?
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,98.645,113.014,"There has to be a requirement of materiality, because the elements of false pretenses, false representations, or actual fraud, are not laid out in 523(a)(2)(A)."
1995.94-967,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.014,116.857,Do you think there has to be intent and materiality?
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,116.857,119.609,"There has to be materiality, and the reason--"
1995.94-967,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.609,120.681,And intent?
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,120.681,122.28,--Yes.
1995.94-967,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.28,122.981,Mm-hmm.
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,122.981,125.213,Because fraud is an intentional crime.
1995.94-967,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.213,127.564,And possibly justifiability.
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,127.564,141.104,"Correct, and the reason that is so is that a balancing act is done in the common law between the culpability of a defendant versus the culpability of his victim."
1995.94-967,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.104,152.791,"Do we know what the difference is between, what are the three categories, false pretenses, false representation, and actual fraud?"
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,155.072,157.824,"They are, Justice... may I explain +/?"
1995.94-967,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,267.415,268.695,What about reliance?
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,276.202,285.558,"--The reliance must be justifiable if it's an intentional fraud, because there's... there's fraud--"
1995.94-967,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,285.558,288.55,"Well, each of these... you have just described each of these as intentional, haven't you?"
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,288.55,288.961,--That's correct.
1995.94-967,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,288.961,297.586,"So you are saying that at common law there must be a justifiable reliance in each of the three categories, not just fraud, but the representation and pretense."
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,297.586,307.561,And the reason it must be justifiable is because there has to be some materiality under the common law between the fraud and the loss of the victim.
1995.94-967,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,307.561,316.086,"I must say, I'm interested to hear this difference among the three described so clearly in the context of a shell game."
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,333.798,347.648,"I believe the case of Matter of Weinstein, page 809, describes the differences between the false representations and false pretenses."
1995.94-967,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.648,348.988,Page 809 of what?
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,348.988,357.353,"Page 809 of the Matter of Weinstein, 31 Bankruptcy Reporter, 504, a 1983 case, Justice."
1995.94-967,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,357.353,358.064,19--
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,358.064,360.486,1983.
1995.94-967,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,362.228,365.79,"--Okay, but that is a bankruptcy case that's already dealing with this language."
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,365.79,372.134,It's dealing with the difference between false pretenses and false representation.
1995.94-967,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.134,372.674,Within the meaning of the statute.
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,372.674,373.405,Within the meaning of.
1995.94-967,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.405,384.552,"I would have rather seen an old common law case that talked about a cause of action for misrepresentation, and I'm not sure... misrepresentation is an element of a lot of other causes of action, but--"
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,384.552,395.11,There's the very old U. S. Supreme Court case of Neal v. Smith that's cited also in the Joint Appendix.
1995.94-967,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,408.037,410.12,--But fraud is always an intentional tort.
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,412.492,416.552,"Justice, there can be fraud implied by law."
1995.94-967,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,442.731,447.925,Let's go back in this case before there was any representation.
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,484.126,488.68,"While that is not the facts of this case, I would agree with you, it would be dischargeable."
1995.94-967,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,488.68,509.454,"Well then, can you explain to me the consistency between saying that if the debtor does something to alert the creditor, then the debt will not be discharged, but if he says nothing at all, then it's going to be discharged?"
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,529.487,548.09,"If I can maybe explain, if the property would have had to have been transferred without any notification or any back and forth correspondence, that would be fraud under the Fraudulent Conveyances Act in the State of New Hampshire."
1995.94-967,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,553.322,559.466,"Just without telling me whether it's fraud implied by law, the debt is dischargeable?"
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,559.466,562.889,"--It would be dischargeable, but that is not the facts of this case."
1995.94-967,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,570.853,582.231,"But don't you think that there's a certain anomaly between the debtor being really bad and not saying one word and just doing it, and the debtor saying... giving some tipoff to the creditor?"
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,600.463,603.055,"--It may not have been a tipoff, Justice, if I may explain."
1995.94-967,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,724.034,729.727,"Well, hasn't it always been the law that under fraud you have to show the reliance was justifiable?"
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,729.727,730.077,--Yes.
1995.94-967,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,730.077,736.883,"That's the word they use, and I never heard in this whole case, anywhere, anybody until now, making a distinction between reasonable and justifiable."
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,775.688,777.839,"The Fosco case, Your Honor--"
1995.94-967,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,777.839,779.99,There may be some cases that say it's different.
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,809.98,820.636,"--Justice Breyer, there must be a material nexus between--"
1995.94-967,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,820.636,823.718,"Mr. Seufert, stay in front of the microphone so we can all hear you."
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,823.718,829.873,--There must be a material nexus between the fraud and the loss.
1995.94-967,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,844.782,871.82,"I don't... my problem is, I don't understand these technical words, and I usually try to interpret them in ways that aren't that technical, and as I read through these briefs, I thought the issue in this case is whether there is a requirement in section (a) that the person who is the victim have to have behaved reasonably or justifiably in the circumstance."
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,896.817,904.973,"--In our brief, Your Honor, we pointed out that contributory negligence is not a defense when you have an intentional tort."
1995.94-967,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,949.352,953.604,May I ask a question which goes to this distinction?
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,976.8,977.01,That's correct.
1995.94-967,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,977.01,977.379,Okay.
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,977.379,979.041,I believe we had the example--
1995.94-967,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,979.041,986.936,"That's why, if you should have investigated but didn't, it's not imputed against you as contributory negligence."
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,986.936,987.607,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.94-967,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1011.402,1011.702,Okay.
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,1019.366,1020.528,I'm not good on answering--
1995.94-967,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1020.528,1024.92,"Everybody knows that he doesn't look like Napoleon, at least I think he doesn't look like Napoleon--"
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,1046.664,1054.058,"--Well, there is no duty to investigate if you prove evil intent, the evil empire, on the perpetrator of the fraud."
1995.94-967,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1054.058,1055.42,"Well, we're talking about evil."
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,1099.189,1125.595,"The extension of credit is what we relied upon before the trial court, because there is a... there was a due-on-sale clause that called forward not only the original note but front-loaded all of the interest that this mortgage was supposed to pay out over its next 10 years immediately up front if the property was transferred without a written consent for transfer."
1995.94-967,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1125.595,1129.959,"But in fact nothing formal happened, and what happened is the same thing as if the debtor had said nothing."
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,1136.084,1136.812,That's right.
1995.94-967,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1136.812,1141.567,"You have two situations where the creditor didn't know about it, and everything remained the same."
1995.94-967,0,20109,christopher_j_seufert,,1239.572,1240.003,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1995.94-967,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1240.003,1252.831,Mr. Jenkins.
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1252.831,1256.654,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-967,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1256.654,1259.724,"Mr. Jenkins, can I ask you a preliminary question?"
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1270.423,1272.243,"--We do, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-967,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1272.774,1275.725,"We don't look to State law definitions, then?"
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1275.725,1276.947,--I think that's correct.
1995.94-967,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1294.338,1302.893,"Well, might we look to the common law definition for the meaning of the terms that Congress used?"
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1302.893,1320.986,"I think that's possible, Your Honor, but I think the better source is, again, the structure of the code, and in particular the word, fraud, which is used elsewhere in the bankruptcy Code, is used in other Federal statutes which this Court in Grogan v. Garner indicated are better sources for discerning Congress' intent when it used the term fraud."
1995.94-967,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1349.103,1357.488,"But isn't the difference here that the word fraud occurs in a series, and the other two terms in the series are obviously common law terms?"
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1357.488,1367.214,"Well, I think, Your Honor, it's unclear whether false representations and false pretenses are common law terms or whether they in fact are statutory terms."
1995.94-967,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1371.289,1381.364,"Yes, but there's no definition of them anywhere in the statute, which is a pretty good indication that there is a reference to some place else, and the some place else is State common law, isn't it?"
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1381.364,1384.356,"--Well, that may be, but we think that's not the best explanation."
1995.94-967,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1405.88,1410.262,"Maybe I should know this, but how do we know that Congress looked to that case?"
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1411.904,1415.116,"It is in the legislative history, and it's cited in our brief, I believe footnote 5."
1995.94-967,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1415.116,1415.667,Okay.
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1415.667,1422.571,"As I've said, we think that the better tool of statutory construction here is the structure of the Bankruptcy Code."
1995.94-967,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1472.353,1473.595,Or it could... I'm sorry.
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1482.491,1482.902,That's correct.
1995.94-967,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1482.902,1483.333,Yes.
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1483.333,1484.371,That's correct.
1995.94-967,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1490.345,1494.338,I take it you agree that materiality is required for fraud?
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1494.338,1497.64,"We do not, Your Honor, as to paragraph (A)."
1995.94-967,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1498.532,1500.052,Materiality is not required?
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1500.052,1500.583,--That's correct.
1995.94-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1519.907,1523.238,"Well, you've just destroyed your prior argument, then."
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1561.743,1565.667,"Well, Your Honor, we do say that those two provisions have different elements."
1995.94-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1567.69,1567.908,Yes.
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1567.908,1573.612,"But that is the only element we think, except for causation, that is required in both (A) and (B)."
1995.94-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1573.612,1580.346,But it's only necessary to find one element in (B) that is not necessary for (A) in order to distinguish the two.
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1580.346,1595.326,"Well, I suppose that's true, Your Honor, and I think in addition we've noted that the legislative history indicates what Congress was trying to do in splitting former 17(a)(2) into 523(a)(2)(A) and (B), and it indicates that the reasonable reliance requirement was at the heart of that."
1995.94-967,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1595.326,1616.08,"But they didn't know at that time, I take it, what the courts were going to hold about this thing, about... there was some split, I gather, and the finance companies came in to them and said a lot of people make these representations in writing, and we want to be certain there's reasonable reliance, the consumer group said."
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1617.282,1619.072,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.94-967,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1619.072,1632.05,"What possible sense could it make to say, if I go in writing, and I use my Napoleon example... you know, it's a surrogate for any ridiculous thing, where you're being very unreasonable."
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1642.687,1643.769,"That's correct, under (B)."
1995.94-967,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1643.769,1653.056,"And what could Congress have in mind if I do exactly the same thing, but I happen to say it orally, and you're so silly as to rely on that statement."
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1665.24,1666.422,"Well, I--"
1995.94-967,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1666.422,1667.094,They didn't change (A)--
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1667.094,1667.523,--Right.
1995.94-967,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1667.523,1668.593,--because nobody asked them to do it.
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1668.593,1691.858,"I think... given the structure of the act, I think the answer to that is that if someone foolishly relies, or is particularly gullible under paragraph (A), Congress intended that that person be protected, that as between an intentionally dishonest debtor on the one hand, and an unwary creditor on the other hand, that the creditor should prevail, except where there had been a pattern of abuse in precode cases, and--"
1995.94-967,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1691.858,1702.167,"You mean, in other words, they want to protect this very, very foolish creditor, the very foolish lender, like General Motors Access Corporation or something."
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1713.773,1719.527,"--Well, Your Honor, the difference between (A) and (B) is not that it's orally versus in writing, it's that it's a false financial statement case."
1995.94-967,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1726.463,1727.174,--Same question.
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1727.422,1731.145,"--If I understand your question, what would Congress' motivation be--"
1995.94-967,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1731.145,1731.445,Yes.
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1731.445,1736.118,"--in protecting the foolish creditor, I think equitable principles that underlie the Bankruptcy Code--"
1995.94-967,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1736.118,1738.19,"No, why in the one and not the other?"
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1738.19,1762.755,"--Well, because there was a pattern of abuse by consumer finance companies that Congress identified as to (B), and that was the purpose for expressly including the elements of (B), materiality being one, reasonable reliance being another, that that would provide added protection to debtors in that category, but again, I think the structure of the code indicates that Congress intended to provide that added protection only in that category."
1995.94-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.755,1769.499,"It seems to me... you know, the language, we've been talking as though they're common law causes of action, false pretenses."
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1817.552,1821.316,"Your Honor, I think that would be respondent's best argument, but I think--"
1995.94-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1821.316,1821.563,Yes.
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1822.805,1832.762,"--I think it's not a winning argument, because the term fraud does not uniformly, or even in most cases, require mater... pardon me, reasonable reliance."
1995.94-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.762,1833.61,"No, I acknowledge that--"
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1833.61,1833.811,Yes.
1995.94-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1833.811,1836.222,--and certainly a false representation does not--
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1836.222,1836.813,Mm-hmm.
1995.94-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.813,1840.015,"--but what about the language, obtained by?"
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1840.015,1840.496,"Well, I think--"
1995.94-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.496,1841.407,Isn't it reasonable--
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1841.407,1841.758,--Pardon me.
1995.94-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1841.758,1848.01,"--to say there has to be a causality, and the causality is broken when there is... when that person shouldn't have relied?"
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1848.01,1849.262,May I answer?
1995.94-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.262,1850.153,Yes.
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1850.153,1854.014,We do think that the obtained-by fraud language requires causality.
1995.94-967,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1880.503,1881.713,"Thank you, Mr. Jenkins."
1995.94-967,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1881.713,1882.034,Thank you.
1995.94-967,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1882.034,1887.379,Mr. Whittington.
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,1887.379,1889.77,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-967,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1982.082,1985.531,"Mr. Whittington, what is your authority for these distinctions?"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,1985.531,1988.583,I have five cases that make these distinctions.
1995.94-967,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1988.583,1988.844,Okay.
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,1991.535,1991.825,"Yes, it is."
1995.94-967,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.825,1997.431,"These are common law cases, or bankruptcy cases trying to make sense out of this unfathomable statute?"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,1997.431,1999.021,"Bankruptcy cases, Your Honor."
1995.94-967,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.021,2004.304,"Yeah, well, I don't... I think they're pulling it out of the air to try to give some meaning to the statute."
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2009.467,2013.611,"I do agree with that, and in fact I looked for some and was unable to find them."
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2013.611,2022.556,May I ask this question: is this language in (A) the same language that was in the statute before 1978?
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2022.556,2032.513,"Yes, it is, with one minor difference, and that is the third of the threesome, actual fraud, was added, and most courts that have addressed that--"
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2032.513,2042.659,But is it correct that actual fraud had been thought to be part of it because of the... what's the old case in 95 U. S.... there's a case that your opponent cited.
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2042.659,2043.691,"--Neal, U. S.... Neal--"
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.691,2044.021,"Yes, Neal."
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2049.664,2050.606,--I believe that's correct.
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2050.606,2058.641,"So that would it be correct to say that at least insofar as the reenactment of (A) is concerned, that was thought to just be a codification of existing law?"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2058.641,2059.572,I think that's correct.
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2059.572,2064.034,"So that construing (A), we could look at pre-1978 cases to find out what that means?"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2064.034,2064.505,That's correct.
1995.94-967,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2064.505,2067.627,"And if we look at Neal, what do we find about reliance?"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2067.627,2098.426,"I can't answer the question with respect to Neal, Your Honor, but with respect to other pre-'78 cases, which we've cited at page 15 of our brief in footnote 13, there are, I believe, at least three cases in the 1970 to 1978 timeframe which did, in fact, require reasonable reliance as to 523(a)(2)(A)."
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2098.426,2101.628,May I ask one other sort of basic question?
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2113.745,2116.818,"We would have prevailed under both, in our view."
1995.94-967,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2182.341,2206.407,"With respect to the pre-'78 common law cases, how do you account for what seems to be a disparity of standards between the cases that you rely on and the Restatement, because I take it the Restatement, in talking about justifiable reliance, really is talking about a less strict standard?"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2206.407,2208.29,I don't think that's correct.
1995.94-967,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2279.046,2290.973,"But you are conceding, I guess, then, to the extent that you are basing your discussion on the Ninth Circuit, that there is at least some distinction to be made between reasonable and justifiable."
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2290.973,2293.647,"Other courts have disagreed with that, and--"
1995.94-967,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2293.647,2294.128,"Well, how about you?"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2295.197,2296.589,--I think it's the same both ways.
1995.94-967,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2296.589,2298.579,So the Ninth Circuit was wrong.
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2301.311,2308.966,"If the Ninth Circuit was right, our position would still be that there was justifiable reliance--"
1995.94-967,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2308.966,2310.408,"Because of the facts of this case, as you've--"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2310.408,2310.768,--That's correct.
1995.94-967,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2310.768,2315.92,"--argued them, but so far as the legal standard is concerned, you're taking a different position from the Ninth Circuit."
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2317.691,2319.743,"That's correct, and in fact--"
1995.94-967,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2319.743,2323.544,And you say that with respect to the duty to investigate.
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2323.544,2324.325,--That's correct.
1995.94-967,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2324.325,2326.528,The duty to investigate is always the same on each one.
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2326.528,2329.22,"Well, there may not be a duty to investigate."
1995.94-967,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2330.32,2334.403,"But if there is, it will be the same whether we're talking justifiable or reasonable."
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2334.403,2336.925,"--That's correct, and that's the point of the Mayer case, I believe."
1995.94-967,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.532,2413.694,"Before you... well, this is the plain language."
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2421.301,2422.37,--Written.
1995.94-967,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2424.042,2427.544,"Oh, only because--"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2427.544,2430.978,"In other words, our view is--"
1995.94-967,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2430.978,2431.218,--Oh--
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2431.218,2432.43,--I'm sorry?
1995.94-967,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2432.43,2433.421,--Oh.
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2433.421,2449.744,"In other words, our view is the reason that Congress took the trouble to list out the elements, to give us a laundry list, as you were, in section (B), is because they've changed the common law in two ways: writing, and financial statements."
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2475.3,2486.787,"Do you agree that (B), the test of satisfying (B) is less strict than the test of satisfying (A), or do I have it backwards?"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2486.787,2487.027,No.
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.277,2527.262,"Do you agree, though, that (B) was specifically directed at finance companies that relied on written statements that they should not reasonably have relied on?"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2527.262,2531.967,I think the tightening up of the statute was specifically directed at that.
1995.94-967,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2580.507,2585.511,Do the general creditors care which way this argument comes out?
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2585.511,2589.193,I don't think so.
1995.94-967,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2589.633,2590.625,I don't think... I don't think so.
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2590.625,2599.04,"--This is a Chapter 7 liquidation case, so if we were under a different chapter, perhaps, but certainly not in this case."
1995.94-967,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2599.04,2600.69,"Under Chapter 13, would they care?"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2600.69,2618.013,"No, I don't think so either, because there's a discharge as of the date... the debtor would have to pay out of future acquired assets, I'm guessing, so I think the answer is no again."
1995.94-967,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2660.569,2671.027,"Well, if you're right, then this case turns entirely on whether we think reasonable reliance is the same as justifiable reliance."
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2671.027,2674.538,I don't agree with Your Honor.
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2727.805,2731.326,"Your position is, then, that here there was a duty to investigate?"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2731.326,2733.5,Not initially.
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.699,2738.991,"Well, at least at the time of the alleged misrepresentation."
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2738.991,2739.292,--That's correct.
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2740.131,2747.527,"But you allege there was one, but do you... you don't also agree it was necessary that there be a duty to investigate."
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2747.527,2748.448,No.
1995.94-967,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.921,2776.196,We're talking as though the duty to investigate and the unreasonableness of the reliance are two separate things.
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2778.506,2778.827,I agree.
1995.94-967,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2778.827,2782.69,It's unreasonable to rely with what you have.
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2782.69,2783.919,I agree.
1995.94-967,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.919,2786.012,Which means you should have done something more.
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2786.012,2786.613,That's correct.
1995.94-967,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2786.613,2788.303,So do we have to get into that?
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2799.23,2800.252,"Well, I have not tried a lot of these."
1995.94-967,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2800.252,2800.893,"--Well, all right then."
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2844.491,2854.726,"Our view is, those are all factors in the mix to be considered by the bankruptcy court, and as an advocate at the trial court level, those are the facts that I'm playing with."
1995.94-967,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2898.446,2906.22,"Mr. Whittington, what about the argument that you made last in your brief that I asked your adversary about."
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2926.093,2928.434,I welcome that question.
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2948.859,2951.301,May I interrupt you for just a second?
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2953.781,2955.103,"--No, I don't."
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2955.422,2963.418,"And with respect to issues bearing on the question we did grant cert to resolve, did you make this argument in your brief in opposition to the cert petition?"
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2963.418,2965.53,--There was no brief in opposition filed.
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2969.884,2971.356,Thank you.
1995.94-967,2,46562,w_e_whittington,,2971.356,2983.485,"Next, I would like to address the collateral estoppel issue, which hasn't been spoken about here today."
1995.94-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.039,3131.612,"Thank you, Mr. Whittington."
