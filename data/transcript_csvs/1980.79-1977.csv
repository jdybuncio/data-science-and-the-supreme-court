1980.79-1977,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,0.997,Thank you gentlemen.
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,71.357,72.801,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1977,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,72.801,72.892,Mr. Lassoff.
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,72.892,77.674,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1980.79-1977,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,126.05,131.818,"Mr. Lassoff, might I interrupt your preliminary -- preliminary there."
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,154.121,158.303,It does but this was not one of the points I was given certiorari on.
1980.79-1977,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.86,175.864,It's not before us?
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,175.864,180.286,It's not before you.
1980.79-1977,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,459.805,469.599,"Will this political compromise that you referred that took place in 1972 had the full participation of the longshoreman workers union, did it not?"
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,469.599,479.084,"It had participation of the long -- of the Maritime Unions, non-sea -- not non-sea unions and of the stevedores."
1980.79-1977,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.177,693.994,Only -- of course it could be that -- I mean logically it could be that the injured longshoreman has always sued.
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,693.994,695.324,Not quite Your Honor as you can see this appeal --
1980.79-1977,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,695.324,697.207,"Well, logically -- I know."
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,700.622,702.383,There were at least 10 cases here Your Honor.
1980.79-1977,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.771,709.966,"Well I would suppose the vast majority of the cases, the longshoreman himself would sue?"
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,709.966,714.084,"Yes, yes, but there are hundreds of cases affected by this particular."
1980.79-1977,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,723.318,729.904,Why as a matter of practical fact doesn't the longshoreman sue in the six months period given to him?
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,729.904,731.898,Ordinarily he does.
1980.79-1977,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,763.732,776.085,"Congress could do or put it this way, could Congress correct that and make some of their form of service possible so that it would eliminate the problem?"
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,776.085,777.771,Congress could do many things.
1980.79-1977,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,782.459,784.83,Or using an agent for service?
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,784.83,786.398,Yes or an agent to service.
1980.79-1977,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,787.282,794.716,"Well, could enlarge the time beyond six months, make it a year, 18 months, two years?"
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,794.716,798.742,The question is -- is not a period of time.The question is what is the intent of Congress?
1980.79-1977,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,798.742,799.038,"Well, it could do that."
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,799.038,809.783,"Every bill -- every bill says safety -- this is hazardous occupation, eight times the national rate, four times the national rate."
1980.79-1977,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,840.152,846.769,Does the -- the stevedoring companies assets are intended to be used for the benefit of longshoreman?
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,853.754,854.723,That is true.
1980.79-1977,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.824,900.513,And who has six months in which to assert it?
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,900.513,916.739,"He has six months in which to assert it, but the question is equitably, equitably does the purpose of the statute, is it -- is it perfected by giving a negligent tortfeasor a right that it was never intended to have?"
1980.79-1977,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,916.739,922.481,What do you say to -- to the -- any statute of limitations argument in a situation like this? These are --
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,922.481,923.175,I say --
1980.79-1977,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,923.175,930.191,There must come a period of repose where past things that have not been litigated can no longer be litigated?
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,930.191,933.46,I have no objection to a statute of limitations.
1980.79-1977,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.836,940.722,But it is the same type of principle?
1980.79-1977,0,36216,martin_lassoff,,940.722,948.52,It isn't because every lawyer practicing in this field knew of the various statutes of limitations.
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,1088.568,1089.853,"Your Honors, may it please --"
1980.79-1977,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1089.853,1091.975,Mr. Stearns.
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,1091.975,1092.666,May it please the Court.
1980.79-1977,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1716.48,1718.648,Can you say that again?
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,1718.648,1727.741,That the entire course of action which is presented to a jury as a claim by a longshoreman against a shipowner.
1980.79-1977,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1727.741,1728.238,A shipowner.
1980.79-1977,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1728.238,1729.82,A third party.
1980.79-1977,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.82,1730.028,You said the stevedore.
1980.79-1977,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1730.028,1731.157,You had said stevedore.
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,1731.157,1732.787,I'm sorry.
1980.79-1977,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1949.331,1956.716,"Counsel, I think that all of us here know of negligence cases, they're just the same --"
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,1956.716,1956.969,Judge --
1980.79-1977,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1956.969,1959.773,-- but you wouldn't (Inaudible) would you?
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,1959.773,1960.408,"Judge, it's not a --"
1980.79-1977,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1960.408,1962.836,"What I'm trying to say, what has it got to do with this case?"
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,1962.836,1964.361,"Well, what I'm trying to show is this."
1980.79-1977,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1964.361,1967.813,Is this -- is this law (Inaudible)
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,1967.813,1968.999,"No sir, he's not."
1980.79-1977,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1970.612,1972.934,(Inaudible)
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,1972.934,1974.885,What I'm trying to do for background is to -- is to --
1980.79-1977,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1974.885,1979.316,Could that case be brought here?
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,1979.316,1982.71,"Well it -- it can't now, no, it's (Inaudible)"
1980.79-1977,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1982.71,1983.624,Why?
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,1983.624,1984.76,"It was not, that's great."
1980.79-1977,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.76,1986.238,For what good is it (Inaudible)
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,1986.238,1991.62,"Well it's good for an illustration of what the value of the third party case, the longshoreman is."
1980.79-1977,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2003.467,2011.546,"Well on the Jones Act, it was a case where a man fell through a bunk up in Time Square and it found that the ship was unseaworthy, isn't it?"
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,2016.967,2018.462,No.
1980.79-1977,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.194,2095.188,"Mr. Stearns, do you agree with Mr. Lassoff that the Rodriguez case is precisely on the same footing as the other two for purposes of our decision here?"
1980.79-1977,1,33064,joseph_t_stearns,,2095.188,2103.555,"Judge, it's -- it's the Perez case where a formal order is involved and there were four questions posed in the application for a writ."
1980.79-1977,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2141.772,2143.249,Mr. Byrn.
1980.79-1977,2,23602,francis_x_byrn,,2143.249,2147.146,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1980.79-1977,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2220.194,2223.085,As they testified before the congressional committees?
1980.79-1977,2,23602,francis_x_byrn,,2223.085,2226.384,"That's correct, in 1956, in May and June."
1980.79-1977,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2438.376,2441.438,But do you think the result was anomalous?
1980.79-1977,2,23602,francis_x_byrn,,2441.438,2454.179,"I think the Court of Appeals said so and I think perhaps this Court and yourself said so, Your Honor."

1980.79-1977,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2637.871,2639.975,Are you going to wander further than he did?
1980.79-1977,3,36216,martin_lassoff,,2639.975,2641.225,"No, I -- I just wanted --"
1980.79-1977,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2641.225,2641.815,"Well, I was just --"
1980.79-1977,3,36216,martin_lassoff,,2641.815,2644.304,I'll stop.
