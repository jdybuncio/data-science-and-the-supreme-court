1980.79-1907,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,0.872,"Thank you, gentlemen."
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,68.53,69.696,Thank you.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,199.143,203.673,"May I ask you right there, that gross sales figure?"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,207.594,208.251,"No, no."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,208.251,215.097,That is an actual figure representing the sales price of the finished product whatever that product is.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,215.097,216.405,"Exactly, exactly."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,216.405,217.675,Of the first marketable product.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,217.675,219.624,Of the first marketable product.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,219.624,226.291,"And so that if it normally, that -- that price would be enough to cover all costs, anyway --"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,226.291,226.927,Yes.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,226.927,228.272,-- or they'll go broke.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,228.272,228.33,Exactly.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,228.33,231.563,"So, it's -- it's -- so it's the gross sales price."
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,231.563,232.527,Exactly.
1980.79-1907,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.386,297.617,"Now, the two questions are separate."
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,300.389,301.897,"Absolutely, absolutely."
1980.79-1907,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,301.897,303.885,"I mean, they have to kind of be answered the same way --"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,303.885,304.608,Exactly.
1980.79-1907,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,304.608,305.325,-- consistently.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,305.325,307.881,Exactly.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,307.881,310.988,So you could include the first question and still not --
1980.79-1907,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,310.988,311.058,No.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,311.058,313.439,"-- change the -- the denominator, could you?"
1980.79-1907,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.439,314.788,No.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,314.788,316.263,"Well, the questions are interrelated."
1980.79-1907,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,317.029,321.419,"Well, so -- but your -- but if -- if your first marketable product is bulk cement --"
1980.79-1907,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,321.419,321.908,Right.
1980.79-1907,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,321.908,325.479,You're certainly not going to include in the denominator the cost of bagging.
1980.79-1907,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,325.479,326.663,"No, exactly."
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,328.092,328.667,The facts --
1980.79-1907,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,328.667,329.97,(Inaudible)
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,329.97,331.04,Sure.
1980.79-1907,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,331.04,344.672,"On the tax -- this tax return, did the taxpayer -- or with respect to gross sales cost, on -- an office administrative cost, did the taxpayer seek to exclude them entirely or to place some of them in the numerator?"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,344.672,347.75,My -- my understanding is that he sought to exclude them entirely.
1980.79-1907,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,362.269,365.948,Does the tax take -- take a different position on that that it did in the court below?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,365.948,367.821,I think so.
1980.79-1907,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,374.554,386.645,"Well, Mr. -- Mr. Smith, if the court below it agreed with you that the first marketable product was both bulk and bagged cement, I'm not sure it would have excluded any cost from the denominator."
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,386.645,387.683,"Well, it's hard to tell."
1980.79-1907,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,388.114,391.783,"Well, I know, but it -- it said that the first marketable product was bulk cement."
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,391.783,393.333,"Yes, yes, so, it more or less then --"
1980.79-1907,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,393.333,396.232,"In this event, you should throw out some costs from the denominator."
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,396.232,397.689,"Yes, and I -- they said --"
1980.79-1907,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,397.689,401.404,"So, your first question, if you went on the first question, you --"
1980.79-1907,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,401.404,401.587,-- you win.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,401.587,408.003,"I think I really win on the first question as a logical matter, the second question is a subsidiary question which takes care of itself but it's --"
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,408.003,408.109,Exactly -- exactly --
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,408.109,420.916,-- it's hard -- it's hard to know exactly how the court below felt about this question generally because it had -- this question has been kicking around in the Tenth Circuit ever since the -- it's the idea of basic test.
1980.79-1907,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,420.916,426.066,"Yes, but there's no suggestion that they would throw those costs out of the denominator even if --"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,426.066,426.94,No.
1980.79-1907,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,426.94,428.648,-- even if the first marketable product --
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,428.648,429.009,No.
1980.79-1907,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,429.009,429.548,-- was bagged cement.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,429.548,437.875,What the -- what the Tenth Circuit has said and which we take strong disagreement with is that the first marketable product was bulk cement.
1980.79-1907,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,442.86,445.117,Which do they sell most of by the way?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,445.117,446.95,They sell mostly bulk cement.
1980.79-1907,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,505.809,506.03,Mr. Smith --
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,506.03,506.389,What --
1980.79-1907,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,506.389,513.062,-- is it agreed that the -- the mining phase stops at the point where slurry is --
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,513.062,534.355,"Yes, I think that is -- that is agreed because the mining process, and Congress has you know ratified this in Section 613 (c) (4) (F) which was enacted in response to the Court's Cannelton decision, the mining process stops at the kiln feed."
1980.79-1907,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,600.509,611.275,"Mr. Smith, I suppose it never happens, but suppose this manufacturer sold everything in -- in bags, would you have a different case?"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,612.654,617.73,Then I -- I -- we'd have a different case but I don't think there would be a quarrel.
1980.79-1907,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,633.917,634.298,"So, the (Voice Overlap) --"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,634.298,634.908,-- premium would go --
1980.79-1907,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,634.908,636.326,-- would take the same position that he does here?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,636.326,643.609,"Right, but I assume that this taxpayer couldn't really argue that anything else was a first marketable product."
1980.79-1907,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,643.609,648.039,"Mr. Smith, it -- it has nothing to do with this case at all."
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,651.549,663.516,"Concrete, as I understand it, and I should know this, because I'm a city boy, I think is -- it -- is what happens when the cement is put in the building and hardens."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.739,808.764,"Well, what about companies that sell on delivered price basis and they pay for transportation?"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,813.516,817.99,"Only certain kinds of transportation, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,817.99,819.808,The ones you don't make a profit on?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,819.808,826.165,"Well, essentially, if -- if they're delivered over, they would transport it and it's the transport as profit."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.783,834.225,"So, you do not -- so you did not include all elements of gross sales?"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,834.225,838.82,Well that -- that as I understand is the only element of gross sales that is not included.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,838.82,841.028,Why -- why isn't it included?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,841.028,842.201,It's not included as I --
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.201,845.14,Because the company doesn't make a profit on it.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,845.14,848.27,"Because the company -- basically, because it's to transport is profit --"
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,848.27,848.64,Well --
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,848.64,848.73,-- but --
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,848.73,852.764,"So -- so yes, I'm right that the company itself doesn't make a profit on it."
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,852.764,855.019,The company does not make a profit on the transportation but --
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.019,858.439,But what if they didn't make any profit on its bagging?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,858.439,862.563,"If -- well, I don't think we have to worry about that in this case because --"
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,862.563,866.153,I know you don't want to worry about it but that's the very worry in the case.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,866.153,867.081,"No, it's not the very worry in the --"
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,867.081,868.527,But that's one of them.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,868.527,870.459,"Well, no, it isn't, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.343,887.942,That is not -- that it is not stipulated that he made a profit on his bagging expense on the bag.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,887.942,889.487,"Well, if you -- yes."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,889.487,890.274,Is it?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,890.274,892.851,"Yes, it is not stipulated that he made a profits on --"
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,892.851,899.895,"As a matter of fact, the claim is that he loses, that it cost him more to bag than he -- than he adds to the price from the bagging."
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,899.895,939.827,"Yes, but the -- but the point of the proportionate profits method is that it has to measure the sales of the -- of a finished product and part of the -- and the -- with this respondent as well as all other cement-integrated producers sold bagged cement in response to a customer demand, put cement in bags and there is no suggestion here that -- and it seems to me that the relevant fact is that this respondent earned a profit on each bag of cement that it sold."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,947.141,951.852,Except -- except the transportation because he doesn't make a profit on them.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,951.852,960.601,"Well, except transportation because transportation basically is taken out of his hands and put into the hands of the transporter."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,966.077,969.391,But the point is that he doesn't make a profit out of it.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,969.391,977.536,"Exactly, exactly, but -- but he -- but he did make a profit on the sale of bagged cement and I think that makes all the difference in the world."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.536,978.582,I know you do.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,978.582,991.37,"The conditions of the regulation, the purchase -- transportation regulations are set forth at page 13(a) of our -- of our appendix to our brief and you can see that the conditions are very narrow."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.33,1075.634,"So, what is defining --"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1075.634,1077.348,-- non-mining -- non- mining activity.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.348,1086.506,"Well, what if the taxpayer price list said, I'll -- I'll sell cement to you either in bags or in gross for exactly the same price per hundred?"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1086.506,1088.926,For exactly the same price per hundred?
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.323,1114.731,And so what if he had had a price list that says I'll sell you bulk cement for $2 and bagged cement for $2.10?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1119.387,1135.236,"No, it doesn't make any -- well, it does make it, in your example, it makes a difference, but the point is that his gross sale of a -- of his first marketable product in -- in that -- in the -- in your latter example is either $2 or $2.10."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1137.874,1145.544,"And you -- it wouldn't make any difference to your case if it were stipulated that the cost of bagging was 20 cents, would it?"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1145.544,1154.859,"It wouldn't make any difference to me that the cost of bagging, and in fact it was -- you know, essentially, that there was a disparity between the bagging premium and the bagging cost in this case."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1243.968,1247.77,And your suggestion is that's -- that's a permissible construction of the statute?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1247.77,1248.724,Absolutely.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1248.724,1249.168,And that's --
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1249.168,1250.056,Absolutely.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1250.056,1253.662,"And if it isn't, you lose, but if it is, you should win."
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1253.662,1266.823,"I think we should win because -- because the statute simply permits the Commissioner to -- permits a reasonable allowance and also, this case has been made under regulations prescribed by the secretary or his delegate."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1280.534,1285.465,"What is the -- what is the source of the language, first marketable product?"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1285.465,1289.445,What is the -- I assume that the source of the first (Voice Overlap)
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1289.445,1292.024,Is that in the regulations anywhere?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1292.024,1292.539,Yes.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1292.539,1294.308,Is it in the statute?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1294.308,1298.354,It is not in the statute but I assume that the --
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.354,1303.862,"So, the first marketable product is a product of the Commissioner's mine?"
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1303.862,1311.168,Based -- based upon his reading of the -- of this Court's decision in Cannelton Sewer Pipe which talked about commercially marketable pipe.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.168,1324.617,Because isn't that a little -- isn't it a little strange to say that -- that there are three products that are the first marketable product even though bulk cement -- you have to do something else to it to get it in the bags?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1324.617,1324.871,Put it --

1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1327.26,1327.283,Yes.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.283,1329.445,-- to get it in the cement block.

1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1329.78,1332.738,And it costs you money to do it and yet you say all three are --
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1332.738,1334.39,"No, no."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.923,1340.739,You said it was.

1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1355.338,1357.765,What about the -- what about the bagged cement?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1357.765,1357.814,The bags --
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.814,1362.894,It costs him money if there's a whole new -- another process to go through to put in bags.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1362.894,1364.417,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1364.417,1368.165,And so how can there be two first marketable products?
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1368.165,1374.078,"Of course there -- no, there's only one first marketable product, cement, no matter how it's packaged."
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1374.078,1375.278,I know that's what you said.
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1375.278,1375.59,Yes.
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.59,1376.838,There's -- there's -- although --
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1376.838,1389.027,"Because in our view, bagging is not -- is not a chemical or a physical process that adds -- that -- that alters the character of the -- of the manufactured product."
1980.79-1907,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1401.333,1425.453,"Well, Mr. Smith, is that consistent with the Tenth Circuit's opinion at 14(a) of the petition down towards the bottom where the Court there says, “The Government seeks to have ""bagged cement"" be the ""first marketable product"" and to so include the expenses associated with the bag?"
1980.79-1907,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1427.704,1428.196,Tenth Circuit --

1980.79-1907,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1454.101,1460.51,"Once -- one answer might be that the reason you're here is because the Tenth Circuit, from your point of view, did not understand the case."
1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1460.51,1461.517,I think that's right.

1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1512.998,1513.264,Yes.
1980.79-1907,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1513.264,1518.099,But the profit on the bagged cement is less than the profit on the other cement because the bags are more --

1980.79-1907,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1653.596,1660.581,And I would like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal.
1980.79-1907,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1660.581,1662.276,Mr. Bedell.

1980.79-1907,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1713.43,1714.073,Yes.
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1714.073,1714.495,And bulk cement --
1980.79-1907,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1714.495,1719.325,Is -- is the case any more complicated than that?
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1719.325,1720.907,Not really.
1980.79-1907,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1735.298,1737.728,"Well, this sounds as though you agree with Mr. Smith --"
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1737.728,1739.132,It is --

1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1739.717,1741.224,I do not agree with Mr. Smith.
1980.79-1907,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1741.224,1744.379,"It sounds as though you do, though."
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1744.379,1744.794,"No, there are --"
1980.79-1907,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.794,1750.613,You say bagged -- you say bagged cement is not the -- one of the first marketable products (Voice Overlap) --
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1750.613,1757.107,I certainly do because bulk cement is sold in significant quantities.
1980.79-1907,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1757.107,1758.455,More bulk than bag.
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1758.455,1761.306,"Indeed, approximately 95% in bulk."
1980.79-1907,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1761.306,1761.636,"Well now, what if the situation were reversed?"
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1761.636,1764.116,It is the first product reached.
1980.79-1907,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1764.116,1773.127,"Suppose there were more in bags than in bulk, only 1% of bulk, would your position here be exactly the same?"
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1773.127,1783.272,"No, it would not because you have to have sufficient sales to establish the price so that you have a -- a meaningful first marketable product."
1980.79-1907,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.823,1793.84,"Where is that line of demarcation, 50%, 40%?"
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1793.84,1801.965,"Cases in the depletion area under the representative market or field price generally are found at 10%, 15%, 20%."
1980.79-1907,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.284,1812.7,"What -- what do you want it to -- to be included in your gross sales figure, the multiplier there?"
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1819.721,1841.758,The sales figures should include the gross sales of bulk cement and the sales value of the cement which is sold in bags because that also is the product of cement rock which was mined by the taxpayer and manufactured into finished cement.
1980.79-1907,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1841.758,1852.803,So you're saying that -- you -- you say along with Mr. Smith then that you include in the sales figure the -- the cement sold in bags?
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1852.803,1882.96,"You have to include an income figure for cement sold in bags and the proportionate profit formula contemplates this because it takes actual sales of the first marketable product, sales of cement in bulk and with respect to products that are second or third, they further processed or product after first marketable product, they take a constructed sales value derived from the sales value applied to the first marketable product."
1980.79-1907,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1882.96,1884.324,You used the word process.
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1889.196,1891.351,"It is the activity of putting it into a bag, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.79-1907,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1891.351,1893.997,"And that does have a process, does it?"
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1893.997,1896.976,"Not in the sense usually used in the depletion area, it is not."
1980.79-1907,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1896.976,1908.441,"(Inaudible) on the portion of the gross sales that represent product that was bagged, what is the constructive -- the sales price that the taxpayer contended for?"
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1915.038,1935.539,"The taxpayer took the -- what is the less favorable position, namely, less favorable to itself or the actual sales price less the bagging cost because in this case, as the Court has noted, the bagging cost exceeded the bag premium, the additional revenue generated by selling the cement in bags rather than in bulk."
1980.79-1907,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1952.603,1960.794,It doesn't seem to me that's consistent with your basic position that the sales cost is the cost of the unbagged cement.
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1968.223,1968.294,The --
1980.79-1907,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1968.294,1969.406,-- it's somewhat inconsistent.
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1969.406,1987.118,The taxpayer was following the law as had been set forth by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1968 in the Ideal Basic case when it interpreted the manner in which the proportionate profits formula functioned in the case of a cement manufacturer.
1980.79-1907,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1987.118,1994.136,"Do you agree, by the way, that the Government's position is the one that the regulation commands and so you must -- you must attack the regulation?"
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,1994.136,1995.985,"No, I do not agree with that."
1980.79-1907,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2091.388,2095.297,And when did the process end in your view?
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,2095.297,2097.903,The mining process ends at the point of kiln feed.

1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,2098.224,2105.689,"Well, that is introduced into the -- the kiln, there is no dispute between the Government and the taxpayer with respect to that."
1980.79-1907,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2177.628,2192.174,"What -- to echo my Brother Blackmun's question, what if your client sold all of the cement in bags and always had and always will?"
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,2192.174,2198.958,"If the -- all of the cement were sold in bags, bagged cement would be the first marketable product because what is being looked to --"
1980.79-1907,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2198.958,2200.681,Bagging would clearly be part of the --
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,2200.681,2203.208,Then bagging would be part of the cost in arriving at that --
1980.79-1907,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2203.208,2203.609,All right.
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,2203.609,2209.338,-- because what is being looked to is what is the point in the activity of getting to market when the taxpayer --
1980.79-1907,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2209.338,2220.615,"But however, if a competitor sold all of cement in bulk?The -- the difference of the mined product would be different between the two companies, wouldn't it?"

1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,2223.298,2227.403,"Under the proportionate profits formula, yes."
1980.79-1907,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2227.403,2227.827,To carry it one --
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,2227.827,2227.958,And --
1980.79-1907,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2227.958,2244.096,"-- step further, what if the industry as a whole sold largely or totally in bulk and this one manufacturer sold it just in bags?"
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,2244.096,2252.516,"There would be -- because of the -- the manner in which the formula, mathematical formula operates, there would be a different result."
1980.79-1907,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2257.923,2258.158,Right.
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,2258.158,2267.546,There are actual facts which can be looked to avoid what is an unrealistic result from the application of mechanical formula.
1980.79-1907,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2287.798,2309.783,"How is that different from, say, you have three or four methods of sales, some you sell through distributors and some on commission and some through door-to-door salesmen, and there are different sales costs per 10% of your business and another 20 and another 50, but it's still all cement would use -- and -- and as those proportions vary from year to year, the value of the -- of the mined product would also vary from year to year, as I suppose."
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,2327.469,2340.863,"One -- since the -- well, it seems to me it's different in two reasons because in -- in the first, there may be sales much closer to the -- the manufacturing plant itself and so as they're moved away from that --"
1980.79-1907,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2340.863,2344.542,I'm leaving out transportation because I'm just focusing on sales costs.
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,2344.542,2347.656,The other -- the other thing is that sales costs.
1980.79-1907,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2361.573,2362.095,"Well, that's exactly --"
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,2362.095,2362.217,And so they --
1980.79-1907,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2362.217,2363.257,-- like -- like they say the bags are --
1980.79-1907,1,20637,dennis_p_bedell,,2363.257,2364.096,-- they allocate --
1980.79-1907,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2364.096,2365.486,"-- allocated to both, too."
