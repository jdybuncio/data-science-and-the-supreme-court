1973.73-5412,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.831,"We’ll hear arguments next in Dillard against Industrial Commission, 73-5412."
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,11.05,14.361,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,110.007,111.731,And that meanwhile payments continue?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,111.731,114.938,"And meanwhile payments continue, yes."
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,114.938,115.811,Until?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,115.811,120.771,Until a determination is made after a due process hearing.
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,120.771,123.787,And if adverse to the employee at that stage?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,123.787,127.121,At that stage they may be terminated.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,127.121,130.756,What about written participation?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,130.756,138.676,In Some instances we would think that written submission of documentary evidence would certainly suffice.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,138.676,141.246,But only if he didn’t ask for more?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,141.246,141.69,"No, I think --"
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,141.69,148.784,Would he have the right -- would he have the right always to evidentiary hearing to cross-exam previous witnesses?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,148.784,149.89,No.
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,215.107,220.116,Is there any more usual or common ground of discontinuance?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,220.116,230.664,"I would think in the amicus brief it says that medical evidence that the doctor who treated the workers says, he is able to go back."
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,234.973,241.896,"Well now on cases like that, what kind of hearing would you think is required?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,241.896,259.512,"I think in most instances, what would be required would be the ability of the worker to submit time to get his own medical evidence and submit it possibly a doctor’s report, an evidentiary documentary report."
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,281.883,284.102,And who do you think should be the decider?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,284.102,289.11,"Well, the decider is under Virginia law, the Industrial Commission or an employee of --"
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,289.11,291.488,And there is no problem in that respect?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,291.488,295.326,No problem in that.
1973.73-5412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,295.326,301.997,What's the difference in the position of Williams and Dillard with respect to the continuing dispute in this case?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,305.174,313.038,"Mr. Dillard settled his individual claim with Aetna, his employer’s comp carrier."
1973.73-5412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,333.773,336.05,"Well, he appealed to the Supreme Court of Virginia?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,336.05,341.877,"Right, which was denied, he has noted or has filed a petition for certiorari in this Court."
1973.73-5412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,341.877,348.994,Did he raise before the Supreme Court of Virginia his due process contentions that he made before the Three-Judge District Court?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,348.994,359.223,"No, that was not before the Supreme Court of Virginia since all he was appealing was a finding by the Commission that he was no longer disabled."
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,370.831,373.579,"Well, the Commission I gather the post termination hearing?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,373.579,374.698,At a post termination.
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,374.698,378.491,Would you agree provides due process?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,378.491,379.074,Most definitely.
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,381.359,384.238,And that was before the Virginia Supreme Court in this case?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,384.238,384.963,No.
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,384.963,387.89,The appeal from its determination adverse to him?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,387.89,388.396,Correct.
1973.73-5412,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,393.477,397.483,"Well, wasn’t that affirmed by the Virginia Supreme Court?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,397.483,398.651,"Yes it was, Your Honor."
1973.73-5412,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,398.651,403.822,And what conceivably are your grounds in the petition for certiorari here from that affirmance?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,403.822,416.161,That there was no evidence before the court -- before the Commission to hold that his evidence -- that his disability had ended and therefore denied him due process.
1973.73-5412,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,416.161,418.94,So to sufficiency of the evidence point in turn?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,418.94,420.63,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,420.63,429.072,"But even if you lose there, there’s still a live of controversy here?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,429.072,431.447,I believe that this case is not moot.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.599,469.713,"Are you arguing that even if that were later determined that he was validly terminated, aren’t you claiming that this initial termination wasn’t proper because of inadequate procedures that you are entitled to payment until proper procedures were provided?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,469.713,471.79,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,474.842,482.313,"If you’re right on that this isn’t moot, then he have some back -- he had some so-called back pay."
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,482.313,485.853,That was not asked for in our complaint.
1973.73-5412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,487.821,492.353,"Well, you didn’t enjoin Travelers so you really couldn’t enjoin and ask for any money, could you?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,492.353,492.383,Right.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,492.383,496.805,"So, it really is a question about mootness, isn’t it?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,496.805,507.29,"Your Honor, we feel that this case fits precisely within what Mr. Justice Blackmun spoke of in Roe v. Wade."
1973.73-5412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.344,532.89,"But here if you enjoin Travelers and preserve the claim for money judgment, it wouldn’t have mooted out?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,532.89,535.476,That would have been a possibility.
1973.73-5412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,583.908,589.976,"But that was too in Burns versus Indiana Employment Security Commission too, wasn't it, that was decided last year?"
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.976,591.341,Burney.
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,591.341,591.92,Burney.
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,591.92,592.428,Burney.
1973.73-5412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,592.428,592.872,Burney.
1973.73-5412,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,592.872,594.98,Burney.
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,594.98,609.378,"The distinguishing factor in Burney and I do not know whether this is what the Court meant in Burney was here there was an intervention of a new member of the class, Mr. Williams."
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,685.177,693.116,Now will you say again why it is that these cases disappear in the course of litigation?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,693.116,695.943,Because a hearing is held.
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,695.943,697.128,That is post termination?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,697.128,698.113,Post termination hearing.
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,698.113,701.741,And the time limits within which that must be held is so short --
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,701.741,701.979,Is so short.
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,701.979,705.789,-- that inevitably it will have been concluded before the case can get to us?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,705.789,706.555,Correct Your Honor.
1973.73-5412,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,706.555,707.239,I see.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,707.239,710.205,"Well, I am not sure about that."
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,716.046,716.565,Correct.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.565,717.902,For the entire period.
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,745.568,749.689,I would have to agree that that would be one solution to this problem.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.689,753.326,Well the issue doesn't just washout.
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,767.206,767.784,Correct.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.519,772.591,That’s right.
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,772.591,773.14,Correct.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.682,779.117,"No, no."
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,790.35,795.257,Correct.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,853.555,861.317,Does each employee in Virginia enter into some kind of agreement when he goes to work covering his Workmen’s Compensation?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,861.317,873.054,"Under the statute in Virginia, every contract of employment, the whole Workmen’s Compensation system is read into every contract of employment."
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,881.164,888.767,So that the worker’s contract is with the employer?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,888.767,890.306,"For employment, correct."
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,890.306,897.042,And he is the one who has the obligations imposed by the Workmen’s Compensation system?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,897.042,899.515,Yes sir.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,899.515,908.043,"So, it’s really the employers that owes -- it’s the employer who really owes the payments?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,908.043,914.887,The statutes of Virginia provide for two ways to fulfill the duty.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.412,926.812,"Well even if the employer gets an insurance carrier to carry his loan form, it is the -- the worker who hasn't any relationship with the insurance company?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,926.812,929.096,Except possibly third party beneficiary.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.096,932.084,"No, but his contract is with the employer?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,932.084,939.97,But each contract of employment in Virginia by statute has read into it.
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.97,956.1,"Well, my real question is whether this employee if he was denied procedural due process in connection with termination of his benefits has a claim against the employer?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,956.1,957.462,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-5412,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,957.462,965.015,"Well, you didn’t need to enjoin Travelers then?"
1973.73-5412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,965.015,966.885,"Well, did you enjoin his employer?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,966.885,970.102,"No, Your Honor. [Laughter]"
1973.73-5412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.102,974.105,"They can opt out of this thing, can’t they by an affirmative action?"
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,974.105,985.833,"No, the Statute of Virginia, as the brief of the amici for the insurance industry pointed that as of January 1, 1974 neither the employer nor the employee can opt that."
1973.73-5412,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,985.833,987.163,It’s mandatory on both?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,987.163,988.11,It’s mandatory on both sides.
1973.73-5412,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1192.168,1208.954,"Mr. Levy, I think there’s a suggestion somewhere in the briefs perhaps that if you prevail here, employers might be less willing to commence payments and to reach settlements at the end of the disability period."
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,1212.302,1214.979,I would not agree with it.
1973.73-5412,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1249.047,1251.076,What are we talking about as a practical matter?
1973.73-5412,0,31406,john_m_levy,,1259.211,1261.422,There is some ambiguity in the record.
1973.73-5412,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1296.693,1297.617,Very well.
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,1304.729,1307.835,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-5412,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1401.831,1406.903,In other words the doctor’s report has to say that he is able to go back to work now?
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,1406.903,1409.366,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-5412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1425.03,1435.575,"I know you are right, but the guideline as proceeded by a sentence the Commission uses the following guidelines and you just suggest that’s not the case?"
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,1435.575,1436.336,Your Honor that’s --
1973.73-5412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1436.336,1437.333,That's not the case.
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,1437.333,1458.622,"That is not the case Your Honor with respect to this comment with the -- and also with respect to several others that are not as substantial, but this was apparently based on communications between the amici and the Commission which we were not a party to."
1973.73-5412,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.85,1745.613,Are the interests of the insurer and the employer always identical in this situation?
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,1750.049,1756.826,The system in Virginia is that it's value rated by industry.
1973.73-5412,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.15,1820.418,"Well that I should think of that situation, particularly a small employer might not have an identical interest with the insurer."
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,1831.669,1848.284,"He would not, but his carrier of course would have a legitimate interest in it and the employer has the interest to the extent that he would not want his premium to go up which it necessarily would as a result of this system."
1973.73-5412,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.864,2182.886,Mr. Dunn.
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,2182.886,2183.6,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-5412,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2183.6,2197.549,"In some States, I believe the Commission does not only administers the system but also has its own insurance program so that in effect the Commissioners can work two-halves when they are making a decision to compensation."
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,2204.45,2206.87,It’s all privately insured.
1973.73-5412,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2206.87,2209.465,"So, all of the Commission does basically is find the facts."
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,2214.559,2215.559,"No, they do not."
1973.73-5412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2317.121,2328.45,"Mr. Dunn, anything in the record which indicates whether there is a post termination hearing or how soon the ultimate determination, whether it is made or made at the hearing or --"
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,2328.45,2333.016,"Typically -- well, I should withdraw that word."
1973.73-5412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2337.951,2340.524,Would they set up the time before the final decision?
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,2340.524,2342.664,"Yes, just as at court does."
1973.73-5412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2342.664,2344.532,I see.
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,2344.532,2347.712,"Obviously, it depends to an extent on the complexity of the matter before the Commission."
1973.73-5412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2347.712,2350.453,"And those decisions, are they written in form?"
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,2350.453,2352.274,They are.
1973.73-5412,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2411.76,2423.597,"Well, do I gather from the last remark that if this case is reversed, that Virginia will have to revise its systems substantially?"
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,2423.597,2429.971,The gravamen of my remark was toward the effect which it would have upon the operation of the system.
1973.73-5412,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2437.221,2441.006,"Well, I just wondered if you’re going to have entirely a new world in which to live?"
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,2441.006,2451.599,"Well, I think it’s difficult to determine because under the brief, the argument seem to be by the appellants that they were entitled to a Goldberg hearing."
1973.73-5412,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2487.235,2507.054,"Well, when you speak of a Goldberg type of hearing, are you suggesting that the hearing officer who could consider the matter in the Goldberg case would be more objective, more neutral than the Commission here?"
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,2507.054,2508.437,Depending on the state --
1973.73-5412,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2508.437,2511.528,Or do you -- were you addressing yourself to the content of the hearing?
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,2511.528,2515.981,"I was addressing myself to the procedure, that is cross-examination, presentation of evidence etcetera."
1973.73-5412,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2515.981,2516.91,I see.
1973.73-5412,1,41222,stuart_h_dunn,,2517.914,2528.382,Thank you.
1973.73-5412,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2528.382,2534.338,Mr. Brame.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,2534.338,2538.017,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-5412,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2636.509,2645.224,"Of course, as I read appellants’ brief they agree that Virginia could change the law if this thing were reversed and permit recoup?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,2645.224,2654.124,"They could permit recoup, but I think probably the answer and this gets again to the state's arguments that delicate balance here that state has struck."
1973.73-5412,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2684.071,2695.37,"Has there ever been any attack on that Virginia statute on the grounds that it’s a denial of due process, the irrebuttable presumption in effect about the recoupment?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,2695.37,2696.424,"Not -- no, Your Honor."
1973.73-5412,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2903.085,2909.556,"That doesn't meet the time problem that was involved for example in Goldberg, does it?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,2909.556,2913.894,"Well, Your Honor if you read Goldberg together with Roth, I think it does."
1973.73-5412,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2981.345,2985.364,"And the employee has a lot of trouble recovering this late too, doesn’t he?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,2985.364,2991.715,"Well, that would be a problem of disability, Your Honor and there is no probation for any payment for cessation of payment."
1973.73-5412,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2991.715,2992.905,Simply pick another one.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,2992.905,2994.285,Oh!
1973.73-5412,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2994.285,2999.794,(Inaudible) you suspend him afterward after you give it?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,2999.794,3000.747,That’s right.
1973.73-5412,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3001.587,3005.128,And suspending it without him knowing a thing about it?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3005.128,3008.253,"In case, well, he is notified but even assuming that’s true --"
1973.73-5412,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3008.253,3011.696,"Well, will he know anything about it before you suspend it?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3011.696,3013.225,"It depends on the circumstances, Your Honor."
1973.73-5412,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3033.347,3036.028,That’s why the case is here to see if you want to prohibit it?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3036.028,3036.538,That’s right.
1973.73-5412,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3058.79,3074.645,Supposing the Commission as of May 15 finds their probable -- finds there is probable cause to terminate and then the employee goes into the circuit court and seeks to recover payments due under the award from May 15th to June 1st.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3083.449,3088.813,It will -- the Commission’s determination of probable cause is completely irrelevant.
1973.73-5412,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3099.61,3103.939,Do you mean the employee could recover the payment on a circuit court action?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3103.939,3105.028,Yes.
1973.73-5412,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3123.574,3136.499,"Mr. Bram, as I understand it, it’s in 90% or so of the cases compensation is agreed upon between the employer and the employee and they never go to the state agency, is that right?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3136.499,3143.842,"Well, they go to the state agency, Your Honor, the 95% figure I believe is a question of initial entitlement."
1973.73-5412,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3143.842,3146.877,Right.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3146.877,3156.982,Any agreement between the employer and the employee respecting compensation payments after an injury must be approved by the Industrial Commission.
1973.73-5412,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3185.867,3191.398,"And then termination in the 90% or so the cases are also by voluntary agreement, is that right?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3191.398,3193.881,I am not sure if the figure is that high.
1973.73-5412,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3212.899,3221.078,"And then on those cases, in the vast majority of cases you say they are in which termination of compensation is by voluntary agreement."
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3226.293,3226.532,Yes.
1973.73-5412,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3266.112,3277.957,Mr. Brame to sum it up an order is added in every case authorizing or proving the payments and the order must be entered in every case to terminate?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3277.957,3278.687,That’s right Your Honor.
1973.73-5412,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3286.091,3287.369,I understand that.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3299.761,3307.436,"Notice was given to Mr. Dillard, Your Honor."
1973.73-5412,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3351.242,3360.736,And what’s the purpose of notifying the employee if he does not have an opportunity to participate in the probable cause determination?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3360.736,3368.342,I am not sure that -- how -- if I can answer that completely.
1973.73-5412,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3390.534,3414.458,"Well, the letter that you have referred to at page 75 calls for the employee if he agrees to indicate agreement and I suppose in a great many of the cases, if not on majority the employee does agree and he indicates that in response to this notice, is that correct?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3414.458,3418.992,"Your Honor, there is a fair degree of response."
1973.73-5412,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3450.781,3461.593,"Well, in any event if after receiving this notice and he has the opportunity to respond to it if he wishes to, but if he goes back to work on the following Monday then there’s no problem I take it."
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3461.593,3473.214,"There -- well, there is no problem under the situation as it now exists although that award continues and he can go into court presumably and enforce it even then up until the hearing."
1973.73-5412,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3477.136,3480.756,"As the letter states that it does not terminate the award, does it not?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3480.756,3481.056,Right.
1973.73-5412,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3482.283,3482.978,"Yes, it does?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3482.978,3483.268,It does.
1973.73-5412,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3485.231,3491.094,Do I understand it correctly that there is nothing in the record on fees on this one way or the other and you don’t know if you’re own person or not?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3491.094,3491.862,No.
1973.73-5412,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3491.879,3493.483,Did I get you correctly?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3493.483,3494.437,As to what?
1973.73-5412,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3494.437,3498.204,As to the number of these that are signed and the number that are agreed.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3498.204,3498.503,That’s right.
1973.73-5412,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3499.224,3501.37,There is nothing in the record and you don’t know either?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3501.37,3502.351,No.
1973.73-5412,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3502.351,3510.248,"Would you interpret that as a valid employee that “by the night by the sleep you had it?"""
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3510.248,3514.191,Yes.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3514.191,3518.701,"You say, he is entitled for court pending the appeal under the hearing?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3518.701,3520.018,Yes.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3520.018,3524.485,So to prevail he would have to show there was a probable cause to termination?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3524.485,3526.986,"No, it has no relationship Your Honor."
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3530.521,3534.285,You just show the award if they pay me?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3534.285,3551.37,It’s in the Appendix to our brief which is a green brief that’s Virginia Code Section 65.1-100 and all he has to do is show the court that he’s got an award by the Commission that’s outstanding and it has not been modified and the amounts that have been paid and he gets an order immediately.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3551.37,3557.413,"Well, why hasn’t it been modified by termination based of probable cause?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3557.413,3564.708,The termination based on probable cause does not -- has no relationship to the award.
1973.73-5412,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3597.537,3612.978,"But at anytime until after the so-called due process hearing and the final official termination by the Industrial Commission, the employee can go into court and collect under the award?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3612.978,3614.701,Yes.
1973.73-5412,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3617.189,3618.886,And the employer has no defense?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3618.886,3619.746,That’s right.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3622.143,3633.524,"After the due process hearing, after the court hearing and the award is terminated, I would suppose the employee if he hasn’t been paid meanwhile could still go back and sue for the interim period?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3633.524,3634.451,"No, the --"
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3634.451,3636.139,Because it wasn’t terminated during that period?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3636.139,3644.295,It wasn’t terminated during that period but the Commission’s order in most cases dates back to the date the application was received.
1973.73-5412,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3651.004,3661.761,"Well, I thought is this procedure that you say operate that the employer never gets to post termination hearing until he has paid up to the date of that hearing?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3661.761,3662.217,"Not to the date of hearing, to the date of the application."
1973.73-5412,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3662.217,3664.037,"No, no date of the application."
1973.73-5412,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3664.037,3665.068,Date of the application?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3665.068,3665.784,That’s right.
1973.73-5412,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3665.784,3668.546,I see.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3668.546,3670.106,In answer to the question on the --
1973.73-5412,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3670.106,3674.715,What's the precise the probable cause?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3674.715,3677.743,Your Honor we ask the same question.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3677.743,3684.145,"One of the facts is you never been -- the employer has never been paying, the employer doesn’t pay anymore, that’s it?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3684.145,3684.818,That’s right.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3684.818,3688.528,"He doesn’t pay at all although he is legally obligated to, you’re telling me."
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3688.528,3690.608,That’s the way we read this Section.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3690.608,3692.876,The Commission hasn’t told them not to pay?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3692.876,3695.311,"No, that’s --"
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3695.311,3697.028,You said there’s probable cause to terminate.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3697.028,3697.939,That’s right.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3697.939,3699.098,And he is terminated.
1973.73-5412,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3699.098,3699.514,Right.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3699.514,3700.337,Right.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3700.337,3703.403,And he is put to act and nevertheless he is legally obligated to be paid.
1973.73-5412,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3703.403,3705.093,If the Court orders him to do so.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3705.093,3705.522,That’s right.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3706.222,3711.028,But the awarding what the Court would say is the award have never got effected.
1973.73-5412,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3711.028,3711.722,Right.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3711.722,3716.157,"Mainly, that you got ordered before let say if you put up the warrant."
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3719.287,3722.326,At what point in time now?
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3722.326,3723.586,Before you go to the court.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3723.586,3724.033,Right.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3724.033,3724.81,Pending the hearing.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3724.81,3725.438,Right.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3725.438,3726.943,And he wins in the court.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3730.97,3731.756,That’s right.
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3731.756,3735.731,I assume there was a legal obligation to pay whether the Court sets the order or not?
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3735.731,3740.116,"Well, in the sense there is -- in the sense there’s a contractual."
1973.73-5412,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3740.116,3749.025,"Well, while the employer is just ignoring his legal duties, what do you suggest?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3749.025,3761.661,"I almost have just after -- well, it’s a contractual duty now whether the moral onus is something else, but they do have a continuing award requiring them to pay and they don’t pay."
1973.73-5412,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3761.661,3766.66,"Well, do you have a Virginia decided case that says that?"
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3766.66,3790.612,"The one, the decision on this -- the best I can find from quickly looking at the annotations, one called Parrigen v. Long, 134 Southeast 562 which says that under Section 100 which is the enforcement section that the court’s duty is strictly ministerial."
1973.73-5412,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3791.453,3793.335,"Excuse me, excuse me."
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3793.335,3799.448,It can inquire into the whether or not the employee was actually entitled.
1973.73-5412,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3819.302,3833.764,And then you told us I think of a case where the court awarded compensation for a period of a year-and-half after have been back at work simply because there have been no official termination.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3834.908,3839.13,That was the Manchester case which is cited in our brief; it was cited in everybody’s brief.
1973.73-5412,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3839.13,3839.811,Right.
1973.73-5412,2,29212,j_robert_brame_iii,,3839.811,3846.056,Manchester Board and Paper Company.
1973.73-5412,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3846.056,3848.815,"Mr. Levy, do you have anything further?"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,3848.815,3850.299,I might --
1973.73-5412,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3850.299,3851.882,Tell us why you are here Mr. Levy?
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,3851.882,3852.332,Pardon me?
1973.73-5412,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3852.332,3856.55,Can you tell us why you’re here if that’s --
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,3856.55,3864.503,First of all there has absolutely no litigation under Section 100 under a Rule 13 procedure.
1973.73-5412,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3869.047,3869.796,Pending a hearing.
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,3869.796,3879.008,"Pending a hearing, once the benefits are suspended, there has been no determination as to what the court would do."
1973.73-5412,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3896.825,3904.577,"Yes, but you have to get into court before the hearing and if the court wasn't very busy and heard your case right away."
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,3909.616,3914.453,The Court under that statute -- the language of that statute would have to enter a judgment.
1973.73-5412,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3922.462,3934.919,"Let's actually have this -- there would be an order to pay or the employer would just say “I am awfully sorry, I know you’ve got a judgment, but I won’t pay you?”"
1973.73-5412,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3934.919,3941.072,"In my years of practice, a judgment against Travelers or against the Aetna always thought to be a pretty valuable thing? [Laughter]"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,3941.072,3948.711,Well you have -- before you a judgment of the Commission to pay until disability is --
1973.73-5412,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3948.711,3954.12,"But then you have a judgment of the Circuit Court, don’t you, after you go to court?"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,3954.12,3973.002,"But still you have a judgment and I would assume that court would say if there is a hearing -- when this hearing comes effect, we are not going to force Travelers to pay since the very basis for that decision will be terminated retroactively."
1973.73-5412,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3973.002,3982.304,"Really, then it is your submission that there is an undecided question of Virginia law in the case as to what the effect of a suit in the Circuit Court during this period of time would be?"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,3982.304,3988.07,"Well, I think it is clear that the whole intent of that statute could be interpreted in no other way."
1973.73-5412,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3988.07,3995.722,"I suppose by the time you got your suit filed, the time for the post termination hearing would have arrived and have been concluded with it?"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,3995.722,3997.07,That is another aspect.
1973.73-5412,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3997.07,4000.866,Then what happens to the law suit in the Circuit Court?
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4000.866,4004.413,"That is an undecided question of state law, certainly."
1973.73-5412,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4004.413,4009.611,That’s the way they do things in Virginia? [Laughter]
1973.73-5412,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4009.611,4021.915,"But it is decided apparently that until there is an official termination by order of the Industrial Commission, the award is in effect as the Manchester case holds, doesn’t it?"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4021.915,4023.02,This is prior to rule 13.
1973.73-5412,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4023.02,4029.381,Giving a man compensation for a year-and-half after he is back at work simply because the award has not been officially terminated.
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4029.381,4048.902,But there has been no litigation first under the old Rule 13 and certainly under the new Rule 13 and it would defy common sense for the Virginia courts to hold that you will give a judgment and let it be collected when that judgment is going to be or possibly will be retroactively terminated.
1973.73-5412,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4048.902,4057.619,"Well, it doesn’t seem to be common sense, but let’s close all the interrogation from the bench. [Laughter Attempt]"
1973.73-5412,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4057.619,4062.707,What do we -- the commission have probable cause.
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4062.707,4064.797,Correct.
1973.73-5412,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4064.797,4068.509,"Now, that's meaningless."
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4068.509,4070.725,It is not meaningless to the injured worker.
1973.73-5412,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4070.862,4080.573,I know but if the employer relies on (Inaudible) but apparently it doesn’t affect the guy were involved.
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4080.573,4092.208,"It affects legally before a court, a Circuit Court in Virginia that is a question of what the effect that is, but in actuality he suspect --"
1973.73-5412,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4092.208,4097.095,Now you brought it up. [Laughter]
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4097.095,4099.376,One other response that I would like to make --
1973.73-5412,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4099.376,4114.029,"Before you go to the response, aren’t you really asking some kind of a judicial command from someone, some court somewhere to keep up the payments until there has been a full adversary hearing?"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4114.029,4115.118,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-5412,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4115.118,4121.774,"In other words sort of a specific performance, equity relief?"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4121.774,4131.56,We are asking that this Court say that Rule 13 does not provide due process by in reality terminates suspending benefits.
1973.73-5412,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4131.56,4138.413,"As I understand Mr. Brame he said he is going to circuit court, you will get just that, we want the money ahead of time?"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4138.413,4149.353,We will get another judgment which is a ministerial act of the court which any insurance company will treat the same way as the judgment of the Commission.
1973.73-5412,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4150.593,4157.256,Do you mean the judgment -- do you mean there is no way in Virginia to enforce a judgment against the insurance company?
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4157.256,4160.529,"Yes, there are the traditional common law remedies --"
1973.73-5412,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4160.529,4161.558,"Well, I thought so."
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4161.558,4163.375,Yes attachment.
1973.73-5412,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4163.375,4165.481,So should they give another judgment?
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4165.481,4167.201,"Correct, Your Honor."
1973.73-5412,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4167.201,4172.791,"Well then the Court will give you what you want the Commission to give you, what would you want us to give you?"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4172.791,4174.082,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-5412,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4174.564,4175.417,"Well, what do you want?"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4179.653,4181.214,We want a notice.
1973.73-5412,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4182.743,4185.984,"Or is it, if you get your money, do you want a notice?"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4185.984,4188.113,No. [Laughter]
1973.73-5412,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4188.113,4198.136,So you are asking us to order the company to pay you the money until they have the due process hearing?
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4198.136,4198.603,No.
1973.73-5412,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4199.027,4201.434,Will you be satisfied with it?
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4201.434,4202.485,"Certainly, but I don’t think --"
1973.73-5412,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4202.485,4209.328,"Well, as I understand all you have to do is file a piece of paper at a court and you get just that?"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4209.328,4213.267,I think that is not clear in Virginia law.
1973.73-5412,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4218.626,4220.233,If you get the money?
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4220.233,4222.774,"Yes, but you have to have, you have to go --"
1973.73-5412,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4222.774,4226.384,"If you give me the money, I don’t care about the notice? [Laughter]"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4226.384,4231.76,"No, but the filing of the Court -- the papers in the Court does not give you the money."
1973.73-5412,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4233.306,4243.752,"If you owe me money and you pay me money, you can even deny me due process, if you give me my money, am I right? [Laughter]"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4243.752,4247.402,"The procedure is -- Yes, you are right. [Laughter]"
1973.73-5412,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4346.627,4357.145,"It sounds to me as though what you are doing is conceding that you have an adequate remedy at law, but it is too complicated and takes to long."
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4359.943,4368.047,"No, by the very fact that it is complicated and takes too long, the plaintiffs in Goldberg had a procedure."
1973.73-5412,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4374.316,4377.678,"But that was not a contractual case, was it?"
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4377.678,4378.868,No.
1973.73-5412,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4378.868,4379.911,Welfare.
1973.73-5412,3,31406,john_m_levy,,4379.911,4381.916,It was not a contractual case.
1973.73-5412,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4399.263,4400.385,Very well Mr. Levy.
