1996.96-110,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,4.184,"We'll hear argument now in No. 96-110, Washington versus Harold Glucksberg."
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,5.165,8.318,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please The Court.
1996.96-110,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,145.956,158.765,"Mr. Williams, in the Cruzan case, The Court recognized a liberty interest and yet it upheld restrictive legislation."
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,158.765,161.237,"Yes, ma'am, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.96-110,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,161.237,176.177,"So couldn't one take the same approach here, there is a liberty interest, but because of the risks and dangers involved, considerable state regulation is permissible?"
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,176.177,180.258,"Yes, Your Honor, one could take that approach."
1996.96-110,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,210.819,215.013,And the bottom line of Cruzan was to uphold precisely what the state did.
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,215.013,216.752,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1996.96-110,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.752,227.378,What are the state interests you would argue support the law here in the event that a liberty interest is recognized?
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,227.378,231.472,"Your Honor, there are three important state interests that are involved."
1996.96-110,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,291.983,327.947,"Mr. Williams, taking the second one separately, the fear of abuse, the argument runs in various forms that, if what the... what the two Courts of Appeals so far have recognized prevails, the risk is that, in fact, the practice of assistance, so-called, is going to sort of gravitate down to those who are not terminally ill, to those, in fact, who have not made a truly voluntary or knowing choice."
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,367.494,370.627,"I would make at least two suggestions, Justice Souter."
1996.96-110,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,424.603,427.665,Let me direct you into a narrower channel.
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,463.768,480.058,"Again, the second suggestion I was going to make would be to look at the district court decision in the case involving the Oregon statute, where the district court noted that the proponents of the Oregon law which is limited in the same way that these Respondents suggest it should be, to the terminally ill."
1996.96-110,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,489.154,493.949,But that's a variant... I think that's a variant of the... sort of the problem of doctrinal slippage.
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,529.292,534.335,"Well, there's no empirical basis in our country, of course, because we do not have a history of recognizing that."
1996.96-110,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,534.335,538.857,Is there anything beyond the references to the Dutch experience?
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,538.857,545.502,"Well, there's the references to the Dutch experience which are I think important and telling in terms of modern history."
1996.96-110,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,549.715,553.716,"What about the Australian, wasn't there something about Australian law?"
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,553.716,562.271,"The northern territory of Australia, Justice Ginsburg, has authorized by statutory action a form of physician-assisted suicide."
1996.96-110,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,576.522,581.876,The Australian proposal was not as the result of a judicial decision I take it.
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,581.876,583.976,"That's my understanding, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-110,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,583.976,595.965,"Indeed it was... whatever the legal status of the Netherlands, but courts elsewhere don't have the kind of Constitutional review that we do either."
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,596.365,599.419,"I believe that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.96-110,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,599.419,609.896,"--But has there been a lot in the briefs about the Netherlands experience, there is this limited legislation in Australia."
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,615.73,623.403,"I think that legislation is so new, my understanding it just became effective in this past year in 1996, that we don't... I'm not aware of any--"
1996.96-110,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,623.403,625.376,May I ask you a question.
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,642.717,644.627,"--Yes, Justice Stevens, it is."
1996.96-110,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,653.243,656.435,"The district court in that case disagreed with that, I think, didn't it?"
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,656.435,667.832,"My... Your Honor, the district court said that the statute that they adopted did not have adequate safeguards and, therefore, did not qual... did not meet rational basis review for equal protection purposes."
1996.96-110,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,672.406,678.681,Didn't the Ninth Circuit in this case kind of express its disapproval of the district court ruling in Oregon?
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,678.681,680.782,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, Judge Rhinehart."
1996.96-110,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,680.782,683.363,"Of course, you're not endorsing the Ninth Circuit's position, though?"
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,683.724,689.157,Let me be perfectly clear on that.
1996.96-110,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,689.507,713.734,"You indicated in your response to Justice Ginsburg that, if we assumed a liberty interest but nevertheless found that the very substantial arguments you have made outweighed it, so that the Washington laws would remain in effect, that this would somehow be confining to legislators and regulators?"
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,729.252,733.696,"What I was trying to suggest, that... maybe if I could explain it differently."
1996.96-110,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,758.393,765.186,"Well, it would be very difficult to assume a liberty interest and rule in your favor in this case, would it not?"
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,776.586,797.817,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I disagree to this extent: I believe the state... the same important state interests that were implicated in the Cruzan case are implicated here but more strongly, because in the context of withdrawing life support and in the physician assisted suicide there are some different factual--"
1996.96-110,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,797.817,805.804,But in Cruzan what we were dealing with was a state rule that said you had to prove a certain thing by clear and convincing evidence.
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,810.215,812.296,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-110,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.296,825.585,"I suppose that proclaiming a liberty interest is cost-free so long as you can proclaim them and then say, however they can be outweighed by various social policies adopted by the states."
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,834.191,835.701,"That's true, Justice Scalia."
1996.96-110,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,859.25,875.639,The analysis usually is to ask and to determine whether there's a liberty interest at the outset rather than say that your... that that inquiry is going to be affected by the standard of review that you use.
1996.96-110,0,46501,william_l_williams,,882.374,885.306,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.96-110,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,888.817,889.898,"Very well, Mr. Williams."
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,891.929,903.805,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.96-110,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,903.805,917.286,"General Dellinger, these last questions, of course, really should be addressed by you because it's your brief that takes the position that there is a liberty interest, but nonetheless, the law should be upheld."
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,917.286,918.828,"--That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1996.96-110,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,967.729,970.912,And what... what precisely is the liberty interest that you urge us to recognize?
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,970.912,997.259,"--We urge you to acknowledge, Mr. Chief Justice, that we think it's not critical to the case, but we urge you to acknowledge that a person states a cognizable liberty interest when he or she alleges that the state is imposing severe pain and suffering or has adopted a rule which prevents someone from the only means of relieving that pain and suffering."
1996.96-110,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1000.081,1003.022,It certainly wasn't the basis on which the Ninth Circuit decided that.
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1003.022,1004.444,"--That is correct, that is correct."
1996.96-110,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1024.286,1031.781,"And how does it differ from the liberty interest recognized or assumed, let's say, by the plurality in Cruzan?"
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1031.781,1050.123,"--That is a liberty interest that is sort of a... deeply a part of the antitotalitarian principle, the state may not compel a person to undergo unwanted medical treatment, recognized very substantially in history."
1996.96-110,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1091.711,1110.823,"Mr. Dellinger, we've always had such laws and you go back as far as Blackstone and find Blackstone saying that suicide is not excused even when committed, quote, to avoid those ills which persons had not the fortitude to endure."
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1127.025,1128.496,--1790.
1996.96-110,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1128.496,1129.878,1790?
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1129.878,1131.908,I'm saying... the answer is not... not in jest.
1996.96-110,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1179.249,1183.009,"But that has nothing to do with... that has nothing to do with suicide, it has nothing to do with--"
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1183.009,1183.329,--That is correct.
1996.96-110,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.329,1190.445,"--with a continuous tradition in our society, if not, indeed, in all western society against... against suicide."
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1190.445,1190.695,That is correct.
1996.96-110,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1228.79,1229.852,"General, it could."
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1239.598,1262.052,"Justice Souter, it is said that the risks that... that are suggested I think by all of the parties are best weighed by you with the understanding that no American jurisdiction has ever recognized physician-assisted suicide as a lawful practice."
1996.96-110,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1279.324,1306.221,"Of course, that... that might be a... a perfectly legitimate argument for saying that, on the... on the subject of recognizing the... the... the... the ultimate cognizability of... of new substantive due process rights, timing is a legitimate factor in what The Court does and maybe, in fact, you might argue The Court should wait until it can know more--"
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1306.221,1307.433,--It would be--
1996.96-110,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1307.433,1309.274,--before it passes ultimate judgment.
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1309.274,1309.524,--Yes.
1996.96-110,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1321.862,1331.319,"General Dellinger, now or ever, because this case raises that very basic question of who decides."
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1347.337,1357.035,"Justice Ginsburg, we believe that the states have interests that are enduring that would sustain a decision by the state simply not to introduce lethal medication."
1996.96-110,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.656,1372.365,"But you say... you say only if we agree with the states, you say there is a liberty interest which... which... which tosses the whole matter into this Court so that it's up to us to decide whether indeed the states are right or wrong that this is a dangerous practice."
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1376.546,1377.047,--Yes.
1996.96-110,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.047,1379.05,That's the consequence of recognizing the literate.
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1379.05,1380.92,"Yes, that is... that is correct."
1996.96-110,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1399.484,1400.553,What page?
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1401.174,1406.597,"--Page 120, Justice Kennedy, the third paragraph below the middle of the page."
1996.96-110,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1458.041,1477.313,"So... so what... what should I make I thought in these very helpful briefs and there were so many helpful briefs, the statistics, and I'm quite serious here, they were very helpful, on that worried me the most that says that only between 1 percent or 2 percent of possibly all people need die in pain."
1996.96-110,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1495.123,1512.846,"The fact that 25 percent unnecessarily die in pain shows the task awaiting the medical profession, but it's not a task that calls for the cheap and easy expedient of lethal medication rather than the more expensive pain palliative."
1996.96-110,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1512.846,1514.178,"Thank you, General Dellinger."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1516.338,1518.92,Thank you.
1996.96-110,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1539.743,1542.095,You say... you say they have the... have the liberty to choose.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1556.685,1557.546,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1578.07,1581.172,"Ms. Tucker, why... why is it limited to those on the threshold of death?"
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1587.515,1588.277,Your Honor--
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.277,1590.287,Why shouldn't I have the right to suicide.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1590.287,1595.252,"--Justice Scalia, we do draw the line at a patient who is confronting death."
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1614.794,1618.787,"I hate to tell you, but the dying process of all of us has begun and is underway."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1631.173,1638.97,"Well, I think not, Justice Scalia, because the patient who is facing this question of how to die... this is the final decision for this individual."
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1667.928,1679.286,"Ms. Tucker, you... you... you said on one end of it that it's got to be the terminal point of life, however one defines soon to die."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1704.043,1708.253,"--Your Honor, we don't believe that that class of persons in reality would exist."
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1715.399,1716.639,Let's take this person.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1724.255,1725.575,--I see your point.
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1730.86,1737.303,But wants it and six psychiatrists will swear that that's the mental state of that person.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1737.303,1745.38,"--Your Honor, we would posit that that is not permissible, that self-administration does address an important state concern here, and that's the concern of voluntariness."
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1762.401,1768.725,"Now, we believe everything that you said, it seems to me, could go on in a legislative chamber."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1770.966,1771.477,Well--
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1771.477,1784.954,To say that as a matter of Constitutional due process you include the person who is able to take the pill herself but exclude the one whose mental state is the same?
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1791.638,1799.343,"--I think again in the constitutional analysis, Your Honor, we are considering the state interests as balanced against the patient's interests."
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1822.701,1829.915,"Why should that decision, if it's competent, reasoned, and deliberated, why should it be limited to physical pain?"
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1838.379,1838.8,That--
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1838.8,1842.032,"You would not allow assisted suicide in that case, I take it?"
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1842.032,1842.693,"--No, Your Honor."
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1842.693,1843.134,Why is that?
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1850.077,1858.943,"Your Honor, mental competency and freedom from a mental disability or instability including such as a condition--"
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1858.943,1859.554,You don't have to be--
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1859.554,1859.985,--like depression.
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.985,1862.686,"--You don't have to be unstable to think that your life is not worth living, do you?"
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1864.476,1872.873,"I think that mental competency here is a bright line and that the... that decision as to whether the patient is mentally competent, of course, is a clinician's judgment."
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.873,1881.947,"Assume mental competence and assume a patient who is thoroughly mentally competent, is not at the threshold of death, is not in physical pain, but does not want to live anymore."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1881.947,1886.852,"Well, and again that patient is not confronted with the choice that we address in this lawsuit."
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.852,1891.784,"What I'm asking, why you... how can you limit the choice you're presenting to us to the physical pain situation?"
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1891.784,1899.231,"That individual, if intervention occurs and is not allowed to make this choice, may one day rejoice in that."
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.01,1921.274,"And you're willing to have the government impose that judgement, even though the patient says these emotional scars will never heal."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1921.274,1922.776,--I believe that the constitutional--
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1922.776,1938.375,"And I've tried it for ten years, I want out; you're willing to let the government make that judgment for the person, but not willing to make the judgment that your... your physical pain is... is not as harmful as a few more years of life would be."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1944.629,1946.522,"--I believe that's an entirely different case, Your Honor."
1996.96-110,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1950.142,1952.095,"Well, but it is... it is different."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1957.687,1959.269,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-110,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1959.269,1964.602,And you are saying that the state can tell individuals that they may not take their own life.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,1964.602,1966.295,"Yes, Your Honor, absolutely."
1996.96-110,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1966.295,1970.857,But I... I still... I... I confess I don't understand what the limit is.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2000.406,2007.221,"Well, the... the terminally ill patient does not have the expectation of a continued life beyond this very short interim before death."
1996.96-110,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2031.516,2034.828,"Your... your argument basically is an autonomy argument, then."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2034.828,2043.593,"--Well, this... this I think will enable me to respond to the Solicitor General's comment that what we're dealing with here is simply a liberty interest in avoiding pain and suffering."
1996.96-110,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2058.853,2061.244,"Well, it is... it is not only important, but it's essential--"
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2061.244,2061.525,It is--
1996.96-110,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2061.525,2064.246,--to your... to your definition of the liberty interest.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2074.715,2083.491,"--The... the second in the constellation of interest is decisional autonomy, and the third in the constellation that has bearing here is the interest in bodily integrity."
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2090.476,2092.396,"Ms. Tucker, may I ask you just to qualify one thing."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2141.146,2143.66,"--I think that's possible, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2158.839,2178.243,"That's another thing too, you're talking about all these regulations, very tight regulations for most liberty interests, we think of them as being free, not... and then, if you're asking a court to declare the interests, who is then to make all these regulations?"
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2181.095,2198.336,"--Justice Ginsburg, we are asking simply that this Court recognize the vital liberty interest at stake and that it is a protected choice but not asking this Court to engage in legislation, we are not asking this Court to promulgate a code for regulation of the practice."
1996.96-110,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2199.896,2201.889,You're not asking that now.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2211.563,2220.459,"I think not, Chief Justice Rehnquist, for this reason, we do think it's appropriate for that experimentation to occur in the states."
1996.96-110,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2230.736,2241.653,"But you're going to find the same thing I suspect that perhaps has happened with the abortion cases, there are people who are just totally opposed and people who are totally in favor of them."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2252.422,2267.071,"--Well, I think that what we see when we look at the quite extensive proposed models that are both in the medical and legal literature and have been presented to The Court and discussed in some of the amicus briefs is that there is substantial agreement from all factions that have joined--"
1996.96-110,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2267.071,2277.447,"Well, I think that there is no doubt that it would result if we upheld your position, it would result in a flow of cases through The Court system for heaven knows how long."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2333.964,2343.371,"--I take your point, Justice O'Connor, but I do think that we are dealing with an issue, the literature is extensive on this, that ours is a culture of denial of death."
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2357.939,2359.35,Presumably the majority disagrees with you about that?
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2368.746,2385.876,"We also have the problem, Your Honor, of the quite well-established and understood underground practice of physician aid in dying and that that is available primarily to the educated and the affluent who can access a physician to provide in that assistance."
1996.96-110,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2385.876,2391.73,May I go back to the reference in your answer to Justice O'Connor to the political process not working.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2440.886,2455.867,"Well, I think what I was getting at, Justice Souter, is that because there's the denial and people do not confront mortality until faced up against it, you do not have an activist component that is able to address that in the legislative process."
1996.96-110,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2462.02,2465.541,I think your argument there is somewhat inconsistent with the filings in this case.
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2472.567,2493.05,"And, Ms. Tucker, isn't it true that maybe the individual hasn't thought about it, but most of us have parents or other loved ones and we've lived through a dying experience that forces us to think about these things."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2507.829,2528.743,"--I think the final point that I will address to the court on why we should not simply leave this to the legislative process is perhaps the most important point, and that is that this Court has never left to the legislative process the protection of vital liberties, and the liberty at issue in this case is certainly of a vital and substantial nature."
1996.96-110,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2528.743,2531.725,"Well, but it's a matter of defining the liberty."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2559.773,2570.14,We're asking this Court to simply recognize the vital nature of this liberty and to leave to state experimentation the regulatory process and the state--
1996.96-110,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2570.14,2572.812,"Ms. Tucker, may I challenge your premise."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2638.885,2646.79,"--I think, Justice Souter, there is a tremendous amount of guidance on how to weight this liberty interest in this Court's precedence."
1996.96-110,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2663.893,2665.413,I disagree with that characterization.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2671.177,2671.767,Yes.
1996.96-110,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2673.307,2675.601,"That's a rather critical point, is it not?"
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2675.601,2677.063,"Yes, it is correct."
1996.96-110,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2677.063,2684.259,"And you're talking about all of these precedents, so this first precedent you site Cruzan and that was just an assumption contrary to your description?"
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2684.259,2689.712,"I went straight to Cruzan because it's most factually similar and I appreciate the correction that, of course, it was just an assumption by The Court."
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.747,2702.499,On the way to upholding the choice that the state made about how it wished to regulate this particular matter--
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2702.499,2703.04,--Yes.
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2703.04,2707.864,--and that's what makes this case worlds different from Cruzan.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2712.507,2724.424,"In Cruzan that is correct, absolutely, Your Honor, however, the focus was very much on preserving to the individual the choice."
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2724.424,2726.036,That was the focus of the legislature.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2756.547,2779.681,"The point that... of Cruzan that I wish to suggest has important bearing here is the point that in reviewing the state legislation that did impose that very high evidentiary standard, the point was that that was permissible to do so because it did then safeguard the personal element of the individual's choice that--"
1996.96-110,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2779.681,2798.505,"I don't think Cruzan was primarily about choice in the sense you're... it was... the liberty interest it recognized was the right to be refused medical treatment, which was based on the common-law idea that... imposition of a medical treatment was a battery of common law."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2798.505,2804.767,"--It also, Your Honor, was based on broader concepts than just being free of unwanted bodily invasion."
1996.96-110,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2809.652,2814.083,Are you now drawing language... I don't think there was language like that in the Cruzan opinion.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2814.083,2825.751,I understand the Cruzan assumption of a liberty interest to be something in addition to a recognition that the common law had protected against bodily invasion.
1996.96-110,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2825.751,2830.465,"But your remark just now, that was not a quotation from anything in Cruzan."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2830.465,2830.916,Correct.
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2864.897,2868.95,Declining medical treatment is something quite different from suicide.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2900.5,2913.46,"Because I think, Your Honor, that this decision is so profoundly personal, so intimate to the individual, so much based on their own values and beliefs and perhaps religious beliefs included among those that the for the state to--"
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2913.46,2922.937,"Every religious decision which tells you to do all sorts of unlawful acts by reason of your religious conviction, those are intensely personal as well."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2926.117,2932.611,"--This, however, Your Honor, has to do with one's own body, one's own medical care, and suffering in the face of death."
1996.96-110,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2942.519,2948.692,May I ask you before you finish to tell us as best you can how you would define the liberty interest on which you rely?
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2948.692,2967.513,"That this is a liberty, Your Honor, that involves bodily integrity, decisional autonomy, and the right to be free of unwanted pain and suffering, and that that constellation of interests gives rise to a vital liberty, at least of the level of Cruzan."
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2967.513,2969.856,But only for this narrow class.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2984.156,2984.827,Yes.
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2984.827,2989.479,So how do you get... leave out the rest of the world who would fit the same standards?
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,2989.479,3002.459,"Yes, Your Honor, and again that gets back to the fact that these individuals that are in the process of dying are confronted only with the choice of how to die, they are not confronted with the choice of should I live or should I die."
1996.96-110,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3002.459,3007.852,"But that describes something, but I don't understand why that is a disposit... I don't understand what that justifies."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,3007.852,3017.879,"It is as if, Your Honor, the right that we claim here only ripens or matures when that patient is at that stage."
1996.96-110,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3017.879,3017.926,By why?
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,3019.348,3032.289,"I don't think that the interest is as weighty at that point, I think that the state's interests are greater perhaps at a prior point where that individual may go on to lead a fulfilling life and contribute to society."
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3053.89,3054.731,At any time?
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,3054.731,3055.022,No.
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3055.022,3065.16,"Someone can withdraw treatment or refuse treatment at age 16 as well as at age 96, isn't that true?"
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,3065.16,3075.306,"Actually, Justice Ginsburg, in the State of Washington, both by statute and by case law, the right to direct the withdrawal of treatment is specifically limited to two situations."
1996.96-110,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3081.86,3083.871,Do you mean I can't refuse treatment in the State of Washington?
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,3086.533,3093.887,"--I think that on those kinds of situations you may implicate different rights to refuse the treatment, First Amendment rights perhaps."
1996.96-110,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3093.887,3095.477,"No, but what is the law in the State of Washington?"
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,3097.529,3102.313,I don't think so much that you are compelled to pursue medical treatment.
1996.96-110,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3103.523,3106.915,But you're telling us what the law of the State of Washington is.
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,3129.471,3138.437,"--I was pointing out that in the State of Washington the right to direct the withdrawal of treatment is limited, tightly, to those who are terminally ill."
1996.96-110,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3138.437,3142.839,"You mean as a result of death, you mean withdrawal that will result in death?"
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,3142.839,3143.279,Yes.
1996.96-110,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3149.894,3154.757,You mean someone who is permanently... aren't you talking about substituted judgment?
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,3159.9,3167.296,"--Well, we do that in the State of Washington, as many states do, through the advanced directive, so that... this is the law that I'm referring to is that advanced directive law."
1996.96-110,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3175.541,3190.14,"Well, I think you would have a pretty good case if you had some kind of kidney disease and said, I'm not going to take dialysis: Or somebody offers surgery to remedy something that's going to be a serious life threatening problem and you say, thanks but no thanks."
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,3196.515,3204.56,"--I think in that context, Your Honor, the doctrine of informed consent would arise and the question could the... would the patient consent to the treatment."
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3229.696,3231.678,That's not an intensely personal decision?
1996.96-110,2,34005,kathryn_l_tucker,,3241.575,3249.539,"I don't think that it becomes less intensely personal, but I do think, as I have indicated in earlier responses, that it's a different choice for that patient."
1996.96-110,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3257.774,3283.3,"I don't see... I don't see how you can separate out the two situations and say the state is entitled to impose its will despite the preferences of the individual at one stage and with respect to some pain and suffering, namely physical, but is not entitled to do it then, but is entitled to do it in other situations, when the person has emotional trauma or when the person is further away from death."
1996.96-110,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3292.416,3302.773,"You may consider that a question, if you wish, and answer."
1996.96-110,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3305.275,3309.078,"Thank you, Ms. Tucker."
1996.96-110,3,46501,william_l_williams,,3311.83,3313.63,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-110,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3334.834,3337.315,The legal line is bright and understandable.
1996.96-110,3,46501,william_l_williams,,3339.907,3344.361,"Your Honor, we have to go only by the data that we have."
1996.96-110,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3369.169,3384.846,"I'm not thinking so much of studies of data that's not in the public domain generally, but the one historical thing that I can't get totally out of mind is I'm not aware of any doctor ever being convicted of committing this particular offense; is that correct?"
1996.96-110,3,46501,william_l_williams,,3384.846,3386.178,--I'm not aware of any either.
1996.96-110,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3386.178,3388.75,And it's hard to believe it has never been committed.
1996.96-110,3,46501,william_l_williams,,3388.75,3392.252,"I don't disagree with that, Justice Stevens."
1996.96-110,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3407.611,3413.365,"Are you aware of anybody ever having been prosecuted for attempted suicide, which is unlawful in some states?"
1996.96-110,3,46501,william_l_williams,,3419.909,3431.577,"--Most of the... I believe all of the statutes making that a crime have been repealed because of the recognition or the heavy influence that mental disease, most likely depression, plays in the request for suicide."
1996.96-110,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3471.414,3482.08,"Does the literature tell us that there have been significant advances in palliative care to reduce pain for the terminally ill over the last five years, or the last ten years?"
1996.96-110,3,46501,william_l_williams,,3482.08,3483.662,"Absolutely, Justice Kennedy."
1996.96-110,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3571.29,3586.76,"Do you know of the... any of the international human rights documents or regional human rights documents, there is recognition of what has been called the right to die or, as described today, for the terminally ill?"
1996.96-110,3,46501,william_l_williams,,3586.76,3589.502,"I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
