1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,58.17,61.255,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,96.395,98.28,"The... now, who's ""she""?"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,99.147,99.747,--No.
1980.79-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,114.506,115.875,"Now, who made that determination?"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,115.875,122.629,"That determination was made, Mr. Justice Stewart, by the woman, the doctor, and the social worker."
1980.79-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,122.629,123.395,By H. L..
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,123.395,126.081,All of them felt that the parents should not be involved.
1980.79-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,126.081,139.241,"Where in the record, counsel, is the finding or testimony that the doctor felt the parents should not be consulted?"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,139.241,143.793,"That is in the complaint, and that was part of her testimony when she testified."
1980.79-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.793,145.394,Could you cite the pages?
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,145.394,152.731,I can only refer the Court to the transcript of--
1980.79-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,152.731,154.766,I read the transcript.
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,173.395,174.164,"--Yes, it was."
1980.79-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,183.852,195.077,"Now, where in the transcript or findings do you find anything that the physician thought it was contrary to her best medical interest that her parents not be notified?"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,195.077,196.827,That's what he told her as--
1980.79-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.827,200.929,Where in what we have before us?
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,200.929,203.147,--I believe that is in her testimony.
1980.79-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,212.953,213.67,Appendix?
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,213.67,217.155,"--of the appendix, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,220.859,228.946,Could you give us the verbatim?
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,228.946,234.866,--I am looking now at her testimony and I am going down page 25:
1980.79-5903,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,314.366,317.068,"Mr. Dolowitz, is that you testifying or the--"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,317.068,319.453,"Oh, I'm asking the questions that she is answering; right."
1980.79-5903,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,319.453,321.305,"--Well, all she says is ""yes""."
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,321.305,347.622,"That's correct, Your Honor, and if I may say so, I led her through this very carefully and the reason that I did that is, she had a highly unique fact situation, and as you read through the appendix you saw that this examination took place after the Court had already denied a preliminary injunction and had ruled that the peculiar facts of her circumstances made no difference."
1980.79-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,363.732,375.94,Do you think that any of what you have read from the testimony so far supports a finding that her doctor told her that it was in her... not in her best medical interests to get an abortion?
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,375.94,378.459,"--In terms of the record, it does not."
1980.79-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,381.56,382.462,"Well, in your--"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,382.462,388.014,I had spoken with the doctor myself and the doctor told her that and I talked to her.
1980.79-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,388.014,393.751,"--In your statement of the case, in your brief, Mr. Dolowitz, you say,"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,407.611,409.28,"I do, sir, and that is the finding."
1980.79-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,409.28,412.932,"And that's a fair paraphrase of what you read us, isn't it?"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,412.932,414.865,"Yes, it is, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.79-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,418.885,424.122,But it is not a finding that the doctor told her it was against her best interest?
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,424.122,474.472,"It is not a... it is a finding, I believe, and I at this point would have to refer the trial court... or this Court, Your Honor, to the specific findings, conclusions of law and in the findings that I'm referring to I am looking at page 40, Finding 7, of the Findings of Fact, page 40 of the appendix, where the trial court made the determination that she should be aborted and that he felt... that's the doctor... that it was not in her best medical interest to do... or was in her best medical interest to do so, but could not and would not perform an abortion on her without informing her parents prior to aborting her because of the statute."
1980.79-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,474.472,494.05,"Mr. Dolowitz, you have emphasized in your oral argument... you have spent quite a bit of time on it, and our questions, and you did in the examination, direct examination of your witness, the importance, you have emphasized the importance of getting counsel and advice and assistance, lawyers, social workers, doctors."
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,502.139,502.789,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,502.789,505.841,What if she has the advice of no one?
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,522.734,523.569,"Factually it would, Your Honor."
1980.79-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,523.569,524.802,"And factually, would it be--"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,524.802,525.452,It would.
1980.79-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,533.325,534.558,"--You don't need to speculate on that, do you?"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,534.558,535.242,--What?
1980.79-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,535.242,538.094,"You don't need to speculate on the Constitutional question, do you?"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,538.094,538.796,No.
1980.79-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,539.512,540.446,"It would make no difference, would it?"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,540.446,540.796,--No.
1980.79-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,547.0,548.666,"Now, she's 15 years old, isn't she?"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,548.666,549.133,That's correct.
1980.79-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,549.133,550.368,Suppose she were 12?
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,552.268,572.715,"I would... the problem, Your Honor, is I've... then I move to speculation and I move to it in a very difficult area, and that is the level of maturity is such that as a 12-year-old she could be very mature, totally immature; though we're leaving something out, and that is that she is talking to a doctor and says, I want an abortion."
1980.79-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,598.233,600.801,What about ten years of age?
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,600.801,602.335,--I would give you the same answer.
1980.79-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,625.75,642.745,"In Utah, under Utah law, if she had walked in, a girl of 10, 11, 12, 15, whatever, and said, I want my tonsils taken out but my parents won't send me to a doctor and won't agree to it, would the doctor be legally permitted to perform the tonsillectomy?"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,642.745,648.599,"There is no law that prohibits it, but I believe that most physicians would not do it."
1980.79-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,649.582,652.833,"Because of the possibility of a malpractice suit, among other things, I suppose."
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,652.833,667.11,"--There is a difference, though, and that is the decision of this Court in Danforth and Bellotti II, and a statute of the State of Utah which states that a minor of any age can consent to any treatment regarding pregnancy."
1980.79-5903,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,667.11,669.176,"Mr. Dolowitz, would you straighten me out?"
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,674.947,676.816,"Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1980.79-5903,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,676.816,680.518,Down just below the middle there is a question:
1980.79-5903,0,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,691.408,696.277,"It should have been, because if it wasn't, then I misspoke it at the time."
1980.79-5903,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,713.239,722.261,"Well, all I want to know is, whether you and opposing counsel agree that this is an error in the printing of the transcript, that the ""not"" is in there?"
1980.79-5903,1,38380,paul_m_tinker,,722.261,723.28,Yes.
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,725.497,741.808,"Now, Your Honor, what we are dealing with... as you can see; and I realize from your questions, Mr. Chief Justice, that you're very concerned about the age of the woman involved."
1980.79-5903,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,757.034,764.238,"Then are you saying that it might, the statute might be constitutional if it fixed the limit at age 12 or 14?"
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,764.238,765.024,"--No, Your Honor, I would not."
1980.79-5903,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,796.995,808.968,"But could it not also, could that phrase not also be intended to take into account a child who had been abandoned by her parents, didn't know where her parents were, her parents impossible to reach, that sort of thing?"
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,808.968,809.785,"Yes, and that--"
1980.79-5903,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,809.785,812.27,Isn't that what the statute is aimed at?
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,812.27,825.844,"--Your Honor, the answer I'm going to say is that that might have been the intention and they added... the Utah Supreme Court said, if possible, within a rational time."
1980.79-5903,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,976.09,979.675,Those four plaintiffs were all emancipated were they not?
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,981.427,985.713,Three of the four were; one was still living at home.
1980.79-5903,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.644,1041.131,"Mr. Dolowitz, before you leave those other cases, I don't understand their relevance to the issue presented by this case."
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1041.131,1056.992,"The relevance, Mr. Justice Stevens, tends to come from the observations of Mr. Justice Powell in the second Bellotti decision, and that is that as applied to two... I will call them categories of minors--"
1980.79-5903,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1056.992,1061.294,"Well, let's say that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to a lot of people who are not before the Court."
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1064.696,1075.637,"--In this case we're dealing with a subgroup of a minor where the determination had been made by the social worker and the physician that it was not in her best interest, and the trial court--"
1980.79-5903,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1075.637,1084.192,"I thought you just agreed with Mr. Justice Rehnquist that there was no such determination, the child so determined after consultation with the doctor and the social worker?"
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1084.192,1085.942,"--If I said that, then that was not what I meant."
1980.79-5903,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1091.579,1102.204,You don't suggest anything that you read from the transcript said the doctor said it was not in her best interest to notify the parents?
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1102.204,1111.227,"Nothing that I read said that, and that means that when I asked the questions in the trial, I stopped one question too soon, because--"
1980.79-5903,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1111.227,1115.179,"We review questions or cases on transcripts, not on unasked questions."
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1115.179,1143.398,"--Well, I realize that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and one of the problems that was going on in this case was that from the prior determination of the trial judge that the only question that he considered important is, was it physically possible to locate the parents, meant that I was conducting that hearing with her to simply show that the facts alleged in the complaint were in fact correct."
1980.79-5903,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1179.121,1182.073,Nothing in the record about that here.
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1186.025,1189.227,I have that she did not want to give notice to her parents.
1980.79-5903,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1189.227,1194.281,"Well... no, no, the possibility, the capability, the feasibility of writing a letter to the parents."
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1194.281,1195.197,I believe... okay; no.
1980.79-5903,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1241.692,1265.575,"Had the doctor written a letter simply stating the simple, direct fact that, your daughter has come to me to have an abortion performed and I'm prepared to do it, and under the statute I'm giving you notice that I will proceed with this procedure seven days from today, would he have complied with the statute?"
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1265.575,1269.678,"Yes, But she--"
1980.79-5903,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1269.678,1281.819,"I'm not sure you've answered my earlier question about whether it affects your case one way or the other... it would affect it one way or the other, if there had been no consultation with anyone."
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1299.781,1301.983,--I believe it is not.
1980.79-5903,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1422.926,1429.347,"Well, Mr. Dolowitz, I think you referred us to this Finding 7, didn't you, at page 40?"
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1429.347,1430.099,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-5903,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1431.682,1460.632,"Am I to read that finding as you have just stated the proposition, that after consultation... or rather, when consulting with her physician, he advised her that she should be aborted, that he was unwilling to perform an abortion without complying with the provisions of the statute even though he believed it was best to do so, or to perform the abortion without complying with the statute?"
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1462.051,1464.153,"Yes, he was not willing to do it."
1980.79-5903,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1464.153,1465.619,Is that the way you want us to read that?
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1465.619,1486.316,"I want you to read that as saying that he felt in his best medical judgment, one, an abortion should be performed; secondly, that her parents should not be notified; third, that he was not willing to act on his best medical judgment, which was to abort her, without notifying her parents because he was at criminal risk if he did so--"
1980.79-5903,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1486.316,1489.434,"That's what we read into it, even though he believed it was best to do so."
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1489.434,1490.168,--Do so.
1980.79-5903,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1490.168,1497.374,"It's a very ambiguous finding, isn't it, if you read it with all the nuances that Mr. Justice Brennan puts in it?"
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1497.374,1505.73,"What I have just expressed to you is what was intended to go that and if we were not, between the trial judge and counsel we were not able to articulate it--"
1980.79-5903,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.73,1507.946,Did you submit the findings?
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1509.465,1511.384,"--I drafted the findings, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-5903,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1511.384,1514.501,Were they entered exactly as you drew them?
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1514.501,1516.385,"They were, after dispute."
1980.79-5903,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.322,1521.755,And then the Court adopted yours?
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1521.755,1522.739,--That's correct.
1980.79-5903,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1522.739,1523.441,Verbatim?
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1523.441,1524.591,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-5903,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1524.591,1529.778,"Mr. Dolowitz, does the record in fact show whether she was aborted?"
1980.79-5903,2,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,1529.778,1532.647,The record does not show that.
1980.79-5903,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1572.322,1574.607,"Very well, Mr. Dolowitz."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1581.078,1583.13,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-5903,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1656.842,1659.794,Does the statute refer to living at home?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1659.794,1660.63,No.
1980.79-5903,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1662.396,1666.967,Then why are you putting those words in your description of the statute?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1666.967,1674.738,"--Merely for emphasis, in that that is who the statute is primarily intended to control."
1980.79-5903,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1677.873,1679.108,"Yes, but how do we know that?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1682.31,1699.338,"Well, and I think that is precisely the separate question which is raised by this other case that Mr. Dolowitz has referred to, and which Mr. Justice Stevens has questioned the relevance here."
1980.79-5903,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1711.146,1715.781,The statute does not refer to an emancipated minor or an unemancipated one.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1715.781,1716.781,--That's true.
1980.79-5903,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1716.781,1719.55,I'd like to look at the case in the face of your statute.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1719.55,1720.002,Right.
1980.79-5903,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.748,1751.021,"Well, do you think that a minor still living at home can challenge the statute that Mr. Justice Blackmun has just described, which does not limit it that way?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1753.556,1756.091,Does the minor not living at home have standing?
1980.79-5903,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1756.091,1765.547,Does the minor living at home have standing to challenge the statute on the ground that it's overbroad as to minors who are not living at home?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1765.547,1771.018,"No, I don't think that that minor has that standing."
1980.79-5903,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1795.75,1801.17,"She's challenging the statute on its face, not as it applies to her, isn't she?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1801.17,1804.539,"Well, yes."
1980.79-5903,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1805.056,1814.713,"Now, somebody else, an emancipated... let's assume that the Supreme Court of your State has already decided that the statute on its face is constitutional."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1828.721,1830.523,"--That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.79-5903,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1830.523,1838.795,"She's not... in this case, the statute is not being challenged as applied, but it's simply being challenged on its face, isn't it?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1838.795,1839.629,Yes.
1980.79-5903,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1853.839,1855.421,What is a minor in Utah?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1855.421,1857.723,"Under 18, unless married."
1980.79-5903,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1865.929,1875.452,"Therefore this statute could be, its constitutional validity could be attacked as it applies to people over 17, for example."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1875.452,1877.587,Yes.
1980.79-5903,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1877.587,1881.555,But here it's being attacked on its face--
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1881.555,1885.274,--by a 15-year-old who it clearly--
1980.79-5903,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1885.274,1886.443,--who is living at home.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1886.443,1886.893,--does apply to; yes.
1980.79-5903,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1886.893,1892.347,Do you see any inherent conflict between the Federal court case and this one?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1892.347,1895.013,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not."
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1926.701,1943.195,"But, Mr. Tinker, the class described in the complaint, as I understand the trial judge, he did in effect say the class was proper, includes all minor women who are suffering unwanted pregnancies and desire to terminate them, which would include the emancipated minors as well as the unemancipated minors."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,1958.472,1977.766,"But I'm not sure, Mr. Justice Stevens, that that alone, the fact that the class was not defined to exclude all these others, permits the named plaintiff to represent a class that she's not part of."
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1977.766,1981.354,Except that as a matter of state law the state judge said she's an adequate representative.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2051.415,2054.703,"Well, at least there was no discussion--"
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2054.703,2055.669,Had he certified the class?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2067.66,2076.748,"--Well, I think the class was essentially defined at that preliminary stage and it was not changed in the subsequent proceedings."
1980.79-5903,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2108.035,2110.654,"A little due process for the parents, is that what you're saying?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2110.654,2113.189,"That's exactly I'm saying, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-5903,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2158.65,2160.252,And what does that accomplish?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2166.004,2167.306,--Among other things.
1980.79-5903,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2177.881,2185.968,"And yet the statute doesn't go that far with respect to parents if the child is married, even though her husband is 16."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2185.968,2193.474,"No, it does not take into account that particular situation."
1980.79-5903,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2265.603,2284.931,"Is it possible the Legislature had in mind that... or is it possible that it's inherent in the case, that the parents might be able to give something of the medical history and background of the child which would be relevant to the doctor and his decision?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2284.931,2291.72,"Well, the Utah Supreme Court in its unanimous decision made that specific finding but that would be one of the purposes."
1980.79-5903,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2298.008,2303.962,I'm not quite clear what it is you say would satisfy the requirement of notification.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2317.453,2321.071,"I'm afraid it does, Mr. Justice Brennan, on the face of the statute."
1980.79-5903,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2321.738,2325.523,Then how much input does this contemplate that the parents will have?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2325.523,2333.36,"--Well, it contemplates, I think, only as much as the doctor in his professional judgment will permit."
1980.79-5903,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2347.019,2349.438,But I just want to be clear.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2353.573,2355.523,Clearly not; clearly not.
1980.79-5903,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2355.523,2371.117,"What if the mother in that hypothetical case then said, are you aware, doctor, that our daughter has been under psychiatric care for the last seven years, and the doctor, says, no, I'm not aware of that."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2378.421,2386.594,"I think he has... excuse me, I think he has a professional obligation to then take that knowledge into account."
1980.79-5903,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2398.852,2411.377,"--Well, that might mean, among other things, that the minor patient was not capable of giving consent to anything, a tonsillectomy, an appendectomy, or an abortion."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2412.278,2413.511,It could be.
1980.79-5903,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2475.702,2476.735,Mr. Tinker?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2476.735,2477.887,"Yes, Mr. Justice Powell?"
1980.79-5903,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2477.887,2484.891,In the plurality opinion in Bellotti II we said this with respect to notice:
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2506.823,2527.903,"I construe that language as relating to the situation of the Massachusetts statute which was a consent statute, not a mere notice statute like ours, and which already created the possibility of alternatives."
1980.79-5903,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2544.946,2548.75,"There was an alternative in Massachusetts, the court."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2551.435,2551.935,Right.
1980.79-5903,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2563.493,2586.525,"I have that... I haven't read it recently, but I thought the purpose of the constitutional requirement that the plaintiff, pregnant, unmarried female, be allowed to go to a court was to convince that court that she was a mature minor."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2591.86,2596.2,Not in the pleadings of this case or in the record.
1980.79-5903,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2596.2,2597.791,"Not that she's an immature minor, is there?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2597.791,2599.183,I'm sorry?
1980.79-5903,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2599.183,2601.028,Are we to assume she's an immature minor?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2601.028,2602.478,I believe so.
1980.79-5903,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2608.087,2614.317,It's not clear at all that she's a mature minor or was prohibited or prevented from showing a court that she was.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2614.317,2621.723,"No, in Utah we don't have a specific procedure for showing a court any--"
1980.79-5903,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2621.723,2627.952,"There wasn't in the Massachusetts legislation either, and that's what we found constitutionally deficient, as I remember."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2627.952,2647.63,"--My recollection was that the Massachusetts statute provided that if a parent refused to give consent or was unavailable, that you could then repair to the Court of General Jurisdiction and seek an order granting the consent in place of parent--"
1980.79-5903,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2647.63,2651.468,Despite the failure to give consent.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2685.755,2688.407,"--I don't believe there is such a claim, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.407,2693.975,"Mr. Tinker, may I ask on this subject, I think the record is a little unclear."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2725.18,2730.15,"That's sort of the horns of a dilemma, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.79-5903,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2730.433,2738.67,"Under the district courts, under the holding in the Federal court, this statute is unconstitutional as applied to emancipated minors, is it not?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2738.67,2742.907,"--If it applies, he essentially found in the alternative."
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.05,2761.285,That's a little ambiguous to me.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2763.537,2764.221,Yes.
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2764.221,2766.406,And now what is it you don't disagree with?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2766.406,2774.862,"Well, that it either doesn't apply or that if it should be found to apply it's unconstitutional with respect to those."
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.862,2775.362,Do you have an opinion as to the matter of state law?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2784.467,2791.738,"Yes, I have an opinion, and my opinion is that it should be construed so as not to apply to an emancipated minor."
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.738,2798.227,"And is there any judicial authority in the State that has so construed the statute, other than Federal judges?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2799.127,2799.627,No.
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.704,2852.262,"Well, you're in effect saying the statute doesn't mean what it would appear to mean to an uninitiated reader insofar as it excludes a class of minors which are not identified on the face of the statute."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2857.999,2866.354,"Well, I don't think it applies to married women at all because in Utah the statutory provision is that all minors achieve their majority by marriage."
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2866.354,2869.906,"No, but I'm talking about the requirement of notice to the husband of a married woman."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2869.906,2870.44,Oh.
1980.79-5903,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2879.429,2884.683,"Oh, if she is not a minor, there is no requirement of notification."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2884.683,2885.216,Right.
1980.79-5903,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2895.888,2896.555,"If she is married, whatever her age, or whatever his age."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2896.555,2897.024,Yes.
1980.79-5903,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2899.107,2907.644,"If she's not a minor, there's no requirement of notification to her parents?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2907.644,2908.763,"Oh, that's definitely correct."
1980.79-5903,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2908.763,2911.881,"No question that she's not mature, this one."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2913.515,2916.667,There's no question that she's not mature?
1980.79-5903,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2916.667,2917.017,Yes.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2917.017,2917.952,There's no question.
1980.79-5903,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2917.952,2923.254,"Because if she were mature, she wouldn't be included under the statute, would she?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2923.254,2923.523,"Well, no."
1980.79-5903,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2934.811,2938.282,That's why I'm confused about this marriage and maturity.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2943.734,2946.769,--I make a distinction.
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2960.96,2967.08,"By emancipated, you are referring to a young person who is married and therefore not a minor within the meaning of the statute?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2976.788,2977.805,Among other things.
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2978.038,2980.673,"Now, is that person covered by the statute?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,2990.707,2994.988,Mr. Justice Stewart is correct in understanding me to this point on that issue.
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2994.988,2995.986,I apologize.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3000.327,3003.843,"No, not to the emancipated minors."
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3003.843,3005.497,"But it's just a matter of his opinion, in any event."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3012.158,3013.927,To the emancipated minor.
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.927,3015.794,Unmarried; an emancipated minor.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3015.794,3017.479,"Living away from home, all the other things."
1980.79-5903,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3070.264,3072.764,"Also, maturity and immaturity?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3072.764,3078.468,"Well, it's an arbitrary decision, in a sense, as to what constitutes--"
1980.79-5903,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3078.468,3089.525,Aren't you saying that if there's any maturity element in this case at all it's in the use of the word 18 and over 18?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3089.525,3092.11,"--Yes, I am saying that, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.79-5903,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3092.11,3097.331,"In other words, you don't concede that someone might be 15 and mature?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3097.331,3103.049,"Oh, I concede that somebody might be but there's nothing in this record to suggest that anyone is."
1980.79-5903,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3103.049,3110.305,"Well, there's nothing to suggest that this 15-year-old is not either, is there, in this record?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3127.0,3131.552,"At least without notice, but with no requirement that the parent can control the decision."
1980.79-5903,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3131.552,3141.141,"Well, now, let me ask you again, is that to say, if there were evidence in this case that this 15-year-old was mature, then the statute would not apply?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3141.141,3143.376,"No, I would not make that argument, sir."
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3147.93,3151.766,"But you do say, if she were away from home it would not apply?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3151.766,3162.638,"Well, if she were away from home and if all the other factors... and this is what we've gone through before Judge Jenkins in the Federal District Court, is trying to find out whether a particular girl is emancipated or not."
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3174.379,3178.866,The thing that puzzles me is how all those criteria can be found in this rather short statute.
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3182.368,3184.82,"--Well, no, I'm saying--"
1980.79-5903,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3184.82,3189.805,"You said if she's emancipated, the statute doesn't apply and those are all the things you look at and decide whether she's emancipated."
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3189.805,3198.328,"--Yes, I'm saying... But an emancipated person is not under terms of state law a minor for purposes of the statute."
1980.79-5903,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3198.328,3206.166,Did the State make any motion for the Federal District Court to abstain on the question of state law construction?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3206.166,3219.124,I have argued the abstention question in the L. R. case and Judge Jenkins said that he would not abstain in this particular case because of the exigencies of time.
1980.79-5903,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3252.178,3254.697,Does Utah have one of those certification statutes?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3254.697,3267.121,"I just found out recently that the Utah Supreme Court adopted by a minute entry, it's not in their Rules, but they've accepted one certification in the past and they tell me they're willing to accept them."
1980.79-5903,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3267.121,3269.906,"Mr. Tinker, how old is this Utah statute?"
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3269.906,3272.324,The statute was passed in 1974.
1980.79-5903,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3399.724,3405.228,Was that always true in the State of Utah prior to 1973?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3405.228,3417.119,"No, I believe Utah had requirements prior to 1973 that were controlled and invalidated by this Court's 1973 decisions."
1980.79-5903,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3417.119,3421.907,So that what you've just said didn't apply to Utah prior to Roe against Wade?
1980.79-5903,3,38380,paul_m_tinker,,3421.907,3423.623,No.
1980.79-5903,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3423.623,3428.061,"Mr. Dolowitz, do you have anything further?"
1980.79-5903,4,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,3428.061,3429.761,"I do, Your Honor."
1980.79-5903,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3502.656,3508.277,"Well, I understand in Utah, once a woman is married, whatever her age she is no longer a minor?"
1980.79-5903,4,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,3508.277,3510.329,That's a question I'm discussing.
1980.79-5903,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3529.723,3530.725,"Well, we don't have that case."
1980.79-5903,4,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,3530.725,3531.359,--We don't.
1980.79-5903,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3548.687,3551.139,"We don't need to worry about that problem now, do we?"
1980.79-5903,4,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,3551.139,3557.459,"I think, Mr. Justice Burger, you do, and the reason I say that is because this statute says, all parents."
1980.79-5903,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3560.445,3567.899,"Well, if marriage emancipates a minor woman, divorce does not probably vitiate--"
1980.79-5903,4,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,3567.899,3570.117,--Utah law doesn't... Utah law isn't clear on that point.
1980.79-5903,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3574.003,3576.655,--I think you'd lose a lot of weight when you talk about divorces.
1980.79-5903,4,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,3578.84,3579.207,--Okay.
1980.79-5903,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3581.791,3583.641,What are you... you'll lose that point.
1980.79-5903,4,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,3598.751,3606.374,"I think in this case that it must be done in overbreadth, because that's what was done."
1980.79-5903,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3664.344,3669.463,"But you were free also to go to the Circuit justice and ask for the same relief, were you not?"
1980.79-5903,4,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,3669.463,3672.831,"At that point, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that's true."
1980.79-5903,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3709.688,3723.181,"Mr. Dolowitz, do you agree with Justice Brennan that the answer to Mr. Justice Brennan's question that if 10 minutes before performing the abortion the doctor called up the parents and said, I'm about to abort your daughter, I want to give you notice in compliance with the statute."
1980.79-5903,4,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,3734.304,3740.041,"I do agree with Mr. Tinker that that would be compliance with the statute, which is what shows that despite its--"
1980.79-5903,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3740.041,3748.396,"--And if it's that easy to comply with it, how can you seriously argue that it substantially burdens the, a woman's private right to choose a decision?"
1980.79-5903,4,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,3748.396,3765.791,"--Because if that, if the reason that he did that is that he knew, for example, that the parents were unbalanced and she risked physical injury when they found out, that injury risk is still waiting for her when she gets home, if she gets home, or when she next meets her parents, if she's afraid to go home."
1980.79-5903,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3768.093,3776.416,So you'd say it would be equally unconstitutional if there was a requirement that two hours after an abortion is performed they notify the parents because they might be unhappy about it?
1980.79-5903,4,20792,david_s_dolowitz,,3776.416,3776.866,Yes.
1980.79-5903,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3779.133,3780.133,"Thank you, gentlemen."
