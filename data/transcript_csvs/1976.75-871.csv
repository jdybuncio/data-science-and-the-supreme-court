1976.75-871,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,64.385,"We will hear arguments next in 75-871, Manson against Brathwaite."
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,67.36,71.117,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1976.75-871,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,239.217,241.527,It was the time?
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,241.527,253.877,The transaction Your Honor took place at approximately or began at approximately 7:45 PM.
1976.75-871,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,253.877,255.081,On what date?
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,255.081,257.028,"May 5, 1970."
1976.75-871,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,400.42,402.154,Except a picture.
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,402.154,405.907,"Yes, Your Honor, except the picture."
1976.75-871,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,734.563,735.687,Which case; which case?
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,735.687,738.918,"Foster against California, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,738.918,740.889,Opinion written by Justice Fortas?
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,740.889,749.098,"Yeah, I don’t think it was Justice Fortas; I think Justice Fortas may have written the opinion in Coleman against Alabama."
1976.75-871,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,749.098,750.264,"No, Justice Brennan wrote that."
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,750.264,751.527,"Alright, I stand --"
1976.75-871,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,751.527,754.701,Or in any matter we are actually looking (Inaudible) recall a case that --
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,754.701,759.583,"Coleman and Alabama, I know, was decided after Foster in 1970."
1976.75-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,871.601,873.476,Is Glover a full-time Police Officer?
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,873.476,881.688,"Yes, he was, Your Honor, with the State Police, acting at that time with an undercover narcotics unit."
1976.75-871,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,881.688,891.256,"Mr. Gaffney, is the testimony about what was said during the confrontation consistent with it being two or three minutes in duration, wasn’t it quite a brief conversation?"
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,891.256,895.402,"The conversation, Your Honor, was brief; there is no question about that."
1976.75-871,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.208,908.592,"But now you say that -- wouldn’t have been two or three minutes in that conversation, would there?"
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,908.592,927.437,"There would not done been two or three minutes of conversation but the testimony, as I read it, was that the door -- and this would relate particularly to the time after which it was first open that during that period up to two to three minutes was consumed."
1976.75-871,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,937.256,939.44,I thought -- maybe I -- maybe my memory fails me.
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,946.561,952.456,"Well, the conversation, when the door opened the second time, was quite brief."
1976.75-871,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,960.127,962.528,Let me put my question a little more precisely.
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,972.497,984.416,"Well, I think more like the latter, Your Honor, because for the reason, as I have tried to indicate that the seller wanted to be sure that he could deal with the parties in front of him, that he wasn’t being set up."
1976.75-871,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1049.576,1054.301,Why did he wait two days to pick up this horrible criminal?
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1054.301,1057.006,"Well, it wasn’t that he waited two days to pick him up."
1976.75-871,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1064.438,1066.746,But what was the delay?
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1066.746,1072.012,"Well, I don’t know that, Mr. Justice Marshall, that there was any delay."
1976.75-871,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1072.434,1076.602,"Well, he went there for the purpose of finding somebody to arrest, didn’t he?"
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1076.602,1080.277,"Not to arrest, to purchase narcotics from, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1080.559,1083.95,Then why did he purchase narcotics?
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1083.95,1088.428,"Well, the arrest would follow after the analysis to determine what, in fact --"
1976.75-871,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1088.428,1092.569,"And how long or more than 10 minutes, does that take?"
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1092.569,1098.292,"Well, the analysis is made by the State Laboratory in Hartford, unfortunately."
1976.75-871,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1098.292,1100.382,It’s the same town; same town?
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1100.382,1101.003,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1101.003,1104.025,And you and I know Hartford is not the largest city in the world.
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1104.025,1105.73,"No, I understand that.[Laughter Attempt]"
1976.75-871,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1105.73,1110.344,So I am trying to find why he had two days before he picked this horrible criminal up?
1976.75-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.592,1122.586,"I suppose, if there had been a contemporary objection at trial, the State might have had an opportunity or might have been motivated to flush the thing out a little more."
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1122.586,1125.264,"Yes, I think that’s accurate to say, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1125.264,1128.835,I suppose this was not the only narcotics case in Hartford in that period of time?
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1128.835,1131.422,"Oh no, by no means, Your Honor, by no means."
1976.75-871,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1131.422,1135.07,What independent answer do you have to my question without help?
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1135.07,1164.943,"Well, [Laughter] the delay, insofar as the confrontation occurred and Glover’s not getting back to his office until May 7, that is May 5 to May 7; as far as the arrest is concerned that would not, under the procedures used in Hartford, that would not have occurred until after it was confirmed by analysis, toxicological analysis, that the substance purchased was, in fact, narcotic."
1976.75-871,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1331.466,1339.436,And he had been identified by a person trained in identifying people and giving accurate descriptions.
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1339.436,1340.929,"That certainly does help, Your Honor, yes."
1976.75-871,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1340.929,1342.229,You don’t want to loose that point.
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1342.229,1343.129,"No, I don’t, no."
1976.75-871,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1493.886,1497.005,I am not sure I understand the argument you are now making Mr. Gaffney.
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1500.493,1534.455,"I don’t know that it’s a cogent argument, Your Honor, for deciding whether there should be a rule or not, I offer it more in the practical sense, but if in a case, such as this one where you have a one witness identification, and the state presents that witness and he makes an in-court identification without any reference to the pretrial procedure, the defense, in the great majority of cases, is going to cross-examine that witness and develop that there was a pretrial procedure to point out how defective it was, how suggestive it was."
1976.75-871,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1542.073,1542.917,-- will wonder why it wasn’t presented by the prosecutor --
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1542.917,1547.448,-- will wonder why didn’t the state -- why are we hearing it now from the defendant.
1976.75-871,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1547.448,1548.014,-- for the first time.
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1548.014,1551.42,And I submit that that doesn’t make the state look very good.
1976.75-871,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1551.42,1552.803,I see your point.
1976.75-871,0,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,1552.803,1577.809,"Now if there is no such rule and the evidence, at least in some cases, is offered by the prosecution, I submit that certainly the trial judge, in an appropriate instruction, can advise the jury of the weaknesses and the dangers and the deficiencies of such suggestive pretrial procedures by the police."
1976.75-871,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1742.3,1745.337,Very Well.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1747.63,1750.664,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1976.75-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.801,1782.274,You are not suggesting that that alone would exclude an in-court identification.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1782.274,1783.516,"No, we are not, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.745,1798.266,"You are saying that testimony about the out-of-court identification should have been excluded because, simply because it was impermissibly suggested?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1798.266,1803.769,"Well, we do say that -- we are also saying, and I think Judge Friendly held the in-court identification also should have been excluded."
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1806.875,1811.456,"But you see he treated -- he regarded it as a tainted, that the second was tainted by the first."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1811.456,1812.687,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.72,1825.189,"Yes, but you don’t say that the in-court identification is automatically excluded."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1825.189,1827.354,"No, we don’t."
1976.75-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.354,1828.751,-- along with the out-of-court identification.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1828.751,1831.077,"No, we don’t say that Mr. Justice."
1976.75-871,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.196,1883.713,"Mr Golub wouldn’t a good deal of the speculation that you are now indulging in, be permitted if there had been a contemporaneous objection and this could have been argued out in the Trial Court at the Glover cross-examined as to how he really knew this was the same man?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1883.713,1887.931,"Your Honor, it is true that there was no contemporaneous objection at the time of trial."
1976.75-871,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1898.281,1899.35,And you did too.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1899.35,1903.765,"We did too, as the memorandum of opinion from Judge Blumenfeld indicates."
1976.75-871,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1925.404,1940.766,"Wasn’t Judge Blumenfeld talking about, whether there was raised it up all on habeas in the absence of a contemporaneous objection rather than question of the degree of speculation you could go into about people’s motives and that sort of thing, if you haven’t raised it at trial?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1940.766,1950.644,"Yes, he was asking for in-court briefs, I think, one whether or not fair to object precluded habeas corpus relief."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1997.212,2008.295,"Do you mean that in case in which police authorities show a picture to a complaint witness, automatically no trial?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2008.295,2009.777,"No, that’s not what we were saying, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2009.777,2010.771,Then what are you saying?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2010.771,2029.377,We are saying that there are two issues in this case and two standards that could be applied in this case: One would be the totality test which Judge Friendly applied in the alternative; the other would be the strict rule of exclusion of the evidence that Judge Friendly also felt was applicable.
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2059.524,2061.527,But you don’t want the automatic one.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2061.527,2066.422,"Well, we do want it, Your Honor, but we don’t think it’s necessary for the Court to reach it to affirm the opinion below."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2066.422,2069.568,What is the total you have here?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2069.568,2070.179,"I am sorry, I couldn’t hear you."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2070.179,2076.587,What is the total evidence that you have here that takes you out of that automatic room?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2076.587,2089.69,"Well, we feel on the totality test, Mr. Justice Marshall, we feel that in view of the brief nature of the encounter, and we agree with the question that was posed by Mr. Justice Stevens about the length of time that was involved."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2092.589,2094.089,Then how much time would it take?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2094.089,2096.083,"Well, we read it as being no more than a minute."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2100.585,2106.564,"I said, how much time will it take for me to look at you before I can identify you?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2106.564,2110.728,"Well, I don’t think -- I think, Your Honor, it would depend on each individual person."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2111.393,2117.175,"Well, how much if I were a well-trained police official; how long would it take?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2117.175,2119.204,"I don’t know, Your Honor, and I don’t think Judges can tell you that."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2119.204,2121.127,"Well, would two-three minutes be enough?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2121.127,2122.838,"It might be under, for some people but --"
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2122.838,2124.917,"Well, it was two or three in this one?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2124.917,2128.856,"The both courts below found that it was no more than one or two, three minutes."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2128.856,2130.441,"Oh, one minute short."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2130.441,2159.263,"I might point out that with respect to the argument about the trained police officer, we have an individual who went to the wrong apartment, we have an individual who was observing the seller without the benefit of electric lights at the time of sunset, we have an individual whose identification was disputed by the other witness present, we have an individual who was subjected to a very suggestive photographic confrontation, but moreover, was subject to the suggestiveness of his superior officer saying, “I know who it is."
1976.75-871,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2183.337,2192.428,"Mr. Golub, is the fact that the defendant was arrested in the apartment relevant to the question of whether the identification was reliable?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2192.428,2195.164,"Well, none as I read the facts, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.421,2235.954,Let me make my question a little more precise.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2235.954,2237.023,I am sorry.
1976.75-871,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2237.023,2250.071,"Is evidence, which one might assume to be relevant to the issue of guilt, like we can assume Brathwaite, he was arrested in the apartment, he went there many times is relevant on guilt, can we consider that in determining whether the identification is reliable or are they two entirely separate things?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2250.071,2251.801,"Well, I think they are two separate questions."
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2280.578,2283.715,Isn’t that what the Court of Appeals in Second Circuit has done?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2283.715,2288.468,"Well, it is; they did do that, Your Honor, but I think that there is a different standard for review in this Court."
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2295.424,2303.14,"What does the Court mean when it says, as Justice Harlan said in this context that we must review these on a case-by-case basis?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2308.64,2320.005,"No, Your Honor, I don’t think it is, but I think that this Court certainly does not want to be faced with reviewing every identification case that comes from the Court of Appeals on the factual basis."
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2320.005,2331.392,"You are quite right but perhaps, it has -- the court has a different attitude when a Court of Appeals, the first reviewing court undertakes to review credibility without overseeing the witnesses."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2331.392,2332.581,You mean the Court of Appeals or the --
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2332.581,2336.892,"The Court of Appeals undertook to review the credibility, I am sure, did they not?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2336.892,2338.544,"Well, I don’t think they did undertook --"
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2338.544,2341.845,What did Judge Friendly have to say about the credibility?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2341.845,2352.148,"I think, what he indicated in the opinion, Your Honor, was that Glover’s incentive, either to make an identification, either consciously or sub-consciously, could not be ruled out."
1976.75-871,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2373.604,2377.929,"Just to go, we don’t have in current findings here too."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2377.929,2383.416,"Well, I think the findings by the District Court and the Court of Appeals --"
1976.75-871,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2383.416,2385.784,Do you think it’s case for the two court rule?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2385.784,2390.837,"I think, there is no -- there no factual findings were reversed by the Court of Appeals."
1976.75-871,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2397.806,2399.157,"Well, over a dissent, that was a case for the two court rule."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2399.157,2401.045,Yes.
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2427.275,2430.2,"We follow which court, District Court or the Court of Appeals?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2430.2,2433.436,I think both courts applied the totality test.
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2436.811,2440.324,"Well, which courts should we follow under facts?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2440.324,2442.405,"I think the facts are the same in both courts, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2442.405,2443.912,"Well, which court should we follow?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2443.912,2445.595,"I would say, follow the Court of Appeals."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2445.595,2448.535,Are you sure? [laughter]
1976.75-871,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2448.535,2453.545,"Well, don’t you think the Court of Appeals is differ to the District Court on the credibility of the witness or not?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2453.545,2465.341,"No, I think the only difference is that the District Court said -- that the Court of Appeals said that there might be an incentive to -- there might be a reason or there might be incentive for him to make an identification."
1976.75-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2465.341,2468.889,"Well, so they question the credibility, the believability of the witness?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2468.889,2470.374,"Well, they just -- I think, they countered the fact that --"
1976.75-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.374,2472.347,"Well, is the answer yes or no?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2475.683,2477.257,I suppose the answer is yes.
1976.75-871,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2480.061,2485.332,"Well, Mr. Golub, certainly Judge Friendly at least inferred a bias in Glover, didn’t he?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2485.332,2487.781,He inferred a potential bias and I think --
1976.75-871,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2487.781,2490.677,"I know, but that Judge Blumenfeld did not."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2490.677,2493.078,Judge Blumenfeld did not do that and I think that’s one --
1976.75-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2493.078,2497.981,"Well, then we never solved that the witness did object -- the trial judge did not?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2499.444,2501.344,There was no hearing in the Trial Court.
1976.75-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.344,2508.388,So that it’s all of the -- both the District Court and the Court of Appeals were operating on a court record?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2508.388,2510.64,"On the same transcript, yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2510.64,2520.895,But the District Court followed the more traditional rule that on a court record you don’t re-examine credibility. Did he not?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2520.895,2524.835,"The District, yes -- he did not look to Glover’s motives."
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2524.835,2534.572,Was there any cross-examination of the officer opening up and gauntleting these facts that Judge Friendly seem to rely on.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2534.572,2539.629,There was no cross-examination of Glover that went to this issue.
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2542.655,2549.522,"Glover then found not a credible witness, by default, in effect, does he?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2549.522,2557.652,"Well, I think the only thing that Judge Friendly found was that he couldn’t be presumed to be accurate, simply because he was a trained police officer."
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2558.082,2560.973,"Well, he presumed the contrary. Did he not?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2560.973,2562.568,"I don’t -- I think, he noted the contrary."
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2565.995,2570.627,"Well, he either accepted the Policeman’s testimony or not, and which did he do?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2572.152,2579.804,He found that the testimony -- there was a substantial likelihood of misidentification from the procedures employed and I might point out that --
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2579.804,2589.816,"Well, that rejects totally and completely, does it not, the in-court identification of the accused?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2589.816,2592.551,"Well, I don’t think it’s necessary to say, it’s a total rejection."
1976.75-871,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2627.737,2637.304,"Mr. Golub, did you suggest earlier that you and your colleague stipulated that no hearing was necessary before Judge Blumenfeld?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2637.304,2638.817,We agreed to go on the trial transcript.
1976.75-871,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2638.817,2640.295,Rest upon the State transcript.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2640.295,2640.901,Yes.
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2640.901,2642.987,And you have the whole the transcript here?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2642.987,2644.687,"It is, it’s part of the record."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2645.11,2645.949,It’s part of the record here?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2645.949,2647.844,It was not -- it’s in the appendix.
1976.75-871,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2647.844,2651.237,"And the burden is on you in a habeas proceeding, isn’t it?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2651.237,2664.358,"Well, I think the burden is on us to show that there was unnecessary suggestiveness, and I think once we have met that burden, which we did, that the burden then shifts to the State to show that there was no substantial likelihood of misidentification."
1976.75-871,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2664.358,2666.25,"Well, what case do you rely on for that proposition?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2666.25,2674.406,"Well, I don’t think it is explicitly stated in a case, Your Honor, but I think that that’s the rationale of the identification law cases."
1976.75-871,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2751.568,2762.857,"Well, as to the unusual practice, is an unusual practice for Police Officer to look at the mugshots?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2762.857,2764.834,"Well, on the basis of my experience --"
1976.75-871,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2764.834,2769.286,Is it or isn’t that rather normal for a Police Officer?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2769.286,2773.112,This is a limited branch of the Connecticut State Police Department.
1976.75-871,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2781.683,2784.032,And is it normal for them to look at mugshots?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2784.032,2791.321,"It’s my understanding of their normal practice, that they make the purchase and then go back and look at only one mugshot."
1976.75-871,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2794.273,2797.887,"Well, how could he normally find one mugshot?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2797.887,2803.352,"Well, they have a list -- they have a book of pictures in the one of the --"
1976.75-871,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2803.352,2805.463,"A book full pictures, that’s not one mugshot."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2805.463,2809.707,"They pulled a picture out of the book, Your Honor, and they will then bring it over as Mr. D’Onofrio --"
1976.75-871,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2809.707,2814.721,"But with police officers, they are different from ordinary people; they are trained."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2814.721,2818.01,"Well, they are trained but they are still subject to the same significance --"
1976.75-871,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2818.01,2838.204,"Well, suppose a police officer comes out and says, “The man, I saw, was 5 foot 8, 180 pounds, a Negro, with blond hair, blue eyes, and a scar across his face, and you show him a picture of that, what’s wrong with that?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2838.204,2846.931,"Well, there are many people who might look like that, Your Honor. [Laughter]"
1976.75-871,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2846.931,2850.104,"Well, that’s the best you can do?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2850.104,2854.456,"[Laughter] Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2887.348,2893.791,"How can you drop the picture until after you have got a full description of him, good enough to be able to pick out the picture?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2893.791,2897.9,"It’s a description, Your Honor, of a heavyset black man with high cheek bones."
1976.75-871,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2901.34,2903.553,Can we find one with a cheek bone?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2903.553,2907.59,There is nothing about--
1976.75-871,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2907.59,2911.486,You are causing so many doubts about the cheek bone.
1976.75-871,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2911.486,2921.122,"Mr. Golub, does the record tell us whether Officer D’Onofrio knew that the defendant frequented this apartment before he received this description?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2921.122,2927.748,The record -- the transcript seems to indicate that D’Onofrio had seen Brathwaite in the area and that’s as far as it goes.
1976.75-871,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2927.748,2928.54,In the area?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2928.54,2928.659,Yeah.
1976.75-871,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2928.659,2930.508,But not necessarily in this particular apartment?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2930.508,2934.207,"No, there is no evidence -- there is no testimony one way or the other as to that."
1976.75-871,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2935.957,2936.662,"Well, let me just go on step further."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2936.662,2937.058,Yes.
1976.75-871,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2937.058,2944.401,Then is it a fair inference that D’Onofrio picked out this picture on the basis of the description given to him by Glover?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2944.401,2946.817,I think that is a fair inference.
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3095.67,3106.546,We will resume there at 1 o’clock counsel.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3108.495,3111.675,"MThank you, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court."
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3232.541,3239.818,"Well, how would prosecutors considerably be having the responsibility for the identification process?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3239.818,3239.861,Well --
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3239.861,3245.98,Or do you mean that he might be (Inaudible) for using or attempting to employ --
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3245.98,3246.646,"Well, I think very often --"
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3246.646,3247.519,-- an identification?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3247.519,3248.006,Excuse me.
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3263.902,3275.05,"Do you think there is something wrong with a lawyer showing potential witness, some of the evidence they are going to be dealing with before a trial?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3275.05,3275.581,"Well, I do, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3275.581,3278.478,And that’s essentially like interviewing the witness.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3278.478,3283.073,"I think, Your Honor, there was no reason why a spread couldn’t have been used on the day of trial as well."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3295.153,3301.356,"But on the retrial it was ordered, you can’t use either identification?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3301.356,3304.508,"Well, I think under the totality test that Judge Friendly --"
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3304.508,3308.461,"Well, I thought Judge Friendly said, you can use either of this -- either of identification."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3308.461,3309.766,That’s correct.
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3309.766,3311.45,How would you convict it?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3311.45,3315.666,"Well, I might say that I doubt if there would be a retrial, I don’t that you could be trying --"
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3315.666,3317.618,"What do you mean, you think he just be turned lose."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3317.618,3319.61,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3319.61,3326.074,"And you don’t really think that -- you are not urging that deterrence may lose, are you?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3326.074,3327.486,"Well, I certainly am."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3327.486,3330.019,"Yes or no, or you are, (Voice Overlap)."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3330.019,3330.564,I certainly am.
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3338.565,3347.809,"The only point you have is that they showed him this picture and on the basis on them showing him this picture, he goes free."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3350.683,3355.229,"Well, in this particular case, on these facts the evidence is not admissible, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3355.229,3356.431,And so he is free.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3356.431,3359.964,"He would -- there would be no other -- since there is no other evidence, he would have to go free."
1976.75-871,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3372.823,3378.291,I am not sure about your answer to Mr. Justice Marshall.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3387.779,3392.893,"That’s correct; I meant to answer with respect to the totality test, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3410.008,3422.368,Let’s assume that the per se rule is not adopted for the out-of-court identification but that the totality was a substantial likelihood of misidentification.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3422.368,3423.659,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3423.659,3438.131,"And let’s assume that in a particular case, applying that rule, it was found that the pretrial identification was so suggestive that it should not be admissible because of the substantial likelihood of misidentification."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3441.743,3443.545,It would not automatically preclude it.
1976.75-871,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3447.365,3455.197,I know but there is a -- but why wouldn’t there still be a question open at the trial whether that was an independent basis for the identification?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3455.197,3456.316,I certainly believe that there would be out --
1976.75-871,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3456.316,3461.82,"Well, if that is true -- Judge Friendly did not go through that routine."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3473.015,3476.833,I don’t think he is clear in his opinion as to why he is suppressing the in-court identification.
1976.75-871,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3476.833,3480.214,"Well, at least he never inquired whether there was any independent basis for the in-court."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3480.214,3486.738,"He raised it in the court in our brief and he did not specifically articulate, why he was suppressing the in-court."
1976.75-871,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3487.788,3497.032,"But in any event, you don’t -- whatever the rule is adopted for the out-of-court identification, you did not claim did that automatically disposes of the in-court identification."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3497.032,3499.01,"Oh no, we do not claim that, we certainly not."
1976.75-871,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3499.01,3501.727,"Well, then was your answer to Mr. Justice Marshall correct or not?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3501.727,3504.506,"Well, I think it’s correct on these facts, Your Honor, because --"
1976.75-871,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3504.506,3505.117,"Well, on these facts."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3505.117,3508.854,"On these facts only, it’s correct, and that’s all I meant to say with respect to these facts."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3508.854,3525.029,"Reading from page 27A, “Assuming which we do not believe that Simmons states a proper test for both of Glover’s identifications, we hold that both were inadmissible”"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3525.029,3527.53,"I think that’s -- and I think, he is holding that neither one could be used in the pretrial."
1976.75-871,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3527.53,3530.103,But that is too essential from the bottom-line.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3530.103,3534.166,"Yes, I think he is holding that neither one could be used to trial on these facts."
1976.75-871,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3538.744,3554.152,"You mean that on a retrial that would -- however, if over an in-court identification by Glover, then the State would have to go forward also and show there was an independent basis, not related to the show-up."
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3554.152,3556.038,"On a retrial, the State would, yes."
1976.75-871,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3556.038,3570.597,"But the State will have to show, in addition to Glover’s in-court identification of Brathwaite that that identification was rested upon a basis independent of the show-up, would it?"
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3570.597,3571.307,"Yes, I believe that that would --"
1976.75-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3571.307,3575.952,Do you think the State may retry it?
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3575.952,3577.165,"I think, there is no change at all."
1976.75-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3578.356,3586.529,It sounds to me like Judge Friendly on the Second Circuit held that this particular Policeman’s testimony would not be received.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3586.529,3587.717,"That’s how I read the opinion also, Your Honor."
1976.75-871,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3587.717,3590.638,Yes.
1976.75-871,1,20922,david_s_golub,,3590.638,3591.149,Thank you.
1976.75-871,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3591.149,3592.829,Do you have any further counsel?
1976.75-871,2,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,3592.829,3607.975,"Just very briefly, Your Honor, if I may, with respect to some of Mr. Mr. Golub’s comments, I don’t know whether he meant to imply or actually said that Detective D’Onofrio was Glover’s superior officer."
1976.75-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3693.346,3703.338,But isn’t that -- wouldn’t it be -- wouldn’t the admissibility of the out-of-court identification be critical in a lot of cases?
1976.75-871,2,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,3703.338,3704.806,"Yes, it would, Your Honor, yes."
1976.75-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3704.806,3719.419,"In the sense that without the pretrial identification, and without it’s being admissible, the officer might have a real problem in identifying in court?"
1976.75-871,2,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,3719.419,3723.379,"Well, I suppose that would be true, if there was a lapse of time, particularly."
1976.75-871,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3723.379,3728.574,"Well, and not only that but having dealt with -- having seen an awful lot of people?"
1976.75-871,2,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,3728.574,3736.776,"That’s right, that’s correct because there are great many persons that these undercover officers deal with over a period of time."
1976.75-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3736.776,3748.043,"Mr. Gaffney, if we apply the totality of circumstances test, am I correct in assuming that that would mean both the in-court and the out-of-court identifications would always stand and fall together?"
1976.75-871,2,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,3748.043,3764.451,"Well, no, I would think that if the pretrial procedure was found to be defective and yet there could be an independent basis shown for the in-court identification apart from the pretrial procedure that the State could hopefully proceed on that basis."
1976.75-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3764.451,3772.605,"But isn’t the inquiry as to whether it’s reliable or not, and if it is reliable, or you pass it for the out-of-courts or in-courts?"
1976.75-871,2,17681,bernard_d_gaffney,,3772.605,3779.442,"Well, yes, I guess it’s so Your Honor, reliability is the key."
1976.75-871,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3779.442,3780.086,Thank you gentlemen.
