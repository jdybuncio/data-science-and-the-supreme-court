1972.71-738,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.229,-- Tribe against Mr. Jones.
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,35.373,38.407,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-738,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,116.77,118.874,Primarily not entirely so?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,118.874,120.04,"Not entirely so, sir."
1972.71-738,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,124.934,132.912,Do you think the case is basically any different from what it would be if a tribe was running a taxicab company in San Francisco?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,132.912,133.163,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-738,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,135.53,139.254,"And the use -- the ski trails would be one of the factors, wouldn't they?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,139.254,141.497,"A minor one, sir."
1972.71-738,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,144.694,145.133,No.
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,149.249,167.352,The Ski resort in fact is bordered on the south by the reservation itself and the ski enterprise including the lease with the United States Forest Service was entered into by the tribe pursuant to Article number 11 of the Constitution which Constitution was approved by the Secretary of the Interior.
1972.71-738,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,199.045,204.17,Could you tell us what kind of training is given to them?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,209.145,210.341,"Yes -- well, yes sir."
1972.71-738,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,239.153,241.654,"Well, then who runs the ski resort?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,241.654,249.326,The ski resort is run under a plan of operation that has been adopted by the tribal council subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.
1972.71-738,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,262.069,267.787,"Well, do I understand from what you just said that it is not run exclusively by Indians?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,267.787,275.063,It is run exclusively by Indians in that the plan of operation for the ski run was adopted by the tribal council.
1972.71-738,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,284.66,290.304,"What I am trying to get at is, are there non-Indians operating in the ski resort?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,290.304,293.13,"There are non-Indians involved in the operation, yes sir."
1972.71-738,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,296.448,300.899,So that the Indians that are present there are only in training?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,300.899,301.664,"Fundamentally, sir."
1972.71-738,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,303.681,311.63,"This is what I get from your briefs that the Indians there are only in training and that other people that are running it, is this correct?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,311.63,313.526,"This case is here on stipulated facts, Your Honor."
1972.71-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,402.6,403.534,Mr. Fettinger?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,403.534,403.785,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,403.785,408.167,Is that tax in the nature of a used tax?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,410.536,410.78,Yes sir.
1972.71-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,419.352,419.606,What if -- ?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,419.606,422.625,It’s generally referred to as an excise.
1972.71-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,422.625,431.153,What if the Indian organization had not had to go out of state and found a dealer down at Alamogordo that would be able supply it?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,444.573,455.855,If the purchase was made by the tribe for tribal purposes we would contend that purchase inside or outside of the State of New Mexico would be exempt from such a gross receipts or compensating tax.
1972.71-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,460.83,461.431,But you would claim --
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,461.431,462.219,(Voice Overlap) would say the same thing about it.
1972.71-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,462.219,476.24,"Even if it were purchased under the circumstances it was in this case from a dealer in Alamogordo and he said, “You know, it’s $1,000.00 price plus $40.00 for the Governor,” that he could not add that to the bill he was giving to the tribe."
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,476.24,477.443,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,501.907,507.039,"Was this -- was the ski left in this case, that the material was used for on and off the reservation?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,507.039,513.133,It is physically located on the present -- beyond the present boundaries of the reservation.
1972.71-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,521.837,523.9,But on Indian property?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,523.9,527.468,We would contend that the interest in real estate upon which the ski run is located (Voice Overlap) --
1972.71-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.468,528.143,"It's a lease, it's a lease."
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,528.143,544.234,"Yes, it's leased from the Forest Service and as such, is an interest in real estate and is effectively subject to the statute which provides that it's not subject to tax."
1972.71-738,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,763.836,767.48,"(Inaudible) reservations to the Congress, was he not?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,767.48,788.097,"Yes sir and I think they are significant from the point of view that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs is presumed by case law to speak for the President when exercising Indian -- a policy towards Indians under 25 U.S.C. 2, hopefully that policy is, as expressed by the President sir."
1972.71-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.97,1162.088,"Would you carry this argument to the point of denying New Mexico’s right to tax the income of Indians who are earning money, working at the ski run at the ski resort?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1162.088,1163.861,That is really beyond the scope of this case.
1972.71-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.637,1169.963,I think it is very relevant to your case.
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1169.963,1180.683,"To income earned on the ski run, whole new avenue opens."
1972.71-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1207.703,1209.304,You're looking to the real estate?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1209.304,1210.302,And the real estate (Voice Overlap) --
1972.71-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1210.302,1214.607,"(Voice Overlap) taxing simply income, not the real estate?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1214.607,1214.936,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1221.414,1227.651,"And so you're -- and so again would you say no tax on the income, on individual income?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1227.651,1232.197,"I think it should be treated the same way as income on the reservation proper, sir."
1972.71-738,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1278.139,1282.562,You are talking about Section 465.
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1297.331,1311.62,"I think in regard to the compensating tax where it’s directly equivalent to interstate commerce, the arguments might be stronger that it should not apply in regard to the gross receipts tax, it maybe -- the argument is equally is strong."
1972.71-738,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1313.032,1315.741,Then you see no difference?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1315.741,1316.226,Except in (Voice Overlap) --
1972.71-738,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1316.226,1321.135,But I take that the Solicitor General does and his approach does see a difference?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1321.135,1340.833,"If the tribe is to be taxed, I do not think it is the court's rulings in the past have established an atmosphere that we play a game to see if the Court can guess some way that has not been prohibited from taxing as opposed to a general prohibition against tax unless specific authority is given by Congress."
1972.71-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.255,1367.816,What's your authority to saying that this Court has held that income from exempt lands is not taxable?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1367.816,1370.196,Income from exempt lands?
1972.71-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.705,1387.475,That was just to construct with the Federal Income Tax Law?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1387.475,1387.694,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1388.649,1394.176,"What -- it had to do nothing to do with Indian exemption, it just had to do a construction of a statute -- the taxing statute."
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1394.176,1403.917,"Well, for example in the revenue ruling of 1967 provides that the income of tribes generally is not subject to the Federal Income Tax for example."
1972.71-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.917,1411.807,"Well, that’s -- Again that just again a construction of the taxing statute, isn't?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1411.807,1412.087,Yes sir.
1972.71-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1412.715,1416.308,(Voice Overlap) New Mexico had intended to reach this income?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1416.308,1422.339,"Well, they are excluded from it because they are not of the nature of this tax, I think it's the basis of the ruling."
1972.71-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1437.234,1437.673,350?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1437.673,1443.462,-- that recites -- that it's in subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Government.
1972.71-738,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1449.085,1458.397,What if the tribe organized the bus line to carry passengers from nearby cities where they have airports to the ski resort?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1464.069,1472.794,"Sir, I would suggest to you that the protections are already built in to the system which controls the Indian tribe is very appropriately discussed at this point."
1972.71-738,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1478.498,1481.135,"Well, let's assume they got it?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1481.135,1483.986,If it had -- if it had the authority vested in it from the Secretary --
1972.71-738,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1483.986,1487.687,Same authority for entering this enterprise?
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1487.687,1488.062,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-738,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1504.384,1509.71,"Well, the political decision whether they should be taxed by the state?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1509.71,1510.083,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-738,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1516.083,1521.721,"Well, I am just talking about a bus line now, not a loan, just a commercial bus line like any other bus line?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1521.721,1521.989,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-738,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1556.813,1561.564,"Mr. Fettinger, let me ask the question that was asked in the last case?"
1972.71-738,0,25300,george_e_fettinger,,1569.076,1577.096,"By contract with the, I believe the Secretary of the Interior, certain welfare items are -- services are provided."
1972.71-738,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1614.452,1619.416,Very well.
1972.71-738,1,29516,john_c_cook,,1623.774,1627.876,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-738,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.452,1841.284,"Is that -- am I correct, this resort is jammed up against the reservation?"
1972.71-738,1,29516,john_c_cook,,1841.284,1844.07,"Yes, Justice Marshall it's (Voice Overlap) of the reservation."
1972.71-738,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1844.07,1846.305,And so on United States property?
1972.71-738,1,29516,john_c_cook,,1846.305,1851.095,It's on land leased from the United States Forest Service.
1972.71-738,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1851.095,1853.07,"But United States property, isn't it?"
1972.71-738,1,29516,john_c_cook,,1853.07,1857.29,It's United States property which is leased to the Indian tribe.
1972.71-738,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1857.29,1863.929,"And if they had made that a part, could the United States have made that a part with the reservation?"
1972.71-738,1,29516,john_c_cook,,1863.929,1868.017,"I don’t -- I don’t know Your Honor whether they could have or not, they did not."
1972.71-738,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1868.017,1870.411,But do you know anyway or even they couldn't?
1972.71-738,1,29516,john_c_cook,,1870.411,1876.455,"Well, I don’t know why they could not have, but I know that in the facts of this case, they did not."
1972.71-738,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1876.455,1880.85,"But if they had, you agree you wouldn't have any case?"
1972.71-738,1,29516,john_c_cook,,1880.85,1886.448,"Your Honor, that would be a different case and I am not agreeing that we would not have a case, if this ski resort was --"
1972.71-738,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1886.448,1889.642,On what basis would you have a case?
1972.71-738,1,29516,john_c_cook,,1889.642,1893.82,We say that what's being taxed here is not --
1972.71-738,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1893.82,1899.578,But then you put this tax on within the reservation?
1972.71-738,1,29516,john_c_cook,,1899.578,1904.146,"Well, we said that that issue isn't before the Court in our case."
1972.71-738,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1904.146,1904.53,Alright.
1972.71-738,1,29516,john_c_cook,,1904.53,1924.819,"I am not speaking for the State of New Mexico, but I would say if the enterprise was located within the boundaries of the reservation, the tax could still apply, but that issue is not presented by this case."
1972.71-738,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2355.28,2355.909,Thank you Mr. Cook.
1972.71-738,2,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2358.786,2360.702,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1972.71-738,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.556,2443.19,Does the tribe collect state sales tax at the ski resort?
1972.71-738,2,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2443.19,2444.766,"I honestly don't know, sir."
1972.71-738,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.143,2445.35,(Voice Overlap) --
1972.71-738,2,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2445.35,2447.772,(Voice Overlap) My recollection is there is a flat rate.
1972.71-738,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.648,2460.705,"How about sales tax, state sales tax on the --?"
1972.71-738,2,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2460.705,2461.926,I don't believe it is collected.
1972.71-738,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2466.258,2469.165,They very much sell food there?
1972.71-738,2,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2469.165,2469.565,Yes sir.
1972.71-738,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2530.069,2532.279,How about federal taxes?
1972.71-738,2,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2532.279,2550.719,"Federal income taxes are covered by a specific regulation with a case citation showed to -- I forgot what it is right now sir, and the tribal income is not taxable to the tribe when -- I believe the concept being that when it passes on, if it was taxable to the tribe and goes on to the members at some later time it would be taxable to the members."
1972.71-738,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.494,2573.901,The income of the tribe from the ski resort is not subject to federal income taxes?
1972.71-738,2,25300,george_e_fettinger,,2573.901,2580.009,"That would be our contention under revenue ruling 67285, I think it is, sir."
1972.71-738,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2580.009,2580.782,Thank you gentlemen.
