2013.12-574,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.17,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-574, Walden v. Fiore."
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,8.354,10.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-574,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,65.025,69.31,Do you have any preference as to which of those errors you would like us to rely on?
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,69.31,82.904,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think for the reasons set out in the Federal Law Enforcement Officers' amicus brief, which I will try to explain, I think that it would be preferable for the Court to address personal jurisdiction and not just venue."
2013.12-574,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.397,136.472,"Of course, the venue question does not -- does not bring into the Court a constitutional question and the jurisdictional -- the jurisdictional one does."
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,136.472,137.555,That's true.
2013.12-574,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.555,140.341,And we usually try to avoid constitutional questions.
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,140.341,140.841,That's true.
2013.12-574,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,193.042,198.528,"It's not likely, is it, considering if the Bivens claim was created by this Court and not Congress?"
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,198.528,200.845,I'm not suggesting that Congress should do that.
2013.12-574,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,216.073,235.785,"You -- you would not have any problem about -- assuming we agree with you that it's -- there's no personal jurisdiction, it's the wrong venue, for the district court in Nevada to transfer the case to the Federal district court in Georgia?"
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,235.785,246.342,"Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, in the ordinary course in a -- in a case starting in district court under Section 1631 or -- or the venue statute, that would be an appropriate course."
2013.12-574,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,276.496,280.397,"That's probably -- it turned out to be a good -- good strategy, at least to the extent they got to the Ninth Circuit."
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,289.971,291.238,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2013.12-574,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,346.225,352.696,What do you think the Court meant when it said that the -- the article was aimed at California?
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,352.696,360.717,"I think what the Court meant, Justice Alito, is that the article was distributed in California and California was by far the largest market for the National Enquirer."
2013.12-574,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,383.73,385.848,"When it was distributed, it was distributed everywhere."
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,410.264,414.102,"--Well, let me try to answer the first part of your question first, Justice Alito."
2013.12-574,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,429.277,430.694,"It's the largest market for everything, isn't it?"
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,430.694,441.335,"--Well, in particular for National Enquirer when you're talking about articles about celebrities, about actresses in particular, that allegedly injured their professional reputation and prevent them from getting future acting jobs."
2013.12-574,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,441.335,441.752,I don't understand.
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,448.589,449.441,"No, I'm not suggesting that."
2013.12-574,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,450.808,453.641,"Well, I thought several times you said California was the biggest market."
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,453.641,456.46,--Right.
2013.12-574,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,510.18,521.135,"Well, what does it mean -- what does it mean in the context of an intentional tort, which is what we're talking about here, to aim at a particular State, if it doesn't mean to aim at a person who you know to be within that State?"
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,538.43,542.216,"--Well, Justice Kagan, I think the answer is that it could take a few forms."
2013.12-574,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,583.293,584.228,"Well, suppose -- suppose -- and I'm sorry."
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,584.828,597.468,"--for some benefit, for some reason, where you're projecting your conduct into that State, not just because that's where the plaintiff happens to be, which is incidental and irrelevant to you that the plaintiff is there as opposed to anywhere else, but because you're seeking that State out."
2013.12-574,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,625.222,625.705,Yes.
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,659.026,671.684,"Well, I think if it's a defamation suit, Justice Kagan, if you project your defamation into the forum State, then it's fair to say that you've in a sense entered the forum State, whether that's electronic or physical as in Calder."
2013.12-574,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,671.684,678.872,"But in -- in this case, it was known or should have been known that these were gamblers, they were in Nevada."
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,721.033,728.539,"Justice Kennedy, the complaint alleges that the plaintiffs had contacts with Nevada, were residents of Nevada."
2013.12-574,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,735.126,740.097,"But didn't they say they were residents in both places, in both California and Nevada?"
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,740.097,740.88,--They do say that.
2013.12-574,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.917,751.119,Let me ask this -- and it's probably clear in the briefs.
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,765.629,770.413,"--Well, I would emphasize 〝 marginally ′′, Justice Kennedy, because I think the gravamen of the complaint is both."
2013.12-574,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,790.01,810.99,"Would you -- would your answer be different, suppose that the officer had said, you can keep -- you can keep your money, go on to Nevada with it, and then, once the Fiores had reached Nevada the officer said -- the officer filed a false affidavit, which, let's say, froze the Fiores' bank accounts."
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,824.917,832.754,"--Justice Kagan, I think if -- if what Officer Walden allegedly had done -- of course, that's not this case -- is freeze a bank account in Nevada, then--"
2013.12-574,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,832.754,837.241,"Well, he did it by filing an affidavit in Georgia and then it froze a bank account."
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,837.241,838.508,"--No, I understand that."
2013.12-574,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,891.626,905.452,"But you told me -- you started by saying that our personal jurisdiction and venue provisions and jurisprudence center on a defendant's action, not on the plaintiff's action or injury."
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,917.61,918.06,Thank you.
2013.12-574,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,918.06,934.054,"I'm worried about the Internet effects from somebody's account in Vermont by someone in Illinois -- the hypothetical on page 19, who steals something from a store in California."
2013.12-574,0,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,934.054,936.423,"Thank you, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-574,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,941.141,941.641,Okay.
2013.12-574,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,954.466,958.437,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-574,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.777,1024.629,Did the affidavit ever get to Nevada?
2013.12-574,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1024.629,1026.081,It didn't get to Nevada.
2013.12-574,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1040.489,1052.731,"Do we know how much of the information, the supplemental information, that was prepared in Nevada and then was forwarded to Georgia, how much of that information was in the affidavit?"
2013.12-574,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1052.731,1055.933,"Based on the current record, I don't know that we do."
2013.12-574,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1096.241,1106.033,"But it was -- it was stated as a separate claim, and I think Judge Grisholm read it that way and I don't think Petitioner has taken issue with that."
2013.12-574,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1133.933,1138.67,--There isn't for purposes of -- of this case in this Court and I don't mean to suggest otherwise.
2013.12-574,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1159.082,1177.193,"But imagine a case where everybody agreed that the initial seizure was lawful, so that that wasn't part of the complaint at all, and the only complaint was that a false affidavit had been filed, so that after making the preliminary investigation, the officer hadn't transferred the money, but had instead kept it."
2013.12-574,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1177.193,1191.286,"And again, obviously, that's not this case, but I don't think that case would be any different because, assuming that the affidavit looks the same as it's alleged to look in this case, it would still be focused -- that money in Georgia and everything about it would still be related to Georgia."
2013.12-574,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1206.728,1209.764,And that would be true even if the Respondents had never been in Georgia?
2013.12-574,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1209.764,1211.366,--No.
2013.12-574,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1273.357,1281.427,Do you think it's relevant in a case like this whether the -- the Federal officer who is sued is represented by the Justice Department?
2013.12-574,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1281.427,1284.83,I don't think it's relevant at all.
2013.12-574,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1334.245,1354.892,"Ms. Sherry, just to try to figure out how far your argument goes, suppose there's an IRS agent sitting in Washington, D.C., and she maliciously does something, files an affidavit, does whatever she does to impose a tax penalty on somebody in Nevada and everything that she does happens in Washington, D.C.--"
2013.12-574,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1363.681,1370.151,I think there's more difficult questions there where the individual hasn't left the State at all and where it's targeted at the State.
2013.12-574,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1373.222,1373.705,"Well, she's a very mobile person."
2013.12-574,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1386.463,1398.354,"--That is what I said, but I think maybe it goes to Your Honor's other question earlier about what it means to expressly aim your conduct at the forum State, as opposed to just the forum resident, when we're talking about an intentional tort."
2013.12-574,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1460.844,1467.165,"Ms. Sherry, you -- would you want us to decide this case on the jurisdictional question or the venue question?"
2013.12-574,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1467.165,1469.934,"--The Court, I think, can do either."
2013.12-574,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1471.719,1472.152,I understand that.
2013.12-574,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1474.704,1484.044,"--My preference would be that -- the same as Petitioner's, that the Court decide it on personal jurisdiction grounds, and the reasons are the ones expressed in the Federal law enforcement officer brief."
2013.12-574,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1484.044,1489.513,What type of action would the United States have brought if they decided to bring an action?
2013.12-574,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1493.399,1495.751,It would have been an in rem action against the assets.
2013.12-574,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1560.794,1561.71,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1566.198,1568.882,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-574,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1612.142,1615.696,They didn't really injure a person in State B here.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1621.684,1627.588,"--Justice Scalia, we disagree, and so let me focus on your point and Justice Kennedy's question about which claim it is."
2013.12-574,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1708.456,1714.027,"Well, suppose that the plaintiffs in this case were not professional gamblers."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1734.107,1734.79,"--No, sir."
2013.12-574,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1764.377,1770.714,"Well, here the -- here the plaintiffs apparently lived in two places, right, California and Nevada?"
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1770.714,1771.214,--That is--
2013.12-574,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1771.214,1778.469,"And suppose my hypothetical rock performer has five houses, one in California, one in Montana and so forth."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1781.254,1782.088,"--No, sir."
2013.12-574,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1805.887,1810.108,"Well, they were sufficiently residents of California to get California driver's licenses, were they not?"
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1810.108,1812.074,"--That is true at one point, and they had moved."
2013.12-574,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1856.052,1859.171,So you're really arguing for a very broad principle.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1871.812,1872.348,"No, sir."
2013.12-574,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.081,1874.364,"No, that's what I thought you were saying."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1874.364,1878.335,"--Then I've misled you, and let me state our test, which I haven't done yet, and that may help you."
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1911.856,1914.258,"Well, I don't see how it arises in Nevada."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1934.339,1934.889,Okay.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1934.889,1942.342,"For example, a college student goes into the bookstore, and it's also a pharmacy, by the way."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1962.822,1963.858,I have not seen--
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1963.858,1965.491,"""Oh, I lost my billfold. """
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1977.332,1981.569,--In that kind of situation where the injury actually -- and you have named several situations.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1981.569,1983.719,"No, no, the injury -- my goodness, he lost his billfold."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1997.412,2003.666,"So Justice Breyer, it is our position that in that situation, there is not personal jurisdiction."
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2004.416,2014.874,"There is no jurisdiction in those cases where he lost his billfold in the bookstore in the college town 1,000 miles away from home, and he's going home, and everybody knows he's never going to have any money, and they keep the money."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2019.944,2020.344,--Okay.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.714,2052.166,Okay.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2053.399,2053.932,Okay.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2116.556,2119.791,Is this is a case -- is this a case like -- I'll look at those cases.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2119.791,2120.226,--Okay.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2120.226,2134.368,"But is your case a case like where the credit card is used, somebody finds it in a bookstore and starts spending the money and did the agents here, who were outside Nevada and they were keeping the money, were they going and spending it?"
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2134.368,2135.32,They weren't going and spending it.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2135.836,2137.02,Was there a credit card that they were using?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2137.02,2137.47,"--No, sir."
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2141.723,2145.175,I was trying to figure out just which cases I should read carefully and I will read those cases.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2145.175,2145.625,--Okay.
2013.12-574,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2157.716,2159.935,Was the money here in Georgia the whole time?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2159.935,2161.637,--The money here was--
2013.12-574,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.637,2162.403,Was it still there in that locker?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2162.403,2162.92,--No.
2013.12-574,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2180.781,2182.466,"Well, if it were about them--"
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2182.466,2183.033,Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2183.033,2185.418,--So -- so suppose they seized a gold watch--
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2185.418,2185.968,Okay.
2013.12-574,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2185.968,2188.12,--and then they refused to return the gold watch.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2188.12,2188.62,Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2188.62,2191.406,But the gold watch really is still sitting there in Georgia.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2191.406,2191.972,Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2191.972,2192.556,Okay?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2197.493,2197.876,Okay.
2013.12-574,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2202.612,2205.164,"Yeah, they seize it and then there's a false affidavit keeping it."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2205.164,2205.832,"--Yes, that--"
2013.12-574,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2205.832,2213.403,"And the complaint is only about the false affidavit, but it's in reference to property that is indisputably in Georgia."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2213.403,2213.92,--Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2232.749,2238.035,"Mr. Goldstein, can I take you back to the origins of all of this?"
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2238.035,2238.82,Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2238.82,2249.493,"The main move for personal jurisdiction traditionally is the plaintiff must go to where the defendant is, no matter how inconvenient that is for the plaintiff."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2264.518,2265.12,Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2265.12,2268.739,You're still not saying they have all-purpose jurisdiction over Walden.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2268.739,2269.406,No.
2013.12-574,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2270.691,2279.88,"And this Court, as the McEntyre decision indicates, has been pretty careful about specific jurisdiction."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2307.781,2308.714,Okay.
2013.12-574,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2368.605,2370.572,Before you move on from that point--
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2370.572,2371.24,--Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2371.24,2378.394,--your argument is dependent on the fact that the officer here knew that the -- the plaintiffs were residents of Nevada; is that right?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2378.394,2379.428,That they lived and worked there.
2013.12-574,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2379.428,2380.93,Why should that make any difference?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2387.833,2396.672,"That -- that is actually generally what the lower courts hold, and their reason is that the defendant is doing something knowing that he may be hailed into that court."
2013.12-574,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2405.195,2407.647,"Well, you could say that about whatever rule we adopt."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2415.151,2416.353,"--Justice Scalia, there is a--"
2013.12-574,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.353,2420.371,"I mean, it's sort of a self-fulfilling point you're making."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2420.371,2422.99,--It's almost like the Fourth Amendment reasonable expectations to privacy.
2013.12-574,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2527.759,2530.209,"When you're talking about the internet, you're in a different world."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2535.68,2536.282,--Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2536.282,2538.398,Could have happened in -- in the 19th century.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2538.398,2539.048,Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2539.048,2540.984,So I don't see what the internet has to do with this.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2540.984,2544.602,"Justice Alito, you always tell us that you've got to write a legal rule."
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2548.089,2548.605,Yes.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2565.532,2573.138,"--Justice Breyer, the kinds of internet cases -- and it's wrong for me to just say internet -- the kinds of cases that I'm talking about are the fraud cases, the intentional tort cases--"
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2573.138,2573.738,Like what?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2573.738,2579.692,"--You steal -- you're sitting in Georgia -- you don't, but someone is sitting in Georgia and they steal the identity of someone who's in Nevada."
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2579.692,2580.359,I wouldn't do that.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2582.911,2585.429,"That's why I took it immediately back, recognizing the error."
2013.12-574,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2585.429,2587.547,He wouldn't know how.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2594.384,2612.013,"But there are bad people in the world, obviously, and those people do, with increasing and distressing frequency with these new tools of communication, they are very, very capable of causing significant harm to someone else without actually do -- setting foot in the State."
2013.12-574,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2679.14,2680.29,"Well, I don't understand what you're saying."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2688.496,2689.196,"No, sir."
2013.12-574,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2693.067,2696.286,"I know that, so that's why I'm confused by what you're saying about transfer."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2696.286,2706.308,"--I'm trying to describe an opinion that you would write and the opinion that I think you would write is this, and it says: Look, personal jurisdiction in the wake of Calder, particularly where there are contacts here, exists."
2013.12-574,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2723.919,2740.298,"But you are asking the Court to decide a big ticket item, personal jurisdiction, and the theory that you are proposing would apply not to, just to Officer Walden, but it would be about as far out as any specific jurisdiction case I know."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2749.07,2751.42,"--Justice Ginsburg, I am not trying to skip over."
2013.12-574,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2792.513,2807.859,Did Calder have something to do with the notion that every defamation is -- that every publication is a tort where it occurs?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2825.302,2826.404,--Two things about that.
2013.12-574,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2842.846,2844.965,But you are libeled wherever it is published.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2850.536,2851.452,"--And, Justice -- that's correct."
2013.12-574,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2889.327,2897.581,"So -- so you could say that Calder, far from being an expansive decision, was a narrowing decision."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2911.841,2913.192,We are saying the same thing.
2013.12-574,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2916.228,2921.113,Except it's harder for you to establish that the injury occurred in Nevada.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2921.113,2923.398,"--I don't think so, and let me try my best."
2013.12-574,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2965.661,2971.648,But our jurisdiction cases have not been based on where you expected to be sued.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2993.661,3012.273,"Justice Scalia, I agree with you, but I will say in my defense that when the Court has said, when we are trying to figure out if there are minimum contacts and whether it's consistent with fair play and substantial justice, the language the Court has used is, is it fair, because the defendant could reasonably be expected -- could reasonably expect to be haled into the court."
2013.12-574,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3026.45,3030.418,"That's your new test, just whether you could expect this to happen?"
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3030.418,3030.854,"--No, sir."
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3066.277,3073.264,What is the -- what are the elements of the second tort?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3073.264,3073.764,Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3075.899,3076.999,And what is the element?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3076.999,3083.738,That he knowingly submitted information that caused the government not to send us the money.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3085.721,3086.69,The other element?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3086.69,3087.39,--Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3087.956,3089.573,How do I find that?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3096.129,3096.529,--Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3097.146,3098.664,But that's not necessarily true here.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3099.564,3104.485,"--No, it's actually not the case that the victim has to be misled in fraud, Justice Breyer, so for example--"
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3104.485,3107.854,--It has to be a misrepresentation--
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3107.854,3109.07,--A knowing misrepresentation.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3109.07,3109.654,--material to.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3109.654,3110.137,Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3110.137,3111.322,Material to?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3111.322,3113.072,Here to the government's decision--
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3113.072,3118.392,"Not here, but material to -- normally it has to be material to the obtaining the, say, of property."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3118.392,3118.875,--Right.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3120.594,3124.196,"Now, where do I find the elements of the tort that you are alleging here?"
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3124.196,3131.385,The tort that we are alleging here is essentially common law fraud under Bivens.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3132.685,3134.754,I don't see anything in the complaint that says anything like that.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3137.289,3137.856,--Okay.
2013.12-574,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3170.927,3189.739,"Mr. Goldstein, as I understood what Mr. Bucholtz was saying, he was saying there is a distinction between an officer who commits a fraud in Georgia, when your money is in Nevada, and so he commits a fraud and he freezes your bank accounts in Nevada, versus he commits a fraud by filing this affidavit."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3198.712,3199.196,Right.
2013.12-574,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3199.196,3201.096,What do you think about that?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3201.096,3205.517,"It doesn't make any practical sense to me, and the money wasn't in Georgia."
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3225.697,3239.404,"Because one of the elements of the crime in the second case, no element of the crime or no element of the tort, it's only the injury which isn't an element of the actual underlying behavior that gives rise to and in the first case it's the other."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3242.173,3242.706,Okay.
2013.12-574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3242.706,3243.492,I'm looking for that.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3247.527,3253.931,I believe that the elements of the tort that Justice Kagan is describing are the same elements that I am talking about here.
2013.12-574,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3255.283,3261.437,What if the plaintiffs in this case didn't leave Georgia?
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3261.437,3262.087,Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3262.087,3264.722,"They said, look, I'm not leaving until I get my money back."
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3270.726,3273.078,"Yes, it is a different case, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-574,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3283.367,3289.004,I thought your arguments was basically it does arise where he lives and works because it is in Nevada.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3295.258,3300.312,"--No, I -- that is -- for example, on our seizure claim, we acknowledge that at the very least there wouldn't be venue."
2013.12-574,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3339.437,3340.304,"Except, Mr. Goldstein--"
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3340.304,3340.889,--Yes.
2013.12-574,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3340.889,3347.46,--it -- it is of no consequence to Walden whether this person is from Alaska or Nevada.
2013.12-574,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3363.135,3372.758,"Justice Ginsburg, to my mind, what resembles it are the documents that go from Nevada to the defendant, and we think that's a -- specific to the fact that it was a libel and defamation case."
2013.12-574,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3373.11,3373.793,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-574,3,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3376.062,3386.501,"There was a lot of talk about intentional torts being different, and -- and how there should be a different rule in intentional torts."

2013.12-574,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3444.539,3445.856,"Counsel, your adversary is right."
2013.12-574,3,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3449.158,3449.777,--Right.
2013.12-574,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3449.777,3461.399,"So write the holding for me that can't be just plaintiff -- defendant's activities, because Calder did more than just defendant's activities."
2013.12-574,3,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3463.601,3464.62,"Of course, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-574,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3479.88,3480.613,I'm sorry.
2013.12-574,3,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3501.876,3503.578,"--Well, I think it's not contingent."

2013.12-574,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3629.643,3633.547,You say the affidavit wouldn't give rise to a Fourth Amendment claim.
2013.12-574,3,29084,jeffrey_s_bucholtz,,3633.547,3644.77,"I think Judge Ikuda made that point below, Justice Scalia, and I would agree with that, that -- that however is what the complaint alleges, and we're here on personal jurisdiction and venue and not on the merits of the -- of the complaint."
2013.12-574,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3651.091,3652.208,You can finish your sentence.
