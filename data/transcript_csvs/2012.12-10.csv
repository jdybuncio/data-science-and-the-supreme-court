2012.12-10,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.439,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 12-10, Agency for International Development v. The Alliance for Open Society International."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,10.839,13.824,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-10,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,59.636,63.005,"Well, but I guess the problem is that there are a number of different ways you could carry out the program."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,83.834,92.024,"--Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the way that Congress looked at this was to look at -- at the organizations with which the government is going to partner across the mine run of situations."
2012.12-10,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,109.65,110.485,"Well, what if they--"
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,110.485,111.552,--and sex trafficking come into issue.
2012.12-10,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,111.552,111.718,--All right.
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,130.014,133.315,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that would present a different question."
2012.12-10,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,161.449,163.101,"Well -- well, it would on that particular point."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,217.485,220.537,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I don't think so, and two responses on that score."
2012.12-10,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,240.768,241.634,"Well, that's quite a few, yes."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,242.251,248.188,"--that's in our support, and the lead organization is the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, and they -- they support us."
2012.12-10,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,266.149,280.159,"Mr. Srinivasan, there isn't -- at least I'm not familiar with anything quite like this where if you're not told, if you want to run a government program, you have to speak the government's speech."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,323.586,331.341,"--Justice Ginsburg, if I could just fight the premise of your question just very slightly and then explain why I think this kind of requirement makes sense in this particular context."
2012.12-10,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,411.643,430.524,I'm not aware of any case in which this Court has held that it is permissible for Congress to condition Federal funding on the recipient's expression of agreement with ideas with which the recipient disagrees.
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,455.406,462.426,"There -- there is germaneness, Justice Alito, and I can point to a couple of other limiting principles that have been noted in this Court's decisions and I think that are satisfied here."
2012.12-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.053,477.672,Say it again.
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,478.988,487.111,--It -- it -- the government is limited from leveraging its control over funding conditions so that it can achieve a speech -- speech-suppressive objective.
2012.12-10,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,502.387,507.707,"Well, let me give you this example, which is mentioned in one of the amicus briefs."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,530.371,533.006,With -- with certain limitations.
2012.12-10,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,535.274,536.124,With what -- with what limitations?
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,536.124,536.724,"Well, I think--"
2012.12-10,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,536.724,554.852,"The government could have a whole list of things, of principles that it thinks should be incorporated into higher education, and it could require a university as a condition of receiving these -- this money, let's say directed through student loans, to express agreement with all of these propositions."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,555.786,562.372,"--Well, I'm not sure, Justice Alito, and of course it's going to be hard for me to decide that we are not going to defend something."
2012.12-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.369,584.205,What do you mean by partnering?
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,591.792,595.161,"--Well, I don't know that it the differs from giving the money to do the job."
2012.12-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,623.08,625.782,I don't know what you -- what do you mean by partnering?
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,632.019,632.336,--Yes.
2012.12-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,632.336,633.936,--Is that all you mean by partnering?
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,633.936,635.888,They are given money to carry out--
2012.12-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,635.888,637.188,To carry out a particular program.
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,637.188,640.456,--But in concert with Federal policy priorities.
2012.12-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.046,648.596,I understand.
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,653.615,655.099,--To implement a particular program and--
2012.12-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.099,657.067,And you call that “ partnering with the Federal government ”.
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,657.067,657.734,--I do.
2012.12-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.734,658.836,"Terrible verb, anyway."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,658.836,659.503,Okay.
2012.12-10,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,667.609,677.315,"Mr. Srinivasan, on this, it does seem to me unusual, as Justice Alito brought out, requiring somebody to say “ I believe this ” or"
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,706.334,708.367,Yes.
2012.12-10,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,710.219,719.575,"Is that just an irrelevant consideration in Rust, that no one -- no one was being obliged to say I believe something that they don't believe."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,719.575,722.177,"--Well, here's why I think it makes sense in this context."
2012.12-10,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,757.867,763.187,"I see that, and I see you have two sides to the policy question."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,867.154,868.006,I think I do.
2012.12-10,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,868.006,869.856,"At the moment, for purposes of the question."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,876.36,885.902,"For the following reasons, Justice Breyer: There is an alternative affiliated organizational vehicle in this case as well, and I think that's constitutionally significant."
2012.12-10,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,921.422,925.541,"But, Mr. Srinivasan, there is a difference in this international setting."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1006.176,1010.647,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I guess it depends on which direction it runs as a principal point."
2012.12-10,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1056.476,1057.794,I wasn't exempting that one.
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1057.794,1058.46,Okay.
2012.12-10,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1058.46,1076.255,"The main difference it seemed to me is, assuming all of that away, is that here the separate structure does not fulfill the constitutional need simply because the basic condition has to do with express speech."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1125.102,1128.221,"I guess I'd -- I'd make two points, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-10,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1158.739,1168.779,"Boy, if -- if the structure -- the separate structure is not really part of a constitutional analysis, then the government could say, why not?"
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1186.922,1187.372,--Well--
2012.12-10,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1187.372,1191.643,--and -- and suddenly people can't say anything in these areas in face of such a condition.
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1191.643,1198.996,"--Well, as part of the -- as part of the constitutional analysis, I guess it's just addressing a different part of the constitutional analysis than -- than what Your -- Your Honor is addressing."
2012.12-10,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1225.214,1225.814,But that's--
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1225.814,1226.714,--and the other point I'd make--
2012.12-10,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1226.714,1227.43,--I'm sorry.
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1229.082,1230.049,"--Thank you, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-10,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1264.855,1275.145,--The problem that I have with that answer is that it doesn't cure the organization's need to stay true to its own beliefs.
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1371.541,1373.826,Justice Sotomayor--
2012.12-10,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1373.826,1378.028,"The church there would say, we don't believe and why should we say we believe."
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1378.028,1382.349,--I -- I'd certainly understand why a church would be reluctant to do that.
2012.12-10,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1420.707,1424.159,But why don't I give you another example that's along the same lines.
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1469.121,1471.223,"--I don't know that it would, Justice Alito, on that--"
2012.12-10,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1471.223,1471.79,"Well, why would it not?"
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1471.79,1477.394,"--because -- because I think, first of all, it would depend on whether there -- there is the requisite germaneness."
2012.12-10,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1514.765,1516.601,One -- one thing before your time is up.
2012.12-10,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1540.581,1545.035,"--I don't know that I have a particular case other than the doctrine generally, Justice Kennedy."
2012.12-10,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1588.798,1589.38,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1602.973,1605.759,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1649.536,1654.606,I don't see why this is a -- you talk about banning their speech.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1690.779,1698.202,"Well, I think the policy requirement here has been applied a little differently than Mr. Chief Justice suggests."
2012.12-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1726.636,1739.112,"So it would be a different case, in your -- your view, as if -- when they have those criteria, they have one of them is, oh, by the way, you must agree with the objective of the program, which is to eliminate to the extent possible prostitution and sex trafficking?"
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1739.112,1739.846,--No.
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1763.312,1763.995,"Well, it isn't just able to do."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1796.283,1797.149,Yes.
2012.12-10,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1806.921,1816.877,But let -- let me -- let me ask you this: Suppose that you're a Congressman or a Congresswomen and you are a constitutional expert and you take your oath to uphold the Constitution very seriously.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1830.636,1832.97,--Well--
2012.12-10,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1832.97,1835.522,Because you like their policies much better?
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1835.522,1840.659,--The -- the Congress can certainly fund a particular program and not fund others.
2012.12-10,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1867.393,1868.443,"Well, I'm -- I'm not quite sure I -- I see the difference."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1882.835,1887.137,"Well, I don't--"
2012.12-10,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1887.137,1891.941,"--across the board, with reference to drugs, with reference to guns, with reference to public health."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1891.941,1901.231,"--If -- if Congress is looking at the viewpoint of an organization and deciding whether to fund it based on its viewpoint, I think that's problematic."
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1914.873,1915.039,"Well, my goodness."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1915.923,1916.723,--is problematic.
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.723,1922.127,--they can't fund the Boy Scouts of America because they like the programs that the BSA has?
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1928.964,1929.799,Not at all.
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.349,1939.255,"Well, then you can take into account the -- the principles and the -- and the policies of -- of the organization that you're giving funding to."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1939.255,1945.243,"--Well, this Court has never said that the Congress can make a decision based on viewpoint alone."
2012.12-10,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1945.243,1953.248,"But there's no way to separate -- with an organization in the field that does things, there is no way, I don't think, to separate what they do from what they say."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1956.7,1957.466,Sure.
2012.12-10,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.466,1967.172,"One is the view that the way to fight AIDS is consistent with and is furthered by longer term efforts to abolish trafficking in women, okay, prostitution."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1991.873,1998.46,Congress can -- can certainly decide what programs to fund and what programs not to fund.
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.237,2015.655,But you -- you go further than that.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2034.666,2039.268,"The Court has never said that's okay, and it's our -- and it's our--"
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.268,2041.37,I'm not asking what the Court said; I'm asking what you're saying.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2041.37,2048.543,--It's our position that it is constitutionally problematic to make funding decisions based on the viewpoint of grantees.
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.543,2050.393,Problematic or -- or unconstitutional?
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2050.393,2052.761,Unconstitutional as applied here.
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.761,2053.228,Okay.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2053.228,2064.068,"However -- however, we are not saying that there is no circumstance in which the government's interest wouldn't be compelling enough to override the First Amendment right."
2012.12-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2064.918,2073.274,So just say the government wants to have an ad campaign to discourage people from smoking and they are looking for ad agencies to -- to help them with it.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2091.401,2096.12,--I think the rules are different when the government hires a spokesperson.
2012.12-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2107.245,2109.113,"Well, isn't that part of what's going on here?"
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2123.107,2124.723,"Well, the -- the government does say that."
2012.12-10,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2184.928,2185.195,Excuse me.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2254.355,2259.076,"Certainly, that would be okay within the four corners of the government program."
2012.12-10,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2266.096,2267.796,"Yes, that's Rust."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2267.796,2268.462,And that's Rust.
2012.12-10,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2269.131,2269.881,This is a step further.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2269.881,2286.341,"--And what Rust says, and I -- I think we fall back on Rust, which we think is just on all fours with where we are here, and that is what the government cannot do -- and I think this answers your question -- is outside the government program the government cannot control private speech."
2012.12-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2303.918,2306.504,"But that is saying this is what's happening in Rust, okay?"
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2320.83,2323.032,"--Rust does not say that, to be clear."
2012.12-10,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2361.057,2361.457,So--
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2361.457,2370.262,"And there's no evidence of harm at all here, so there's none of this undercutting the program that the government is alleging here."
2012.12-10,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2370.913,2371.613,"--No, no, no."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2403.068,2403.501,Yes.
2012.12-10,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2403.501,2422.545,"Which is how do you -- how do you answer the question of why does the Constitution bar the government from saying, look, if you're going to work with me, you can't go out there and promote a -- actively promote--"
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2422.545,2423.429,Right.
2012.12-10,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2423.429,2425.081,--a different message?
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2425.081,2430.568,"That's not the case here, but taking that case--"
2012.12-10,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2430.568,2431.068,Well--
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2431.068,2435.789,"--Taking that case, I think the government can't do that."
2012.12-10,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2479.149,2493.992,"Only because -- see, it's not -- it's not, in my opinion, not a viewpoint matter if they're going to fund a -- a group that wants to end discrimination against women around the world because they think all kinds of good things will flow from that."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2537.504,2541.206,"I don't think you can in terms of viewpoint either, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2579.581,2581.564,Let me -- can I -- can I be sure--
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2581.564,2581.949,Yes.
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.949,2587.101,--I understand what you've just conceded in -- in your response to Justice Breyer.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2607.349,2609.783,No.
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2609.783,2611.718,"Well, you said it's not a viewpoint thing."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2611.718,2612.168,No.
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2617.539,2620.574,I thought that's what you just said to Justice Breyer.
2012.12-10,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2620.574,2623.526,"I did too, because I -- I didn't see the reason."
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2647.992,2649.042,Him or me?
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2651.394,2655.062,"Mr. Chief Justice, I need your help on--"
2012.12-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2655.062,2657.864,"You can always choose me, too."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2657.864,2668.739,"--Well, our position here is that viewpoint is not the basis on which a decision can be made."
2012.12-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2684.065,2687.467,"Your approach, it seems to me, is just dealing with the breadth of the program."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2706.364,2710.149,"We absolutely would have a leg to stand on, and let me just explain--"
2012.12-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2710.149,2711.918,So you're an organization--
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2711.918,2727.444,"--what I attempted to concede before, and that is, if -- if the government -- in that narrow case where the government is hiring a spokesperson, which is what they've focused on, saying one thing with public funds and turning right around and saying another with private funds, there is no case that says they can gag the private speech of that spokesperson."
2012.12-10,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2748.107,2749.941,Let me -- let me just ask -- ask this one more time.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2783.361,2786.146,"No, I don't think it is."
2012.12-10,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2794.669,2795.335,"Well, this isn't -- no."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2801.256,2802.923,--And says this is the reason.
2012.12-10,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2802.923,2812.547,"And they say the reason we're not giving to organization A is because it's always critical of the United States; even though its technical skills are better, we prefer organization B."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2813.881,2815.664,Congress cannot do that.
2012.12-10,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2815.664,2817.849,And your best case for that proposition is what?
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2817.849,2821.635,"Well, even the government concedes that -- that they can't do that."
2012.12-10,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2825.27,2832.624,"Well, I'm -- I'm not sure they should if they're going to -- if they're going to be able to establish the principle that allows them to prevail in this case and that's why I'm asking."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2832.624,2843.497,"I -- I don't think that that's permissible, because all that is, is penalizing a particular viewpoint and withholding a subsidy or benefit based on viewpoint."
2012.12-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2843.497,2850.485,--I just want to make sure I -- the government has a program to develop water resources.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2868.532,2879.67,"Well, that -- I don't think it can make that decision based on viewpoint."
2012.12-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2880.339,2881.556,Viewpoint on apartheid.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2886.326,2902.453,"--I mean, the -- the reason that that case is so much tougher than this one is because in this one, they're not attempting to select organizations that will do the best job by using the policy requirement."
2012.12-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2926.235,2930.02,It goes to the effectiveness of the program.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2955.738,2956.155,"Yes, I understand."
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3028.3,3029.3,"It doesn't say, “ profess belief ”."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3035.421,3036.722,Well--
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3036.722,3037.072,A policy.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3048.613,3052.165,"--Well, as it's been applied to us, it's more than just have a policy."
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3064.805,3080.165,"They can get all that without making you profess it, unless -- unless you consider the only profession to be the assurance to the -- to your partner, the United States government, that you -- that you in fact oppose prostitution."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3080.165,3084.619,"--Well, that's -- that's precisely it, Justice Scalia, is we are required to profess our allegiance to the government."
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3084.619,3085.119,To tell the government.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3087.252,3089.785,That's the profession that we're required to--
2012.12-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.785,3090.068,Oh.
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3090.287,3091.12,--that's the pledge.
2012.12-10,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3097.64,3113.066,"And then they're doing that, they say, because we're part of the belief as a matter of policy that the best way to go about this, whether you think so or not, is to restrict the grants to those people who will oppose the long-term extension of prostitution expressly."
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3123.105,3126.141,--The government no doubt has a good reason for putting it there.
2012.12-10,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3171.838,3195.453,"Are you -- what -- are you saying that you can -- within the government program, within the government program, the government can specify whatever it wants, including this -- this policy, but it can't then say and the organization outside the program is also bound by this profession?"
2012.12-10,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3195.453,3204.743,"--Within the program, they can tell us, if we are speaking for them, what to say, and -- on their behalf, not ours."
2012.12-10,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3275.003,3276.621,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-10,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3279.24,3287.244,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-10,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3315.08,3321.15,"I don't want to interrupt your rebuttal, but I don't see the difference between those two, those two things that you just tried to distinguish."
2012.12-10,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3321.15,3330.923,--Because it goes to the limitation that the Court has imposed in its decisions about leveraging funding so as to suppress viewpoints.
2012.12-10,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3345.183,3351.004,"Well, suppose you have an organization that previously has expressed support for the legalization of -- of prostitution."
2012.12-10,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3366.346,3367.063,--I don't think--
2012.12-10,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3367.063,3368.965,--to change the viewpoint that they are expressing?
2012.12-10,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3368.965,3373.017,"--It's not -- Justice Alito, with all respect, I don't think it's trying to change their viewpoint."
2012.12-10,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3446.731,3460.308,I would have less problem accepting your message if there weren't four major organizations who were exempted from the policy requirement and -- medical science -- vaccinators are exempted.
2012.12-10,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3473.818,3479.119,"Justice Sotomayor, Congress is not required to -- to pursue every objective no matter what the cost may be."
2012.12-10,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3488.477,3490.46,"Mr. Srinivasan, that was one, veterans."
2012.12-10,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3500.368,3505.187,"Justice Ginsburg, I think the exemption for these organizations makes good sense if you consider the character of the organizations."
2012.12-10,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3510.308,3510.974,Mr. Srinivasan--
2012.12-10,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3510.974,3511.774,--Can I just finish this thought?
2012.12-10,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3529.12,3530.153,"--Thank you, counsel, counsel."
