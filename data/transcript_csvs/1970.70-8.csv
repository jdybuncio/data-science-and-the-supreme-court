1970.70-8,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.594,"Mr. Reese, I think we’ll just wait for a moment."
1970.70-8,0,37633,pearce,,57.594,67.094,"Alright, surely."
1970.70-8,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,67.094,82.324,"And, we’ll hear arguments next in number 577, United States against Johnson."
1970.70-8,1,26617,howard_e_beckler,,83.606,98.245,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.70-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,98.245,100.367,"Mr. Reese, you may proceed whenever you’re ready now."
1970.70-8,2,37633,pearce,,100.367,101.646,Thank you very much.
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,1912.617,1934.443,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please the Court, I have had an extremely difficult last few moments in beginning my argument because I’ve heard some of the inquiries presented by this honorable Court to my opponent, the petitioner."
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2046.422,2060.215,"Well, not about the requirement before you leave this country, before you can get a passport, you get to submit to having a small pox inoculation, among others."
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2060.215,2060.409,Yes.
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2060.409,2082.672,"And depending on where you’re going, a great many other things, now these are frequently, to some people, less agreeable, more painful, more an invasion of privacy than somebody disrobing, as a great many people do on the beach and doctor’s offices and many other places."
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2093.944,2094.717,"No, I do not."
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2095.092,2097.324,What’s the difference on the constitutional basis?
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2097.324,2099.615,I think the difference is two-fold.
1970.70-8,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2172.222,2177.626,In what way do you give to what is almost a matter of judicial notice?
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2195.258,2196.719,I have two answers.
1970.70-8,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2208.424,2211.567,Are you talking about body cavity search?
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2211.567,2214.405,"No, I’m talking, Your Honor, in underwear."
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2286.912,2295.347,What if we found 50 here in a mine built around the torso of the-- on apparently overweight man?
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2295.347,2295.854,I would s--
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2295.854,2298.363,"What’s the difference whether it’s 2, 20, or 200?"
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2298.363,2301.372,I would say we have to balance the interest here.
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2301.372,2303.41,"As between 2, 20, and 200?"
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2303.41,2306.745,"No, between the initiation of the search and not the result."
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2325.19,2347.644,"Well, I have seen records of cases, counsel, where there was expert testimony, undisputed, that a single person could carry $50,000 worth of raw heroin on purse without having it noticeable to any but the most alert and astute trained observer and not even always then."
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2347.644,2362.41,"If that right to search that person is given, it should be based on an articulable objective statement that the officer can explain to the trier of the fact that why he wanted that person stopped."
1970.70-8,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2380.944,2383.002,"That’s a sound desk, you know?"
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2383.002,2389.771,"Yes, that’s a lucky meek sheet, Mr. Justice, where they have had a history of experience with that person before."
1970.70-8,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2402.631,2403.56,Who has had--
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2403.56,2406.332,Who has had contraband or been arrested as a suspect.
1970.70-8,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2450.018,2468.245,"Mr. Beckler, what if instead of 1 in 15, what if the hard statistical facts were, over the basis of a long period of experience, that 1 out of every 2 travelers who crossed the border at this particular point was a smuggler?"
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2468.245,2474.236,I would probably not be here arguing and I would concede to Your Honor that that would be fair enough.
1970.70-8,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2474.506,2476.699,And everybody could be given a personal search?
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2476.699,2479.531,"Yes, the batting average there is 500."
1970.70-8,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2504.108,2506.185,"And then one out of every four, they found contraband."
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2506.185,2508.973,"That is correct and, in my opinion, that is not good enough."
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2508.973,2516.893,"Now, where do you find in the constitution that one out of four is not constitutional, but one out of two is constitutional?"
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2516.893,2517.93,I don’t find that.
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2636.182,2639.029,Let’s go back 180 years ago.
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2648.578,2651.857,I doubt it very much and I don’t think it should be that way today.
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2693.211,2700.153,Do you think it could-- the constitutional problem would be cured if a physician or a registered nurse made the examination?
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2700.153,2700.818,"No, I don’t."
1970.70-8,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2832.043,2838.753,"What you call again that, conceivably, could be based on experience quite apart from many and of any personal prejudices."
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2871.397,2871.589,Yes.
1970.70-8,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.589,2877.225,Then it would-- might not represent any personal prejudice on his part whatsoever?
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2877.225,2879.386,I concur totally.
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2900.722,2903.274,How many of those did they find something on?
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2903.274,2905.066,"1,311."
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2905.066,2908.408,"1,311 had some narcotics or some other contraband?"
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2908.408,2910.421,"Something, yes."
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2910.421,2915.794,And that figure doesn’t suggest anything to you?
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2915.794,2918.623,It suggests that we have a problem in the country.
1970.70-8,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2933.024,2946.007,"Mr. Beckler, going back over some ground that you’ve already covered, I did understand correctly, did I not, that you have no concern about indiscriminant search of luggage?"
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2946.007,2947.302,"I do not, Your Honor."
1970.70-8,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2947.923,2955.596,And you drew all the distinction then on a-- by a balancing of interest even though the Fourth Amendment reads as to effects as well as to one’s purse.
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2955.596,2957.454,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1970.70-8,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2970.622,2975.376,"Well, sometimes people don’t bring in objects."
1970.70-8,3,26617,howard_e_beckler,,2979.464,2981.281,"It can be, yes."
1970.70-8,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.03,3074.375,Thank you.
