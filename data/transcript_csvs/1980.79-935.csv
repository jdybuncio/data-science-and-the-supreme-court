1980.79-935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.654,We'll hear arguments next in Allen v. McCurry.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,78.766,82.302,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.901,261.936,"Mr. Fitzgibbon, can I ask you a question about the procedural posture of this case?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,295.359,295.942,That is correct.
1980.79-935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,295.942,323.926,"And the Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit didn't... although it said you can't use collateral estoppel once the state process is finished, it directed the Federal District Court to abstain while he, the defendant, perfected his appeal through the Missouri court system."
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,323.926,324.426,Right.
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,339.804,344.69,"And did the case go to the Missouri Supreme Court, Mr. Fitzgibbon?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,344.69,345.542,"No, it did not."
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,350.994,352.927,Could he have gone to the Missouri Supreme Court?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,352.927,353.244,--Pardon me?
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,353.244,356.279,Could the defendant have taken his conviction to the Missouri Supreme Court?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,356.279,358.314,"No, Your Honor, not under our law."
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,362.266,365.302,Or could it have come here from the Missouri Court of Appeals?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,365.302,367.937,From the Missouri Court of Appeals?
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,379.744,385.981,"No, but cert might have been sought here from the Missouri Court of Appeals?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,385.981,389.1,It could have come very well by petition for certiorari to this particular Court.
1980.79-935,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,389.1,390.369,Bring me up to date.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,395.606,398.391,It was affirmed by the Missouri Court of Appeals.
1980.79-935,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,398.391,400.025,Was cert applied for?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,400.025,401.177,Pardon me?
1980.79-935,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,401.177,402.543,Was cert applied for?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,402.543,409.181,"I am not familiar with that particular point because I am not the prosecutor in the case, I represent the police officers."
1980.79-935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,414.984,421.923,When you speak of cert are you speaking of cert to the highest court in Missouri?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,421.923,422.79,"No, sir."
1980.79-935,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,427.292,432.446,"Well, certiorari from the Missouri Court of Appeals which for this case is the highest court in Missouri."
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,439.25,440.552,"--No, not under our state law."
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,451.542,459.279,"I'm sorry, Mr. Fitzgibbon, did the Missouri Court of Appeals decide the Fourth Amendment claim?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,459.279,461.548,"--Yes, Your Honor, they did."
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,472.773,474.039,And that turned on federal law?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,474.039,481.295,"On federal law, and they so cited the federal rules concerning that in federal cases."
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,481.295,485.264,Couldn't that issue have been taken to the Missouri Supreme Court?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,485.264,486.481,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,486.481,487.814,I see.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,487.814,499.205,I guess you'd have to go back to the Civil Rights Act to find out what the effect was and whether or not collateral estoppel should apply.
1980.79-935,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,632.174,637.01,"Counsel, certainly that issue is here, but straighten me out on one other little detail."
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,640.529,641.179,Right.
1980.79-935,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,641.179,651.003,"And there is a statement in some of the briefs on the other side that Judge Meredith, if it was Judge Meredith, bypassed or failed to pass upon that issue."
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,653.153,667.347,"When we started off this case I asked the court for partial summary judgment on the issue that we're here on today, and the court, I guess inadvertently, granted me full summary judgment, which I really didn't ask for."
1980.79-935,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,670.049,671.834,So that may have to go back?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,671.834,673.251,That... yes; yes.
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.535,676.719,That was remanded by the Court of Appeals?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,676.719,680.272,That was remanded and that issue should be tried.
1980.79-935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,825.167,832.405,Is his damage claim for assault against the officers that he shot or some other officers?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,832.405,848.097,In his motion... he had a cross motion for summary judgment and in that cross motion for summary judgment he identified another police office who he alleges assaulted him while he was lying on the ground with his hands behind his back.
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.453,911.19,What would you say if the state court finding had been the other way and that the evidence was excluded?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,911.19,913.809,If the evidence was excluded--
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.809,929.401,And then this suit were brought against these particular police officers and the plaintiff claimed that the issue had been concluded in the criminal trial and he needn't present any evidence?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,929.401,941.642,"--There is one case which holds, I believe, that the transcript of the testimony in that case could be by stipulation introduced to reach a result."
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.411,953.1,You say that the police officers can use this judgment in the criminal case defensively?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,953.1,953.817,--Right.
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.817,959.604,But you wouldn't say that a plaintiff could use a contrary judgment offensively?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,959.604,965.424,"He could go back, if the issue is decided in his favor, certainly, under 1983."
1980.79-935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.424,967.276,We have different parties then.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,967.276,968.559,It could go in.
1980.79-935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.632,980.351,When the police officers had never had an opportunity to litigate and argue in good faith and so forth?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,981.703,986.488,"--As I understand the question, if it were determined in his favor that the search was unlawful--"
1980.79-935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.488,986.988,Right.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,986.988,992.206,--then he could fully litigate his 1983 claims in the Federal District Court.
1980.79-935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.206,993.206,"Litigate, but could he get summary judgment?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,994.889,995.658,"No, no."
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.097,1009.066,"Well, let's assume that in the criminal trial it was predetermined there was not probable cause."
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1011.684,1014.719,It would be open in a 1983 suit?
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.719,1014.885,Yes.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1014.885,1020.437,"Or he could proceed to trial, in a jury trial against the police officers."
1980.79-935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1022.373,1056.462,"But typically, in your criminal trial, a motion to suppress may be granted notwithstanding the good faith immunity of the officers in a 1983 action, and if there were then, the motion to suppress were granted, wouldn't that be conclusive as to the violation of the constitutional rights in a 1983 action, so that the only matter open would be the good faith of the officers?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1056.462,1077.892,"I think at that time the good faith of the... many times the officers may violate the Constitution inadvertently through lack of knowledge on their part of what the law is, the law is such a morass of rules for the police officer."
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.26,1087.914,All you have to do today is to win on defensive collateral estoppel.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1104.173,1106.559,"Have another bite at the apple, Your Honor."
1980.79-935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.559,1115.831,"--Well, actually, isn't that issue here because isn't it true that the Missouri court did suppress evidence found in the drawer and in a tire?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1115.831,1117.6,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1117.6,1123.671,And suppose they have therefore decided as a matter of collateral estoppel that to that extent there was a violation of Fourth Amendment rights?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1123.671,1133.46,"No, Your Honor, because the whole posture of this particular case was based on a conspiracy of the two officers to conduct an illegal search, the two officers that were shot by this prisoner."
1980.79-935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.46,1138.531,And we have a state court adjudication that there was some violation of the Fourth Amendment rights in this--
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1138.531,1139.38,Not by them.
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.38,1140.463,--Not by them?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1140.463,1141.43,No.
1980.79-935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1153.538,1156.64,The officer who opened the drawer and looked in the tires is not a defendant?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1156.64,1157.556,Is not a defendant.
1980.79-935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1172.833,1180.588,"I know it's really not relevant but I have some problems with your damage theory that you're going to, that they're going to wrestle with if they win; but--"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1180.588,1186.057,"If you're talking about the stuff which was suppressed, it's narcotics."
1980.79-935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1187.409,1197.765,"--I'm trying to understand if it was not suppressed, if they... I would hate to be the trial judge trying to decide how to apportion, how to award damages if you ultimately lose."
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1197.765,1203.05,"--Well, that's another problem that we have."
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1203.05,1210.823,"Mr. Fitzgibbon, no reference is made, is there, in the appellate court's decision to Mincey v. Arizona?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1210.823,1217.06,"In the appellate, in the 8th Circuit, of Mincey v. Arizona?"
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1221.178,1226.665,"I just wonder on the issue of collateral estoppel, because that's intervening law; it's relevant here."
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1231.336,1239.508,"Are you saying that because... well, the Missouri Court of Appeals went into this particular issue and said that--"
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1239.508,1243.544,Doesn't Mincey v. Arizona have some bearing on the resolution of that?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1243.544,1247.746,--The Missouri Court of Appeals ruled on that particular issue--
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1247.746,1249.498,Under Mincey?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1249.498,1250.9,"--And said... yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1250.9,1251.4,"Oh, did it?"
1980.79-935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1251.4,1253.5,Which court of appeals are you referring to now?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1253.5,1257.054,"I'm referring to the Missouri Court of Appeals, not to the 8th Circuit."
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1265.742,1274.931,Do we have that opinion of the... I was under the impression that there was no reference in the Missouri Court of Appeals opinion to the intervening decisions.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1274.931,1279.817,I believe it might be in the petition for certiorari.
1980.79-935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1283.185,1291.775,Did this gentleman demand the return of the narcotics which he said were unlawfully seized?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1291.775,1299.98,"--I think he was only interested in the evidence that was seized and used against him in the particular proceeding, the criminal proceeding."
1980.79-935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1299.98,1307.152,"Ordinarily in Missouri, if the court holds that the contraband was unlawfully seized, do they give it back to him or is it--"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1307.152,1309.436,You can't give marijuana back to somebody.
1980.79-935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1311.854,1313.24,--That's what I was thinking.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1313.24,1322.246,"If you want to get into the issue of what was the street value of the heroin, and that's the question of damages, I don't see how we're going to reach that."
1980.79-935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1322.246,1326.131,It might not impress a jury very much as as an amount of damages.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1326.131,1327.548,I don't think so.
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1327.548,1333.185,"Mr. Fitzgibbon, is this the Missouri Court of Appeals opinion at Appendix C of the petition?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1333.185,1333.985,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1333.985,1337.339,I just looked at it and I don't see any reference to Mincey.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1337.339,1356.233,It's on page... Appendix 16.
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1364.553,1364.787,"Oh, I see."
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1366.322,1367.838,There was a reference made to it.
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1367.838,1368.438,Thank you.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1368.438,1403.578,"I have come to a further conclusion on this case concerning the exclusionary rule, and in Stone v. Powell this Court went into the exclusionary rule and the results concerning this, that there is probably some displeasure with the exclusionary rule because it, I guess it shunts away whether or not a person is guilty or innocent and goes into the evidence, whether or not this evidence was seized legally or illegally."
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.739,1491.053,"Mr. Fitzgibbon, what is... do you think though that what you're urging here is just some federal court policy about collateral estoppel or is it a statutory construction problem under 1983 or what?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1491.053,1508.68,"--I don't think it's a... under 1983 I don't believe that there is any history, that the framers of that particular law and the congressional reports on this show any indication that they wish to abolish collateral estoppel."
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.68,1514.251,"Well, historically, hasn't collateral estoppel required some mutuality or not?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1514.251,1525.976,"I believe the courts have gone further, and mutuality... you mean the mutuality of the same parties and the same issues?"
1980.79-935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1525.976,1526.759,Yes.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1526.759,1528.592,"No, that would be res judicata."
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.4,1554.076,"Let me ask you, do you know what the result would be in the Missouri courts if there was a suit under state law against these officers for illegal search and seizure?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1554.076,1557.694,They could go either way in our state courts.
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.694,1570.252,"Well, would the state courts say that the legality of the search had already been determined in the criminal trial and so dismiss the case on collateral estoppel grounds or not?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1570.252,1571.502,If a full and fair hearing were--
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1571.502,1573.621,Is that the Missouri rule?
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1573.621,1574.454,--Yes.
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.643,1593.201,"So you think that if a 1983 suit were brought in the state courts, the Missouri courts would dismiss the case on collateral estoppel grounds?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1593.201,1594.434,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1594.434,1597.403,If you had no assault element.
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1597.403,1598.003,Right.
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1601.973,1606.258,"Well, your colleague on the other side doesn't agree with that, does he, or not?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1606.258,1607.191,I don't think he does.
1980.79-935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.191,1616.197,"Do you think it makes any difference what Missouri law is in this case, or is it just a question of federal law?"
1980.79-935,0,30372,john_j_fitzgibbon,,1616.197,1622.035,It's a question of collateral estoppel under the common law.
1980.79-935,1,33087,jeffrey_j_shank,,1894.611,1897.813,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-935,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1962.319,1966.123,The District Court in other words granted more than the defendant had asked.
1980.79-935,1,33087,jeffrey_j_shank,,1966.123,1966.89,"--That's correct, sir."
1980.79-935,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2003.313,2008.95,"That was the contraband drugs, is that correct, that were excluded?"
1980.79-935,1,33087,jeffrey_j_shank,,2008.95,2017.74,"Anything that was found in some drawers, in some tires, evidence that was found in plain view."
1980.79-935,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2017.74,2021.008,Were the drugs concealed in spare tires in the car?
1980.79-935,1,33087,jeffrey_j_shank,,2021.008,2022.56,That's my understanding.
1980.79-935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2028.531,2039.421,"Now, as your colleague told us, there's a difference, is there, in the officers involved in the search of the tires and the drawers, the evidence that was suppressed?"
1980.79-935,1,33087,jeffrey_j_shank,,2043.29,2045.325,There was one other officer that was--
1980.79-935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2045.325,2048.36,Were any of these defendants involved in those searches?
1980.79-935,1,33087,jeffrey_j_shank,,2048.36,2049.46,--They would have been involved.
1980.79-935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2061.251,2064.87,Dealing with the suppressed items?
1980.79-935,1,33087,jeffrey_j_shank,,2064.87,2065.487,"--Correct, sir."
1980.79-935,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2092.972,2103.745,Is the alleged conspiracy of the officers a conspiracy by them to find the drugs or to find... or was it--
1980.79-935,1,33087,jeffrey_j_shank,,2103.745,2105.947,To conduct... to conduct the unlawful search.
1980.79-935,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2120.255,2124.659,"--Why was that conviction, why was not cert, sought here?"
1980.79-935,1,33087,jeffrey_j_shank,,2124.659,2125.692,"To this Court, Your Honor?"
1980.79-935,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2125.692,2126.309,Yes.
1980.79-935,1,33087,jeffrey_j_shank,,2126.309,2140.751,"As a practicality of the situation, I believe respondent had retained counsel and had no access to anyone to file the writ other than possibly pro se."
1980.79-935,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2143.553,2144.053,When did this happen?
