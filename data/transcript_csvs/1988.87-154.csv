1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.689,"We'll hear argument now in No. 87-154, Joshua DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,13.49,18.734,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,41.209,43.18,xxx narrow one [inaudible].
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,43.18,45.321,None in those situations--
1988.87-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,45.321,45.661,Oh.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,45.661,46.583,--Justice White.
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,107.441,111.023,You derive all this from the language of the due process clause?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,111.023,112.514,"Indeed, Your Honor."
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.8,289.799,A... a right against the state.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,289.799,294.735,"--And a right that... that arises out of the Constitution to remain alive, yes, sir."
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.735,297.216,"Well, but... but it's protected only against the state."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,299.878,303.891,"Well, I think that's part of what the Court is going to have to address in this case."
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,303.891,315.828,"Well, why don't we start with the language of the Fourteenth Amendment which says that a state shall not... what does it state... deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,315.828,316.186,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,316.186,330.746,"Now, certainly we've held in many cases that the state may not deprive someone of life, but we've never held that that provision protects in the constitutional sense a private... a private attack on another person."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,330.746,333.259,"I agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,401.073,406.817,But... but the rights of the parent are recognized to the extent that the state may not interfere with it.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,406.817,408.758,--I think that's entirely true.
1988.87-154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,409.609,419.744,And the... and the question here is the extent to which you impose a mandatory duty on the state to act affirmatively to protect the child.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,419.744,421.036,"--That's right, Justice--"
1988.87-154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,421.036,426.94,And the fact that it's... that other cases are not workable seems to me not the point.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,428.682,442.992,"--Well, it occurs to me that you derive the duty first and foremost from the nature of the... of the relationship that you're... that you're analyzing in a... in a constitutional setting, and secondly, from the fact that the Constitution does admittedly apply in that relationship."
1988.87-154,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,442.992,465.465,"Well, the only... the only cases in which the Court has found an affirmative duty on the part of the state to provide basic services is in a setting like a prison or a state institution where the state has already deprived the individual of the individual's liberty and institutionalized them."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,465.465,466.817,"Justice O'Connor, I... I generally--"
1988.87-154,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.817,470.681,This is certainly a step far beyond that that you're asking us to take.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,470.681,474.153,"--The only word I would... I would differ with you is... is the word ""far""."
1988.87-154,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,513.488,522.824,"If... if your theory were to be accepted, it seems to me it would have a real deterrent effect on state child abuse programs."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,536.722,542.105,"If... if the circumstance were as you... as you phrased it, Justice O'Connor, I would agree."
1988.87-154,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,652.598,662.796,"Well, Mr. Sullivan, don't you have to persuade us that the child has an entitlement under Wisconsin law?"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,662.796,668.559,"--Well, I... I think first I have to persuade you that the child has an entitlement and the--"
1988.87-154,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,668.559,670.921,What... what's your argument that he does?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,670.921,671.642,"--Well, there are two."
1988.87-154,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,683.66,686.973,You mean from that arises an entitlement?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,686.973,695.097,--I feel that from that arises an entitlement in the extreme and only in the extreme circumstance that I posit to the Court.
1988.87-154,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,695.097,697.31,Has a Wisconsin court said that it--
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,697.31,699.851,The Wisconsin standard is mere negligence.
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,710.909,711.43,--Yes.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,711.43,713.609,--that the child has an entitlement under Wisconsin law.
1988.87-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,722.957,727.15,"Mr. Sullivan, let me put it another way."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,730.08,730.871,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,730.871,738.176,"And the state placed him in a position of extreme danger, did it not?"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,738.176,739.916,"Eventually they did, yes, sir."
1988.87-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,741.108,748.422,"Well, they put him in... not eventually, but they put him in a position of extreme danger."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,749.664,753.517,"--When they... when they unilaterally returned him to the abusive father, yes, sir."
1988.87-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,753.517,764.534,"Now, suppose the... the state or the county, municipality knew that it was putting the child... placing the child in a situation of extreme danger."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,768.678,770.247,"No, Your Honor."
1988.87-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,774.7,776.471,"Well, I wonder why you don't argue it."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,776.471,778.003,"Well, I did--"
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,778.003,778.321,I haven't heard you--
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,778.321,785.557,"--I did in my pleadings, but I... I would... I would remind the Court that one of the... and we addressed it three or four or five times in our brief."
1988.87-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,800.708,802.048,--That she knew--
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,802.048,803.099,I understand it that way.
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,803.099,803.69,--or should have known.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,803.69,804.851,"I understand it that way, yes, sir."
1988.87-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,805.422,807.544,And in... in effect admitted that she knew--
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,807.544,808.515,"--Yes, sir."
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.515,808.886,--or should have known.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,808.886,810.973,That was... that's how I understand that... that language.
1988.87-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,810.973,815.418,"Well, that's the way I parse your case, and maybe it is a step ahead."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,819.281,820.04,Yes.
1988.87-154,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.051,916.493,Did they at that point commit a constitutional violation?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,923.827,926.268,I think that's right.
1988.87-154,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.268,929.901,And why... why was that a constitutional violation to return the child at that time?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,929.901,934.065,"I'm not prepared to say that that was, but I am prepared to say that the next incident was."
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.897,940.259,But they didn't... the child had already been placed by then.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,940.259,947.145,--They took the child out and placed the child in the technical custody of the hospital during his period of hospital confinement.
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.162,948.114,That's January of 1983.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,948.114,949.185,"Yes, sir, which is the--"
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.185,949.995,All right.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,956.038,962.813,--I think it was the very next contact they had with the child and each succeeding contact--
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.813,964.125,"Well, in the very next one then you say it did occur."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,966.346,987.761,"--At that point... and by way of background information so that we're clear on this, if I may, Justice Stevens... the... when the case worker made the decision to return the child... and this is in the record at 159 and 160... she dismissed the protective proceeding that they had started, and--"
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.761,988.74,Was that a constitutional violation?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,988.74,989.712,--I don't think so.
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.322,994.553,I want to get to the constitutional violation and when it occurred.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,994.553,995.645,--All right.
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.521,1056.203,"But just summarizing, what you're saying is it's... she got sufficient information on that occasion that she had a constitutional duty to remove the child."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1058.296,1059.065,On the... on the ensuing occasion?
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.065,1059.546,Yes.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1060.297,1060.828,"Yes, yes."
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.828,1071.785,"So, your theory is not that the state placed the child in a position of extreme danger, but rather that the state failed to remove the child from a position that they should have known was extremely dangerous."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1071.785,1072.135,Subsequently.
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.139,1085.973,Would your case be any different if you had none of this history but a very stupid social worker who went in and saw lots of evidence of child abuse and failed to remove the child from the home immediately?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1085.973,1090.386,"--It's a... it's a question of the level of... of... and that's why I'm using the word ""enmeshment""."
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1090.386,1091.027,"Well, I know."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1093.75,1094.16,Okay.
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1096.832,1105.717,"My question is if you just have those stark facts, a social worker visits a home, sees the child that a reasonable social worker should have known was in extreme danger--"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1105.717,1106.467,--Yes.
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.467,1110.179,"--and fails to remove the child, has the state committed a constitutional violation?"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1110.179,1112.761,"In an appropriate fact setting, yes, I believe so."
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1112.761,1113.131,"Well, I've given you the facts."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1114.073,1119.094,"If we... to... to... to illustrate what I think your question is, if on the very first occasion--"
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1119.094,1119.645,That's right.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1119.645,1132.405,"--maybe even by accident, stopping to use the phone, no official business, and the... and a case worker finds the... the parent holding a knife to the throat of a toddler, I would say that obligation arises at that point."
1988.87-154,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.207,1140.54,"Now, how do you... how do you place within the words of the Fourteenth Amendment again?"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1144.633,1146.073,It is the state alone--
1988.87-154,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1146.073,1153.129,"--You see I can... I can understand it's depriving the child of something when the child is safe with the state and the state turns it back, which happened here."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1160.262,1161.213,--Well--
1988.87-154,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1161.213,1170.6,But I don't understand how the state is depriving the child of anything when... when the child is already in the home and all the state has done is failed to take the child out of the home.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1170.6,1176.214,"--Well, that's the... that's the final argument in the Seventh Circuit's opinion that all we did was not stop it."
1988.87-154,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1187.39,1191.974,"That's... that's not... well, I... I could think of a lot of cases."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1204.884,1205.463,Right.
1988.87-154,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.463,1207.816,"But there is, of course, all shades of evidence."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1209.205,1209.515,That's correct.
1988.87-154,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.515,1214.518,"It's pretty serious, but you say the evidence is clear enough so that the constitutional duty arose to remove the child."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1214.518,1216.151,"I think the evidence... and, yes, I do."
1988.87-154,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.003,1262.179,"What is magical about the fact that the citizen, here the child, is in threat from... from his father rather than from someone else?"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1278.602,1287.208,"To the... to the best of my knowledge, in the first place the Constitution does not intrude into each individual life in the sense of an obligation to provide food, shelter, clothing."
1988.87-154,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1300.585,1302.806,--How... how is the Constitution interposed there?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1307.741,1314.544,"--It's interposed, more precisely, when the... when the state says we suspect there might be a problem for this child."
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1346.335,1349.077,But that's a... that's a limitation on the state... those cases.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1356.231,1365.748,"--I... I think that the procedural things, Mr. Chief Justice, clearly are... are limitations on... on the mechanics by which you can effect a termination."
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1365.748,1367.09,"Well, no doubt."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1376.115,1380.379,"Well, if we've recognized... and... and manifestly--"
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1380.379,1381.35,Can you answer that question?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1381.35,1382.67,"--Well, I... I hope so."
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.451,1384.052,Why don't you try?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1384.052,1385.081,--Okay.
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1396.511,1402.843,That has nothing to do with the limitations on the state's authority to take the child away from the parent.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1402.843,1403.604,--No.
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1405.226,1407.837,I thought... but I thought that was the basis of your argument.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1407.837,1415.311,"--Well, what I'm saying is that we recognize that the Constitution has a legitimate place in the relationship between the parent and the child."
1988.87-154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1430.542,1430.952,xxx.

1988.87-154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1452.787,1456.518,But there is a constitutional obligation I would assume not to arbitrarily take it away.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1456.518,1457.57,Yes.
1988.87-154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1457.57,1458.281,All right.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1458.929,1459.7,That's a--
1988.87-154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1459.7,1465.715,"--So, the Constitution is in the house with the elderly woman just as it's in the house... just in the same sense that it's in the house with the parent and the child."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1465.715,1469.808,--I... I'm not sure I follow your question or... or I'm seeing it very differently.
1988.87-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1486.859,1494.493,Do you think it makes any difference what agent of the state finds outs that this child is in danger from his father?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1506.11,1506.861,Yes.
1988.87-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1515.557,1522.181,"So, it has to be a certain kind of a... of a state agent who has a duty under state law or not?"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1522.181,1523.333,--I think that would be correct.
1988.87-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.126,1536.463,"Well, isn't it a state law... isn't it a state law issue here then as to... do you... do you suggest that this social worker was violating state law when she--"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1536.463,1538.683,"In addition, yes... yes, sir, we do because of--"
1988.87-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.683,1541.104,--Is there any... do you have some Wyoming cases for that?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1543.364,1544.516,--I'm... I'm a citizen of Wyoming.
1988.87-154,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.516,1546.356,"I know you're from Cheyenne, aren't you?"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1546.356,1546.737,"Yes, sir."
1988.87-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1548.409,1553.823,"Well, Mr. Sullivan, aren't there any Wisconsin tort remedies assuming you're right--"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1553.823,1554.644,--There clearly are.
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1554.644,1555.022,--Hmm?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1555.022,1557.526,There clearly are state tort remedies.
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1557.526,1558.496,"Well, what are they?"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1558.496,1559.817,A negligence--
1988.87-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1559.817,1562.459,"If they're... if they're adequate, isn't that the end of your claim?"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1562.459,1565.501,--I think it would be as to the property interest claim.
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1577.699,1579.89,Did you argue that in the lower courts?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1582.09,1583.983,"No, it wasn't addressed, Mr. Chief Justice, at--"
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.983,1587.236,You... you didn't argue the Roth entitlement in the lower courts.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1587.236,1587.636,--No.
1988.87-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1595.921,1600.042,"Now, is... there's a limitation of some amount, isn't there, on a--"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1600.042,1600.603,There is--
1988.87-154,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1600.603,1601.374,--State tort remedy?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1601.374,1601.885,--There is--
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.885,1602.455,Fifty thousand dollars?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1602.455,1602.533,--Yes.
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.12,1629.143,How can we be confident that this social worker violated state law?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1629.143,1633.675,"--Well, you have the record before you which reflects that on countless occasions--"
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1633.675,1634.186,I know.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1639.689,1647.453,"--The statute says by its terms when you get notice of evidence of child abuse, you shall make a fresh, de novo investigation--"
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1647.453,1647.974,All right.
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1647.974,1651.096,--promptly and you shall intervene as appropriate.
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1656.089,1659.251,Do you have some... do you have some case in... in Wisconsin that--
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1659.251,1662.674,--This is the only circumstance we've been able to find in Wisconsin where this has occurred.
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1664.086,1664.975,--[inaudible].
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1664.975,1674.601,"But the fact is that if... if the... if the rule says that when the members of the court come in, I have to stand up, it's a simple matter of whether I stood up or not."
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.097,1684.408,"Well, do you think it was intentional?"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1684.408,1685.498,--In the sense that the--
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.498,1686.98,Or was it just negligent?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1686.98,1687.611,--No.
1988.87-154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1699.539,1701.632,Was that... was that just a negligent omission or what?
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1701.632,1702.072,No.
1988.87-154,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1711.618,1720.332,"Wasn't it just a failure to realize that... that a breach of duty was involved, a negligent failure to know... know her duty?"
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1720.332,1732.421,"--If we didn't have the factual setting in the record of... of the lady saying to people she believes on a current basis the child is being abused and saying later I believed the child was going to die, that might be the case."
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1741.98,1743.861,"Very well, Mr. Sullivan."
1988.87-154,0,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,1743.861,1744.212,Thank you.
1988.87-154,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1744.212,1745.691,"Mr. Mingo, we'll hear now from you."
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,1745.691,1756.39,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1845.017,1850.651,"The lower courts didn't reach any of those issues, did they, because they found there was no constitutional duty?"
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,1850.651,1851.82,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-154,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1922.239,1929.742,"Mr. Mingo, if this child had been in foster care placed by the state or the county, would there be potential liability?"
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,1929.742,1950.556,"Justice O'Connor, in that instance, we believe there may well be potential liability because in that case we have, at least arguably, state action in the sense that the state took a child out of his natural surroundings, arguably put him in state-controlled surroundings and thereby increased the risk of harm to that child."
1988.87-154,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1962.144,1966.367,What... I... I'm sure Justice Stevens is going to ask the same question.
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,1975.353,1980.685,In January of 1983--
1988.87-154,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1980.685,1982.906,Because they had custody of the child for a few days.
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,1982.906,2001.169,"--the hospital had custody of the child because of the fact that the juvenile court... not the social workers, not the Department of Social Services, but Wisconsin juvenile court... through its intake worker placed the child in the temporary custody of a hospital."
1988.87-154,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2001.169,2001.62,All right.
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2012.926,2033.831,"Although that is certainly not the case before this Court, in that instance, I believe from a constitutional standpoint only a county or a department of social services could return the child without facing constitutional liability."
1988.87-154,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.831,2039.204,Even with knowledge that there's... even with knowledge of extreme danger and almost certain serious abuse of this kind?
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2039.204,2041.686,"Even with that knowledge, Your Honor."
1988.87-154,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2041.686,2045.98,"Well, why is that different then from the foster home case that Justice O'Connor asked you about?"
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2045.98,2057.269,"In the foster home setting, we have the state taking a child away from his natural surroundings, putting him in another set of surroundings, which are state controlled, state operated--"
1988.87-154,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.269,2059.03,That's exactly what happened here.
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2059.03,2061.871,"--No, that's quite different from what happened here."
1988.87-154,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.432,2082.715,"No, but during those three days, the child was in the custody of the state, wasn't it?"
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2082.715,2083.146,--No.
1988.87-154,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2084.866,2086.949,Who owned... who operated the hospital?
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2086.949,2089.991,"As far as I know, it was a public hospital."
1988.87-154,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.023,2094.924,But... but who had custody?
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2098.507,2101.698,The agency I believe definitely did not have custody of the child.
1988.87-154,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2134.37,2136.871,And the statute required whom to... to return the child?
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2136.871,2137.402,--Pardon me?
1988.87-154,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2137.402,2140.004,Who was it that had the duty to return the child?
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2140.004,2151.52,"Wisconsin's statutes say that the juvenile court... not the social worker, but that the juvenile court must return the child to the home in the event a petition is not filed within 72 hours."
1988.87-154,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2151.52,2152.449,All right.
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2164.478,2171.373,"Even though we may have the requisite state of mind, Your Honor, present in that case, I do not believe--"
1988.87-154,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2171.373,2172.264,xxx state action too.
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2172.264,2192.527,"--I don't believe in that instance we would have state action because we have not done anything to increase the risk of harm to that child, whereas in Justice O'Connor's example, we certainly can be said to have increased the risk of harm to the child because we took that child away from his or her natural surroundings and put that child into an arguably more dangerous set of surroundings."
1988.87-154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2194.818,2200.642,"What if you don't give it back to the father, but you give it back to... to the wrong person?"
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2215.945,2222.748,"Justice Scalia, I believe in that set of circumstances there well may be liable... liability because we have state action--"
1988.87-154,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.748,2229.363,"So, what you're saying is what makes a difference is whether you're just returning him to the status he was in before you took over the temporary custody."
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2230.585,2240.6,--I believe that the important factor to be looked at is whether or not the state action can fairly be said to have increased the risk of harm to that child.
1988.87-154,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.644,2247.886,Increased it from what?
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2252.338,2256.191,From what it was before the state interjected and took custody.
1988.87-154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2256.191,2261.564,"Well, you were just returning it to the person who had the legal right to custody."
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2261.564,2263.307,That's correct.
1988.87-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2269.48,2272.781,Which is more important than the abuse to poor Joshua?
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2272.781,2280.476,"--We're not saying it's more important, but the parents certainly have a constitutionally protected right which must be observed by the social worker."
1988.87-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.476,2282.176,Poor Joshua.
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2294.265,2299.0,"If there was any malfeasance, that certainly would be an argument."
1988.87-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2322.795,2325.437,"Well, except the social worker."
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2325.437,2334.821,I'm now talking about the January 22 incident where the state arguably took custody or custody was placed with... with the hospital.
1988.87-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.58,2396.961,"Well, Mr.... Mr. Mingo, I wonder if you wouldn't be better advised to use the term ""constitutional duty"" rather than state action."
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2413.113,2414.944,"Yes, Your Honor, you're quite correct."
1988.87-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.381,2437.361,"And under your theory, I take it if two policemen see a rape and watch it just for their own amusement, no violation of the Constitution."
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2437.361,2444.733,We would concede that there is no constitutional violation in that particular case.
1988.87-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2444.733,2446.996,You're not... you're arguing it as well as conceding it.
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2447.395,2448.426,That's correct.
1988.87-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2572.678,2577.771,"Mr. Mingo, under Wisconsin law, does Joshua have a cause of action against his father?"
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2577.771,2584.456,He certainly would have a cause of action against his father.
1988.87-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2586.376,2591.612,No... no barrier between child/parent relationship?
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2591.612,2596.316,--That... that immunity was done away in Wisconsin some 10 or 15 years ago.
1988.87-154,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2796.432,2806.78,You... I take it you don't agree with your colleague on the other side that the social worker was... was disregarding her duty under state law?
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2806.78,2811.695,"--We certainly do not agree with that position, and we believe the record is quite clear."
1988.87-154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2845.126,2849.489,"Yes, but there was further information received by the social worker, wasn't there?"
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2849.489,2854.933,There was information in the sense that the social worker suspected that there might be abuse.
1988.87-154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2854.933,2858.054,And the... wasn't there visits after that?
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2858.054,2859.295,By the social worker?
1988.87-154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2862.867,2865.209,"Well, that's better... that's better than having a written report I suppose."
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2865.209,2870.023,"In fact, those were tantamount to informal investigations."
1988.87-154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2875.897,2891.745,"Well, but the submission... the submission is that the social worker knew enough that under state law it was her duty to take the child out of the house or do something to... to remove the child from that position of danger."
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2893.678,2894.429,We do disagree with that.
1988.87-154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2905.646,2906.908,"Well, what... what was the purpose of investigating?"
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2911.741,2932.473,"The law doesn't say that, but I believe the law probably presupposes that if there is an investigation and that investigation reveals probable cause to believe that there was child abuse, that that information will be relayed to, in this instance, the Corporation Council who will then file a petition in juvenile court."
1988.87-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2932.473,2933.304,In Wisconsin--
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2941.931,2944.421,The only formal investigation--
1988.87-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2944.421,2945.934,"Well, what is the difference?"
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2945.934,2950.258,--A formal investigation is an investigation triggered by the statute.
1988.87-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2956.179,2959.381,"Well, what's the difference in what the social worker does?"
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2959.381,2969.569,"Again, the... a formal investigation is any investigation triggered by the statute, 48... Section 48.981."
1988.87-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2969.569,2972.511,"So, there's no difference between a formal and an informal one."
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2974.051,2975.934,I don't believe that is correct.
1988.87-154,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2975.934,2977.784,"Well, what is the difference?"
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,2981.157,2991.933,"The only way I can answer that question, Justice Marshall, is to tell you that a formal investigation is one that's triggered by a statute."
1988.87-154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3000.889,3010.566,"So, you really are drawing the distinction between a formal report and an informal investigation."
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,3018.259,3022.834,That's not the basis of our... our... our position is.
1988.87-154,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3022.834,3024.654,I thought that's just what you've been arguing.
1988.87-154,1,36346,mark_j_mingo,,3024.654,3031.52,What I've been attempting to argue is that a formal report is required to trigger an investigation.
1988.87-154,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3041.644,3043.076,"Thank you, Mr. Mingo."
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3045.257,3054.053,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-154,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3302.829,3317.419,"What if a police officer responding to a complaint of a neighbor goes into a house and sees a father beating up his son and the officer just says, well, I guess the son deserves it and just watches as the beating goes on?"
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3324.062,3324.603,--I don't--
1988.87-154,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3324.603,3325.344,--[inaudible] on the state?
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3325.344,3328.907,--I don't think that there is going to... I think the answer is probably no.
1988.87-154,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.596,3351.029,But protection is never one of the... one of the things that the Constitution would require the state to furnish.
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3351.029,3352.702,I don't... I don't think it is.
1988.87-154,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3362.567,3376.298,And even if the... even if the state law put... put the affirmative duty on the officer or the social worker to remove the child or stop the abuse if it occurs in their very presence.
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3376.298,3383.701,"Well, it might be possible to write a statute in a way that created a procedural due process interest."
1988.87-154,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.485,3405.136,We're just talking here about whether there's a federal cause of action.
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3405.897,3406.308,Absolutely.
1988.87-154,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3406.308,3412.252,--I presume that there would be a state cause of action against the officer in those circumstances if he had a duty to act and didn't.
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3412.252,3414.323,"Well, in most cases, I would think there would be."
1988.87-154,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3427.001,3437.036,"Well, my only purpose of asking the question is that I... I take it that... that you had to answer that way and... but also it makes irrelevant how much the social worker knew."
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3437.036,3442.459,"Well, I... I think that's right unless you... unless you are--"
1988.87-154,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3442.459,3452.517,"Yes, and if... but if we... if we decide... if we... if we decide for the state, it... it really does mean that it's irrelevant how... how much the social worker knew or--"
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3452.517,3453.358,--That's correct.
1988.87-154,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3453.358,3455.629,--how much of a duty she had under state law or anything else.
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3455.629,3461.252,That's correct unless you are thinking of going down the... the Roth line of argument which I think is... is--
1988.87-154,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3461.252,3461.743,Well--
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3470.989,3472.509,"--Well, there... there's a duty--"
1988.87-154,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3472.509,3473.941,--even though there is a duty to provide equal protection of the law.
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3473.941,3474.201,--That's right.
1988.87-154,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3536.662,3538.061,What about giving him back to his father?
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3541.344,3543.056,xxx the case?
1988.87-154,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3543.056,3548.149,"If the state had... well, let's assume the state had a lot of knowledge at the time the child was returned to his father."
1988.87-154,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3551.662,3559.677,"Well, I... I... I would think not and the reason would be that the removal in this case was a temporary removal for specific purposes."
1988.87-154,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3594.64,3595.231,"--Thank you, Mr. Ayer."
1988.87-154,3,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,3597.592,3600.304,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-154,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3600.304,3606.137,"Mr. Sullivan, do you rely on due process or equal protection?"
1988.87-154,3,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,3606.137,3607.169,"Due process, Your Honor."
1988.87-154,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3607.169,3608.24,Due process?
1988.87-154,3,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,3608.24,3609.84,We... we posed this case in terms of--
1988.87-154,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3609.84,3610.261,All right.
1988.87-154,3,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,3613.103,3614.174,--I'm sorry.
1988.87-154,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3614.672,3619.477,--What denial of due process is it that you deny... that you object to?
1988.87-154,3,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,3619.477,3629.021,"We feel there... there are two: one, the... what we see to be a... a substantive due process right inherent in the balancing of the constitutional involvement in the child/parent relationship."
1988.87-154,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3629.021,3631.354,"Well, what facts do you object to?"
1988.87-154,3,21583,donald_james_sullivan,,3632.493,3659.541,"We object to the fact that the... the county agency and its personnel knowing and believing that the child was probably going to die or at least be seriously, as he turned out to be, profoundly injured and knowing that he was in immediate need of medical care for lifesaving purposes, nonetheless, despite its power, its exclusive power, refused to help the child."
1988.87-154,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3670.981,3671.892,"Thank you, Mr. Sullivan."
