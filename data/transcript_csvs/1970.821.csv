1970.821,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3161.057,3162.907,You agree with him?
1970.821,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3162.907,3164.319,Yes I do.

1970.821,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3309.952,3329.898,"Well, I think Mr. Justice that the equities relating for the situation of the individual firms in this situation must be bounced against the demands of the public interest in restoring effective competition here and I think that in this situation, it is appropriate to divest."
1970.821,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3420.818,3429.868,"There is nothing very remarkable though about this rule into the Deep South by expanding industry, is there?"
