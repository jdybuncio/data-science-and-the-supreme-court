2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-1456, Cuellar versus United States."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,10.072,21.096,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1956, the money laundering statute, requires an intent to minimize the criminal taint of unlawful proceeds."
2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,47.497,49.431,"Well, he certainly concealed the location."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,58.187,62.156,"Chief Justice, in the broader sense location was concealed."
2007.06-1456,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,113.922,118.024,Maybe I should ask you this now because you've probably thought about it and I can't work it out.
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,129.948,130.417,"Yes, Justice--"
2007.06-1456,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,130.417,137.371,"And if you read it that literally, then there is no problem in getting to your interpretation of the statute, or is there?"
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,143.041,144.325,"--No, Justice Breyer; you're correct."
2007.06-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,170.525,174.077,"May I just ask, what do you mean by method of transportation in this case?"
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,181.581,194.389,"Justice Stevens, what I'm referring to is certainly that it was in a car, but there was a secret compartment, goat hair was sprinkled around to try to throw off drug detection dogs, and those type of characteristics."
2007.06-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,194.389,200.025,But isn't that all just evidence that there was a motive to conceal the ownership?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,200.025,202.494,"No, I don't think so, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-1456,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,238.167,248.456,If he were a courier bringing the marijuana into the United States what would be the crime and the penalty?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,248.456,250.641,"Justice, if he was bringing--"
2007.06-1456,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,250.641,256.295,If he was bringing marijuana into the United States instead of returning with the proceeds?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,256.295,260.414,"--Well, presumably, Your Honor, it would be a drug trafficking crime."
2007.06-1456,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,265.818,268.303,But now he possesses money.
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,278.225,286.148,"We have suggested that Mr. Cuellar's, liability, liability or culpability, lie more properly under the bulk cash smuggling statute."
2007.06-1456,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,286.148,303.608,"But that requires knowing that it's illegal to take out more than X amount of money, and there's nothing that indicates that the common courier would know anything about such a provision."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,303.608,308.827,"Yes, you're correct that it would require inference as opposed to direct evidence."
2007.06-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,330.843,338.714,If we take it that you concede... I don't want to say that you concede.
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,362.046,363.314,"No, I don't think--"
2007.06-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,363.314,366.616,I know the government didn't indict under (ii).
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,366.616,373.87,"--But I don't think it is the same, Your Honor, because the cash smuggling, the bulk cash smuggling statute, speaks to currency and of course this speaks to transactions."
2007.06-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,375.656,378.674,You mean as the proceeds of an illegal transaction?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,378.674,389.03,"--Well, I'm distinguishing between currency and transaction because as I understand it at least transaction might implicate in a banking context, but cash is cash, if you will."
2007.06-1456,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,389.798,396.119,And it doesn't matter for purposes of the bulk cash statute that it was illegal.
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,398.404,400.354,"--Yes, Your Honor, absolutely."
2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,400.954,407.593,But why... why isn't this transporting to conceal the location or the ownership in this sense?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,429.69,438.812,"As I understand it, Mr. Chief Justice, if the police are aware of it and then the flush, if you will, takes the money across, I think that's... that's much closer."
2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,439.146,447.135,"Well, they think it's there, but they're not sure, and they... you know, that would help them make their case, to find out that the guy they think sold the drugs has $80,000."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,454.905,479.187,"--I would... no, I think that the... if the police were aware, if the police were aware and the kingpin were aware and put in place some type of design, if you will, to flush the money and perhaps to... to Mexico under the circumstances you described, then you would be closer to, to having money laundering liability, although certainly I don't know that the courier necessarily would."
2007.06-1456,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,515.195,519.746,I still don't see why isn't what the Chief Justice said absolutely right?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,529.287,529.703,--I--
2007.06-1456,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,529.703,535.776,"If you're transporting it simply to pay some courier somewhere else, you're not transporting it to conceal it."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,547.165,547.667,--I think that--
2007.06-1456,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,547.667,549.384,What is wrong with that?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,549.384,566.062,"--I think what's wrong, Your Honor, is that the... the statute focuses on the transportation or some of the other transfers of transmission and specifically is coupled, if you will, with this notion of... of the attributes themselves."
2007.06-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.668,583.174,"I... maybe I don't understand the... I thought he was helping you, but maybe...--"
2007.06-1456,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,585.79,602.652,"It sounds like he was making the distinction that didn't the dissenting judge make between... the dissenting judge says transporting to conceal is no good, but concealing to transport is okay."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,602.652,608.136,"That... you're correct, Your Honor, and that is, I think, a point to be made."
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,616.775,650.898,"Suppose someone transports money across a border and is recorded surreptitiously on tape explaining exactly why the person did it, and the person says: The reason why I'm transporting this across the border is because I know that when I get it to the destination country, that's a place where people use huge amounts of cash for bank deposits, for purchases; and, therefore the act of transporting it from the United States to the other country will disguise the nature of the cash as drug money."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,652.765,665.225,"No, I don't think so, Justice Alito, and the reason I don't is because that... what you've described implicates potential money spending, this notion that the money is easier spent."
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,669.494,672.946,Why wouldn't that fit the literal language of the statute?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,681.502,684.354,"--I'm not sure, Justice, that you've actually concealed the nature."
2007.06-1456,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,690.673,700.065,"Yes, but it doesn't remain dirty simply because it goes to a place in which the appearance of this kind of cash does not have the dirty appearance that it does at home."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,705.969,706.302,--I--
2007.06-1456,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,706.302,708.921,Why doesn't that make it laundering?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,708.921,718.46,"--Again, I don't know that there has been... as I understood the hypothetical, I don't think that there's been any suggestion of a design to conceal, the why."
2007.06-1456,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,719.877,748.712,"No, but the design to conceal... maybe I misunderstood the hypo, but I thought the design to conceal was you conceal the dirty character of the money by taking it to a place and using it in that place where use of large amounts of cash, whether for bank deposits or spending in luxury stores, does not have the dirty implication, the dirty appearance that it does in the United States."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,752.598,757.585,"--I... Justice Souter, I think that the answer to the question is here."
2007.06-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.483,785.502,"You don't have any evidence like that here anyway, do we?"
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,793.608,802.547,"--Justice Scalia, what we know, because the government's evidence established it, is that the money was being sent back to Mexico to repay--"
2007.06-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,802.547,804.78,Does everybody have a lot of money in Mexico?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,806.582,810.467,"--Well, I would hazard to say no, of course, but the record--"
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,810.467,815.271,Was there... was there evidence about the nature of the Mexican economy?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,815.271,815.604,--There was.
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,816.787,818.306,What was the evidence?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,818.306,818.639,I'm sorry?
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,818.639,820.175,What was the evidence?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,820.175,826.495,The evidence that you just asked about went to that it was easier to spend money in Mexico.
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,826.495,830.381,Wasn't there an expert who said that Mexico has a cash economy?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,830.381,832.149,"Yes, yes."
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,832.933,834.483,And what does that mean?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,834.483,836.201,--What I take it to mean--
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,836.201,839.82,Does it mean people can spend a lot of cash without raising eyebrows?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,839.82,841.172,--Certainly more than here.
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,855.412,861.4,"In your brief, you argue that there has to be a design to create the appearance of legitimate wealth."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,864.335,870.774,"No, and, of course, we are well aware that those words are not found in the statute, nor do we suggest that they were."
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,884.282,885.368,"Well, why would that be so?"
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,907.114,909.733,"Well, at that point, yes, because I think--"
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,909.733,914.637,"But there wouldn't be an attempt to create the appearance of legitimate wealth there then, would there?"
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,914.637,921.557,"--Well, to the extent that the individual who has been taped is contemplating the money's resurfacing, I think that there would be."
2007.06-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.268,944.389,--Does the statutory purpose have to be the only purpose or the principal purpose?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,979.912,981.862,"If we... well, Justice Scalia, if we--"
2007.06-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.862,984.231,If you assume a primary purpose to pay off the--
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,984.231,985.097,--Right.
2007.06-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1000.69,1006.175,"--Even though that wasn't the real purpose... I mean, the real purpose was to pay off this fellow, who otherwise might come to hurt you."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1006.175,1007.344,"Yes, absolutely."
2007.06-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1007.344,1012.58,"But once you do pay him off, you know that the money is going to be ready spendable."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1012.58,1019.834,"Well, certainly in this case, we don't have any evidence that Mr. Cuellar knew any such thing."
2007.06-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.392,1035.694,"Now, what you understand the language"
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1049.854,1051.456,"No, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1058.909,1060.744,"Well, that's what it seems to say."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1063.346,1073.802,"--Well, what I think it means is that there has to be some... the transportation or what have you has to be purposed, designed, to take the nature and obfuscate it."
2007.06-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1074.488,1078.19,"But I'm just asking about the word... the meaning of the word ""nature""."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1083.51,1092.833,"--That it would... I think that it would... ""nature"" is perhaps the first and foremost of the attributes, but I think that it means, that it means dirty, unclean."
2007.06-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1092.833,1097.584,"""Dirty"" in some sense other than being proceeds of specified unlawful activity?"
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1097.584,1099.853,"Oh, okay."
2007.06-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.305,1105.923,I just don't know what that means other than that it is proceeds of unlawful--
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1105.923,1109.392,When I have... when I read the attributes and contemplate--
2007.06-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1109.392,1111.077,"--I'm just talking about the one attribute, ""nature""."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1111.077,1111.377,--Right.
2007.06-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.377,1113.046,I'm trying to understand what you think that means.
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1113.046,1117.565,I have thought of it as meaning basically dirty.
2007.06-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1117.565,1119.533,Proceeds of unlawful activity.
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1119.533,1121.217,Proceeds of unlawful activity are the--
2007.06-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.217,1123.319,It's always dirty.
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1123.319,1125.354,"--There may be... well, yes, I see where you're going."
2007.06-1456,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1130.908,1139.93,Why isn't it simply to change the nature from being drug money to look like it's apparently innocent?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1158.275,1160.76,--I don't... I brook no quarrel with that.
2007.06-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1163.296,1165.079,"But the verb is not ""transformed""."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1168.331,1178.555,"--That's true, and the meaning certainly of ""conceal"" would be to bring it forward with maybe no explanation of the taint, if you will."
2007.06-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1185.192,1191.196,Was there a reporting requirement for... for this shipment.
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1202.521,1206.473,--To avoid a transaction reporting--
2007.06-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1206.473,1210.277,"To avoid a transaction reporting requirement, and you wouldn't have to go through all this ""nature"" thing."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1210.277,1216.181,"--Your Honor, as I understand it he would have a currency reporting requirement, had he been going South."
2007.06-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1216.181,1218.547,You indicated that there is such a requirement.
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1218.547,1220.649,"A currency reporting requirement, yes."
2007.06-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1224.635,1225.703,"Oh, I see."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1225.703,1227.687,--may implicate different considerations.
2007.06-1456,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1227.687,1236.575,"And if he... if he didn't know about the currency reporting requirement, then he's not guilty under that statute because it requires knowledge."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1236.575,1239.796,"Yes, Your Honor, I understand."
2007.06-1456,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1253.304,1261.893,"If he's not... if he doesn't fit into either category, then there's no crime?"
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1261.893,1265.428,"That's a possibility, yes, absolutely."
2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1265.428,1270.016,"Counsel, can I ask you to go back to Justice Stevens's line of questioning?"
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1276.485,1290.745,"No, and I think that... Mr. Chief Justice, I think that it's important to understand, for example, that hiding money is not necessarily the same thing as... I mean, concealing money is not necessarily the same thing as concealing the location."
2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1294.514,1295.966,"Well, that... that doesn't seem to follow."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1305.505,1306.022,--Yes.
2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1311.976,1314.527,"Well, that gets me to a question."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1321.198,1333.322,"--What I'm suggesting, Chief Justice, is that if the... that the statute would have a particularly different meaning from the one that the government wants if the attributes just listed existence of the money."
2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1346.396,1349.046,"Well, you better explain that a little more for me."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1349.046,1350.412,"All right, then."
2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1350.762,1351.329,Because they seem to me the same.
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1351.329,1351.998,--If I... no.
2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1374.677,1377.763,"Okay, so hiding location assumes it's going to come up later."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1377.763,1378.196,--Yes.
2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1378.196,1381.517,"And if you just hide the money, you assume he's just going to leave it somewhere and forget about it?"
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1381.517,1381.833,No.
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1410.718,1422.592,But what if there is a wire transfer to a bank in another country because that bank has bank secrecy laws that will make it impossible to ascertain the location of the money once it is there?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1424.844,1434.233,"At this point, no, Justice, because you haven't suggested that there was any type of design, any intent to disguise or conceal."
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1437.052,1437.604,If that's the purpose.
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1448.843,1449.21,--No.
2007.06-1456,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1449.21,1449.912,That's not--
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1449.912,1451.612,"On those facts, no, I don't think so."
2007.06-1456,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1466.921,1474.877,Would you say the same thing for... if you just put it in a safe deposit box in a bank in the Bahamas?
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1474.877,1479.947,"I would make the same... my answer would be the same without more, Your Honor."
2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1479.947,1482.649,"Well, the ""more"" is they don't hold it under your name."
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1488.287,1490.32,It very well may.
2007.06-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1506.581,1510.55,Because the police can't find it in that account even if it is still under your name.
2007.06-1456,0,29113,jerry_v_beard,,1523.791,1527.995,"--Justice, no, I don't think so, and I'll briefly answer and try to come back to you in rebuttal."
2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1539.602,1540.269,"Thank you, Mr. Beard."
2007.06-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1540.269,1544.437,"I don't understand that, so I hope you will explain it later."
2007.06-1456,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1551.693,1556.431,Ms. Schertler.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1556.431,1574.309,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The international concealment money laundering statute contains no appearance of legitimate wealth requirement, nor does it demand proof that the illegal proceeds will be cleansed after they cross the United States border."
2007.06-1456,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1623.556,1629.71,"Does the word ""transportation"" mean the act of transportation across the border or the method of transportation?"
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1629.71,1636.966,"The word ""transportation"" itself means the carrying of something from one place to another."
2007.06-1456,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1678.21,1679.61,You go back to Justice Alito's question.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1748.722,1753.608,"Your Honor, several responses to that, to that question."
2007.06-1456,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1792.249,1827.506,"But if that's all they were getting at, they wouldn't have to have this international component at all, because if you totally eliminated the ""to or through"" requirement and you were able to focus or properly focus solely on the method of the transportation, et cetera, then you would cover not only cases in which the concealment ultimately would take place by crossing a border, but you would pick up cases in which the concealment would take place even within the United States; and that would certainly be in the government's interest."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1847.553,1854.659,"My answer to that, Your Honor, is that that would have... that would defeat the purpose for which this statute was enacted."
2007.06-1456,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1868.916,1876.172,"But that would be... that would be equally true and an equally appropriate objective without the ""to or through"" requirement in there."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1887.38,1893.884,--And there... there could have been drafted a statute that was even broader than this one in that respect.
2007.06-1456,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1911.262,1922.401,"Then what you're saying, I suppose, is that the movement of funds, if they're illegal proceeds, outside of the country is a per se concealment?"
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1922.401,1924.003,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1456,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1924.97,1931.257,Give me an example of when you take money outside of the country that's illegal money--
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1931.257,1931.824,--Yes.
2007.06-1456,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1931.824,1933.142,--that's not a concealment?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1933.142,1934.592,Yes.
2007.06-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.045,1965.98,"He puts it in his shoe, okay."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1968.33,1970.282,--That would--
2007.06-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.282,1971.565,"That would be enough, wouldn't it?"
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1971.565,1972.634,--That would... yes.
2007.06-1456,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1975.486,1981.74,"What if he gives it to his brother and says take it across for me, will you?"
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1981.74,1986.225,"--Well, I don't think that that alone is... is enough, Your Honor."
2007.06-1456,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1988.76,1991.028,If he tells his brother to put it in his shoe?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,1991.711,1994.313,--That would... that would... that would get close.
2007.06-1456,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1994.313,1996.515,Why isn't that enough?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2005.538,2007.823,"With that additional evidence, absolutely."
2007.06-1456,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2016.163,2016.646,"Well then, let me back up."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2032.422,2033.874,"We don't go that far, Your Honor."
2007.06-1456,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2034.357,2034.774,But if you do.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2034.774,2035.374,--you need to find--
2007.06-1456,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2035.374,2038.076,I think you have to go that far to make the case you're making.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2038.076,2039.742,"--No, not at all."
2007.06-1456,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2050.717,2053.252,But you're always concealing the control.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2061.105,2065.076,--I don't... you have... they have to find a design to conceal.
2007.06-1456,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2065.076,2067.759,"He purposely puts it in his shoe, okay."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2067.759,2068.11,Yes.
2007.06-1456,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2068.11,2068.744,It's a design.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2076.864,2077.215,No--
2007.06-1456,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2077.215,2081.85,"If you are saying that, I don't know why they call this statute ""Laundering of Monetary Instruments""."
2007.06-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2085.038,2099.178,"And you're basically confronting face on the dissent here, which drew a distinction between transporting to conceal and concealing to transport."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2114.99,2128.965,"--Your Honor, the title of this statute, 1986."
2007.06-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2156.8,2172.743,"Were they concerned that this was a 20-year penalty, not what you're talking about, the person who gets... who is the drug dealer, but all that this evidence shows is that we have a courier."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2201.346,2209.019,"--He needs to know that part of the design, part of the plan of that transportation, was to conceal or disguise--"
2007.06-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2209.019,2211.035,That's a... that's a lot of fancy language.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2224.878,2233.65,--And the use of that courier also was part of a design to conceal or disguise the ownership and control--
2007.06-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2233.65,2234.2,Not his design.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2267.488,2288.821,"--Justice Ginsburg, the... Congress's purpose here was in getting at exactly this kind of conduct by third parties in particular, because when you use a third party that violates another purpose at which the statute is directed: using third parties to conceal who the true owner in control of the proceeds is."
2007.06-1456,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2288.821,2295.224,I suppose then the brother should be... giving the money to the brother should satisfy the statute.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2295.224,2295.824,It--
2007.06-1456,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2295.824,2307.782,"Because if I'm... if I'm in the drug business and my... my brother is an international social worker or something, I'm certainly going to conceal when I give it to him and he carries it across the border."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2307.782,2319.856,"--Yes, Justice Souter, that would be another example of using a third party so that a... so that one part of the design of that transportation is to conceal the ownership and control of the proceeds."
2007.06-1456,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2362.935,2375.125,Suppose the person who set all this up lives in Mexico and the sole intent of that person was to bring the money back to him in the place where he lives?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2379.844,2390.668,"If he had designed this transportation, yes, Your Honor, because the whole... the design of this transportation was to conceal or disguise all five of the attributes of these illegal proceeds."
2007.06-1456,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2390.668,2393.12,Isn't that a question of... isn't that a question of his intent?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2393.12,2393.704,I--
2007.06-1456,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2393.704,2395.406,"It's not the effect of the design, is it?"
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2397.672,2403.56,--It... it is... what was... what was the plan?
2007.06-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.166,2414.918,"Everybody knows he's a drug dealer, back in Juarez or wherever he lives in Mexico."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2414.918,2415.35,But by--
2007.06-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2415.35,2416.652,He's famous in town.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2425.941,2436.733,"--And he's arranged it in a way, if we're assuming the transportation here, so that his ownership and control of those proceeds will be disguised--"
2007.06-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2436.733,2438.049,It won't be disguised.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2438.049,2441.551,"--during the course of the transportation by saying, I'm going to select a third party."
2007.06-1456,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2441.551,2442.501,During the course of the transportation.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2477.958,2496.021,"That... the sentence, Mr. Chief Justice, that you just read is the last in a series of ""if's"" that we lay out in our brief, where we... where we assert that at any point in the transportation a jury could find evidence of a design to conceal or disguise."
2007.06-1456,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2515.499,2521.753,So there is no money laundering if they conceal the proceeds in a suitcase that's in the trunk of the car?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2522.505,2523.922,"Well, that would--"
2007.06-1456,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2523.922,2526.557,Is that concealing the money?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2526.557,2543.002,"--If we're talking about just the attribute of location, use of a suitcase I would say provides some evidence that there was a design to conceal the location of those illegal proceeds during... as part of this cross border transportation."
2007.06-1456,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2543.002,2545.502,Does use of a suitcase provide that evidence?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2545.502,2548.304,I think it would provide basis for a jury to make--
2007.06-1456,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2548.304,2552.341,"When I use a suitcase I'm using it to carry my clothes, not to conceal them."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2552.341,2568.201,"--And if the jury were presented with testimony that that was the design... that the only design, the only purpose, the only plan in using that suitcase was to use it to secure money for travel, then we would not have met our burden, but based solely on the circumstances."
2007.06-1456,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2568.201,2572.522,"Well, your answer to Justice Scalia's hypothetical is still not clear to me."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2592.665,2595.784,"Oh, our... let me... let me be clear."
2007.06-1456,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2623.451,2629.271,"So Concealment, concealment during the transportation is always a concealment of an attribute under the statute."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2630.921,2632.54,--Concealment... yes.
2007.06-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2651.935,2658.805,"May I ask you a broader question, forgetting the text of the statute for just a minute, because the text is extremely broad."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2669.663,2670.396,The question presented--
2007.06-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2670.396,2679.285,"--And you're arguing that's totally irrelevant and that... and also that that familiar title, ""Money Laundering"", totally irrelevant?"
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2679.285,2687.341,"--Your Honor, we disagree that there is any... there is no appearance of legitimate wealth requirement in the statute."
2007.06-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2687.725,2688.441,There is no... okay.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2688.441,2689.043,--This statute--
2007.06-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2689.043,2692.495,"And the term ""laundering"" really should be totally ignored?"
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2692.495,2705.486,"--The term ""laundering"" under... when it is understood to mean the way Congress meant it and the way Congress was viewing this conduct is much broader than Petitioner suggests."
2007.06-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2713.842,2720.579,"I understand you could find a violation of it, but what I'm really asking you: Is this just a total wild goose chase?"
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2725.75,2729.602,--The title of the statute says... but the terms of the statute are what matter here.
2007.06-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.602,2731.204,So it is irrelevant?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2731.204,2731.904,The terms are plain.
2007.06-1456,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2742.877,2752.133,"So if this fellow were driving to Canada would that be a different case, because Canada does not have the sort of cash economy we've heard about in Mexico?"
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2752.133,2760.223,"If the method of transportation were exactly the same, it would make no difference, Your Honor."
2007.06-1456,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2788.992,2796.229,"So, what if the fellow says: You know, there are dangerous roads between here and Mexico."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2808.537,2812.256,"I think that's enough to get to the jury, and that would be a jury question, Your Honor, yes."
2007.06-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2812.256,2819.777,"Just to be clear, you affirmatively say that concealing to transport is enough, right?"
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2819.777,2821.361,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2835.754,2838.556,Why do you make distinctions between methods of concealment?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2877.966,2896.762,"That need not make a difference if there is evidence before the jury, if there is evidence that the ultimate design of the transportation is to conceal or disguise the proceeds at the point of destination."
2007.06-1456,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2896.762,2903.931,"Well, then your only defense is to go across the border and before you go across you put all the money in your arms so the people can see it?"
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2906.3,2913.656,"In that situation, there would no basis to find concealment or disguise of location."
2007.06-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2943.592,2945.86,That's transporting to conceal.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2945.86,2948.144,"That's... and I, for one--"
2007.06-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2948.144,2950.029,But you're saying this statute covers both?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2950.029,2951.348,"--It covers both, Your Honor."
2007.06-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2966.358,2973.028,"In your brief, you said the bulk cash statute would not apply to a courier."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,2980.365,3001.697,"The bulk cash... well, the bulk... in this case, there's no evidence in this record that a bulk cash smuggling statute charge would have been viable because there's no evidence in this record that this defendant knew of a currency reporting requirement and intended to evade it."
2007.06-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3034.585,3042.356,There's no principle that all criminal statutes have to cover every... every bad act.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3079.797,3087.97,"The plain reading of the money laundering statute covers this conduct, and Congress specifically had this conduct in mind."
2007.06-1456,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3108.283,3109.766,How many co sponsors were there?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3109.766,3111.652,"--I don't know, Your Honor."
2007.06-1456,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3119.439,3123.06,How does that show what you want it to show?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3132.099,3132.532,And--
2007.06-1456,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3132.532,3135.784,They'll transport it abroad in order to launder it.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3136.934,3141.021,--They will resort to taking their money physically out of the United States.
2007.06-1456,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3145.006,3146.425,In order to launder it.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3148.791,3149.793,If the premise--
2007.06-1456,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3149.793,3151.843,Or were they not talking about it?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3156.397,3163.218,--This provision was directed at preventing the illegal moneys from leaving the country.
2007.06-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3177.645,3178.73,If you're trying to prevent the money--
2007.06-1456,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3178.73,3189.468,"But you, in response to one of my hypotheticals, said that it would be relevant in some cases to show that it was designed to create the appearance of legitimate wealth."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3190.804,3191.32,--If--
2007.06-1456,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3191.32,3192.704,--So you put that back into play.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3192.704,3194.822,"--If we have that evidence, yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3212.118,3218.372,"--What if... if that's what they're concerned about, taking the money out of the country, why do they have the concealment requirement?"
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3223.691,3224.191,They--
2007.06-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3224.191,3224.675,They didn't say that.
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3243.589,3245.472,"--I think that it does, Your Honor."
2007.06-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3310.631,3312.333,May I ask... may I ask this question?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3326.057,3342.353,"I don't think so, Your Honor, and I would... I would go back to the evidence that Justice Alito has pointed out that is in this record, that there's evidence in this record that... that the... by taking the funds to Mexico, they would be able to be used in a way that would not raise suspicion."
2007.06-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3342.353,3347.072,"Well, there's also, consistent with the evidence, they want to pay the drug dealer for the drugs."
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3353.06,3356.762,There was... I would not... I would not disagree with that.
2007.06-1456,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3359.647,3360.997,Why don't you finish your answer?
2007.06-1456,1,35076,lisa_h_schertler,,3360.997,3375.574,"Your Honor, there was... there was evidence in this case that the proceeds were removed... this is expert testimony... removed from the United States to conceal so as not to go through reporting requirements, so that the money would not be identified to U.S. law enforcement."
2007.06-1456,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3382.913,3385.531,"Thank you, Ms. Schertler."
2007.06-1456,2,29113,jerry_v_beard,,3388.983,3391.701,"Justice Scalia, when I left we were discussing--"
2007.06-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3391.701,3393.818,I forget what it was that I didn't understand.
2007.06-1456,2,29113,jerry_v_beard,,3394.303,3396.337,--Happily I've been thinking about it.
2007.06-1456,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3483.361,3485.73,May I ask the same basic question of you?
2007.06-1456,2,29113,jerry_v_beard,,3491.884,3493.517,"It is not an element, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-1456,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3494.919,3499.571,"So then your question presented raised that question, you're walking away from that question?"
2007.06-1456,2,29113,jerry_v_beard,,3499.571,3506.56,"--We have spoken in the question presented in that broad term, because we think that that language encapsulates what's taking place."
2007.06-1456,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3506.56,3508.511,It is not an essential element of the offense?
2007.06-1456,2,29113,jerry_v_beard,,3508.511,3510.112,It's not an element.
2007.06-1456,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3523.186,3530.926,"--the same thing, appearance of legitimate wealth goes to one of the attributes, the nature of what's being transported."
2007.06-1456,2,29113,jerry_v_beard,,3533.394,3542.417,"--The Congress had identified, Justice Alito, those particular attributes as being key to allowing the launderer to inject the money back into commerce."
2007.06-1456,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3556.993,3565.349,Suppose the evidence is clear that he knew he was taking it across the border and it was to pay the drug dealer?
2007.06-1456,2,29113,jerry_v_beard,,3566.899,3568.551,"--For liability under the statute, Justice?"
2007.06-1456,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3577.74,3578.34,"Well, but... no, no."
2007.06-1456,2,29113,jerry_v_beard,,3582.375,3582.742,--Yes.
2007.06-1456,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3588.463,3589.297,Yes.
2007.06-1456,2,29113,jerry_v_beard,,3589.297,3594.116,"That wouldn't give rise to laundering, because all you have there basically is money spending."
2007.06-1456,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3595.968,3601.022,It's concealing who owns and controls.
2007.06-1456,2,29113,jerry_v_beard,,3601.022,3602.772,"--No, I don't think so."
2007.06-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3611.194,3614.863,"Mr. Beard, can't you give us something we can get this guy on?"
2007.06-1456,2,29113,jerry_v_beard,,3615.865,3617.732,I'm not comfortable doing that.
2007.06-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3617.732,3619.25,He's carrying dirty money.
2007.06-1456,2,29113,jerry_v_beard,,3630.123,3636.195,"Well, Justice, I'm not uncomfortable with the notion of him walking, because I'm not uncomfortable with the notion you brought up earlier with that there may indeed be a gap."
2007.06-1456,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3639.897,3647.917,"The point... the point about aiding and abetting something, this money reeks of marijuana, and that was very puzzling to me."
2007.06-1456,2,29113,jerry_v_beard,,3661.577,3667.731,"--Justice, I know that the... initially the way this went down was the money that was in his pocket."
2007.06-1456,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3692.563,3693.329,"Thank you, Mr. Beard."
