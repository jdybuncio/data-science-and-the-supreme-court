1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.589,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-636, Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill v. the Michigan Department of Natural Resources."
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,57.238,74.529,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,87.92,89.322,That's up by Port Huron?
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,89.322,89.983,"--Yes, sir."
1991.91-636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,136.082,141.297,I take it this waste is not of the kind that we were talking about in the last case?
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,141.297,142.079,"That's correct, sir."
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,148.086,151.805,"And garbage is your element of commerce here, I guess?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,151.805,152.706,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.706,162.043,"Is the waste, could it ever be said to be hazardous to transport it?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,162.043,179.074,"Under the regulations that have been promulgated by the State of Michigan, the transportation of municipal solid waste if it is moisture laden must be transported in trucks that are sealed and not capable of leaking."
1991.91-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.52,196.545,"Well, would that aspect of it possibly bring it in the quarantine exception?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,196.545,205.08,"--In this case, Justice O'Connor, no one has suggested that the quarantine cases are applicable."
1991.91-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.752,335.279,"Mr. Finn, I guess the Sixth Circuit purported to apply the Pike v. Bruce Church test in this case?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,335.279,337.831,"--Yes, it did, Justice Scalia... Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,337.831,348.339,"And do you make the argument that it was, that was the wrong test to apply, or that it was the correct test to apply but they applied it wrong?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,350.66,356.093,There is no question in our mind that the Sixth Circuit applied the incorrect test.
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.03,380.75,"Well, what's the matter with it?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,386.036,406.929,"Well, in Brimmer v. Rebman, which was decided in 1891, in Dean Milk v. the City of Madison in 1954, and in Polar Ice Cream and Creamery Co., this Court has held that it's immaterial for purposes of determining whether there is discrimination against interstate commerce that in-state commerce is subject to the same constraint."
1991.91-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.719,441.84,"Mr. Finn, isn't it really a little unrealistic to say that what we're dealing with here is an article of commerce called garbage?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,447.377,451.288,"Well, in this case it's the question of--"
1991.91-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,451.288,451.929,Nobody wants garbage.
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,457.195,464.501,"--The, there's no question but that the landfill is itself engaged in commerce."
1991.91-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.697,480.729,"But the landfill space is just in St. Clair County, right?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,480.729,482.532,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1991.91-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.532,494.551,"Now I suppose, I suppose St. Clair County could impose an enormous tax upon any garbage brought into this landfill space."
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,494.551,496.724,"That's, I agree with that, Justice Scalia."
1991.91-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.724,498.123,"It would have the same result, wouldn't it?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,498.123,499.726,It would not be discriminatory.
1991.91-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,501.008,509.153,"Yes, but of course all the tax goes into St. Clair County's own coffers, so as a matter of fact it would not deter St. Clair County from using the landfill."
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,513.035,529.996,"The discrimination is made against the citizens and businesses of other states in this instance who are prohibited from bringing municipal solid waste into St. Clair County, whereas the citizens and businesses of St. Clair County are free to put their waste into the landfill without constraint."
1991.91-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.996,530.607,Well--
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,530.607,532.66,That discrimination is what's impermissible.
1991.91-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,532.66,539.155,--So all you're making St. Clair County do is to reduce its business taxes and impose an enormous tax on taking stuff to the landfill.
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,539.155,543.89,"If they choose to do that, that would be... I can't address whether that would be permissible or not."
1991.91-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,548.224,559.252,"But to the extent that the county tried to do that and imposed the tax on its own citizens as well, I imagine it wouldn't sit too well to be told that the county was going to recoup some of the money."
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,559.252,562.324,I think that is correct.
1991.91-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,564.097,568.32,"People who live there and who vote there still have to get rid of their garbage, don't they?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,568.32,569.731,"--Yes, they do, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,569.731,574.345,"And they want to do it at reasonable rates, I suppose."
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,574.345,576.355,"Well, their alternative is not--"
1991.91-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,576.355,578.536,Let me ask you this.
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,593.198,607.417,"--To some extent municipal solid waste as it starts from our respective homes or our respective businesses contains materials that can be removed from the solid waste, such as recyclables, plastics, aluminum, or the like."
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.055,654.509,I dare say lots of people would think they weren't.
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,656.702,667.45,--I think it's clear that Congress would think that it had the power to regulate the funeral home industry or the cemetery industry because it was regulating a matter of interstate commerce.
1991.91-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,682.001,699.984,"Mr. Finn, could Michigan put together a scheme whereby the counties could decide that they wouldn't allow any private landfills, period, and that all waste disposal would be at county-owned sites?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,699.984,712.512,"Other than the problem of expropriating the existing privately-owned landfills, I think the county would have the power, the state would have the power to prohibit the operation of private landfills."
1991.91-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,712.512,718.977,"And if they did that and then said no out-of-state waste, I guess you wouldn't win."
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,718.977,722.089,"Well, I wouldn't have a private landfill in that case."
1991.91-636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,722.089,722.379,Right.
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,722.379,735.569,"But I don't, we don't question but that the state can, through the market participant doctrine, restrict out-of-state waste from coming into the state, into the state-owned or county-owned landfills."
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,735.569,749.568,"Mr. Finn, I think some of our cases have said that when the motive of the state appears to be protectionist, parochial favoring local industry, then we're going to give it strict scrutiny."
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,757.044,771.333,"The citizens and businesses of the county, of St. Clair County, have an opportunity to put their municipal solid waste in petitioner's private landfill whereas citizens and businesses out-of-county don't have that opportunity."
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,771.333,774.735,"That is the, that is the protectionist aspect?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,774.735,775.156,"Well, I think it's a broader--"
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,775.156,778.598,It's certainly a good deal different than a lot of cases that we've--
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,778.598,801.384,"--It is true that this Court has talked repeatedly in terms of economic protectionism, but it has to be recognized that virtually all of the nine embargo cases that this Court has struck down over the past 119 years involved the argument on the part of the state that their statute was justified by some legitimate purpose."
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.452,823.501,"--But the Madison, the Dean Milk case was a case where the, I think the City of Madison was trying to assure that a particular local processing plant got the business and not somewhere else, wasn't it?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,823.501,833.889,"Well, it was also cited, the state, or rather the city contended that they needed to have the local requirement for processing of milk in order to be able to adequately inspect."
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,833.889,834.59,Yes.
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,834.59,835.719,But the Court did not buy that.
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.719,843.275,But you... I don't see the same protectionist element in this case as there was in the Dean Milk case.
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,843.275,844.126,"Well, I--"
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,844.126,846.598,They're not trying to protect a local business.
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,846.598,855.135,--I think what they are trying to protect is the need for local expenditures and to protect citizens from competition.
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,896.208,905.264,"So the New Jerseyans end up shipping their garbage to St. Clair County, and St. Clair County ends up shipping its garbage to South Dakota?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,910.808,916.05,St. Clair... it's just a question of creating space.
1991.91-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,947.013,948.966,"Well, it's not just--"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,948.966,951.167,I think that's the essence of economic protectionism.
1991.91-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.167,964.336,"--I assume that it also means that the, that what you can charge the state today, or what any existing landfill can charge the state or in-state citizens or in-county citizens has to be lower, doesn't it?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,972.322,974.804,"There is no question about that, Justice Scalia."
1991.91-636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,974.804,976.293,"Well, that sounds like protectionism to me."
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,976.293,978.176,That's why we're here.
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1035.192,1037.724,Because there is no threat from the garbage.
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,1037.724,1042.147,I don't think that the quarantine cases present any threat.
1991.91-636,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1127.936,1155.644,"What if the county in this case had combined its embargo with a temporal limitation, let's say 5 years or 10 years, and had justified that, assuming it could do so, on the ground that it takes that long to engage in responsible planning and construction of further facilities, so that it justified it essentially on the basis of a planning purpose, expressly and overtly?"
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,1156.476,1172.537,I don't think that this Court has ever upheld discriminatory legislation which discriminates against foreign articles of commerce or against foreign citizens and businesses on the basis that it was a temporary planning measure.
1991.91-636,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1174.998,1176.21,"No, but I mean in the classic sort of case."
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,1214.798,1222.054,"--Well, I don't think it would take it out of the strict scrutiny test because the strict scrutiny test is applied whenever discrimination is found."
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1395.146,1401.77,"Well, not anywhere in the strictly soil sense."
1991.91-636,0,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,1411.41,1417.006,"Well, I think it's clear from the briefs of the respondents and the amici that that's no longer necessary."
1991.91-636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1461.009,1464.93,Very well.
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1472.256,1476.019,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.948,1547.115,"How... I take it that the State allows a county, however, to take out-of-state waste?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1547.115,1547.756,Yes.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1547.756,1553.129,And how many counties have in their plan permission to do that?
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1553.129,1555.202,Each county creates a plan.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.387,1562.607,"And the, but none of the rest of them?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1562.607,1568.562,The others do not currently contain a specific provision permitting out-of-state waste to be brought in.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1568.562,1571.704,And unless it does then the state law forbids the importation?
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1571.704,1573.717,That's correct.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.717,1579.0,So it's a state law that puts the teeth in this arrangement?
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1579.0,1584.595,A state law requires affirmative action by each county before out-of-state waste can be brought in.
1991.91-636,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1584.595,1587.546,And approval by the State.
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1587.546,1587.827,Correct.
1991.91-636,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1587.827,1588.027,Yes.
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1588.027,1603.408,"There is a comprehensive process for developing the plan with input from the local counties, local planning agencies, votes by the municipalities within a county, regional approval, and ultimately approval by the director of the Department of Natural Resources."
1991.91-636,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1603.408,1620.12,"Mr. Casey, does the State take the position that the transportation of solid waste presents significant health or safety dangers?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1620.12,1621.591,"Yes, it can."
1991.91-636,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1623.042,1628.257,Is that a position taken by the State here to justify its position?
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1628.257,1639.474,--We are urging this Court... this case presents the opportunity for the Court to reexamine the Philadelphia v. New Jersey decision.
1991.91-636,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1662.8,1668.875,"Well, if we disagree with that and leave the precedents on the books, then where are you?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1668.875,1675.508,--We believe that the judgments below can be affirmed without retreating whatsoever from Philadelphia v. New Jersey.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.86,1761.756,"Well, do you think just because the State operates through the county that it's off the hook?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1774.125,1780.199,We would be probably taking a stronger position that Philadelphia v. New Jersey should be overruled.
1991.91-636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.941,1811.72,"Well, what if in this case, Mr. Casey, the Michigan statute by name said these eight counties shall be able to import waste and the others shall not."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1816.465,1823.979,--In a facial challenge that would be much more like the statute that was present in Philadelphia v. New Jersey.
1991.91-636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.963,1838.29,"It would be much more like it in the sense that it was more like the Pennsylvania statute, or the New Jersey statute there."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1854.462,1864.199,--The key differences between our statute and the statute in Philadelphia v. New Jersey is that in that case there was an absolute prohibition.
1991.91-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.145,1899.903,"But you have to take responsibility for what your counties do under your authorization, and in fact it is a total prohibition with respect to some of the counties."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1905.285,1912.63,I would suggest to you that that would be the analysis if this were a challenge to the statute as applied in a particular circumstance.
1991.91-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.983,1966.018,In such manner as to exclude out-of-state garbage--
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1966.018,1966.218,--Yes.
1991.91-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.218,1969.21,--while still receiving in-county garbage.
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,1969.21,1969.661,Correct.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.469,2003.584,"Well, suppose there's an operator of an amusement park in St. Clair County and the county, and the state has a law like this that anybody, any county that wants to keep amusement, to prevent amusement parks from catering to out-of-state visitors may do so?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2003.584,2006.198,"That would not be our position, no."
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.198,2007.538,"Well what, what's the difference?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2007.538,2010.58,This subject matter is fundamentally different than the typical economic--
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.58,2018.998,"This amusement park operator wants to do business with out-of-state visitors, and the state says well, the county can keep them out, and the county has."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2025.513,2032.318,--Under the traditional Commerce Clause analysis you have to determine the nature and the legitimacy of the local concerns.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.672,2041.354,"Well, neither would this be in my example."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2041.354,2044.926,--Perhaps I didn't understand your example.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.94,2059.777,"They want to exclude, they want to prevent the amusement park operator from doing business with people from out-of-state."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2059.777,2064.661,--That probably would not be a sufficient justification for making the exclusion.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.617,2074.726,"Well, the--"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2074.726,2081.161,The key is the means that the state has used to implement that legitimate purpose.
1991.91-636,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2102.579,2116.659,"--We do have to have a sense, don't we, even as you have posed the issue before us, of the kinds of interest that, the kinds of local interest that it would be legitimate to assert, that might reasonably be asserted?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2137.575,2141.737,To some extent landfills always pose dangers to public health.
1991.91-636,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2148.922,2161.441,"All right, well how are we supposed to kind of get our hands on the kind of public health concern which you say at least facially, on a facial challenge might justify the restriction?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2170.767,2178.091,The cases in which the Court has applied strict scrutiny in this Commerce Clause area deal with simple economic protectionism.
1991.91-636,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2179.971,2182.515,"No, that may be, but how do you articulate your public health interest?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2201.999,2209.685,--There are in the neighborhood of 180 million tons a year of municipal solid waste generated.
1991.91-636,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2249.124,2252.527,"Well, it seems to me you have raised two issued but you haven't answered the question."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2294.75,2303.256,"Public health dangers in the form of leachate, fluids that seep through the landfill and are required to be pumped out and drained."
1991.91-636,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2312.952,2317.544,Those are good arguments for saying solid waste disposal sites are not desirable neighbors.
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2329.684,2339.642,"--Because of the volume of solid waste which is created throughout the country, measures have to be taken somewhere to provide proper disposal."
1991.91-636,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2339.642,2351.73,"But this case is unlike the Taylor and Maine case, because there the out-of-state character of the item imported was itself the evil."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2380.591,2382.271,Correct.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2400.967,2403.638,Is this law subject to strict scrutiny?
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2403.638,2404.239,--No.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.018,2406.639,What if it were?
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2406.639,2410.66,--It would still pass muster under either the--
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.66,2413.044,And why isn't it subject to strict scrutiny?
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2413.044,2421.822,--Because it is not facially discriminatory to the extent that the strict scrutiny cases have applied that standard.
1991.91-636,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2421.822,2427.505,"Mr. Casey, may I go back to one of the questions that we have left dangling here?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2433.609,2436.361,I am not sure I understand.
1991.91-636,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2436.361,2457.057,"Well, you began to answer a previous question of mine by saying that somehow it is reasonable to give the counties the kind of leeway that you want to give them because the state has allocated to the counties the responsibility for finding, or for establishing, I guess, disposal sites for, at least for their own county wastes."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2465.397,2472.991,"The Commerce Clause analysis that the petitioner has raised is that the statute is discriminatory, it favors in-county residents."
1991.91-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2496.82,2500.883,"Well, we don't care, we don't care if you discriminate against county residents."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2501.474,2502.646,"But in the, the point I'm--"
1991.91-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2502.646,2508.259,--You can be as unfair as you like to your state citizens and the Federal Government doesn't care.
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2512.833,2515.175,--I would analogize to the Sporhase decision.
1991.91-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.763,2579.428,"It isn't enough to impose some burden on intrastate, on state residents."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2589.956,2593.96,"If the burdens are comparable, then the statute--"
1991.91-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2593.96,2594.13,But they aren't comparable.
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2594.13,2595.96,--We submit they are.
1991.91-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.96,2596.22,How are they?
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2604.256,2615.043,"That's correct, but the out-of-state resident can satisfy... the problem of solid waste is a local problem."
1991.91-636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2635.49,2638.104,"The Commerce Clause says there's no such thing as a local problem, doesn't it?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2640.287,2640.668,"No, I don't think so at all."
1991.91-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2666.915,2672.581,"Mr. Casey, you point out that in some communities they put the garbage on trains or trucks and ship it away."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2678.755,2686.23,"If every state had a law like Michigan's, every county would be required to dispose of its own solid waste and we would not have an interstate problem."
1991.91-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2686.23,2695.667,"And if it found that it could do it much more cheaply by putting it on a train and shipping it to some area where the land is very cheap and there's a lot of desert or something, they wouldn't be able to do that, would they?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2695.667,2699.8,They could if the receiving state accepted that burden.
1991.91-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.688,2723.356,"Why does, why does St. Clair County really want to forbid this private landfill operator from processing or disposing of out-of-state waste?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2723.356,2728.137,"--Again, we have very little in the way of evidentiary record here."
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2753.746,2757.289,"Well, hadn't the operator been taking out-of-state waste?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2757.289,2757.85,--No.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2757.85,2760.432,This was going to be new business?
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2760.432,2763.694,There had been litigation within the State where they were trying to take out-of-county waste.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.694,2767.367,So this would just be new business for the landfill operator?
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2767.367,2767.678,Correct.
1991.91-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2785.95,2796.388,"It's still true, as I understand, that if he could demonstrate that he could still handle all the local garbage for the next 20 years the law would still prohibit him from taking any out-of-state garbage."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2796.388,2801.32,If he could make that showing in a challenge to the statute as applied--
1991.91-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2801.32,2805.504,"No, I'm not, I'm not worrying about constitutionality, just the way it would work."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2817.572,2819.162,--Correct.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.802,2848.213,Well... go ahead.
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2857.81,2862.434,The county would have to find some alternative method of assuring disposal.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.434,2863.003,I see.
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2863.003,2863.975,That is the obligation--
1991.91-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2863.975,2866.665,He has no obligation to serve the county for the next 20 years.
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2866.665,2866.836,--No.
1991.91-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2868.549,2876.914,So that if he rents his space to an out-of-state customer it has the same impact on the county as if he just closed up?
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2879.896,2882.24,"--The county would still have to solve the problem, yes."
1991.91-636,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2882.24,2893.43,"Now I take it you agree with Mr. Finn that the county could do that simply by prohibiting landfills, or by going into the landfill business itself and in that instance could prohibit out-of-state receipt?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2893.43,2898.952,I don't know if the county could do that on its own because the statute requires them to assure capacity--
1991.91-636,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2898.952,2906.946,"Well, there's not comment that there would be... I assume you agree there would be no Commerce Clause bar to its doing so if that were otherwise the political disposition of the State?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2906.946,2907.137,--Correct.
1991.91-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.79,2924.11,"Did this landfill operator, didn't he offer to, didn't he undertake to satisfy the, all of the county's--"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2924.11,2932.024,"In the proposal that he submitted he said that, the county said... the company said it would guarantee the full 20-year capacity."
1991.91-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2994.839,2997.901,"--Of course there wasn't an absolute prohibition in the New Jersey case either, was there?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,2997.901,2999.744,"--There were four very limited exceptions, but--"
1991.91-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2999.744,3005.437,"But they were whatever exceptions the agency wanted to allow, and they allowed for."
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3005.437,3013.2,"--The governor or whoever the official was passed a regulation with four exceptions, but the Court said--"
1991.91-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.2,3015.742,Just as here a county can allow out-of-state garbage if it wants to.
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3020.477,3031.383,--In a facial challenge such as this what we're saying is that it is permissible for a state statute to let local governments evaluate local circumstances.
1991.91-636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3076.784,3082.79,"The district court here granted summary judgment to the respondents here, I mean to the petitioner here?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3082.79,3082.848,No.
1991.91-636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3091.405,3102.792,"So in effect it was giving you the benefit, it was resolving all disputed facts against you, I take it then?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3102.792,3103.013,That's correct.
1991.91-636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3104.373,3110.567,"And then the Sixth Circuit sent it, the Sixth Circuit upheld that?"
1991.91-636,1,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3110.567,3110.898,Correct.
1991.91-636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3141.652,3141.992,"Thank you, Mr. Casey."

1991.91-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3192.417,3199.712,"Is that a facial challenge to the act, or is it a facial challenge to the act plus the St. Clair implementation of the act?"
1991.91-636,2,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,3199.712,3200.513,It is--
1991.91-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.513,3202.384,What are you facially challenging?
1991.91-636,2,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,3203.105,3208.828,--I am challenging the act as it incorporates the St. Clair County solid waste management plan as it was in effect at the time.
1991.91-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3208.828,3216.554,"--So yours is not just a facial challenge to the whole Michigan statute, it's a facial challenge to the Michigan statute with the St. Clair ordinance implementing?"
1991.91-636,2,27003,harold_b_finn_iii,,3216.554,3217.045,That is correct.

1991.91-636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3400.06,3401.269,"--Well, a state... we had this problem in the last case."
