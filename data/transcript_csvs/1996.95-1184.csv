1996.95-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.507,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1184, Dan Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture v. Wileman Brothers and Elliott, Inc.--"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,10.228,17.934,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,58.211,63.002,"May I ask a question at an early stage, Mr. Jenkins?"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,104.011,105.071,"Well, I don't--"
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.071,107.572,--in light of the posture taken below.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,107.572,109.315,"--I don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.717,125.043,"But it does appear that the Government below chose not to urge the Abood line, took that tactic, and I don't know why we should address that here."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,125.043,128.294,"Well, Your Honor, I disagree with that characterization of our position below."
1996.95-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.965,162.539,"And both of those lines of cases, of course, deal with the First Amendment, don't they?"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,162.539,164.679,"Quite so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,165.701,209.5,"Mr. Jenkins, assuming that we apply one or the other test in a way that requires us to determine the value of the Government's interest, do you claim that the value of the Government's interest depends on a Government concern over and above that of the growers whose products they are advertising, or, on the other hand, do you claim that the Government's interest is essentially derivative, that it's important simply because the growers themselves want to do this, and that desire, that vote in fact on their part establishes its importance?"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,210.1,213.292,"Well, I think it's the latter, Justice Souter, but I think it's even broader than that."
1996.95-1184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,243.43,251.137,"But the growers, as I understand it, do not vote in any narrow or specific sense as to whether the interest is threatened."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,255.829,261.863,"Well, I think that's correct, Justice Souter, but that just is at the core of the Government's interest."
1996.95-1184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,274.633,295.516,"Is that how you would explain the... what struck me, at least, as the peculiarity in this case that apparently there are, I guess, peach-growers, for example, in some 30 States, but the only ones who seem to have expressed a need for this advertising scheme are California peach-growers."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,305.01,307.892,"I think that's true, Justice Souter, but I'd also like--"
1996.95-1184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,307.892,309.284,Does the record support that?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,309.284,314.025,"--It does not, and let me make clear the way in which this act operates."
1996.95-1184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,314.025,323.793,"Mr. Jenkins, before you do that may I ask you, I think a question that is of a similar basic kind?"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,357.506,362.268,"Justice Ginsburg, as I've said, first the broader interest is in orderly market conditions."
1996.95-1184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,387.487,399.161,"Well, I could understand that if this was across the board, if you said there this compelling need, and so we do it for all agricultural commodities, but it seems to be rather haphazard."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,399.161,416.405,"--Well, I think that relates to my answer to Justice Souter's previous question, which is that taking, for example, that one of the proposed disparities is between California-grown peaches and Georgia-grown peaches... and I think it's important to look at the regulatory framework here, which is commodity-specific, and region-specific."
1996.95-1184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,451.928,457.861,How can it be narrow tailoring when the... when in effect the tailoring is done by a nongovernmental entity?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,466.728,483.838,"--Well, that's not entirely true, Justice Souter, insofar as the marketing... the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act treats different commodities in different regions differently, but you're certainly correct that it's the industry in the first instance, a supermajority, two-thirds majority producers, that caused the marketing order to come into being."
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.743,492.864,Mr. Jenkins--
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,492.864,493.245,Pardon me.
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.245,497.907,--do we have to believe... this argument sounds like something time-warped out of the 1920's.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,534.341,536.873,"I think so, Justice Scalia, for two reasons."
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,549.87,550.09,Just for agriculture.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,552.454,554.966,"Has not done it for every commodity, that's true."
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.966,556.806,"I mean, it seems to express the belief that elsewhere that isn't true."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,556.806,558.965,"Well, I don't think so."
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.506,560.958,That market disorder is okay.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,562.288,563.831,"--Well, no, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,574.897,576.497,They will invoke the Government's aid anywhere.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,579.78,580.301,--Well--
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.301,582.154,They'll take the Government's aid wherever they can get it.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,582.154,583.072,"--Well, I don't think so."
1996.95-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,610.991,620.539,"Well, isn't it at least, or couldn't Congress find as a fact that in agriculture, at least since after the First World War, there's always been a problem."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,632.604,637.359,"We think so, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think particularly as to these commodities that is true."
1996.95-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,637.359,647.333,"But that... that could justify the marketing orders, but it certainly doesn't support with any necessity the advertising."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,653.397,673.653,"That's certainly true as a technical matter, Your Honor, but it's also true that in adopting both... in adopting promotional programs Congress found, and in adopting these particular marketing order provisions the Secretary found that these... the ability to invoke generic advertising activities has a beneficial effect, and in fact directly advances--"
1996.95-1184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,673.653,685.748,What is the test that you say we must apply to determine the validity of this provision requiring advertising?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,699.309,715.609,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, I think it is more deferential, but if I could set back for a moment, I think that if certainly this Court were to conclude that regulating these commodities and establishing orderly market conditions in terms of its effect on the national economy was a trivial interest, then the Government would lose in this case."
1996.95-1184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,716.36,717.321,Because speech is involved?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,717.321,720.363,"--I'm sorry, I--"
1996.95-1184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,720.363,721.412,Because speech is involved?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,721.412,733.39,"--Well, insofar as the First Amendment rights of handlers are affected, then there must be, I suppose, more than an irrational governmental interest, but I think there's no question that the interest here is substantial."
1996.95-1184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,737.814,739.705,Mr. Jenkins--
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,754.114,755.786,"Well, yes."
1996.95-1184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,756.527,763.92,"What is the case, the closest case that you have to suggest the proper standard that we should use here?"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,767.463,768.593,"--No, Your Honor,--"
1996.95-1184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,768.593,769.714,--Or the Zauderer case?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,770.075,797.554,"--Zauderer, insofar as the Central Hudson test commercial speech analysis is applicable, Zauderer would probably be the closest case insofar as it involved the aspect of compelled disclosure of information, as distinguished from restrictions on speech, but we think that the speech interests in this case are attenuated in several respects, first because it's commercial speech, second because there's no restriction on respondent's ability to advertise in any respect, third because--"
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,797.554,799.445,"--Well, let me ask you about that."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,831.736,834.778,"--Your Honor, we do, but let me first say that I think--"
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,834.778,849.045,"That's amazing, that the Government could take money from everybody in the industry, every grower of peaches and nectarines, and advertise one grower's exclusive use to a patented fruit."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,849.045,852.709,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, if that were the dominant or even perhaps a plurality of--"
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,852.709,852.929,Well--
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,852.929,853.788,--Pardon me.
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,853.788,855.961,--do you defend the right of the Government to do that?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,855.961,857.331,"Justice O'Connor, we would--"
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,857.331,861.886,Just answer that isolated question... under any test.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,861.886,863.656,--I suppose my answer is no.
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,863.656,864.186,No.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,864.186,868.769,We do not defend an overarching governmental goal of advertising a particular competitor's--
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,868.769,871.242,"But you say, if it happens once in a while it's okay."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,872.232,889.722,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, I think it's important to look... in our, in the Joint Appendix in Volume 2, at page 531, this is the varieties chart to which respondents were referring, and among the list of many, many varieties, there is included the Red Jim which, as you pointed out, is a proprietary variety--"
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,889.722,890.103,Right.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,890.103,891.144,--shipped by only one handler.
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,891.144,891.555,Right.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,891.555,895.295,"Now, we think that this is an infinitesimal aspect of this program."
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,895.295,900.351,"So you say if there are violations, they're de minimis, and so we can ignore them."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,902.631,903.342,That's part of our argument.
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,903.342,905.433,Would you clarify one more thing for me?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,910.506,910.937,That's correct.
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,910.937,911.457,Not the growers.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,911.457,911.838,That's correct.
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,911.838,914.138,Do the handlers pass it on to the growers?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,914.138,918.113,"That's the expectation of the way in which this program operates, and I--"
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,918.113,922.234,"And who has to vote to terminate the program, the growers or the handlers?"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,922.234,924.527,--The growers vote in the first instance to terminate.
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,929.91,931.369,As well as the growers.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,931.369,931.8,--That's correct.
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,931.8,935.793,"To set it in place in the first place, handlers and growers vote."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,935.793,936.093,That's correct.
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,936.093,938.165,But to terminate it only growers vote.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,938.165,939.036,"That's correct, and let me--"
1996.95-1184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,939.036,944.529,Have any of the growers asked for a vote on peaches and nectarines in California?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,944.529,955.076,"--Well, in fact, Your Honor, there are periodic referenda, I believe every 4 years, and in the last referenda there was overwhelming support for this program, I believe between 75 and 83 percent."
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.076,959.249,"Mr. Jenkins, this relates to Justice O'Connor's question about the Big Jim, and--"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1035.59,1047.99,"We don't, Justice Scalia, assert that there's something comparable to the duty of fair representation in this context, although that is similarly true in the integrated bar context, that there is no concomitant duty of fair representation."
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1047.99,1058.025,"Well, I think the bar is a special situation, and have always felt that, but as far as unions go, you have the distinctive fiduciary obligation."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1065.091,1073.726,"Well, Justice Scalia, I also think that the majority cannot, as an overwhelming, either as a goal or as the effect harm the minority's interest."
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1085.553,1087.415,Some of them here say they're being harmed.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1087.415,1088.917,"--I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1088.917,1104.955,"Some of them here say they're being harmed, that the mere advertising of, generically, peaches harms them because they are trying to convince the public that all peaches are not fungible, that some kind of peaches are really good peaches, and their interests are harmed by any generic peach advertising."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1104.955,1109.019,"But Justice Scalia, I don't see how that removes this from the Abood line of cases."
1996.95-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1133.206,1159.191,"Mr. Jenkins, supposing there's such a thing as the Beer Institute, which is a private organization devoted to generic advertising for beer, and supposing some of its members feel that some of the micro breweries who aren't members are kind of free-riding on the generic, could the Beer Institute go to Congress and say, look, we want to have a kind of a marketing agreement and some generic advertising."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1164.815,1168.748,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think if it were, in fact, an important governmental interest--"
1996.95-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1168.748,1172.389,"Well, I'm sure the beer people would think it was. [Laughter]"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1172.389,1173.931,"--Well, I--"
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.931,1176.052,You think beer is less important than peaches?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1176.373,1189.102,"--No comment on that, but I do think that... of course, it's up to this Court to determine as a matter of law whether the interest that Congress in this case seeks to achieve is an important or a substantial one."
1996.95-1184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1189.102,1206.392,"Mr. Jenkins, on that point, I understand the portion of these marketing orders that deals with inspection quality controls, and nobody is contesting that everybody can be required to pay for the cost of inspecting and assuring health and safety standards."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1230.208,1233.861,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I just have a two-part answer to that."
1996.95-1184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1256.975,1267.613,"It may also help, but does it have the same importance as maturity standards and the inspection controls?"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1267.613,1292.719,"Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, under this Court's cases the question has not been, is the means toward the end as important, is one means as important as another, but first is the end important and then, secondly, does the means chosen advance the end, and so I think the record in this case does demonstrate that the end of orderly market conditions and sustained demand for these products is significantly advanced by the means that's chosen, including generic advertising."
1996.95-1184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1292.719,1302.444,"But your argument is on that, as I understand it, that we have generally accepted the proposition that advertising induces people to buy what is advertised."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1373.511,1376.185,"Justice Souter, let me answer the second part of your question first."
1996.95-1184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1406.453,1408.964,"It makes consumers buy them, is what you mean."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1408.964,1409.765,--That's correct.
1996.95-1184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1409.765,1410.085,Yes.
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1410.085,1425.796,"And both of the courts below found that, and that secondly, viewed in the context of this act, it provides the Secretary and the commodity committees with a tool for influencing consumer preferences, and I think it's the inevitable... the conclusion is inevitable that that aids in regulating market conditions."
1996.95-1184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1428.248,1435.752,"Well, I... it regulates only in the sense that it... we will assume that it creates some demand that would not have been there otherwise."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1464.732,1467.862,"--I think that's generally correct, but I would also note--"
1996.95-1184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1467.862,1470.574,"Isn't it fair to say... and I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1471.315,1476.35,"--Well, I was just going to say it's also the case that these markets are very different, so that if there is sufficient demand--"
1996.95-1184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1476.35,1477.8,But how do we know that?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1477.8,1483.844,"--We don't, Justice Souter, but as I've said, I don't think we need to know that in order to answer the question that's at issue here."
1996.95-1184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1483.844,1484.645,Mr. Jenkins--
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1505.549,1510.521,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think the record in the Frame case was quite similar, but the program was somewhat different."
1996.95-1184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1531.125,1546.054,"Am I wrong in having the impression that Congress made a determination with respect to the state of the meat market and said we have to respond to that terrible situation, and there were no such findings by the legislature here?"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1546.054,1548.686,"--I think with respect, Justice Ginsburg, that's incorrect."
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.193,1563.855,"But the question is whether Congress made the findings, not whether the district court did."
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1565.047,1566.848,--Congress was citing... pardon me.
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.78,1570.881,"Citing the findings, or--"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1570.881,1574.703,"--Was citing the Congressional Record reports, and--"
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1574.703,1579.855,"--Statements by... not the whole Congress, but by some individual Members of Congress?"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1579.855,1580.846,--Some were from reports--
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.846,1581.738,Committee reports?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1581.738,1582.298,--That's correct.
1996.95-1184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1582.298,1584.66,But there was no congressional finding?
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1584.66,1590.674,"Well, Your Honor, I think in the act itself there's a congressional finding that programs are necessary, that--"
1996.95-1184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1590.674,1603.951,"Programs, but is there anything... are you telling me that the record from Congress is comparable, that there was no more that Congress said about the meat industry than it said about the fruit industry?"
1996.95-1184,0,16292,alan_jenkins,,1603.951,1607.353,"--I think it is comparable, but I want to be specific, because I don't want to mislead the Court."
1996.95-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1647.641,1649.392,"Very well, Mr. Jenkins."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1651.302,1661.54,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1675.579,1678.221,Disorderly markets are the problem.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1678.221,1687.026,"Well, Justice Scalia, the Solicitor, in answering your question in that regard, I believe misspoke."
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1691.64,1692.268,So--
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1692.268,1695.892,"--and he cites the 1954 act, which doesn't deal with that subject whatsoever."
1996.95-1184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.155,1733.365,"--Just a minute, Mr. Campagne."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1733.365,1733.636,--Yes.
1996.95-1184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1733.636,1742.602,"That isn't terribly helpful to simply hold up a brief and say that Stipulation Number 59... we don't know what... if you want to make a point, make it so that we can all understand it."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1742.602,1743.413,"Very well, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1771.052,1771.891,Where is that?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1773.683,1773.864,Yes.
1996.95-1184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.27,1804.101,It doesn't say exclusively in what I'm reading.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1804.101,1808.656,"It says, as being the entire rulemaking record--"
1996.95-1184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1808.656,1809.497,"Oh, okay."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1809.497,1821.545,"--on the third line, Your Honor, regarding the implementation of the advertising record with respect to peaches, plums, and nectarines which occurred approximately 6 years after the act was amended."
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1823.916,1825.646,"Mr. Campagne, can I ask you a question?"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1825.646,1825.866,--Yes.
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1825.866,1829.76,"We basically have a constitutional question here, and there are an awful lot of details floating around."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1844.468,1847.061,"It would make a huge difference, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1847.061,1847.321,You do.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1847.321,1849.462,They would have an easier time with Central Hudson.
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1849.462,1852.864,So you're not saying this sort of program is always unconstitutional.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1852.864,1853.585,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1860.19,1863.453,Why can't Congress leave those findings to be made by the Secretary?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1865.183,1866.653,--But in this case--
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.653,1873.347,"Establishes a basic framework for a program and says if an executive officer finds a certain situation to exist, he can take certain actions."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1874.689,1879.733,"--In this case, Your Honor, I don't need to address that issue, although--"
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.733,1880.133,Sure you do.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1880.664,1881.112,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1996.95-1184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1908.961,1924.572,"Well, in connection with that, Mr. Campagne, you don't have to attack here the various health inspection provisions, the pro rata provisions, that sort of thing, and I take it you're not challenging the basic congressional authority to enact something like that."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1927.954,1928.523,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1940.651,1944.414,"Well, what is the difference between... you say what is the problem."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,1959.387,1960.496,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1960.496,1989.597,"So what is the First Amendment problem that your client has that wouldn't be shared by anybody who used to fly on the airlines and had to pay money in part for messages that they might have disagreed with that would have been spent by the Air Transport Association required by the Civil Aeronautics Board, or exactly the same thing in the utilities industry, or the trucking industry, or any taxpayer who pays taxes which then is spent by the Government on messages they disagree with?"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2009.91,2018.265,"Your Honor, we would have no objection whatsoever if the Secretary of Agriculture was taking money out of the General Treasury and--"
1996.95-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2018.265,2037.156,"No, no, they didn't... I'm saying the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Interstate Commerce Commission... I mean, I thought the Constitution would permit the public, mistaken or not, to have regulatory systems to regulate every industry, perhaps, if they wanted to, to have a nonfree enterprise system perhaps if they didn't want to."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2074.581,2078.475,"--The First Amendment issue, Your Honor, is two-pronged."
1996.95-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2105.002,2113.447,"Well then, you would point out, I suppose, that you're not objecting to expenditure of money for advertising or for any other purpose by the Government."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2117.459,2118.07,--No.
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.043,2138.664,"So it's not Government speech, which would pose a different issue, so we can get rid of a whole lot of those regulatory programs that Justice Breyer was referring to, and only limit ourselves to those in which a privately run organization spends money that is assessed against competitors."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2140.046,2145.408,"--But the point I was trying to make, Your Honor, here we have absolutely no studies whatsoever."
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2156.475,2162.59,"It seems to me your argument is they did a lousy job here, but if they'd done a good job, it would be constitutional."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2162.59,2170.875,"--If they could meet the Central Hudson test, which was the test they stipulated to before the Ninth Circuit in Cal-Almond--"
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2170.875,2172.237,"Yes, but we're not bound by that."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2200.964,2201.575,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2201.575,2201.886,What?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2201.886,2205.378,Some of our clients testified they don't sponsor lying.
1996.95-1184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2206.347,2207.219,They don't sponsor what?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2207.219,2208.17,--Lying.
1996.95-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.082,2246.805,Is that the picture of this little girl running in a sprinkler eating a nectarine?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2246.805,2257.752,"--And the radio that says so juicy, so sweet, a radio advertisement right afterwards that says eating a peach reminds you of your first kiss in the back seat of your car."
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2268.057,2272.681,"Well, there's nothing in words to that effect in the ads, is there?"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2272.681,2273.611,"--No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2280.726,2290.874,"Well, would you be here at all if the advertising were in fact generic advertising for California fruit?"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2290.874,2294.865,"--Well, first of all they'd have to define to me, Your Honor, in some--"
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2294.865,2296.558,Or is there some problem here?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2296.558,2299.369,"--what the problem... that's the point, exactly."
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2299.369,2299.74,"Well, what?"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2299.74,2300.609,I don't know--
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2300.609,2310.115,I'm trying to understand what it is you say causes or results in a First Amendment violation here.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2311.366,2323.483,"--They take almost a million dollars a year, give it to my competitors to advertise 15 varieties of fruit we don't grow, and force us to associate with our competitors in a manner--"
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2323.483,2325.506,Don't you represent handlers?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2325.506,2328.988,"--I represent handlers/shippers, but there's a big distinction, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2343.188,2350.721,"Well, of course, you're forced to associate, using your term, by the terms of the marketing order anyway."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2393.801,2394.532,Because what--
1996.95-1184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2394.532,2397.513,"You're already associated, whether you like it or not."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2397.513,2404.807,"--In 1959, when they promulgated marketing orders for quality control there was no problem."
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2440.791,2443.312,I didn't know you were here on some APA claim.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2462.964,2465.906,"That's absolutely what I was trying to express, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2465.906,2479.496,"Well, that's odd, because I thought that there isn't much difference between an assessment or any other fee or tax that Government might take, which necessarily, of course, limits your funds for advertising."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2480.606,2482.148,"Yes, but, Your Honor--"
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2482.148,2485.351,Do you cite a case from this Court to support you on that?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2485.351,2488.683,"--Yes, PG&E, and that is that you're taking our money--"
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2488.683,2489.634,PG&E.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2489.634,2489.743,--Yes.
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2489.743,2491.085,Do you have a citation for that?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2491.085,2491.345,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2549.181,2555.936,Do you say that your growers do not... that your clients do not grow peaches or nectarines?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2555.936,2566.663,"--Our clients grow peaches, plums, and nectarines, but there's over 100 varieties of each peach, plum, and nectarine, unlike beef and unlike milk, where--"
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2566.663,2569.204,You don't believe that all California peaches are the same.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2569.204,2570.586,--Absolutely not.
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.586,2574.569,And that is the message that this advertising conveys to the public.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2574.569,2575.588,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2575.588,2579.06,So they're conveying precisely the message that you want to counter.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2579.06,2582.273,"They're conveying... exactly, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2582.273,2601.286,"And your associational objection, as I take it, is not an objection to simply being regulated with everybody else, associated on that basis, but rather the objection of being presented to the public as in league with everybody else: All us California peach-growers are the same."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2607.589,2608.871,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2608.871,2610.511,"You don't like some of these other peach-growers, do you?"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2610.731,2616.498,We want you to buy our yellow nectarines and not their red nectarines.
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2616.824,2618.527,Mr. Campagne--
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2622.308,2626.512,"It would be... that's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2627.133,2636.64,"And if the advertising was limited to those features of the California peaches that were, in fact, common to all California peaches, you would not have a problem."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2636.64,2645.826,"--If they could establish that California had a problem which the Government had an interest in solving, but there is no record whatsoever--"
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2645.826,2646.785,"Well, assume they could do that."

1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2677.085,2678.656,"Well, it doesn't have to be in collapse, does it?"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2678.976,2681.347,"--Well, in Frame they stipulated--"
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2681.347,2682.839,"--I mean, they've got all sorts of marketing orders where the--"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2682.839,2688.023,--that the meat industry was in imminent danger of collapse and they assessed--
1996.95-1184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2688.023,2690.954,--Are you saying that that's the bottom line that they must show?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2739.266,2740.805,"--We're saying both, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2762.33,2764.131,"But may I interrupt again, Mr. Campagne?"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2797.683,2803.738,"Under that hypothetical of course, Your Honor, if there was a compelling governmental interest to solve some serious problem--"
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.738,2804.189,Right.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2804.189,2809.222,"--and we only grew one variety in all the States, the answer would be that 3 percent would be bad."
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2814.594,2820.488,"Yes, but what if the Secretary of Agriculture made a lot of findings saying a peach is a peach, to add--"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2820.488,2821.59,"They haven't made any such findings, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2833.948,2835.86,--With reference to the marketing--
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2841.795,2843.876,"--I'm sorry, I couldn't hear the end of--"
1996.95-1184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.876,2849.429,"I'm trying to figure out whether the program is just sort of per se bad, or has it just been poorly administered."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2855.803,2861.817,"--This particular program on this particular 19 days of trial record, it was tainted from the very beginning."
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.021,2869.283,But this is not an APA problem.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2876.446,2877.388,Just like Turner.
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2877.388,2879.429,As is not required in some other areas.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2879.429,2880.01,Exactly.
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.01,2881.9,You must demonstrate the compelling interest.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2881.9,2887.233,For over 20 years they didn't produce any studies or any reports showing that California--
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.233,2892.518,"We keep drifting away from the First Amendment, and it does get to sound like an Administrative Procedure Act problem, but that is not your point."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2899.45,2900.322,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2900.322,2912.861,"Of course, to the extent that the marketing order without the promotional aspects of it helps everybody to market their peaches, I suppose you're helping to market Red Jim through the marketing order."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2912.861,2913.502,Yes.
1996.95-1184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2913.502,2924.058,"And given the fact that you are therefore in a common marketing entity anyway, it seems to me to much diminish your First Amendment claim."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2924.058,2925.069,I don't believe so.
1996.95-1184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2925.069,2939.939,"Whether you like it or not, big growers may be helping smaller growers to market their products, and maybe that's not cost-effective for you and you'd rather have something else, but you begin with the premise that this is a valid program."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2939.939,2942.21,"But you're forgetting a very key important point, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2977.663,2990.463,"Well, don't you also distinguish between regulations which don't have any speech import to them, like quality and so on, plus some sort of regulation that forces you to spend money for speech?"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,2990.463,2991.771,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2991.771,2995.285,I agree with you that a peach is not a peach.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3061.859,3063.028,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3096.3,3103.824,"Well, that may well have been an error, as the Government conceded in its argument, but you don't overturn the whole program, I suppose."
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3105.076,3108.068,"--But it's inherent to the entire system, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3108.068,3120.737,"Well, are there other examples where in these advertisements a single proprietary item that no one else could acquire was advertised by name, and if so, what, and where?"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3120.737,3122.918,"The May Belle nectarine, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3122.918,3123.588,Excuse me?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3123.588,3124.838,The May Belle nectarine.
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3124.838,3128.251,And it was specifically referred to in the ad?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3128.251,3128.461,Yes.
1996.95-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3128.461,3128.922,Where?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3128.922,3130.063,I believe in the very same exhibit.
1996.95-1184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3130.063,3131.834,Weren't these peaches--
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3131.834,3135.586,It's in that same section.
1996.95-1184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3136.646,3138.558,--Weren't the peaches selected because of the volume?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3152.507,3153.038,--Yes.
1996.95-1184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3165.416,3167.487,So it was based on volume.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3167.487,3175.532,"--They're spending all of their TV and radio advertising money on eat California peaches because they're all the same before July 4, 80 percent of the money."
1996.95-1184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3177.733,3184.207,"Was there a finding to that effect, that that's the necessary purport of those ads, or can we just tell it from the... from reading the ads?"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3184.207,3187.33,"--There's a finding to that effect in Judge Baker's decision, Your Honor."
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3187.33,3187.84,Mr.--
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3196.235,3197.918,Are the same.
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3197.918,3199.047,Are the same?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3199.047,3199.388,Yes.
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3199.388,3200.009,And--
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3200.89,3202.27,And she further--
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3202.27,3203.041,And you object to that.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3207.702,3209.214,"--Absolutely, because that's not truthful."
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3209.875,3210.865,"Well, that... but isn't there another reason--"
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3210.865,3217.159,"--that you ought to buy green plums and give them to your wife, and you're thinking to yourself right now you don't want to give your wife diarrhea, but green plums--"
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3217.159,3217.86,--Green plums?
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3227.226,3230.237,"--Because, Your Honor, we have almost $6 million in trust--"
1996.95-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3230.237,3231.628,Greengage.
1996.95-1184,1,42555,thomas_e_campagne,,3231.628,3241.736,"--and the Ninth Circuit ordered that there would be a determination as to whether or not those moneys that we related to plums from 1987 through 1991, so plums are still relevant."
1996.95-1184,2,16292,alan_jenkins,,3392.394,3397.198,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1184,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3470.776,3472.537,Does anything in the law prevent bias?
1996.95-1184,2,16292,alan_jenkins,,3488.909,3492.122,"I think so, Justice Scalia, as a practical matter."
1996.95-1184,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3492.122,3492.73,What provision is that?
1996.95-1184,2,16292,alan_jenkins,,3492.73,3494.162,May I complete my answer?
1996.95-1184,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3494.162,3494.553,Yes.
1996.95-1184,2,16292,alan_jenkins,,3494.553,3503.108,The AMAA provides that the Secretary must find that particular activities are... tend to effectuate the goals of the act.
