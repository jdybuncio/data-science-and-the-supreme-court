2015.14-361,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.89,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-361, Ocasio v. United States. Mr. Davis."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,7.89,14.41,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Hobbs Act requires that a defendant obtain property from another."
2015.14-361,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,48.165,76.215,"Does that mean that you would have to -- in order to get at this -- this venture, you would have to bring two separate prosecutions, one against your client for the extortion, and then a separate crime -- a separate prosecution in State court against the body shop owners?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,76.215,79.69,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I think that is correct."
2015.14-361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,97.5,110.56,"Is it -- is it well established, or even not well established, that you are obtaining property under color of law when you give somebody a bribe?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,110.56,111.56,Your Honor --
2015.14-361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,111.56,120.185,"It seems to me -- what that means to me under color of law is you -- you pretend to have a legal right to it, which in fact you don't have."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,120.185,133.49,"Justice Scalia, until 1992, I think that was an open question, but this Court decided in Evans v. United States in '92 that Hobbs Act extortion encompasses the paying of -- of bribes."
2015.14-361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,133.49,138.97,"I dissented, I assume. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,138.97,140.1,You did.
2015.14-361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.39,160.16,"Well, we have stated that a person may be liable for conspiracy even though he was incapable of committing the substantive offense."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,166.92,169.48,"I think that's distinguishable in principle, Justice Kennedy."
2015.14-361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,169.48,170.345,And why?
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,170.345,176.53,"Well, certainly not every conspirator must personally commit every element of the substantive offense."
2015.14-361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,176.53,182.55,"But he might not even be capable of it, must not even be capable of it, as I understand what we've said."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,182.55,194.465,"That's correct, Your Honor. Must -- need not even be capable of committing every element of the substantive offense, but each conspirator must specifically intend that someone commit every element of the substantive offense."
2015.14-361,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,194.93,205.15,"Well, why isn't that test satisfied here, because the shop owners agreed that Mr. Ocasio would commit every element of the substantive offense?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,205.15,211.48,"The shop owners, Your Honor, agree that Mr. Ocasio would obtain property from another, not from themselves."
2015.14-361,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,212.73,217.885,"Well, the -- the -- Mr. Ocasio is committing every element of the substantive offense."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,234.77,237.17,"Justice Kagan, I don't think that's quite right."
2015.14-361,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,252.8,261.335,"They only need to agree that he should obtain property from another, and that is exactly what they agreed to."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,261.335,267.67,"Justice Kagan, I think the best way to approach your question is through imagining how this would happen in ordinary English."
2015.14-361,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,290.47,307.36,"Is that any stranger than the Mann Act situation, where the woman who is being transported across State lines for immoral purposes, conspires with the person who is transporting her across State lines? That's permissible, isn't it?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,307.36,309.04,"Justice Alito, I think yes, it is."
2015.14-361,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,318.79,330.76,"Well, ""any woman"" is broader than ""another woman."" ""Any woman"" means any of 3.5 billion-plus women in the world, and that subsumes ""another woman,"" doesn't it?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,330.76,331.97,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2015.14-361,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,347.53,378.88,"Well, they're two different words, but the syntactical problem seems to me to be identical, which is that it's just not natural to say that the transported woman is herself transporting any woman, right? I mean, the transported woman is not transporting any woman. But the reason the Court said that a conspiracy was possible there was because the transported woman could agree with another person, let's say, the man, that the man would transport any woman, namely, herself."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,382.34,383.6,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2015.14-361,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,421.455,432.535,"What difference did it make in this -- you're -- you're not contesting the extortion convictions, right? You -- it's only the conspiracy; is that right?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,432.535,445.815,"That's correct, Your Honor, with an asterisk, and that is if we were to prevail here, we would go back to the Fourth Circuit and ask to vacate the substantive convictions also on the basis of spillover prejudice. But for purposes of this appeal, you're correct."
2015.14-361,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,445.815,456.315,And did the addition of the conspiracy conviction affect the sentence? Would it have been different if there had been no conspiracy charge.
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,456.315,458.55,"Your Honor, the sentences ran concurrently."
2015.14-361,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,470.125,477.325,"I have a small question, but not unimportant, which is: Who paid the bribe, Majestic or the brothers?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,477.325,480.14,"The brothers paid the bribes, Your Honor, out of --"
2015.14-361,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,480.14,482.08,"Out of their own pockets, or did they --"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,482.08,482.53,Out of the --
2015.14-361,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,482.53,484.705,"-- Majestic, issue a check?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,484.705,486.75,"Out of the Majestic bank account, Your Honor."
2015.14-361,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,486.75,489.675,So why isn't Majestic the other person here?
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,489.675,499.55,"Your Honor, the government forfeited any argument that Majestic is the ""another"" by not raising it at any -- at any stage in this Court, in -- either in its cert stage briefing or in the --"
2015.14-361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,499.55,503.37,Was Majestic a separate corporation or was it just the proprietorship-owned?
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,503.37,506.93,The record is a little unclear on that point.
2015.14-361,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,535.43,547.595,"Well, Moreno and Mejia are two -- are two people; they're not the same person, right? So I assume even if it was -- let's say it was a partnership, they each would be entitled to half of the money, right?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,547.595,549.22,I think that's -- that's correct.
2015.14-361,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,549.22,557.73,So Moreno could conspire with Ocasio to obtain money from Mejia and Mejia could conspire with Ocasio to obtain money from Moreno.
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,557.73,563.4,"Your Honor, I don't think that that theory works in this case because the bribes came from them jointly."
2015.14-361,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,570.95,577.285,Did this government argue this proposition as its theory of the case in the trial court or here?
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,577.285,579.31,"No, not that theory of the case, Your Honor."
2015.14-361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.31,592.4,"You -- you acknowledge that the -- that the police officer is -- is guilty of a violation of the Hobbs Act, never mind the conspiracy, but just the Hobbs Act violation."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,592.4,595.59,"We're not directly challenging that here, Your Honor."
2015.14-361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.59,613.71,"Well, if you don't -- if you don't challenge that here, I -- as I recall, your briefs say that to disagree with you in this case is to establish a Federal law of bribery for the whole country."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,625.12,630.785,"Justice Scalia, on one side of the transaction, yes, on the public official side of the transaction."
2015.14-361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,632.06,638.625,"Well, that's all you need to have a national law against bribery, it seems to me. You just get one of the two, I don't think you have to get both."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,638.625,653.1,"Well, Your Honor, if -- if this Court were to extend Evans in this case to cover not only the public official side of the transaction but also the private citizen side of the transaction, that would be a dramatic expansion of the law of bribery."
2015.14-361,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,663.985,678.925,"What about -- what do you do with the government's argument that Ocasio was conspiring with other police officers to get the money from another? In other words, that conspiracy got money from another, the -- the two individuals."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,678.925,680.54,"Two responses to that, Your Honor."
2015.14-361,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,723.125,729.51,"I think if I'm remembering the government's response to your first point, is that it certainly would have been harmless error in this case."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,729.51,732.915,"Your Honor, I find that response a little difficult to understand."
2015.14-361,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,776.42,788.09,Is there any difference to your argument based on the government's position that your client was charged under the general conspiracy statute and not the Hobbs Act statute?
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,788.09,790.8,"Justice Sotomayor, no, I don't think it makes a difference."
2015.14-361,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,811.925,816.575,"That's my problem, which is it's not an extra step."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,831.745,840.6,"Well, under the general conspiracy statute, just like under the Hobbs Act, Your Honor, every conspirator has to specifically intend that someone commit every element of the crime."
2015.14-361,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,841.535,856.825,"Well, is that -- that begs Justice Kagan's question, which is they wanted Ocasio -- they wanted the police officer to act under color of right and to take the bribe."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,856.825,868.62,"And I think the key problem with that, Your Honor, is that the repair shop owners did not intend to help Ocasio obtain property from another. They intended to help Ocasio obtain property from themselves."
2015.14-361,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,883.59,884.77,"No, I don't think that's right."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,910.1,915.51,"Your Honor, I think that, again, the repair shop owners did not intend to obtain property from another."
2015.14-361,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,916.52,921.865,They intended and they agreed that Mr. Ocasio should obtain property from another.
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,923.56,940.89,"Your Honor, I think going back to how that kind of conversation would happen in ordinary English is a way to see why it's not plausible to read the statute like that. If the repair shop owners go to Ocasio and say, I want to help you obtain property from another, Ocasio would think that they're talking about someone else."
2015.14-361,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,943.34,949.045,"It's a statute, and the statute just says the other has to be somebody different from Ocasio himself."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,991.81,1000.6,"Your Honor, even if that's a plausible interpretation of the statute, which we don't think it is, it's definitely not the most natural way to read it."
2015.14-361,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1029.14,1039.29,"What about aiding and abetting? Could the brothers who own the body shop, could they -- could they be charged with aiding and abetting --"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1039.29,1040.78,Justice Ginsburg --
2015.14-361,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1040.78,1041.805,-- the extortion?
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1041.805,1044.815,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't think that they could."
2015.14-361,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1061.365,1081.89,"Is it -- is it extortion or attempted extortion? If two brothers, as here, try to get money from a third party and the third party really wants to give them the money -- say, for example, he wants to give them the money because he's going to illustrate how awful the police are in that town."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1108.545,1119.305,"Your Honor, this Court has defined extortion in Evans to mean -- to basically mean when a public official takes a bribe, and, you know, we take that holding as a given."
2015.14-361,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1119.305,1128.29,"He takes a bribe, all right? Is it -- is it a bribe when the person just showers him with money, hoping for nothing illegal?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1128.29,1128.87,No.
2015.14-361,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1128.87,1132.855,"He might think it's a bribe, but -- but is it?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1132.855,1133.61,"Well, Your Honor, there has --"
2015.14-361,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1133.61,1138.07,He voluntarily gives him the money expecting joy and happiness.
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1142.55,1151.02,"Well, Your Honor, I think if he just gave him -- showered him with gifts not expecting anything, it would not be extortion because there has to be a quid pro quo."
2015.14-361,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1157.3,1157.52,All right.
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1189.39,1190.035,I don't --
2015.14-361,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1190.035,1191.63,Because they are showering with money.
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1193.005,1196.1,"Your Honor, we're not taking direct aim at Evans."
2015.14-361,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1196.38,1200.83,"I know that, but, I mean, how you're asking me to make that distinction, how do I do it?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1200.83,1206.47,"Well, Your Honor, I think Evans dealt with a substantive offense, and this case deals with conspiracy."
2015.14-361,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1257.53,1266.865,"Well, before -- I mean, the government says, of course, is there's -- there's consent and there's consent, and they suggest that there's a difference between consent and conspiracy."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1267.725,1268.465,Right.
2015.14-361,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1268.465,1270.125,"Well, what's your answer to that?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1270.125,1272.0,"Well, we agree with that, Your Honor."
2015.14-361,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1290.27,1293.165,And what payment of a bribe is not extortion?
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1293.165,1295.05,"I -- I agree, Your Honor."
2015.14-361,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1295.29,1295.65,All right.
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1304.37,1305.005,I think --
2015.14-361,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1305.005,1305.87,Is that --
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1305.87,1308.175,"I don't think that's quite right, Your Honor."
2015.14-361,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.175,1312.35,Works for me. (Laughter.)
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1312.35,1316.48,"I -- I think that is a ground, Your Honor."
2015.14-361,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1339.8,1342.84,"Mr. Davis, if you could go back to what you just said about the consent."
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1393.885,1397.27,"Justice Kagan, I don't disagree with you, but with an asterisk."
2015.14-361,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1489.45,1507.425,Is it fair to say that you are advancing an argument that is limited to the precise language of the Hobbs Act? You -- you are not taking issue with the proposition that a person can conspire to commit offense that the person could not personally commit.
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1525.45,1526.46,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-361,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1536.68,1545.24,"And if another substantive offense doesn't have the word ""obtain property from"" -- the phrase ""obtain property from another,"" then your -- your rule doesn't apply?"
2015.14-361,0,62592,ethan_p_davis,,1545.24,1547.0,"I think that's generally right, Your Honor."
2015.14-361,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1571.42,1582.22,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kedem."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1582.22,1596.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A conspiracy is an agreement to commit an offense against the United States, that is, a joint commitment to a plan that, if completed, would satisfy all elements of the substantive offense."
2015.14-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1619.065,1630.88,"Do -- do you agree that under your approach, every private individual who seeks to bribe a State official is liable for conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act extortion?"
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1630.88,1631.69,We don't.
2015.14-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1708.205,1715.74,"Well, suppose he arranges to meet on the park bench at 2:00 o'clock, and has a follow-up call to the official to please be there."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1716.9,1724.37,"I think that would be incidental to the one thing that they're really agreeing to do, which is to turn over the money. But contrast that with what happened in this case."
2015.14-361,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1757.125,1759.24,How do you charge that to a jury?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1759.24,1760.025,Pardon?
2015.14-361,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1760.025,1761.53,How do you charge it to a jury?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1761.53,1771.06,"I think you would tell the jury two things. First, in order for a bribe pair to be a conspirator, they have to agree to actively participate in the plan. And second --"
2015.14-361,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1771.06,1780.81,"Well, I mean, I'm a juror and I say, I -- police officer came to me, asked me for 20 bucks, and he'll let me go for my ticket."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1783.99,1793.375,"The second one is that you would have to tell the jury that if all you've agreed to do is to turn over money in return for official acts, then that by itself is insufficient."
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.375,1793.72,Okay.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1822.355,1822.69,Well --
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1822.69,1829.84,"Except to make it up to sweeten the deal, so that -- so that we -- we don't extend this -- this law too far."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1829.84,1837.665,"Active participation comes from Holte and Gebardi, and it's also notable that the government didn't make up the requirement for purposes of this case."
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.09,1845.235,And where did they get it from?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1845.235,1845.85,They get it from --
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1845.85,1847.925,And where did Holte and Gebardi get it from?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1847.925,1855.54,I think Holte and Gebardi see it as a gloss on the type of agreement that's necessary to make a particular person a conspirator.
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1855.54,1858.35,But that's not what conspiracy law says.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1872.705,1887.18,"In this -- in this Court's case in Abuelhawa, which is cited at footnote 8 in our brief, the Court also relied on Gebardi to raise the level of facilitation that would be required for a drug purchaser to be held liable for facilitating the sale of a drug."
2015.14-361,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1887.18,1887.74,But I -- I --
2015.14-361,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1887.74,1894.04,Where is the -- the active participation point in the jury instructions?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1894.04,1913.81,"It's not in the jury instructions because Petitioner never requested it, despite the fact that active participation was already the law in the Fourth Circuit. I would also point out that it was Petitioner's argument that it simply doesn't matter how actively a bribe pair facilitates the extortion. Moreover, there was no dispute in this case that Moreno and Mejia made an active role."
2015.14-361,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1929.69,1930.15,So if --
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.15,1931.285,That makes sense to me.
2015.14-361,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1931.285,1941.295,"If -- if I could just understand what you're saying, you think active participation is more than an agreement along the typical conspiracy lines."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1941.295,1946.33,I think normally agreeing to the bare outlines of the crime would be sufficient for most conspirators.
2015.14-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1946.76,1947.285,Would -- would?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1947.285,1953.5,"Would, that's correct. But I think active participation is a way to raise the threshold --"
2015.14-361,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1953.5,1953.59,Right.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1953.77,1954.39,-- certain types of crimes.
2015.14-361,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1954.39,1967.25,"-- this does sound more like an aiding and abetting standard than it does a conspiracy standard, because typically in conspiracy we say it doesn't really matter if you actively participate, as long as you reach an agreement."
2015.14-361,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1967.25,1975.05,"Now that agreement is more than acquiescence, right? It's more than I reluctantly give you the bribe that you're demanding of me."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1975.05,1976.38,That's right.
2015.14-361,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1976.38,1992.35,But -- but I guess I'm with Justice Scalia that I don't really quite understand how to get from the typical real agreement that we require in conspiracy cases to some higher standard with respect to this crime of active participation.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,1992.35,1997.865,I think it's a gloss on what you have to agree to do in order to be considered a conspirator.
2015.14-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2047.08,2057.07,"The -- the answer, as I understand this now, the purpose of this active participation doctrine is let's look at the substantive offense."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2073.35,2073.9,That's right.
2015.14-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.9,2074.2,Okay.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2074.2,2074.43,But --
2015.14-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2074.43,2082.95,"So now what you're going to do is you're going to make not only them guilty of the Federal crime, you're going to make anybody who pays them guilty of the Federal crime."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2130.625,2131.54,I think that's correct.
2015.14-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.74,2132.01,Okay.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2133.53,2133.87,That's --
2015.14-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2133.87,2138.99,The argument on his side is don't make a bad situation worse.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2138.99,2139.59,Well --
2015.14-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2139.59,2147.97,"We already are federalizing vast numbers of State crimes, which really are the States' business."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2163.975,2166.86,"I think under active participation, you wouldn't be doing that."
2015.14-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2166.86,2167.66,I understand.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2167.66,2169.1,I would also point --
2015.14-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2169.1,2171.15,What I'm interested in is if I understand it correctly.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2171.15,2178.95,"I think you do, Your Honor. I would also point out that the argument he makes with regard to ""from another"" has nothing in particular to do with the Hobbs Act."
2015.14-361,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2184.71,2187.945,"Well, before you do, I'm still stuck on the jury instructions."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2208.73,2209.18,That's --
2015.14-361,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2209.18,2210.495,"-- ""the jury was instructed."""
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2210.495,2215.03,"That was given -- given the jury, but I think that's the standard conspiracy instruction."
2015.14-361,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2215.03,2233.245,"Well, on page 194, it says, ""The extent of a defendant's participation has no bearing on the issue of his guilt."" And I just wondered whether your -- it's active participation. That suggests to me something that goes to the extent of the defendant's participation."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2233.245,2233.74,That's right.
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.71,2329.38,I'm afraid you haven't scared me.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2349.135,2349.82,I don't --
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2349.82,2351.4,-- to point a gun at another.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2351.4,2359.01,"I don't think, Justice Scalia, you would say, give me the money or I'll kill my friend. I think the friend would pretend to be a customer in the bank."
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.01,2359.465,Sure.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2360.3,2365.52,And I think the two of them would have formed the plan in order to accomplish the aggravated robbery.
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2365.52,2369.58,And I would not think that that's a conspiracy to point a gun at another.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2369.58,2371.09,"Well, Justice --"
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2371.09,2374.405,It's a conspiracy to point a gun between themselves.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2374.405,2379.345,"Justice Scalia, I think that only is true if you judge each element of the offense --"
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.345,2380.07,"No, I understand --"
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2380.07,2381.45,-- with regard to the conspiracy.
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2381.45,2384.0,-- but you were trying to present a clear example.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2384.0,2384.38,Sure.
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2384.38,2386.7,And it doesn't seem to me very clear at all.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2386.7,2398.21,"Justice Scalia, we cite about a half dozen other Federal statutes that also similarly use phrases like ""from another"" and ""to another"" that would be similarly affected by Petitioner's argument. I would also like to --"
2015.14-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2398.21,2406.83,"But the other reason your hypothetical doesn't work too well is we know that he's not going to pull the gun because he's his friend, but in this case the money is going to be given."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2408.38,2419.555,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I would point you then to the statute that we cite that talks about someone who is a government official who receives coded, secret information from another and provides it to another."
2015.14-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2516.495,2531.355,"Well, is it -- if -- what -- I'm still -- a crime requires that the victim give consent."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2581.41,2582.22,Justice Breyer --
2015.14-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2582.22,2588.74,So how can you be conspiring to -- to do something to get a consent that was already given?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2588.74,2589.72,Justice Breyer --
2015.14-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2589.72,2595.715,"You could conspire to attempt to get it, but not to get it, if you're being really picky on these words."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2595.715,2607.22,"The issue of consent is really a red herring in this case, because as my friend just stated, consent from the common law for extortion falls well below the meeting of the minds that you would need for conspiratorial agreement."
2015.14-361,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2629.35,2636.05,"You haven't talked about Majestic yet, and your friend said that's maybe because you had never raised that below."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2641.21,2642.15,That's not accurate.
2015.14-361,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2653.665,2657.82,Was that just -- was that in your brief in opposition to certiorari?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2657.82,2667.02,"We talked about the fact that in this case you could look at Majestic as another, and we talked about that in the context of the Brock case out of the Sixth Circuit, but we're not --"
2015.14-361,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2667.02,2669.505,Is Majestic a sole proprietorship?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2669.505,2675.265,"It started out as an LLC, but became a corporation, as cited in footnote 1 of our brief."
2015.14-361,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2675.265,2678.895,Was it indicted as part of this crime?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2678.895,2684.59,"It wasn't indicted, but it was in the indictment stated that money came from Majestic."
2015.14-361,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2684.59,2695.41,"You do say in your brief that if we adopt the Petitioner's argument, that basically you would never have any cases."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2727.135,2727.73,I don't --
2015.14-361,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2727.73,2733.595,"I think, as one of my colleagues said, there was a conspiracy here to get money from the victims."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2733.595,2765.375,"I don't think, Justice Sotomayor, that our argument is you would never have instances in which the conspiracy provision would apply. I think what we're saying is, this is precisely the type of scenario in which conspiracy liability should attach. And I think there may be a sense by some that clever prosecutors, maybe in some cases, are pushing the bounds of conspiracy law beyond where they're -- traditionally have gone, and using it in ways that perhaps are not warranted. Whatever the merits of that criticism as a general matter, this is not that case."
2015.14-361,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2779.37,2783.155,You had no other substantive crime to charge against the brothers?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2783.155,2790.86,"The brothers also pled guilty to aiding and abetting extortion which, under Petitioner's theory, would not have been possible."
2015.14-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2790.86,2799.005,"Why didn't you just charge them with getting money from the customers? I mean, that's who -- they're conspiring -- after all, they're giving $150 to the policeman."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2805.79,2806.22,That's correct.
2015.14-361,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2806.81,2808.125,So those are the other people.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2819.615,2841.88,"That is true, Justice Breyer, but they didn't necessarily commit a crime against the customer if all they did is repair the customer's car. Now, they did also commit various forms of insurance fraud, but put that to the side. In this scheme, if all they did was get money from a customer and fix the car as promised, then they would not have committed a crime necessarily against the customer."
2015.14-361,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2841.88,2853.89,"And, indeed, isn't it right that what Justice Breyer is saying was the very theory behind Evans, why this was extortion, is because the real crime was to the public at large, not to any particular customer."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2858.235,2858.98,That's correct.
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2867.81,2873.0,"And the Federal government's interest in this case, right, the reason is -- is, what?"
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2873.0,2874.02,"Well, Justice Scalia --"
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2874.02,2878.34,That automobiles are instruments of interstate commerce?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2878.34,2888.09,"Justice Scalia, I think Evans settled that the mere receipt of a bribe in return for performing officials acts is, in fact, extortion."
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2890.51,2896.71,"Oh, oh, it doesn't have to be any -- any Federal constitutional authority, just --"
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2896.71,2898.72,There does have the to be constitutional authority.
2015.14-361,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2898.72,2902.54,"Well, what is it? I mean, here, it is -- I assume that it's automobiles."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2902.54,2910.355,"That's -- well, Justice Scalia, it's affecting commerce and there was evidence at trial that, for instance, insurance payments came from out of State."
2015.14-361,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2935.325,2947.615,"You -- you agree with your friend's point, though, that charging the conspiracy gives the prosecutor considerably broader range in the evidence that he wants to admit at trial?"
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2947.615,2955.72,"I think that that does sometimes happen, but that's a general principle that has no specific relation to the argument that Petitioner is making in this case."
2015.14-361,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2955.72,2978.255,What is the relationship between that argument and the question of whether there's a conspiracy between Ocasio and Moreno and Mejia? It might apply to the conspiracy between -- the alleged conspiracy between Ocasio and the other police officers because it -- although it could allow the -- make it easier to admit evidence of what the other police officers did.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2978.255,2979.11,That's right.
2015.14-361,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2979.11,2989.895,But what -- it has no -- whether or not there was a conspiracy between Ocasio and Moreno and Mejia doesn't seem to me to have anything -- anything to do with what evidence would be admissible at trial.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,2989.895,2991.16,"That's right, Justice Alito."
2015.14-361,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2991.16,2992.54,"Well, I thought you told me that was wrong."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3003.18,3025.41,"It does -- it does, Mr. Chief Justice, but that would still have been true even if Moreno and Mejia were not charged as co-conspirators because there was voluminous evidence -- and we cited in the last portion of our brief -- that Petitioner conspired with other police officers as well. For instance, he was recruited into the scheme by another police officer, probably Officer Rodriguez, who was indicted along with him."
2015.14-361,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3025.41,3031.04,Do you -- do you agree that the most that that gets you is a remand to address the Skilling question?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3031.04,3031.545,We don't.
2015.14-361,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3070.115,3078.395,And -- and is it a sufficiency -- I would have thought it's a statutory interpretation challenge and not simply a sufficiency of the evidence challenge.
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3078.395,3091.1,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think there was a specific instruction to the jury one way or another about whether they either could or couldn't find it just based on Moreno and Mejia."
2015.14-361,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3106.205,3125.04,"Well, on that I guess your -- your friend says that the whole thrust of the case you presented was based on the conspiracy between the two brothers and the officer rather than the spokes, I guess is the jargon, involving the different officers with Ocasio."
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3126.115,3127.18,We don't think that's true.
2015.14-361,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3145.74,3158.295,"Isn't that just harmless error, assuming we agree with your -- your -- with the Petitioner and say the other has to be somebody else?"
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3158.295,3164.584,"We don't think that it's harmless error, but I do take your point that it's an alternative grounds for holding for the government."
2015.14-361,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3164.584,3167.74,So you think it's sufficiency?
2015.14-361,1,56065,allon_kedem,,3167.74,3168.58,I do.
2015.14-361,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3175.29,3181.41,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Davis, you have four minutes remaining."
2015.14-361,2,62592,ethan_p_davis,,3181.41,3182.52,Thank you.
2015.14-361,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3198.65,3201.595,But did you challenge the instructions in the district court as well?
2015.14-361,2,62592,ethan_p_davis,,3201.595,3213.395,"We challenged the jury instructions in the district court, yes, Your Honor. There was an objection raised to the government's proposed instructions there. I'd like to turn to the active participant standard."
2015.14-361,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3264.08,3270.455,"Will you, in your answer, get to what I think is the main point; the main point being, look, two policemen and a shop owner."
2015.14-361,2,62592,ethan_p_davis,,3288.06,3288.72,I think --
2015.14-361,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3288.72,3300.76,"-- the shopkeeper is helping the policemen do what is the thing that counts as extortion and, therefore, he's conspired with them. That's their very simple argument."
2015.14-361,2,62592,ethan_p_davis,,3302.935,3306.67,"The simple answer is that's not consistent with how -- with ordinary English, Your Honor."
2015.14-361,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3313.3,3313.45,Yes.
2015.14-361,2,62592,ethan_p_davis,,3316.385,3317.02,Only if --
2015.14-361,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3317.02,3319.87,That's -- that's what this other case says.
2015.14-361,2,62592,ethan_p_davis,,3323.6,3328.47,I think the only way the government can make that sound plausible is by adding words to the statute --
2015.14-361,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3328.47,3329.5,"No, no, no words."
2015.14-361,2,62592,ethan_p_davis,,3355.34,3356.01,And --
2015.14-361,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3356.01,3358.01,"Odd, but English."
2015.14-361,2,62592,ethan_p_davis,,3358.01,3362.71,"Justice Breyer, I think the words ""namely Sam"" are doing all the work there."
2015.14-361,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3373.8,3375.9,"Mr. Davis, I don't think you need to add words."
2015.14-361,2,62592,ethan_p_davis,,3405.575,3408.06,"Justice Kagan, with respect, I don't agree with that."
2015.14-361,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3417.26,3422.62,"There absolutely is a unity of purpose, that one person should do the crime."
2015.14-361,2,62592,ethan_p_davis,,3422.62,3424.03,Your Honor --
2015.14-361,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3424.03,3424.76,Go ahead.
2015.14-361,2,62592,ethan_p_davis,,3424.76,3430.265,"With the unity of -- there may -- that obscures the words ""from another"" from the statute."
2015.14-361,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3437.985,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
