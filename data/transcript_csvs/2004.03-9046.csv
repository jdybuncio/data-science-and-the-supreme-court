2004.03-9046,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,5.739,We'll now... we'll now hear argument in Rhines against Weber.
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,43.179,46.318,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9046,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,90.49,92.386,I think that's unquestionable.
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,133.975,136.476,"Justice Scalia, I agree with your framing of the issue."
2004.03-9046,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.476,137.052,Okay.
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,137.052,150.593,"And I also believe that a stay under these circumstances is appropriate under the statutes, section 2254 and 2244, and is consistent with those statutes."
2004.03-9046,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,162.232,164.34,"Well, there's no... there's no abuse of discretion here."
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,175.319,176.971,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.377,191.998,"Well, why shouldn't... why shouldn't the petitioner for habeas have to first go to the State court and exhaust the State court claims?"
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,211.067,220.826,"--Well, in an ideal world, they would be presented in the first instance, but we're dealing with a... a world where 93 percent of petitioners are proceeding pro se."
2004.03-9046,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,229.15,234.556,At the price of suspending the 1-year statute of limitations that Congress thought was central to AEDPA.
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,234.556,235.959,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,251.728,265.93,"Well, but it's a free ride if you say... so long as you get in within the 1-year period, the court can then give you another 3 years or as long as the court thinks is reasonable for you to go back and... and do what you were supposed to do before you arrived."
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,269.645,279.304,"I disagree that that is a free ride, and I do not see that as a frustration of the 1-year statute of limitations when a petitioner has met the 1-year statute of limitations."
2004.03-9046,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,280.957,282.071,But the petitioner--
2004.03-9046,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,282.071,282.61,"No, but the point--"
2004.03-9046,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.61,289.707,--didn't go to the State court with this enormous laundry list of unexhausted claims.
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,311.421,319.883,"--Your Honor, Congress wanted to compress certainly the time between exhaustion of the State remedies and the time when the petitioner came to Federal court."
2004.03-9046,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,341.227,372.889,"Is there a difference... would you say there's a difference between a case where the petitioner comes into Federal court in the first instance with this laundry list or as, if I recall correctly, this case, goes first to the State court and then, when it's dismissed from the State court, comes to Federal court with the same basic list which has been exhausted, plus others which have not?"
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,392.041,399.017,--I think it truly depends on the circumstances which of those two hypotheticals present a more compelling case for stay and abeyance.
2004.03-9046,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,409.048,413.673,How many... how many were not exhausted of that... that laundry list?
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,413.673,417.304,The court... or the State challenged 12 of the claims as unexhausted.
2004.03-9046,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,440.256,441.287,16 months.
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,441.287,445.168,"It's actually a little bit... it's longer than 16 months, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,453.137,469.773,"One of the problems is that the statute encourages prompt resolution in... in the Federal system as well, and under a stay and abey procedure, you could have a district judge who lets the matter sit for 9-10 months and all of a sudden issues a stay and abey."
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,471.175,479.06,"Your Honor, I think the alternative that the State proposes presents an even more troubling illustration."
2004.03-9046,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,540.361,545.29,"Well, so then he's protected in the State system, and if he needs Federal review, he can come here on direct."
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,545.29,561.01,"Your Honor, the problem is the eight claims that he is now exhausting in State court, if the State's approach is taken, he forever sacrifices, loses the right to Federal review of those eight claims."
2004.03-9046,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,561.01,561.176,No.
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,564.437,566.833,Excuse me.
2004.03-9046,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,568.152,574.263,He can come to this Court on certiorari after the State decision in the second... in the second habeas.
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,574.263,579.602,"--Your Honor, as a matter of--"
2004.03-9046,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.602,581.981,It's fair for you to say he loses his right to Federal review--
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,581.981,582.187,--Right.
2004.03-9046,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,582.891,589.328,"--because we wouldn't necessarily take that case, whereas you say he'd have a right to go into Federal... Federal habeas."
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,589.867,592.179,--Thank you for throwing me the life preserver.
2004.03-9046,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.521,644.042,Would we have to... would we have to reverse in part Rose against Lundy to go with your view?
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,644.042,650.524,--I don't believe so anymore than you would have to reverse in part Rose v. Lundy to go with the State's view.
2004.03-9046,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,719.915,726.314,"Well, that was at a time before the AEDPA enactment that tried to put limits, time limits, on these things."
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,726.314,727.428,--The only--
2004.03-9046,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,727.428,734.365,"That's what we run into here, is a total frustration almost of Congress' time limiting."
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,734.365,742.0,"--Your Honor, I... I would disagree that this is a total frustration of Congress' time limiting... time limiting."
2004.03-9046,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,756.74,780.145,"Yes, but Congress, I think under the scheme, envisioned having someone make all the State claims the first time around, gather them up and go to State court, and let them take as long as they like... no statute will run until that's complete... and then go to the Federal court."
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,784.353,793.641,"--Your Honor, I don't believe this does an end run because this is different than... than tolling."
2004.03-9046,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.975,908.319,--That... that happens often with time limits.
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,956.532,957.647,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,957.647,957.897,Why not?
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,957.897,967.185,"I believe there's always a very powerful incentive to prisoners to exhaust in full because if they file a mixed petition, they're not going to have relief."
2004.03-9046,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.185,968.216,Sometimes--
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,968.216,969.886,(b)(1) says it shall not be granted.
2004.03-9046,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.886,979.817,"--Well, you said... you said in your brief that... that it's always in the... with the possible exception of capital cases, it's always in the interest of a habeas applicant to get... get it decided as soon as possible."
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,992.57,999.629,"I think those illustrations are... are the... very much the exception rather than the rule, as this Court recognized in--"
2004.03-9046,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,999.629,1001.115,"--Well, what about the exceptional case?"
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,1003.223,1008.711,"--Well, I think that's then the district court's task that has more familiarity with the particular case."
2004.03-9046,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1008.711,1008.961,Which can do what?
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,1008.961,1013.435,The district court can refuse to issue a stay and abeyance order.
2004.03-9046,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1028.195,1033.109,Do you think the procedure should be any different between capital cases and noncapital cases?
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,1046.568,1048.508,"You're right, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-9046,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1080.459,1095.897,"But you... you don't really think we can hold that line, giving less favorable treatment to somebody who's... who's trying to argue against a capital penalty, less favorable treatment to him than somebody who's... who just wants to avoid 10 years in jail?"
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,1097.261,1102.213,I'm not advocating less favorable treatment or more favorable treatment for that matter.
2004.03-9046,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1106.011,1112.51,Could you just replay the order of the proceedings?
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,1121.986,1123.351,"Yes, he was, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1123.351,1125.868,So he's been represented by counsel throughout.
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,1125.868,1129.955,"Well, he filed his Federal habeas petition pro se."
2004.03-9046,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1132.76,1138.416,But the... the State application that preceded that... he was represented there.
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,1138.416,1139.615,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1139.615,1143.246,And then he lost his representation when he came to the Federal court?
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,1143.246,1150.222,"Justice Ginsburg, a different lawyer gets appointed in the Federal court system than represented him in the... in the State court system."
2004.03-9046,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1150.222,1153.937,How... how general is... is this problem?
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,1181.141,1197.655,"I think that's an excellent point and on footnotes 9 and 10 of the yellow brief, there is a litany of the State procedural rules, and many States would bar a second habeas or would put a strict time limit that the petitioner could not meet."
2004.03-9046,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1199.634,1200.088,Yes.
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,1200.088,1218.004,"South Dakota allows a second habeas and, indeed, allows a petitioner in a second habeas to show cause for a default by proving that he received ineffective assistance of habeas counsel, which is unique among the States."
2004.03-9046,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.121,1257.302,Unless what would happen in these other States as the... is that the court would grant the... the stay of proceedings in order to let him go back to the State court and be told after however long it takes that... that his... his claims are now procedurally barred.
2004.03-9046,0,39808,roberto_a_lange,,1266.59,1274.353,"I... I believe that would... could be and... and should be a factor in a district court's consideration of whether to grant stay and abeyance, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1396.25,1397.986,"Thank you, Mr. Lang."
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1400.337,1412.226,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-9046,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1477.984,1488.924,"What... what is your answer to... to your... your brother's answer on this, and... and that is, that the... the existence of stay and abey as a possibility is not a right to stay and abey?"
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1514.272,1525.167,I think that... I think that the... the answer is that Congress designed the system to resolve all those issues in State court first.
2004.03-9046,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1536.85,1539.823,"Oh, again, there's no question about that."
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1588.409,1592.662,"I don't think the system needs to be tinkered with, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1592.662,1614.704,"Well, I... I know but there's... what... what is your answer on the merits to the fact that most of the people who are going to ask for stay and abey are... are going to be pro ses, or at least have gotten into the mess that they're in as a result of pro se representation, and... and that... that exhaustion in close cases can be a very... very tricky issue?"
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1615.984,1617.676,My response is in two parts.
2004.03-9046,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.876,1658.254,"I'm not sure... I'm not sure it's... it's true, are you, that... that the reason people get into these situations is because they were pro se."
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1685.542,1690.659,--That's... I... I suspect that's the typical case in... in capital cases.
2004.03-9046,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1691.98,1692.434,It's typical.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1783.911,1787.171,"--I think it's less complicated than that, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1788.452,1789.484,That's pretty simple.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1789.484,1790.144,--I--
2004.03-9046,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1790.144,1792.084,The door is closed forever.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1792.91,1793.449,--I disagree.
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1824.656,1825.399,The--
2004.03-9046,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1825.399,1827.833,--They seem to have made a mistake here quite a lot.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1832.208,1832.458,I... I can't--
2004.03-9046,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1832.458,1833.201,I agree with you.
2004.03-9046,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.888,1854.089,"You know, it... it could be, I suppose, that these people have nothing else to do sitting around in the jailhouse, and... and having written their State petition, they sit around for a few more months and they say, you know, there are a few more claims I could make."
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1869.2,1876.713,"--Justice Scalia, I think that's exactly what the statute... the statutes... the three read together and enforced together--"
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1876.713,1877.373,--But they're all--
2004.03-9046,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1877.373,1889.8,I take it... I take it that one of the answers to the observation that the Federal court is closed to a third of the claims is that that's not true with respect to the exhausted claims.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1896.115,1898.55,"--Well, I agree with that."
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1902.515,1903.713,--May I ask you--
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1903.713,1904.206,Please.
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1904.206,1905.237,--with respect to this case?
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1984.787,1987.965,"That was not the situation in this case, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1987.965,1996.138,Then why did the... the district judge say four on the State's list have been exhausted?
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,1996.138,2011.992,"Well, the... factually the court... the court examined the amended petition and concluded that eight claims in the amended petition were unexhausted."
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2086.174,2087.864,So that... that would take care of the four claims.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2089.351,2091.58,"Well, it doesn't make any difference at that point, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2095.833,2096.221,"Well, they--"
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2096.221,2099.177,--is not... is not worse if there gets to be 12 or 15.
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2099.177,2102.437,--But those could be... those could be dropped out of the Federal complaint.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2116.266,2127.662,"Well, if he... if he goes within the 80 days and immediately files to pursue in State court his unexhausted claims, the statute is tolled."
2004.03-9046,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.352,2147.928,"Even without going back to the State court, I don't see anything in this statute which indicates that Congress expected everybody who comes into Federal court with unexhausted claims to have time to remedy that defect by running back to State court and... and filing."
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2179.507,2182.397,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.397,2187.865,"But I don't agree with that you were saying or you do agree with that, I know."
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2243.409,2245.35,"Not that I've found, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2245.35,2245.843,Either way.
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2245.843,2286.505,"If that's so, then why isn't a system like the one that the Second Circuit described the most reasonable thing to do, that is, to put very tight deadlines both on the petitioner and on the Federal court, that is, to deny... deny the stay and abey when the prisoner has not been diligent, to put a tight time line on when that prisoner has to go to State court, and a similarly tight line on returning to the Federal court after the State court is done?"
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2296.37,2311.852,"I think the answer to the question, Your Honor, is that in order to follow the Second Circuit as you've described, this Court would have to rewrite the interpretation of the exhaustion statute that they issued in Rose v. Lundy."
2004.03-9046,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2327.844,2336.206,But Rose and Lundy also assumed that they could go back to State court and... and in... in fact this could be done without wiping out the claims.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2369.825,2379.773,"Your Honor, if the petitioner is not capable of going back to litigate the State claim, the claim is not unexhausted by definition."
2004.03-9046,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2381.531,2385.163,It may not be... it... it will be waived.
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2394.33,2404.277,"See, you could... there are two things in Rose v. Lundy, and everybody agrees with the one, you must exhaust in State court."
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2435.197,2438.456,"--I think there are two responses to that, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2505.247,2525.226,"Well, the... the troublesome thing is some petitioners will be able to do just what you said in South Dakota, go back to the State court a second time, because they had a swift district judge, and some won't because the district judge was slow."
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2550.944,2574.988,"--Your Honor, I... I struggle with the... one of the premises of your hypothetical, and the portion I struggle with is the... is the situation where the petitioner, through no fault of his own, either... and I think that's implied in your hypothetical... doesn't go to State court."
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2577.693,2578.332,"No, did go."
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2633.217,2668.14,"--The... there's the... the difficulty in the stay and abeyance procedure, as it is currently practiced, I think, is that there is no set of standards, other than the three statutes that we've... that we have discussed, to guide the district court's discretion in when they give stay and abeyance."
2004.03-9046,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2668.14,2685.767,"--General Long, do... do those States that apply stay and abey make a distinction between whether the person who comes with unexhausted claims has exhausted some claims in State court and ones who haven't?"
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2685.767,2693.115,"Well, I think the predicate to getting stay and abeyance, Your Honor, is that there has to be at least the presence of one exhausted claim and one unexhausted--"
2004.03-9046,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2693.115,2693.941,Why should that be?
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2693.941,2705.913,"--Well, I think that that follows from... I think that follows from Rose v. Lundy which talked about a mixed petition and that's the... that's the factual background."
2004.03-9046,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2705.913,2707.975,"If you get a second bite, why shouldn't you get a first bite?"
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2732.291,2735.263,"Well, I think the--"
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2735.263,2735.651,The... the--
2004.03-9046,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.651,2738.523,But you're... but you're telling me the States do draw a distinction.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2738.523,2739.637,"--Well, I don't think--"
2004.03-9046,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2739.637,2740.009,I mean... I mean--
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2740.009,2741.329,--it's not the States who draw a distinction.
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2742.61,2743.52,"--Well, hasn't the second--"
2004.03-9046,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.52,2747.152,But the difference is that one of those petitions could be totally dismissed and the other one would not be.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2751.239,2752.603,"--I think so, yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2752.603,2760.981,"Whereas, if there's one exhausted claim, they could... they could keep the Federal... petition in Federal court and stay it and let the unexhausted claim be exhausted."
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2760.981,2766.654,"Well, that's... that's the... it's the stay that we're having the problem with, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-9046,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2773.53,2776.296,And the judge could dismiss the others.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2776.296,2778.814,--He... he can dismiss the unexhausted one and move forward.
2004.03-9046,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2796.564,2807.876,"General Long, if you were designing a system to set standards to guide the Federal judge in deciding how to treat these, what standards would you set?"
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2807.876,2811.508,"That's a hard question, Your Honor, because--"
2004.03-9046,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2811.508,2812.722,Do your best.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2813.177,2817.248,"--I... I think this, Your Honor."
2004.03-9046,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2866.781,2872.232,"Well, are you suggesting then that we could have a rule, oh, somewhat like the grant of a preliminary injunction?"
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2883.582,2884.697,"Well, I--"
2004.03-9046,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2884.697,2893.12,"Because if you have that, we then have a new Gothic jurisprudence where we're reviewing discretion on a collateral issue."
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2893.12,2893.985,"--Well, but--"
2004.03-9046,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2893.985,2895.554,--Rococo I think.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2895.554,2901.498,"--Well, the... the difficulty with the way it is now, Your Honor, is there is no review of the discretion of the district courts at all."
2004.03-9046,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2904.759,2906.784,"Well, I suppose the suggestion I made--"
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2906.784,2906.988,--and it's--
2004.03-9046,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2906.988,2908.724,--is preferable than the one I gave.
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,2912.189,2919.702,"--Well, our first position, obviously, is no stay and abey at all, that the unexhausted claims ought to be dismissed, as the Eighth Circuit said in this case."
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2999.125,3001.604,--But again--
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,3001.604,3002.468,--stay and abeyances.
2004.03-9046,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3002.468,3008.867,--I come... I come back to the... the Second Circuit tried to deal with that problem and why isn't that adequate?
2004.03-9046,1,34732,lawrence_e_long,,3013.78,3043.047,"The... well, the... the Second Circuit followed very closely to what the... what the district court did here, Your Honor, but what I did not see in the Second Circuit opinions and frankly haven't seen in any of the opinions except the Eighth Circuit opinion was any type of analysis about an explanation of why the petitioner hadn't been prudent and hadn't been diligent in State court."
2004.03-9046,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.563,3064.156,"Thank you, General Long."
2004.03-9046,2,39808,roberto_a_lange,,3094.621,3096.44,"Yes, I do, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-9046,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3155.511,3160.712,"Well, it's one thing to say that there's... it's utterly without merit and he can deny it, which he's entitled to do under the statute."
2004.03-9046,2,39808,roberto_a_lange,,3173.837,3186.18,"--Right, and those should be circumstances where the State court is left to judge whether the claim has merit while the Federal court proceedings are suspended, are abeyed or held in abeyance."
2004.03-9046,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3201.497,3208.555,"Mr.... Mr. Lange, why... why isn't... gee, you have Lange and Long."
2004.03-9046,2,39808,roberto_a_lange,,3261.227,3264.033,"Well, this is Mr. Rhines' one opportunity."
2004.03-9046,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3280.38,3282.692,"Well, to have exhausted claims entertained."
2004.03-9046,2,39808,roberto_a_lange,,3291.942,3299.289,"Well, under (b)(1), a claim must be exhausted to support relief from a Federal court."
2004.03-9046,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3326.41,3328.556,"Well, this is not a pro se petitioner."
2004.03-9046,2,39808,roberto_a_lange,,3328.556,3329.549,No.
2004.03-9046,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3391.963,3397.248,Earlier you... you suggested that in your view the district court could deny it.
2004.03-9046,2,39808,roberto_a_lange,,3397.248,3403.026,"If under section 2254(b)(2) it does not meet the standard, yes."
2004.03-9046,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3414.997,3421.852,"Mr. Lange, you were appointed by the Court, and on behalf of the Court, I want to thank you for your services and for the quality of your services."
2004.03-9046,2,39808,roberto_a_lange,,3421.852,3422.428,--Thank you.
2004.03-9046,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3422.428,3423.133,The case is submitted.
