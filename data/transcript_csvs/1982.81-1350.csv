1982.81-1350,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,2.25,We will hear arguments next in the United States against Villamonte-Marquez.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,6.015,25.068,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, since before the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, Customs officers have been authorized by federal statute to conduct suspicionless boardings of vessels for the purpose of checking their documents."
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,256.898,260.053,"Mr. Alito, you have been addressing the merits from the beginning."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,262.396,264.786,"Your Honor, this case is certainly not moot."
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,287.605,291.979,Wasn't it the government that got the dismissal of the indictment?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,291.979,305.975,"--The government had the indictment dismissed merely for the purpose of complying with the Court of Appeals mandate, but I think this Court's decisions establish that ministerial acts of that sort, which--"
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,305.975,308.161,"Instead of a dismissal, couldn't you have sought a stay of mandate?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,308.161,313.44,"--We could have, Your Honor, and that might have been a preferable procedure, but it is merely a technical matter."
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,313.44,320.234,"Didn't you waive reinstatement by the course you took, dismissing instead of getting a stay?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,320.234,321.14,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,327.902,330.027,Would you have to reinstate the indictment?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,330.027,333.775,--I think you just reinstate the convictions.
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.775,335.087,"And then the sentence, yes."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,335.087,336.477,And the sentence.
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,338.118,339.055,That is what your brief says.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,339.055,342.101,"--That's correct, and I think that's what would happen."
1982.81-1350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,346.707,356.984,"Are you aware of any cases in which a conviction had been reinstated without the indictment... I mean, a conviction had been reinstated without an indictment being in the case, in the record?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,356.984,365.216,"--Justice Stevens, I must confess, I don't know what happens as a technical matter to the indictment when the conviction is reinstated, but I think that when--"
1982.81-1350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,365.216,365.966,I have never heard of it.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,381.647,384.348,"--Well, I see no reason why the indictment cannot be reinstated."
1982.81-1350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,391.378,393.939,"Has it ever been done, to your knowledge, under this set of facts?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,396.406,398.469,I don't know whether it has been done on this state of facts.
1982.81-1350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,398.469,400.389,You can't cite us any case in which it has been done?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,400.389,400.811,I'm afraid I can't.
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,400.811,405.809,"Well, he was indicted, and he was convicted while the indictment was outstanding."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,405.809,406.84,"Certainly, he was."
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.84,409.152,Nobody disputes there was an indictment at one time.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,414.229,415.243,I believe that is correct.
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,415.243,416.446,"Well, I still don't understand."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,418.929,421.583,I believe it was done... it was--
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,421.583,422.49,Why not a stay of the mandate?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,422.49,426.925,"--I won't dispute the fact that that's probably the preferable alternative, but I don't think that--"
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,426.925,429.471,"Well, why was it... why was dismissal sought?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,429.471,431.471,"--As a fact, I don't know, Justice Brennan."
1982.81-1350,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,438.546,450.041,Did the Court of Appeals mandate address itself to the indictment or merely set aside the judgments?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,450.041,465.19,"I believe it reversed and remanded with instructions to take proceedings consistent with the decision, and since the principal evidence at trial was the evidence that had been suppressed, I believe that--"
1982.81-1350,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,465.19,470.86,"Is it your position that if you were complying with the mandate of the Court of Appeals, you can't be charged with any waiver?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,470.86,472.47,--I think that's correct.
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,485.433,493.368,"When the mandate went back down, it went back down to the District Court, right?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,493.368,494.961,"Yes, it did."
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,494.961,498.429,"Well, who dismissed the indictment?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,498.429,500.443,The District Court dismissed the indictment.
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,500.443,501.693,On whose motion?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,501.693,503.629,I don't know on whose motion.
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,505.895,509.736,I had the impression it was on the government's motion.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,513.221,514.471,"No, it certainly can't."
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,518.579,522.218,"Well, do we know what the record is, or not?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,522.218,524.061,"Well, we know what the record is."
1982.81-1350,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,524.608,537.135,Certainly there is nothing in the judgment of the Court of Appeals that in so many words said that the indictment should be dismissed.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,537.135,553.69,"--That is certainly correct, but when... in a case of this sort, when the convictions are founded upon the discovery of contraband, the suppression of that contraband necessarily means that there will no longer have been--"
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,553.69,557.267,Was there some transcript made at that time of what happened in court?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,557.267,559.47,"--I assume there was, Justice White."
1982.81-1350,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,576.463,577.119,Let me put it another way.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,583.695,586.865,--I believe the dismissal--
1982.81-1350,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,586.865,587.442,I think that's a good way of describing it.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,587.442,594.579,"--I don't think I can say more than that the dismissal of the indictment was merely a technical matter, done to comply with the Court of Appeals mandate."
1982.81-1350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,594.579,602.342,"All the Court of Appeals mandate required was that you set aside the conviction and suppress the evidence, which normally would lead to a new trial."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,606.653,610.324,There was not a requirement of dismissing the indictment in a legal sense.
1982.81-1350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,610.324,613.76,You could have complied with the mandate of the Court of Appeals without dismissing the indictment.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,613.76,616.977,It would have meant an outstanding indictment--
1982.81-1350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,616.977,617.414,Right.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,617.414,627.785,"--which would have called for a trial within a certain amount of time under the Speedy Trial Act, and if there could be no retrial, which in fact there could not be, unless the decision suppressing the evidence was reversed--"
1982.81-1350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.785,628.394,Or stayed.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,628.394,635.594,"--or stayed, then compliance with the Court of Appeals mandate as a practical matter would have necessitated dismissal of the indictment."
1982.81-1350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,635.594,637.827,"No, it would have necessitated a motion for a stay."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,637.827,646.371,"Well, that's right, Justice Stevens, but our position is that making such a stay motion is not necessary to preserve a live controversy."
1982.81-1350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,646.371,648.73,"Well, but you don't have any authority for that proposition."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,648.73,656.789,"Well, we don't have authority for that proposition because it was not Respondent's contention at any point that dismissal of the indictment was what mooted this case."
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.209,663.319,"Well, you hope to make some authority for that."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,663.319,667.331,"Well, at the minimum, we hope to make authority for that, Justice White."
1982.81-1350,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,667.331,677.139,"It wouldn't necessarily follow that there would be a new trial, if the only evidence the government had was the evidence that was suppressed."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,685.855,688.51,"That is certainly correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1350,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,694.274,696.664,"Well, they don't dismiss the indictment."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,700.146,704.473,"--Well, I believe at a certain point there is a motion to dismiss the indictment."
1982.81-1350,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,704.473,711.922,"Well, I thought you told Justice Stevens that you couldn't name a single case where the indictment was dismissed."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,711.922,713.954,I can't name one offhand.
1982.81-1350,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,715.296,716.953,How can you say it if you can't name one?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,716.953,738.224,"Well, what I am saying is that when critical evidence is suppressed and a case is remanded to the District Court, the indictment is dismissed because a new trial is impractical, and that was what happened here, and I am sure that is what the Court of Appeals understood was going to happen when they decided this case."
1982.81-1350,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,738.224,745.629,"And that was consistent with the... if not ordered, it was certainly consistent with the mandate of the Court of Appeals?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,760.154,767.339,I believe there are cases that would permit reinstatement of the complaint after... after that.
1982.81-1350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,767.339,770.211,After the prevailing party moved to dismiss his own complaint?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,770.211,774.085,I believe if that was done truly to comply with the mandate of an appellate court reversing--
1982.81-1350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.085,776.412,But it wasn't necessary to comply with the mandate.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,781.411,789.079,"--Well, if the practical effect of the appellate ruling is to make any further proceedings in the trial court impossible, I think--"
1982.81-1350,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,789.079,791.578,"Counsel, let's get on with the merits of the case now."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,791.578,792.546,--Thank you.
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,800.996,802.387,"Excuse me, Mr. Alito."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,816.178,819.661,--We certainly raised the question of whether reasonable suspicion was required.
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,819.661,820.988,"Well, what did you argue?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,822.098,826.283,"We argued... in our petition for rehearing, we argued both points."
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,826.283,828.36,"By that, the original argument?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,828.36,834.264,"Initially before the trial we merely argued that reasonable suspicion was present, but we did that for two good reasons."
1982.81-1350,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,891.365,894.583,Does this case fit within the border exception?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,894.583,902.487,"--It does not fit within the classic border exception, but we believe it is necessary to effectively police the sea border."
1982.81-1350,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,926.96,937.91,"You think that the foreign registration of the vessel would not be sufficient, I mean, the obvious markings from the outside of the vessel showing it's a foreign vessel?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,937.91,947.89,"Well, we believe that any foreign... persons on any foreign vessel within United States waters have no legitimate expectation of privacy, at least with respect to their documents."
1982.81-1350,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,947.89,954.871,Would that fit within a traditional border search exception as cause to believe that the vessel had had foreign contacts?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,954.871,964.321,"Your Honor, I hesitate to analogize this too closely to border searches on land, because the sea is simply not like the land."
1982.81-1350,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,964.321,967.554,"Well, how about border searches of airplanes?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,971.364,980.783,"Well, that's correct, and with an airplane you can usually detect on radar whether it has in fact crossed the border, and with scheduled airlines, you know in advance where they are coming from."
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,998.853,1017.69,"Mr. Alito, what particular document or documents did this particular sailing vessel need, even though it was from... even if you believed it was from a foreign country?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1017.69,1022.219,"--Well, if it was a foreign vessel, of course, it would have foreign... it would have foreign documents."
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.0,1023.453,What documents?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1023.453,1027.39,--Each country has its own documentation system.
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.138,1031.809,All right.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1036.462,1047.662,"--As soon as it entered Customs waters, it was required to report its arrival promptly to Customs, and if it was to go any further, it would need a cruising license, or else it would have to make entry again--"
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.662,1051.753,"Well, of course, it hadn't entered the United States yet."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1051.753,1054.94,--It had entered Customs waters and--
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.94,1062.484,"I am just asking you again, at the point where the vessel was boarded, what document were you looking for?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1062.484,1068.123,"--We were looking for its basic foreign registry documents, where was it registered, what sort of vessel was it."
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.123,1072.698,And that is permitted under the federal statute?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1072.698,1073.807,That's correct.
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.494,1085.584,"And are documents like that sort of mobile, or are they attached to a vessel somewhere, or are they... can you hand them around, or what?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1085.584,1087.286,I think this may vary from country to country.

1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1110.558,1116.852,"--Well, I think it is often if not usually impractical to do that without boarding the boat."
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1116.852,1117.587,Why is that?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1117.587,1120.43,Because boats rock back and forth and hit each other.
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.43,1122.555,"Well, how about the captain boarding your boat?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1122.555,1125.835,"Well, he may do that, perhaps."
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.835,1127.63,Despite the rocking back and forth?

1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.895,1134.316,"What if he said to you, I will board your boat and bring my documents?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1134.316,1138.064,"--Well, I don't know what their response would be in a specific case, but part of--"
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.064,1144.826,"I know, but what would be your response for the United States if he said that and he said, stay off my boat, but I'll bring you my document?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1144.826,1149.231,"--Well, I think that it would be reasonable first to inspect the documents, and then after doing so--"
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1149.231,1152.323,"Right, and if they complied, you wouldn't board his boat, would you?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1152.323,1159.883,"--Well, part of a documentation inspection is examining the main beam number, which necessitates a visit to a portion of the hold."
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.883,1165.552,"Now, is that for a foreign vessel at 18 miles from the coast?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1171.003,1175.424,It is required to make a satisfactory identification of the vessel.
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.154,1192.901,"So there is a statute or some regulation that says, please look at the beam numbers?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1192.901,1203.693,"There is a statute, 19 USC 1581(A), that authorizes Customs officers to board any vessel in any part of the United States to check its documents and to examine the vessel."

1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1231.198,1233.977,--The statute is reproduced in the appendix to our brief.
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1233.977,1238.601,What page?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1238.601,1240.85,Page 1-A.
1982.81-1350,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1240.85,1252.908,"Let me pursue this, not on a little sailing vessel down there, but a British or a Swedish or a Norwegian or a Dutch vessel comes into the New York harbor."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1269.931,1270.634,That is absolutely correct.
1982.81-1350,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1273.648,1280.271,It doesn't make any difference whether it is a 40-foot sailboat or a 300-foot cruise vessel?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1280.271,1288.33,"No, I would suppose that someone attempting to set the record for the smallest vessel to make a trans-Atlantic crossing would be subject to those entry requirements."
1982.81-1350,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1288.33,1294.061,"And this includes the health officers, and the Customs officers, and a whole range of people, does it not?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1294.061,1301.45,"That is correct, and that is why a vessel like the Henry Morgan II cannot have any legitimate expectation of privacy in U.S. waters."
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1381.823,1390.991,Your argument then certainly isn't limited to vessels who you see on the stern may come from a foreign port.
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1394.349,1398.238,"Well, that's correct, but what is at issue--"
1982.81-1350,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1398.238,1398.613,--Isn't that right?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1398.613,1407.079,"--what is at issue here is the search... is the boarding and document check in this particular case, which involved such a large sea-going foreign vessel."
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1410.578,1424.102,"Are you suggesting, Mr. Alito, that your asserted power to board without reasonable suspicion would not apply in the case of boats not capable of going to sea, for example, like river barges and such?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1424.102,1432.099,"--I am not asserting that that authority would not apply in those instances, because Customs has enforcement responsibilities--"
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1432.099,1436.02,Even if it is a barge incapable of going to sea?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1436.02,1436.879,--I think that--
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1436.879,1439.034,You say they could board those under this statute?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1439.034,1440.05,"--Yes, they could."
1982.81-1350,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1441.565,1450.873,"And would it make any difference, for example, if it is on waters that don't empty into the seas, a lake or something like that?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1452.17,1467.944,"--It would... I believe the authority would extend to any navigable waters of the United States, because Customs has the... has enforcement authority that goes beyond policing the entry of goods coming from abroad, although that is perhaps their most highly visible responsibility."
1982.81-1350,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1519.267,1535.65,Is the underlying basis for this authority the authority of the United States to govern entry into this country from beyond our borders of foreign goods and vessels?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1535.65,1538.337,"That is one of... That is one of the bases for this authority, but--"
1982.81-1350,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1538.337,1540.321,Is that the primary thrust?
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1540.321,1541.883,"--It is the primary, but not the exclusive basis."
1982.81-1350,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1542.43,1554.8,"It is just hard for me to understand how it should extend, for instance, to a full right to board and search a small pleasure boat on an inland lake."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1554.8,1567.201,"--Well, we are specifically not making that argument, but I think it is also important to recognize that any rule that would draw a distinction between commercial and non-commercial vessels would be extremely unworkable."
1982.81-1350,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1567.201,1577.556,How about a rule that is limited to the open seas or adjacent waterways and Customs--
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1577.556,1581.32,That isn't what is involved in this case.
1982.81-1350,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1582.07,1586.974,"--Yes, but you are arguing for a much broader rule, if I understood you correctly."
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1590.66,1600.313,"--We are arguing for a much broader rule, but in this case all that is involved is a vessel located, as I said, a relatively short distance from the coast."
1982.81-1350,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1618.695,1620.992,"In any event, we haven't got a lake case here today, have we?"
1982.81-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1620.992,1621.444,That's right.
1982.81-1350,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1731.557,1736.931,Mr. Ieyoub.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1736.931,1752.392,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Your Honors, the boarding of the Henry Morgan II was pursuant to 19 USC 1581."
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1898.553,1909.954,"If the government is right, and I realize you argue they are not, that suspicionless boardings are permissible under the statute and don't violate the Constitution, what difference does it make what motive the investigators had?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1909.954,1926.057,"Your Honor, I think it is very significant, because if the search was primarily one to obtain criminal evidence to support a criminal prosecution, the competing interests of the government and the individual are changed."
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1926.057,1933.194,"Well, do you have any finding from either the District Court or the Court of Appeals that the search was primarily to obtain incriminating evidence?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1933.194,1939.301,"Only... only the facts that were adduced at the trial, Your Honor, indicates that."
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1942.253,1948.126,"But, I mean, I asked you, did either of the lower courts make a finding such as you are now saying apparently should have been made?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1948.126,1948.501,--No.
1982.81-1350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1951.422,1953.155,"Were they asked, requested to?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1954.077,1961.558,"I don't think they were requested to do so, Your Honor, but the testimony that was taken at trial clearly reflected that--"
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1961.558,1971.444,"If you have to win based on having us accept a fact like that, you may be in trouble."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1984.956,1985.423,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1985.423,1986.548,Isn't that what you really have to say?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,1986.548,1988.454,That is really what I am emphasizing here.
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.638,1997.449,"Well, how do we know?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2001.291,2007.726,--I think the objective facts of this particular case indicate that it was a criminal search.
1982.81-1350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2032.842,2044.711,Do you suggest that the state police of the border states haven't any right to cooperate with federal Customs people and the FBI and whatnot in keeping drugs out of the country?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2044.711,2049.21,"They certainly, Your Honor, do not have the right to board under 19 USC 1581."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2080.541,2084.617,Did the narcotics agent testify?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2084.617,2085.648,"Yes, he did, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2085.648,2087.757,Did you ask him that question?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2087.757,2091.77,I did not specifically ask him that question.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2091.77,2093.629,"Well, if you did, you could have found out, couldn't you?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2093.629,2094.848,"Yes, I could have, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2094.848,2098.392,"So you didn't ask, and you ask us to draw a conclusion."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2098.392,2099.564,"Well, Your Honor, he--"
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2099.564,2100.907,Which you could have brought out of the witness.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2100.907,2101.345,--Correct.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2110.529,2112.841,Indicate is enough?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2112.841,2114.169,"--I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2114.169,2115.933,Indicate is enough?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2115.933,2128.755,"I think in this case if you take all of the facts as they are presented, and as the testimony indicated, that it should lead to a conclusion, Your Honors, that it was in fact a criminal investigatory search."
1982.81-1350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2128.755,2134.019,"Do you say that when these officers stood on the deck of this craft, they were there illegally?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2134.019,2136.58,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2136.58,2144.407,"And when they detected the odor of burning marijuana, they could not legally do anything about it?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2144.407,2145.921,"Well, that--"
1982.81-1350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2145.921,2150.731,"Or could they take the vessel in tow, and take them to a United States magistrate and get a warrant?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2150.731,2153.106,"--I think they could have done that, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2172.16,2174.799,Because of the lack of some kind of reasonable suspicion.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2174.799,2175.236,That's correct.
1982.81-1350,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2261.874,2275.337,"Are there different factors that play, though, when you are dealing with vessels on open waters which just don't lend themselves to staying put long enough to go get your administrative warrant?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2275.337,2286.333,"Your Honor, I think insofar as that is concerned, that vessels, with respect to your particular answer, vessels are not that much different in mobility certainly than automobiles are."
1982.81-1350,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2286.333,2289.877,"Well, but, of course, with vessels we don't have roads."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2300.671,2301.779,"Well, in--"
1982.81-1350,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2301.779,2303.06,So how do you deal with that?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2303.06,2310.307,"--Well, in United States versus Demanett, which was a lower court case, they were faced with that particular proposition."
1982.81-1350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2402.676,2406.705,How would a check point be less of an intrusion on privacy?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2412.5,2413.702,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2415.905,2430.946,"How would there be less intrusion of the privacy if the Customs boat had pulled alongside and said, 200 yards north there is a check point, pull your craft in for inspection?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2430.946,2436.006,"--Well, first of all, the check point can be seen by all the vessels."
1982.81-1350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2472.68,2477.693,"But for the check point, they could have the stop and the search without suspicion?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2477.693,2478.942,I think so.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2488.609,2490.718,A check point in the canal?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2490.718,2492.186,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2495.279,2496.528,Have you ever seen one?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2496.528,2497.575,"--No, I have never seen one, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2517.504,2521.816,"Well, now, this isn't really the inland water situation, though, here, is it?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2527.875,2529.89,"Well, Your Honor, this--"
1982.81-1350,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2529.89,2530.546,Isn't that right?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2530.546,2531.701,"--Well, yes, that's correct, but--"
1982.81-1350,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2531.701,2540.525,"And you would also agree that there is no real right of privacy, is there, for anyone entering our borders from abroad?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2540.525,2561.862,"--Insofar as the border search is concerned, Your Honor, there is no right to privacy, and that has been historically true, and the decisions of this Court have so held for many years, but this was not a border search, and insofar as this particular body of water was concerned, it covers an area of 35 statute miles from Lake Charles, Louisiana, to the coast of Louisiana."
1982.81-1350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2571.951,2574.559,"And as someone pointed out, Chicago or Minneapolis-St."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2588.882,2597.286,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, in that particular case, though, you have a set point of Customs or border inspections."
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2616.714,2634.286,"What if a plane was sited by Customs officials on the Arizona-Mexican border as coming in from Mexico, and they were able to trace it by radar, say, to simply a small landing field in northern Arizona, northern New Mexico."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2645.094,2657.026,"--Well, in that particular case, Your Honor, it would, first of all, seem very unusual for a very small plane to be flying in from Mexico and flying at a very--"
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2657.026,2660.166,"Let's accept my factual hypothesis, if you will."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2663.039,2673.224,"--Well, it may not be unusual, however, I think, but those particular facts might give rise to a reasonable suspicion of a law violation, and--"
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2673.224,2686.391,"Well, I don't know why that would be, but supposing the government didn't argue any law violation, they just said, we can make a suspicionless inspection in the nature of a border search here, even though you are 400 miles from the border."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2686.391,2695.776,"--Well, I think in a particular situation where there is a plane, and a plane is different than, I think, a vessel in this particular case."
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2705.007,2716.143,"So if Customs officials had seen your client's boat crossing the three-mile limit or 12 miles, whatever it is in Louisiana, they could have stopped it there?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2716.143,2718.923,"Yes, I think so, Your Honor, because the Fifth Circuit has held that way."
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2755.737,2759.126,Even though in fact it turned out that the boat had crossed the border.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2759.126,2759.798,That's correct.
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2774.557,2778.712,Is that what shows as Lake Calcasieu on the roadmap?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2778.712,2780.024,"I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2780.024,2787.787,"Is what you call the Calcasieu Ship Channel what shows as Lake Calcasieu on the roadmap, or is that further up?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2788.302,2789.661,"It is very close by, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2802.86,2806.153,--I suppose they are two... The ship channel and the lake are two separate things?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2806.153,2806.809,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2806.809,2812.213,What papers in fact were found on this craft when they boarded?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2813.588,2824.491,"I think it was just a registration, Your Honor, I think, that... showing where the vessel was purchased, where the vessel was made and where the vessel was purchased."
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2844.778,2846.106,"Well, how does that help you?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2847.887,2853.337,"--Your Honor, it helps me, I think, Your Honor, in showing that there is a tremendous amount of possibility of abuse."
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.337,2854.15,It is just like a roadblock.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2854.15,2855.197,"Well, no, Your Honor--"
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2855.197,2856.305,We're not going to pick and choose.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2859.882,2860.882,"--Well, in a random--"
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2860.882,2861.944,I thought you said that would be all right.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2861.944,2863.318,"--A random search, Your Honor, is what it was."
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2864.162,2864.817,Random?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2871.003,2871.784,Well--
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.784,2878.751,"It's like setting up a roadblock and saying, everybody who goes through this roadblock is going to have to show his registration certificate."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2878.751,2882.046,"--Well, but there is not the regularity that a roadblock would have."
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2890.135,2891.556,Stopping everybody in sight?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2891.556,2893.619,"Well, that was their purpose."
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2939.694,2945.191,"But what you are challenging is the application of the statute to your particular case, isn't it?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2955.532,2959.373,"No, Your Honor, I am challenging it as it was--"
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.373,2963.418,You would have to show to win that the boarding was unconstitutional.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2963.418,2966.323,"--It was unreasonable under the Constitution, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2966.323,2967.229,"You have to show that, don't you?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2967.229,2968.12,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2968.12,2970.712,You have to show that the boarding was unconstitutional.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2970.712,2971.305,That's correct.
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2980.489,2980.973,Of the search?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,2981.801,2982.505,--Of the boarding.
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3001.606,3009.041,Congress has said that that doesn't... that... here is what we think is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3012.336,3015.46,"--Well, but Congress cannot authorize the violation of the Constitution."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3015.46,3016.365,"I agree with that, but at least--"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3027.298,3027.579,Well--
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3027.579,3028.689,Is that what the record shows?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3028.689,3034.515,--The record shows that they boarded... I contend that they boarded in order to conduct a search.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3034.515,3035.202,I'm talking about... not you.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3036.14,3046.167,"Well, the record would show that, too, Your Honor, but they did board, and then supposedly they saw... they smelled marijuana, looked toward the hold, and there were some burlap sacks."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3046.167,3049.461,Have you anything to dispute that they did that?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3049.461,3051.991,"No, I don't have anything to--"
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3051.991,3053.225,"Well, why do you say supposed?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3053.225,3054.505,"--I'm sorry, I didn't hear Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3054.505,3056.958,Why do you say supposed?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3056.958,3060.691,"No, that is what... that's what the testimony, that's what the testimony reflected."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3060.691,3061.004,That's what they did.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3061.004,3061.504,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3061.504,3062.58,So they didn't board to search.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3064.518,3066.345,That's correct.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3066.345,3068.251,And what is wrong with that?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3068.251,3070.703,"Well, the boarding itself."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3071.936,3076.889,"Well, if they'd passed by the boat and had smelled it, could they have boarded it then?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3076.889,3080.965,"Very possibly they could have boarded, yes."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3080.965,3082.574,"Well, couldn't they very possibly have done it here?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3082.574,3088.82,"Well, the record absolutely doesn't reflect that they smelled it before they boarded the vessel, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3088.82,3091.21,"You know, I am with you on one point."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3100.832,3101.705,The record does show that--
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3101.705,3103.252,And I don't see how you can get away from that.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3109.796,3111.155,--That's correct.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3111.155,3118.949,"And while they were looking for the papers of the boat, they saw marijuana on every place except nailed to the mast."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3118.949,3120.027,"I am saying, Your Honor--"
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3128.46,3132.85,To look to see whether it was papered or not?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3132.85,3136.067,--Even an administrative search.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3136.067,3139.613,Do you have a right to stop a car to see if it is registered?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3139.613,3141.347,Not at random.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3159.963,3160.526,Or right to travel.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3160.526,3161.681,Or right to travel.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3168.304,3170.771,This man... there's only one man on the boat.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3172.537,3173.989,"Well, that's correct."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3175.52,3176.41,Where did he come from?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3176.41,3179.284,I think he came from Colombia.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3179.284,3179.8,You don't even know.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3179.8,3180.909,"Colombia, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3200.541,3204.008,"Could he stop by, take his bullhorn, and say, have you got papers?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3204.008,3207.194,"Well, if it entailed--"
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3207.194,3208.288,Could he say that?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3208.288,3212.489,--It depends on whether it was a stop.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3212.489,3213.364,Is that interfering with him?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3213.364,3214.192,It is interfering.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3214.582,3215.145,Could he?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3215.145,3220.657,--Not unless he had a reasonable suspicion initially to make the stop.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3223.156,3225.0,"Well, here he had already stopped."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3225.0,3226.139,He had already stopped.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3226.139,3226.811,Is that right?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3226.811,3228.498,"Yes, he was anchored."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3228.498,3231.341,"Well, could he have asked him, do you have papers?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3231.341,3233.058,I think that would be a minimal intrusion.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3233.058,3234.621,"Over the bullhorn, could he do that?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3234.621,3236.777,I think that would definitely be a minimal intrusion.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3236.777,3238.214,Thank you for agreeing to one point.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3238.214,3238.729,Yes.
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3304.876,3315.951,"Do you think this is the same rule whether it was three miles from the... two miles from the coast, three miles from the coast, 18 miles from the coast, or 100 miles?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3316.42,3325.822,"--Well, I think insofar as three miles from the coast is concerned, Your Honor, that there could have possibly been a border type... a border search rationale applied."
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3325.822,3326.072,Why?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3326.072,3328.119,"Well, I think if it is that close to--"
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3328.119,3328.26,"Well, it is close."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3329.571,3332.414,--I think it can be a matter of degree.
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3334.914,3338.272,"You mean, you have already crossed the border."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3338.272,3340.333,--That's correct.
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.333,3346.972,"Any time you cross the border, you can search?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3349.456,3352.047,"Not any time you cross the border, Your Honor, no."
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3353.686,3354.327,Why not?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3357.014,3370.197,"--Well, I'm just... I'm just saying that there's a possibility the Court of Appeal might have found that this... if it had been three miles, or closer to the border, there may have been a border search rationale applied, because--"
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3370.197,3371.758,Let's suppose it wasn't Customs.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3377.802,3379.24,"--No, that would be unreasonable, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3382.722,3391.641,Do you think it is unreasonable for a state to put up an inspection station at its border and search for citrus that may cause plant disease in that state?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3391.641,3391.827,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.84,3416.74,"I know, but a vessel, it can unload anywhere along the beach, and here is a... here is the state's border, three miles out in the ocean, or nine miles, some places in the Gulf, and the vessel has crossed the border of the state."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3418.629,3419.926,"Well, Your Honor--"
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3419.926,3423.737,It may go into some... it may just unload.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3427.391,3429.454,--That's correct.
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3429.454,3437.106,Don't you think the state could stop that and insist on a search to see if it is carrying something that is contrary to state law?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3437.106,3443.306,"Well, I think... Your Honor, I think that might be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment."
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3444.01,3445.618,Assume it isn't.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3451.006,3457.035,"--I would say the border of the United States, the coast of the United States, is three miles... there's a--"
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3457.035,3460.253,What's the border?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3462.409,3465.284,"--I think it's three miles off the coast, Your Honor, if I'm not mistaken."
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3465.284,3468.642,Of the United States?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3468.642,3469.596,I think so.
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3469.596,3470.158,And what--
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3470.158,3471.377,It's Customs waters.
1982.81-1350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3474.298,3476.875,"--Well, that's... you mean the Customs waters is three miles?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3476.875,3477.86,If I... I think so.
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3481.592,3488.402,A few minutes ago you said it's all right to stop and search for bugs and things.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3488.402,3490.9,"At a permanent type check point, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3490.9,3493.805,"Well, suppose while they are looking for it they find marijuana."
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3493.805,3497.96,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3498.663,3500.349,Suppose they find marijuana.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3500.349,3501.396,If they find--
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3501.396,3503.786,While they were searching the lettuce.
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3503.786,3507.612,"--If they find marijuana, then the person is subject to being arrested and prosecuted."
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3507.612,3509.83,What's the difference between that case and this one?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3509.83,3513.939,"This is a roving patrol, random type search that leaves--"
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3513.939,3514.251,That's the only difference?
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3514.251,3520.718,"--Well, the only difference, too, Your Honor, is that it is... it was made pursuant--"
1982.81-1350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3520.718,3522.077,"The only difference, too?"
1982.81-1350,1,39577,richard_i_ieyoub,,3522.077,3523.311,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3543.911,3546.66,"--Do you have anything further, Mr. Alito?"
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3546.66,3550.862,"Two very brief points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1350,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3560.749,3570.199,"Well, on that, will you please put in a copy of your order which the U.S. Attorney filed, the motion to dismiss the indictment?"
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3570.199,3571.948,"--Yes, Your Honor, we will look into that."
1982.81-1350,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3571.948,3572.776,It is right here in the record.
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3572.776,3580.693,"Well, Your Honor, as I said, that was done not because they had no further interest in pursuing this case."
1982.81-1350,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3580.693,3581.911,"Well, it doesn't say... it just says he's the one."
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3583.176,3587.285,It was done because he wanted to comply with the mandate of the Court of Appeals.
1982.81-1350,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3590.237,3595.142,Do you have anything... Your time is not up.
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3595.142,3596.61,I am sorry.
1982.81-1350,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3655.757,3672.595,"Well, in your submission, it sounds like, your most recent one, anyway, is that on the facts of this case, this boarding was all right, but that you aren't pushing for any kind of a rule that you can search any... you can board any vessel that you find anchored 18 miles off the coast."
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3672.595,3678.624,"No, I believe it is necessary to do that, because until you inspect the documents, you cannot--"
1982.81-1350,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3678.624,3687.697,"So you are saying any vessel you find anchored or under way 18 miles off the coast or any distance off the coast, for that matter, you can stop and make a document check?"
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3687.697,3691.055,"--We believe the statute is constitutional, and that is what it provides."
1982.81-1350,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3692.383,3694.195,"Well, you are not arguing about the search, I don't suppose."
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3694.195,3696.677,--Pardon me?
1982.81-1350,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3696.677,3701.802,"Are you arguing that the search provision, part of the... is constitutional?"
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3701.802,3703.457,That is not the issue here.
1982.81-1350,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3705.862,3711.547,"But I take your argument to be, as applied here, it meets constitutional standards."
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3711.547,3712.609,That's correct.
1982.81-1350,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3721.2,3724.277,Is the statute limited to Customs waters?
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3724.277,3728.213,"No, it is in any part of the United States or in Customs waters."
1982.81-1350,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3728.213,3733.882,I was thinking about the request or suggestion as to whether or not a search could be made 100 miles off the coast.
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3733.882,3746.502,A search could be made 100 miles off the coast by the Coast Guard pursuant to a different statute which authorizes boardings on the high seas of any vessel subject to U.S. jurisdiction for the purpose--
1982.81-1350,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3746.502,3749.517,"There are some cases pending on that, isn't that correct, down in Florida?"
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3749.517,3759.7,"--There are many cases pending on that issue, and that authority has generally been upheld by Courts of Appeals based upon reasoning analogous to the arguments we have advanced in this case."
1982.81-1350,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3759.7,3767.416,Do you have in mind how many times we have denied certiorari on boardings off the Florida coast and--
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3768.822,3769.431,Quite a few.
1982.81-1350,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3772.82,3773.492,Both ways.
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3773.492,3778.067,"That authority has been sustained by at least three or four circuits, and cert has been denied on numerous occasions."
1982.81-1350,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3778.067,3779.099,May I ask one question?
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3789.97,3793.374,We did in our petition for rehearing.
1982.81-1350,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3793.374,3794.17,In your petition for rehearing.
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3794.17,3801.309,"We did not do it initially because of settled Fifth Circuit authority, and because we had won on alternative grounds in the District Court."
1982.81-1350,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3801.309,3801.668,Right.
1982.81-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3801.668,3803.572,But we raised it in the petition for rehearing.
1982.81-1350,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3803.572,3805.338,"Thank you, gentlemen."
