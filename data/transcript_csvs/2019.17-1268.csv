2019.17-1268,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.64,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1268, Opati versus the Republic -- Republic of Sudan. Mr. McGill."
2019.17-1268,0,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,9.64,25.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Sudan provided Al Qaeda with a safe haven and vital material support enabling it to carry out the embassy bombings, killing 224 people and wounding thousands more."
2019.17-1268,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,206.76,223.0,"In a case involving private -- a private defendant, rather than a sovereign nation, are there constitutional limits on Congress's ability to make punitive damages retroactive?"
2019.17-1268,0,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,223.0,240.84,"Yes, I think under this Court's decision at least in BMW versus Gore, the Due Process Clause imports some idea of fair notice that would be applicable to persons, but foreign states are not persons within the meaning of the Due Process Clause, just as states of the union are not."
2019.17-1268,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,240.84,254.12,"So if we just apply the Landgraf test, what would be wrong with saying if Congress wants to make punitive damages retroactive, it has to say so expressly? There is a magic words requirement?"
2019.17-1268,0,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,254.12,258.64,That would be inconsistent with the -- how the Court looked at it in Landgraf.
2019.17-1268,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,294.64,295.08,Is Sudan --
2019.17-1268,0,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,295.08,295.4,And --
2019.17-1268,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,295.4,312.24,"-- simply wrong when it tells us, as it did in its brief, that the Court has never permitted retroactive application of a statutory authorization of punitive damages in any context?"
2019.17-1268,0,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,312.24,326.72,"I'm not -- I'm not aware that Sudan is wrong as to what it said, but the Court was very clear in Landgraf that if the 1990 bill had been enacted, that would have been sufficient."
2019.17-1268,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,368.84,394.36,"Mr. McGill, is it really right that it does -- all the rest of it does apply retroactively? And I mean that in this sense, that under the old statutory scheme, 1605(a)(7), wouldn't a person have been able to get compensatory damages and all the other damages anyway? So that the only new thing that was added by way of this creation of a cause of action is the punitive damages."
2019.17-1268,0,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,404.16,450.04,"No, it's not correct, Justice Kagan, because as part of -- part of the rationale for Congress enacting a federal cause of action was that the Court in the Peterson case involving the 1983 Marine Corps barracks bombing, it held that persons -- family members proceeding under Pennsylvania law and Louisiana law had no -- had no remedy because the state -- the state law didn't permit for intentional infliction of emotional distress for persons not present at the scene of the bombing. So -- so Congress enacted -- in the federal cause of action, it -- it created a remedy that did not otherwise exist for compensatory damages in that limited instance, at least. I would point to --"
2019.17-1268,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,450.04,455.4,"Well, I guess -- I mean, it definitely created -- maybe I'm not -- not understanding the answer."
2019.17-1268,0,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,466.48,474.4,"A -- a family member who was in Pennsylvania -- who lived in Pennsylvania, for instance, had no claim for compensatory damages under --"
2019.17-1268,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,474.4,475.28,Because?
2019.17-1268,0,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,475.28,477.44,By dint of Pennsylvania state law.
2019.17-1268,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,490.92,491.52,Got it.
2019.17-1268,0,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,491.52,495.88,But -- but -- so that was part of the rationale for the federal cause of action.
2019.17-1268,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,495.88,496.6,Got it.
2019.17-1268,0,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,496.6,532.88,"There are two, at least two other points that I think demonstrate Congress's clear intent that punitive damages apply retroactively. First is the prior actions provision, which for qualifying cases provided not only that an action could be restored under the new Section 1605A but also that the judgment itself shall be given effect as if it had been originally filed under 1605A(c). And prior to 2004, many courts in D.C. had awarded punitive damages in cases under the Flatow Amendment."
2019.17-1268,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,768.64,780.6,"This is an aside of the issue here, but I have not seen the term ""solatium"" as a -- as an item of damages before. Where does that come from?"
2019.17-1268,0,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,780.6,803.24,"I don't know where it comes from originally, but it -- I think it -- it refers to the -- the emotional suffering of an aggrieved family member who is not themselves directly -- that -- that the injury that, for instance, a spouse suffers from have -- from viewing their -- their spouse or their -- their other family member suffering through an injury."
2019.17-1268,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,803.24,808.16,What about the retroactivity of punitive damages under state law?
2019.17-1268,0,62679,matthew_d_mcgill,,808.16,869.72,"So I think there, if the Court agrees with me that -- that the federal remedy -- that the punitive damages applies retroactively under the federal cause of action, then the state law cause -- then it applies -- the D.C. Circuit's decision with respect to state -- the state law cause of action really collapses. The D.C. Circuit's primary rationale was that it would be inconsistent to allow state law punitive damages and not -- if you had already decided that the federal law doesn't, you know, doesn't provide for punitive damages, and it was that -- what it said, inconsistent outcomes at page 129 of the petition appendix that really drove the decision. Two additional points I would make is, first, the D.C. Circuit recognized that without the Landgraf presumption, then the amendment would have lifted the restriction as to state law punitive damages."
2019.17-1268,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,966.44,970.36,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ross."
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,970.36,998.24,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: If I could start this morning with Justice Alito's question about a magic words requirement, we of course agree with Petitioners that -- or with Petitioners that Landgraf doesn't require that."
2019.17-1268,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1065.72,1067.0,If Landgraf --
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1067.0,1067.44,I don't --
2019.17-1268,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1067.44,1093.32,"-- is -- if Landgraf is a sort of substantive interpretive canon that is based on constitutional concern, why would it apply at all in a case involving a foreign sovereign? And if it's not such a substantive canon, it would have to be an interpretive canon that Congress generally doesn't want to impose liability retroactively on a foreign state. Would there be any basis for that?"
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1093.32,1096.64,So I think it is a canon of congressional intent.
2019.17-1268,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1239.0,1243.44,"Ms. Ross, I'm -- I'm trying to process everything you've just said --"
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1243.44,1243.76,Sorry.
2019.17-1268,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1243.76,1247.52,-- but let me break it down in a more direct way.
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1247.52,1248.52,Sure.
2019.17-1268,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1248.52,1271.2,"Your colleague said that we don't have to get into the Landgraf/Altmann issue, that we can just see the plain language of the statute and say whatever -- however we look at it through the Landgraf lens or the Altmann lens, Congress was clear: Punitive damages apply retroactively in this case. Do you agree with that proposition?"
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1271.2,1272.92,"I do, Your Honor, with respect to the federal aspect."
2019.17-1268,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1272.92,1273.16,All right.
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1301.64,1304.16,"No, Your Honor, we think that Landgraf would apply."
2019.17-1268,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1308.32,1311.52,"I'm sorry, I know your adversary takes a different tact."
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1314.04,1314.48,Correct.
2019.17-1268,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1314.48,1314.68,Yes.
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1314.68,1317.44,Petitioners think that you can apply Altmann across the board.
2019.17-1268,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1324.4,1333.88,You -- you don't -- you don't believe that it's only to private rights; you believe it's to any retroactivity questions?
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1333.88,1334.44,"Well, no."
2019.17-1268,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1338.92,1339.48,But on immunity?
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1339.48,1339.72,But on immunity.
2019.17-1268,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1340.44,1340.84,All right.
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1340.84,1354.24,"And we think that that's why Altmann, in fact, applies to the state law claims, because all Congress did with respect to the state law claims was adjust the extent to which United States courts are open to plaintiffs with preexisting claims."
2019.17-1268,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1398.64,1418.32,"If Congress thought that a particular country was an incorrigible sponsor of terrorism and it wanted to punish that country, would there be any constitutional barrier to Congress simply expropriating all assets of that country within the reach of the -- of the United States?"
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1418.32,1424.32,"Your Honor, the United States hasn't taken a position on the scope of a foreign state's constitutional rights in this case."
2019.17-1268,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1459.28,1471.36,But you think that Landgraf applies in exactly the same way to a claim by -- when the -- when the defendant is a foreign state as it does when the defendant is a private party?
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1471.36,1478.16,"I think that, again, we -- we haven't had a need to address that here because I think Landgraf requires that Congress be clear."
2019.17-1268,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1512.16,1530.96,"I mean, is the idea that if a -- if a foreign state is going to sponsor terrorism, it might think, well, you know, if we're going to be liable for compensatory damages, it's worth our while, but if we're going to get hit with punitive damages, well, that's going to stop us? Is that the -- the thinking of the U.S. Government?"
2019.17-1268,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1530.96,1534.12,"I don't think that that's the thinking of the U.S. Government, Justice Alito."
2019.17-1268,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1583.12,1589.4,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Curran."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1589.4,1634.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: First, a response to my friend Mr. McGill's opening histrionics, I note that the D.C. Circuit concluded that the -- that the evidence at the default hearing failed to show that Sudan either specifically intended or directly advanced the 1998 embassy bombings. The D.C. Circuit also acknowledged that Sudan expelled Bin Laden permanently in 1996, May of 1996, two years before the U.S. designated Bin Laden and Al Qaeda as terrorists. So I think that some of Mr. McGill's comments have some selective 20/20 hindsight aspect to them."
2019.17-1268,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1634.76,1637.72,Now -- but is that before us?
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1637.72,1643.52,I'm just responding to the -- the argument that Sudan is the devil incarnate here.
2019.17-1268,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1714.68,1716.36,But their decedents were?
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1716.36,1720.8,But their decedents were. But these are not claims on behalf of the decedents.
2019.17-1268,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1817.36,1830.76,"Well, Mr. Curran, assuming Landgraf controls, why isn't it met here? I mean, you've conceded that every other part of this statute applies retroactively. So how is it that you can exempt punitive damages from that retroactive coverage?"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1830.76,1831.24,Okay.
2019.17-1268,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1860.12,1862.68,"Well, Mr. McGill said sometimes there was."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1876.8,1877.0,Right.
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1899.84,1910.44,"But, Mr. Curran, just to try and pursue this question a little bit further, I -- I thought you had conceded as well that 1605A's cause of action applies retroactively, the federal cause of action --"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1910.44,1911.56,"Yes, yes."
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1911.56,1911.72,-- does.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1911.72,1912.4,Because --
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1912.4,1912.76,Okay.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1915.52,1917.44,"Well, it's new as a matter of federal law."
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1917.44,1918.24,Right.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1920.72,1921.0,"Okay, but --"
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1921.0,1922.64,-- is there a source of law that provides --
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1922.64,1923.04,-- there is a point.
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1923.04,1923.92,"May I finish, please?"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1923.92,1924.36,I'm sorry.
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1924.36,1928.48,"That's all right. So, and -- and this is just the heart of the matter."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1954.0,1975.0,"Yeah, the answer to that lies in this Court's analysis of the Bradley case, within Landgraf and within Altmann. Okay, Bradley was a case where there were -- there was an entitlement to attorneys' fees under common law. And then a statute was passed authorizing attorneys' fees."
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1996.96,1997.4,Right.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2015.44,2021.56,"Well -- well, I might change my concession as to the federal cause of action, if -- if the state -- if the prior state cause of action was --"
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2021.56,2022.2,Can we do that --
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2022.2,2022.36,-- irrelevant.
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2022.36,2023.76,"-- at this stage, Mr. Curran?"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2023.76,2025.64,"Well -- well, I don't know."
2019.17-1268,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2075.68,2105.64,"I thought you were really -- I thought it was a given that you were contesting the retroactivity only of punitive damages, not the basic cause of action, not the compensatory damages, not pain and suffering, not solatium, I -- and now you seem to be waffling or reneging on that concession."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2105.64,2105.92,No.
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2157.24,2164.76,"Well, we often say there's a state tort cause of action, that doesn't necessarily mean there's a federal civil rights cause of action, right?"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2164.76,2167.88,"True, but here there's no space between --"
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2167.88,2172.08,"So, hey, federal law can provide the exact same remedy that state law can."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2175.6,2181.16,"Well, I think under Landgraf and under Bradley, what we look for is the practical consequences."
2019.17-1268,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2194.8,2198.96,I don't know where your argument based on these state claims is going.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2228.24,2230.92,"That's exactly what I'm saying, yes."
2019.17-1268,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2231.68,2234.52,I think you're arguing in exactly the opposite direction.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2244.36,2244.64,No.
2019.17-1268,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2244.64,2250.32,-- no problem with retroactive application of the federal claim because you were already liable under the state law.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2250.32,2252.52,"Right, that's the proper application of Landgraf."
2019.17-1268,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2268.28,2268.84,"Well, what --"
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2268.84,2269.6,Suppose you're right.
2019.17-1268,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2269.6,2270.32,-- does that mean we have --
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2270.32,2313.96,"Suppose you're right that -- I mean, we take all this, you say, look, go read 160- whatever it is, whatever it is -- (c)(2), and it says, with respect to any action that was brought under 1605(a)(7), on motion, the judge -- it's -- shall -- it's treated, it shall be given effect, as if the action had originally been filed under 1605A(c). Now, when you look at the effect, as if it had been brought under 1605A(c), we get all these things like economic damages, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, and punitive damages, all right? So I'll make every assumption you want."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2344.0,2352.4,"Well, there's no reference to punitive -- you -- you -- you -- you summarized accurately 1083(c)(2)."
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2357.0,2360.16,"No, all there is, is the word ""as if."""
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2360.16,2360.64,Right.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2360.64,2384.84,"And it says ""as if the action had originally been filed under 1605A(c),"" okay? So if it had been originally filed under 1605A(c), you would have -- when you're looking to the damage, what damages shall I give, said the judge? Well, read the words, economics, solatium, pain, suffering, and punitive damages."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2384.84,2391.68,"This Court's decisions, Landgraf and the progeny, they all say that there has to be a clear statement of retroactivity."
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2391.68,2393.08,"Well, isn't this clear?"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2393.08,2393.92,That's not clear.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2393.92,2408.2,"It's clear because it says ""as if."" It's like if Socrates is a man, you know, what is that -- all men are mortal; if Socrates is a man, Socrates is mortal. It says all actions brought under 1605A, it shall be treated as if --"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2408.2,2408.36,Right.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2408.68,2413.6,"-- it is 1605, and to treat it under 1605A(c), you give punitive damages."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2413.6,2414.0,Right.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2414.48,2417.44,"Maybe Socrates wasn't mortal, but I thought he was. (Laughter.)"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2417.44,2420.28,"Well, 1083(c)(2) --"
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2420.28,2420.72,Yeah.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2420.72,2430.2,"-- applies only to pending cases, and it provides that by motion, a -- a party in a pending case, a plaintiff in a pending case --"
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.2,2430.56,Yeah.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2430.56,2443.24,"-- can make -- can, therefore, basically transition its action from the prior version, which is 15 -- 16 -- 1605(a)(7), to the new federal cause of action. So it's a transition."
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2448.88,2449.0,Yeah.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2452.24,2458.32,So it's -- so it's putting -- so it's putting that transitioned plaintiff on the same footing as a fresh-filing --
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2458.32,2458.6,Yep.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2458.6,2461.56,-- 1605A person.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2461.56,2462.08,Yep.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2462.08,2468.84,That -- that says nothing about whether punitive damages should apply to pre-enactment conduct.
2019.17-1268,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2469.24,2499.2,There's something strange about the -- the whole discussion of retroactivity because the doctrine is supposed to be based on people having an opportunity to know what the law is and conform their conduct to it. Are you maintaining that Sudan might have withheld their aid to Al Qaeda just to prevent exposure to punitive damages?
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2499.2,2540.24,"This Court's cases are pretty clear saying that even as to conduct that was illegal or immoral, the -- the bad man under -- to use Justice Holmes's terminology, is still entitled to notice of what the law is. Maybe a -- a -- a country in the position of a Sudan knowing about the extra liability of -- maybe they would have supervised their residents, their 40 million residents, a little more closely. But -- but the -- but the law does presume that -- particularly in the case of punitive damages, that it's only fair to apply them if the party was on notice of its exposure to that at the time of the relevant conduct."
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2540.48,2546.2,"It's like a due process argument, and I guess if corporations are persons, maybe foreign countries are too."
2019.17-1268,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2547.36,2547.52,That's another --
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2547.52,2548.28,"Well, this Court's said --"
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2548.28,2555.96,"But that isn't in front of us, is it? And as far as the words ""pending cases"" are concerned, you fall within -- are you a pending case?"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2555.96,2556.68,Pardon me?
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.68,2559.08,Were you -- are your -- are these pending cases in your view?
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2559.08,2559.44,"No, none of them are."
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2559.44,2560.44,They're not pending cases?
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2560.44,2560.72,Right.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2560.96,2570.08,"It says, ""with respect to any action that was brought under 1605(a)(7),"" yours was brought under --"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2570.08,2570.8,No.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2570.8,2572.64,It wasn't? What was it brought under?
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2572.64,2575.56,They were all brought after the enactment in 2008.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2594.2,2594.68,"Oh, I see."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2595.4,2596.44,You're looking in the wrong place.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2596.44,2597.44,Let me see I have if right.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2608.68,2609.32,Yes.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2609.32,2611.72,-- and your cases are big A.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2611.72,2613.08,Yes.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2633.28,2642.32,"But that -- wouldn't that be a little weird? In other words, you brought it under 1605A before what's called the Flatow Amendment, is this -- I don't know what you're --"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2642.32,2642.52,No.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2643.52,2653.0,"All right, wait -- you're saying it's under big A, and this latter thing, application of pending cases, is only small a."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2653.0,2653.48,Right.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2653.48,2660.04,"So if, in fact, you filed the -- a case in 1899 and it's still pending, it's true in some courts -- (Laughter.)"
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2660.04,2667.04,-- the -- the -- and you -- you -- then you wouldn't -- you would have punitive damages applied to that?
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2667.04,2667.32,No.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2667.52,2668.52,But if you filed it --
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2668.52,2668.76,No.
2019.17-1268,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2697.2,2702.4,Nothing short of -- of referring explicitly to punitive damages would be sufficient?
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2702.4,2704.48,I -- I think that's right.
2019.17-1268,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2756.4,2782.2,"Mr. Curran, if I could understand your position, are you saying that punitive damages are the only thing that was new, or are you saying -- are you conceding that there are some states where other sorts of damages and maybe some other liability rules were new, but that those get kind of swept into the mix and there is retroactive application of those?"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2782.2,2789.8,"I'm not aware of any new exposure that 1605A imposed, other than punitive damages."
2019.17-1268,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2789.8,2794.0,Suppose Mr. McGill can tell us we found three states where there's new exposure.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2796.24,2812.6,"If there was no exposure in those states, and then now there is under the new federal cause of action, I think a foreign sovereign defendant has an argument that that is new, that is a new disability, that is a new punishment, and it shouldn't be applied retroactively without a clear statement by Congress."
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2817.2,2822.44,"I want to be sure I understand this, but you're saying, I think, look at 1605A."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2822.44,2823.52,Yes.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2823.52,2833.76,"When you look at 1605A, it does provide for punitive damages, but it doesn't say whether those punitive damages are retroactive."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2833.76,2834.8,Correct.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2834.8,2841.04,"Now you look at 16- -- then you look at 1605A, application to pending cases."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2851.96,2853.96,I -- I'm not sure if I heard you right.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2854.2,2854.4,Is it --
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2854.4,2854.56,All --
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2854.56,2854.88,It says in --
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2854.88,2855.36,-- all of these --
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2855.36,2861.12,-- with respect to any action that was brought under section 1605(a)(7)? Yeah.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2861.68,2862.72,That -- that isn't ours.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2862.72,2864.12,So that whole section doesn't apply --
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2864.12,2864.32,No.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2864.4,2866.04,-- and when we look at the section that does apply --
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2866.04,2866.24,Right.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2866.24,2868.56,-- we see that it doesn't say anything about retroactivity.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2868.56,2869.56,I'll -- I'll say it again.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2869.56,2870.68,Is that it? Is that it?
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2870.68,2871.08,Yes.
2019.17-1268,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2878.36,2883.92,Is that a new argument? I thought -- are you saying that the federal cause of action does not apply retroactively at all?
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2883.92,2884.8,"No, I'm --"
2019.17-1268,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2884.8,2889.88,Under the new federal cause of action all you can sue for are things that happened after the enactment of that provision?
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2889.88,2900.6,"No, I'm saying that the new federal cause of action applies retroactively because under Landgraf's second step, it has no retro -- no practical retroactive operation."
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2900.6,2925.84,"And if we disagree with that premise, you lose, right, because if -- if we think that a federal cause of action adds in any way a material new potential liability, different statutes of limitations, for example, different elements of the cause of action, whatever, if -- if we disagree with you and we think that a federal cause of action is separate and distinct from a state cause of action, you lose?"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2925.84,2926.16,No.
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2926.16,2928.04,Why not? How -- how do you prevail then?
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2928.04,2932.8,"Because -- because if -- if the federal cause of action is really a new disability, is really a new --"
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2932.8,2933.08,Yeah.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2933.08,2938.64,"-- a new prejudice, then it requires an express statement by Congress --"
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2938.64,2938.88,And you've --
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2938.88,2939.56,-- of retroactivity.
2019.17-1268,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2939.56,2947.68,"And my understanding, though, is you've agreed that the retroactivity here is permissible, but you are saying that that -- that's -- that that -- maybe -- maybe I'm missing this."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2954.2,2954.68,"No, no, no."
2019.17-1268,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2970.12,2970.56,Excuse me.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2972.88,2973.88,Please.
2019.17-1268,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2973.88,2994.72,"Let's assume that this had been filed earlier than the amendment, that it was -- that it goes back to or it was timely filed before. Would you concede that 1605A(c) would make punitive damages retroactive as to that class of cases?"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2994.72,2996.12,I would not and I'll tell you why.
2019.17-1268,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2996.12,2996.6,All right.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3001.56,3002.16,Okay.
2019.17-1268,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3002.36,3003.2,-- it's not clear.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3003.2,3009.64,If 1083(c) was relevant because there was a pending case under 1605(a)7 --
2019.17-1268,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3009.64,3010.6,Exactly.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3010.6,3021.6,-- then I still would say where is the express or explicit command of retroactivity for punitive damages and I don't find that in 1083(c).
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3021.6,3022.68,You have a stronger argument.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3049.76,3049.92,Right.
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.72,3059.04,"Well, that's a pretty -- I mean, you have to say something like that. And, boy, we're in outer space, I think, by the -- we're --"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3059.04,3063.6,Landgraf tells us the -- the -- the notion of retroactive imposition of --
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3063.6,3063.92,Yeah.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3063.92,3067.52,"-- punitive damages is such a draconian step, it -- it is against --"
2019.17-1268,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3067.52,3068.36,"See, I've got that."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3068.36,3076.88,"-- the basic principles going back centuries about fairness. So before we attribute that intention to Congress, we're going to ask Congress to say it pretty damn clearly."
2019.17-1268,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3076.88,3077.64,"So, Mr. Curran --"
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3077.64,3078.52,That's all it says.
2019.17-1268,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3078.52,3115.24,"-- in your state of the world and if I understand it, it's not just punitive action, punitive damages now, it's really any new liability, any new damages. So you're conceiving of a state of the world where a defendant foreign state gets to walk in and say, well, there's this new thing and that wouldn't have been true before, there's this new thing and that wouldn't have been true before, and -- and that's what it will all come down to, right? And -- and, boy, that seems -- that seems awfully complicated and probably not what Congress had in mind, that somebody would say under Pennsylvania law it works like this. Under Wisconsin law it works like this."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3121.92,3125.28,"Well, the -- first of all, these principles aren't just for foreign sovereigns."
2019.17-1268,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3127.6,3128.32,Yeah.
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3128.32,3136.64,"Right? And -- and we're not taking a position that, oh, oh, the federal cause of action shouldn't apply retroactivity because of people in Pennsylvania."

2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3250.56,3254.0,"Well, that -- that's the issue, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.17-1268,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3277.44,3287.2,"Mr. -- Mr. McGill says that if your interpretation of extrajudicial killing is correct, then the terrorism exception doesn't apply to terrorism."
2019.17-1268,2,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3287.2,3289.44,"Yeah, that -- that's -- that's semantics."
2019.17-1268,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3289.44,3290.24,Well -- well --
