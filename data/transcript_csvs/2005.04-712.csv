2005.04-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.643,We'll now hear argument in Lincoln Property v. Roche.
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,5.877,14.762,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-712,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,139.03,148.549,"Well, I thought (b) simply enacted a special necessary condition when you had a local defendant."
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,154.436,169.921,"It is, Justice Souter, but what... my argument is that that language, properly joined and served, simply tracks the civil action requirement under the original diversity statute, as well as the removal provision of 1441(a)."
2005.04-712,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,170.714,187.013,"Well, it's consistent with it, but I... it seems to me that it's a bit of a stretch to say that anyone who is properly joined and served, at least in a formal sense, is, therefore, the only person who may be considered in a... in a diversity inquiry."
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,187.013,206.048,"--What the court of appeals did, and where we think it got off track, was it took the... to... the phrase ""parties in interest"", and it... and it took cases from this Court that have used the phrase ""real parties in interest"" to determine what are proper party plaintiffs, and it used that concept on the defendant's side of the ledger."
2005.04-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,223.198,228.161,"So, I take it your answer to Justice Souter is yes."
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,238.963,249.874,"--Our position, Your Honor, is that the phrase ""parties in interest""... we were seeking to find out where the court could have applied that phraseology on the defendant's side."
2005.04-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,263.362,279.709,"Mr. Frederick, what about cases where a plaintiff sues two defendants... one is diverse, and the other is not diverse... and there is a motion by the defendants to dismiss for want of diversity?"
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,318.707,319.61,"--There are, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,357.933,358.994,"Ah, but the plaintiff said,"
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,394.068,398.571,"And that position is incorrect, both as a factual matter and as a legal matter."
2005.04-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,424.454,425.125,The plaintiff--
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,425.125,425.768,--no question--
2005.04-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,425.768,441.956,"--the plaintiff points to two offices of the defendant, who's... the defendant is described by defendant as a Texas corporation... but there was one witness... Chaney, was it +/?"
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,450.151,455.054,"--Well, Mr. Chaney's testimony has to be viewed in contact... in context, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,513.558,527.116,"Well, they thought they got closer with a witness named Franzen, who was a Virginia resident, and who also described Lincoln as a partnership, and himself as a partner."
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,527.116,541.458,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, as the Real Estate Roundtable brief demonstrates, and is unrebutted, the real estate industry operates through many very complicated structures for perfectly legitimate finance and tax related reasons."
2005.04-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,605.376,610.851,"Mr. Frederick, earlier you made the point that Lincoln was a proper ""real party in interest""."
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,617.72,628.834,"Well, we don't think, Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, that the ""real party in interest"" analysis even applies on the defendant's side, but it is... it would not apply to this extent."
2005.04-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,641.662,645.261,"But if they... if they don't have a proper defendant, they should do that?"
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,645.261,649.013,"--If they do... if there is no proper defendant, then I think--"
2005.04-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,649.013,649.976,"I presume, then--"
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,649.976,650.317,--That's correct.
2005.04-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,649.013,657.308,"--that the plaintiff loses, not that you get to have the court find the proper defendant for the plaintiff."
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,657.308,657.819,--That's correct.
2005.04-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,692.733,693.604,Mr. Frederick--
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,693.604,693.795,--functional equivalent of an--
2005.04-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,693.795,694.676,--will you just clarify one thing for me?
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,701.596,702.119,--No.
2005.04-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,790.614,800.223,"Well, plaintiff certainly wouldn't want to say there's an indispensable party missing, I take it, because then that would put the plaintiff out of court."
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,804.966,811.776,"And, Justice Ginsburg, they never sought to name or join that other possible defendant."
2005.04-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,866.186,882.142,"And because you represent the removing defendant, it is true, is it not, that the removing defendant has the burden of showing that proper diversity exists?"
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,882.142,894.691,"And we readily satisfied that, both on the face of the complaint, which identified Lincoln Property Company as a Texas corporation, and in the remand notice, which identified its principal place of business as Texas."
2005.04-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,934.429,951.291,"What... I know you contend that's not the case, but let's say there is a in State subsidiary that's completely responsible for all the challenged actions, and the in State plaintiff sues an... only the out of State parent."
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,953.126,963.355,"Well, what the ninth circuit, in a... in an opinion by then Judge Kennedy that we have cited, called Simpson... said you respect the plaintiff's allegations."
2005.04-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1015.738,1018.474,"Mr. Frederick, would you clarify one thing for me?"
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1039.268,1047.192,"--If you agree with us on question one, Justice Ginsburg, reversal is the appropriate disposition, and the Court need not reach question two."
2005.04-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1071.03,1071.972,"Well, I don't understand it."
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1075.482,1076.013,"--No, but you--"
2005.04-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1076.013,1076.514,--that's the end of it.
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1076.514,1101.718,"--expressed disapproval with this very close nexus standard by which the fourth circuit attempted to engraft onto the normal citizenship rules for a limited partnership the notion that its citizenship could be deemed, if its activities had a very close nexus with the State... and I'm referring now to the passage, Justice Ginsburg, that's at pages 16(a) to 17(a) of the petition appendix."
2005.04-712,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1123.864,1131.416,"Yes, but, Mr. Frederick, before that... you know, read back... the court... the fourth circuit has said,"
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1166.257,1183.388,"Well, all of the evidence, Justice Ginsburg, in the record was that EQR was a Delaware limited partnership, where it was registered, composed of a Texas corporation as its general partner, and a limited partner that had two partners that were, themselves, Texas corporations."
2005.04-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1205.825,1213.226,"Am I correct, though, this entity we're talking about is not a party to the case?"
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1213.226,1213.767,That's correct.
2005.04-712,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.767,1214.61,So--
2005.04-712,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1214.61,1220.757,"That's correct, Justice Stevens, and that's where we think that the fourth circuit went off."
2005.04-712,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1279.938,1281.282,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1284.982,1288.371,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1300.538,1302.303,Was what?
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1302.303,1304.581,Was not a real party to the controversy.
2005.04-712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1304.581,1302.303,"Then why did you name it, in the complaint, as the defendant?"
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1308.632,1302.303,"Trial counsel named it, because that was the understanding that he had."
2005.04-712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1321.781,1326.194,"Then you'll be left without... if you've named the wrong defendant, then you have a suit against no defendant."
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1331.748,1337.347,"You're correct, Your Honor, and that's because Lincoln said that it was the manager."
2005.04-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1356.102,1356.193,I've never heard of that.
2005.04-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1356.193,1356.794,Well--
2005.04-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1356.794,1362.37,"I thought, if you sue A, and then it turns out A doesn't own the building, well, then you've got to sue B."
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1362.37,1363.675,"--Your Honor, that is--"
2005.04-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1363.675,1364.366,And you didn't sue B.
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1364.366,1365.197,--We didn't sue B.
2005.04-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1367.152,1372.186,"Well, that's too bad, that, unfortunately, if you don't know who owns the building, it's going to be hard for you to bring the lawsuit."
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1387.854,1393.89,"Your Honor, Lincoln represented to the public and to the court that it was, in fact, the manager."
2005.04-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1405.446,1406.87,"I've looked through the appendix, actually."
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1464.038,1464.308,--Your Honor--
2005.04-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.308,1465.282,--or did I misread it?
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1465.282,1466.886,--you read that absolutely correctly.
2005.04-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1467.076,1467.517,All right.
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1467.568,1467.738,--are other--
2005.04-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1467.738,1468.659,--what is the evidence?
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1468.659,1473.311,"--There are... there is other evidence on that issue, which I believe is a distinct issue, but let me address that issue."
2005.04-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1491.225,1492.859,Where is it in the appendix?
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1533.279,1547.651,"--On page 179 of the joint appendix, Your Honor, in Lincoln's supplemental answers to interrogatories, Mr. Franzen is identified in this affirmation as a senior vice president and partner of Lincoln Property Company."
2005.04-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1563.404,1564.879,What page--
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1564.879,1565.63,"I'm sorry, that--"
2005.04-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1565.63,1566.102,--is that?
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1566.563,1567.656,"--that was joint appendix, page 181."
2005.04-712,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1567.656,1569.941,"--Well, that's better than what is in the opinion."
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1572.169,1572.739,"181, Your Honor."
2005.04-712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1575.809,1588.125,"And how about joint appendix 239 and 275, both of which say that Franzen was not a partner in any entity responsible for managing the apartments in question?"
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1588.125,1591.545,"--Your Honor, that evidence was also in the record."
2005.04-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1610.813,1611.886,"--Well, Mr. Joseph, I--"
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1611.886,1612.407,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1612.407,1621.915,--I thought we had to decide whether an unnamed private party should be considered for jurisdictional purposes.
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1621.915,1622.145,Correct.
2005.04-712,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1622.145,1625.944,And do you have any case supporting that proposition?
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1625.944,1626.716,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1644.018,1652.733,"But the... it sounds to me... if I understood your answer correctly, you're talking about cases in which the named party citizenship is disregarded."
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1652.733,1653.414,"Correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1653.414,1658.558,"Where the question is, Should an unnamed party citizenship ""be"" regarded?"
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1658.558,1659.511,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2005.04-712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1666.542,1667.835,Then there's no defendant.
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1667.835,1689.431,"Your Honor, they defended the case. And we'd submit that, on the basis of Barney and Little, that what one does... on the basis of the State Highway Commission case, when you have someone who is serving as a surrogate for another, you look to the jurisdictional characteristics of the other; otherwise, he can, by coming in to defend, obtain a Federal forum to which he is otherwise not entitled."
2005.04-712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1689.431,1692.7,"Yeah, but he didn't come in to defend; you pulled him in to defend."
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1692.7,1692.7,It--
2005.04-712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1692.7,1711.615,"And the problem that I have with your position is, I don't know of anything in the record that indicates that he wasn't ready to defend, that he wouldn't have... or it wasn't ready to defend, that it wouldn't have paid the judgment, that you could have... could not have gotten, from the party you named, all the relief that you were asking for."
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1711.615,1714.685,"--Your Honor, it was definitely a party to the controversy."
2005.04-712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1721.835,1721.996,Okay.
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1750.259,1751.362,--Understood.
2005.04-712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1751.362,1759.917,"--principal and... corporate parent and subsidiary, or principal and business agent."
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1773.015,1778.453,"Your Honor, the facts, as you've stated them, I believe, are not the facts in this record."
2005.04-712,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1778.453,1778.863,Okay.
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1780.158,1780.469,And let me explain.
2005.04-712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1806.987,1809.828,But you named Lincoln as the defendant.
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1851.72,1853.705,"Well, let me try to make it less bizarre, Your Honor."
2005.04-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.88,1877.488,He's a real party if you sued him.
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1877.488,1878.369,--Your Honor--
2005.04-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.369,1881.718,Just because you're going to lose doesn't mean that he's not a real party.
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1881.718,1882.832,--It's one thing--
2005.04-712,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.832,1885.58,It seems to me anybody you sue is a real party.
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1885.58,1890.323,"--Your Honor, that cannot be the case, or the ""real party to the controversy"" case means that every defendant is a real party."
2005.04-712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1892.53,1923.321,"But they... let me stop you on that 17, and it's talking about plaintiffs, that suits have to be brought in the name of the real party so that the defendant isn't in a situation where he's sued one day by plaintiff A, and is not home free when plaintiff B comes in with the identical complaint."
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1940.821,1945.315,"--Your Honor, it's certainly true that rule 17 only deals with plaintiffs."
2005.04-712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1961.723,1965.997,Rule 17 is about joinder of parties; it's not about jurisdiction.
2005.04-712,1,25544,gregory_p_joseph,,1965.997,1967.631,Exactly right.
2005.04-712,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1971.04,1972.444,"So, that's... it's something different."
