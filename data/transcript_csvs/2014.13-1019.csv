2014.13-1019,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.027,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-1019, Mach Mining, LLC v. the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,9.885,12.073,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1019,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,34.904,40.606,"At -- at first, I thought this was an Overton Park case committed by law to agency discretion."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,76.082,76.75,Sure.
2014.13-1019,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,186.408,190.437,"Well, it's kind of an odd conciliation, isn't it?"
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,205.181,207.053,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-1019,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,262.265,277.665,"Well, but at the same time, Mr. Goldstein, and this really follows up on Justice Kennedy's question, the statute makes entirely clear that the EEOC has the prerogative to decide what kind of offer by the employer is acceptable or not."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,287.518,289.238,"Could I agree with the first part, but not the second?"
2014.13-1019,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.272,319.943,Let's not skip over the time provision as irrelevant so quickly.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,326.595,329.11,--It can if it cannot reach a conciliation agreement.
2014.13-1019,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,329.496,347.399,"So Congress couldn't think that this was any kind of an onerous requirement if all they have is 30 within 30 -- days they can say, okay, we told them that that -- that what -- the complaint is, they didn't come up with anything and so end of conciliation."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,347.399,353.393,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, we just, I suppose, disagree about the substance of the conciliation requirement is in that point."
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,404.172,415.543,"Mr. Goldstein, if I understand your argument, you're saying that there is an obligation to conciliate, but that obligation does not have to be pursued in good faith."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,415.543,416.803,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,417.383,429.005,"So that the -- even if the Commission enters upon a conciliation process, you think that the outcome of that is reviewable?"
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,429.005,430.259,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.113,446.977,That was my question.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,446.977,447.079,--Yes.
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.079,450.997,"It can declare when the finish line is, but it can do that in bad faith."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,450.997,451.533,No.
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.329,453.093,Yes.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,455.578,458.359,"It can it can -- say we didn't get to the finish line if it went through the motions, yes."
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,458.359,460.67,And it can say that in bad faith.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,460.67,463.01,"I don't believe that's correct, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,465.6,466.173,"Well, is it correct or not correct?"
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,466.173,466.719,It is not correct.
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,466.719,468.139,Because I don't understand your argument.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,468.139,469.604,Let me give you an illustration of my point.
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,494.698,503.604,"So fair application of the statute is reviewable, so that the proper -- I mean, we're just quibbling over, you know, how bad it is, that's right."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,503.604,514.893,"--Well, Justice Scalia, here's their -- their view of judicial review is that it is available, but it is limited to one thing, which is to say, did we send the employer a letter that said give us a call?"
2014.13-1019,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,522.329,541.836,But it is true that you -- you do not -- I think I'm correct in this -- reach out and try to incorporate the existing law on good faith bargaining in the labor context or there are many contracts which have good faith clauses and that the courts have tremendous difficulty with that.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,544.521,545.061,Right.
2014.13-1019,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,545.344,547.773,But it seems to me that that's you're safest harbor.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,547.773,548.818,"--Well, Justice--"
2014.13-1019,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,548.818,556.817,But you've already -- you recognized in in the prior exchange that there -- this is nothing like bargaining.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,561.234,561.687,--Yes.
2014.13-1019,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,561.687,564.627,Here there is no duty at all on the part of the employer.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,568.92,569.466,That's right.
2014.13-1019,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,597.893,606.235,"Well, it's unusual enough that there's a huge split among the circuits as to how to define what they're reviewing."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,624.727,626.848,"--Justice Sotomayor, this is not an ADA case."
2014.13-1019,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,627.185,628.193,"Oh, well, I agree with you."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,639.205,648.794,"--Justice Sotomayor, I think when Congress said informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion, it was contrasting bringing a lawsuit."
2014.13-1019,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,662.992,664.895,"Well, can we take take this case?"
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,664.895,665.285,--Yes.
2014.13-1019,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,665.285,668.075,The EEOC did send a letter saying--
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,668.075,668.942,Give us a call.
2014.13-1019,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,668.942,670.377,--give us a call.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,702.412,702.795,"Well, this--"
2014.13-1019,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,702.795,708.846,"Wouldn't the employer have to come up and say something like, okay, we'll -- we'll agree that we'll hire women?"
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,708.846,709.361,--Okay.
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.98,759.138,Can I ask something about this?
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,759.138,759.535,--Yes.
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,759.535,766.742,Conciliation I thought would be conciliation between the complaining parties and the employer.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,766.742,768.356,It's between sorry.
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,768.356,770.038,But and that's wrong?
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,770.038,772.006,It is the EEOC and the employer.
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.006,774.698,Between the EEOC and the employer?
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,774.698,774.872,Right.
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.821,787.062,"So even if the complaining party is willing to accept $500,000 rather than a million, if the EEOC says a million, the EEOC is conciliated."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,787.062,789.406,--The EEOC says it's conciliated.
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,789.406,790.154,"Well, no."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,792.545,792.873,Right.
2014.13-1019,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,827.656,830.558,"Mr. Goldstein, could we talk about that confidentiality provision?"
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,848.523,848.913,Yes.
2014.13-1019,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,848.913,861.586,"And your entire position would have all the stuff about this conciliation come in as evidence in a subsequent proceeding, which is to say, come in as evidence in the litigation of the lawsuit."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,861.586,861.866,Okay.
2014.13-1019,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,872.829,873.986,I'm just saying as a matter of fact--
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,873.986,874.076,--Okay.
2014.13-1019,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,874.076,882.418,--there is discretion in the sense that the statute clearly gives it to the EEOC to decide what's acceptable in the end.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,882.418,883.465,"Absolutely, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-1019,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,909.624,909.705,Yes.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,934.272,934.678,Okay.
2014.13-1019,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,943.3,944.957,I don't even understand that distinction.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,946.704,952.077,--Because the subsequent proceeding is not -- is about the merits of the subsequent -- the substantive claim.
2014.13-1019,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1019.924,1022.346,I would have thought that the point of the provision is very clear.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1034.03,1037.559,"Well, I just gave you three examples where I think plainly it can't be read that broadly."
2014.13-1019,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1038.249,1039.687,You left out one person.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1039.687,1039.902,--Yes.
2014.13-1019,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1039.902,1041.26,The complainant.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1053.132,1055.809,"This -- this, again, I think has to be a point in our favor."
2014.13-1019,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1092.827,1097.38,"But if it is confidential, that is plain in the statute."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1097.38,1099.618,"--But it's not confidential in that sense, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-1019,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1106.707,1114.805,So it's your position that the courts that have held that the proceedings are under seal or they're secret proceedings are just irrelevant; we don't need to be concerned with that?
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1114.805,1116.416,"Justice Kennedy, there aren't such courts."
2014.13-1019,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1117.406,1118.766,There are or there aren't?
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1118.766,1119.543,--Are not.
2014.13-1019,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1166.209,1173.599,Because they consider it -- and I think you can't quarrel with it; this is what Congress intended -- as a highly informal proceeding.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1177.782,1179.018,That's not quite right.
2014.13-1019,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1192.058,1192.831,"Well, what about that?"
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1200.904,1201.479,--Yes.
2014.13-1019,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1201.479,1202.205,All right.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1219.541,1219.853,Yes.
2014.13-1019,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1219.853,1230.771,"So we wrote an opinion, and probably you've read it, and we said, well, judge, yeah, if it's unusual and you really have some thought here that the IRS is in bad faith, you can go a little further."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1234.066,1234.319,Sure.
2014.13-1019,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1234.319,1234.892,And then -- okay.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1246.74,1248.004,Yes.
2014.13-1019,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1248.912,1250.659,"That's what your -- well, maybe there will be agreement on this."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1250.659,1251.49,--I doubt it.
2014.13-1019,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1270.446,1270.836,Aha.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1272.294,1274.54,--I'm doing so to try and be helpful.
2014.13-1019,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1284.316,1285.755,Maybe that's confidential.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1295.626,1296.118,--That is--
2014.13-1019,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1296.118,1297.285,--and he's not persuaded.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1306.575,1306.827,--No.
2014.13-1019,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1311.427,1312.819,That's at the moment what I have in mind.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1314.02,1314.613,--All right.
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1316.395,1319.331,I -- I think your response is persuade him about what?
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1319.331,1320.018,Persuade--
2014.13-1019,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.018,1322.299,He tried to persuade him about what?
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1327.703,1328.265,--Right.
2014.13-1019,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1328.689,1331.965,"--No, we didn't persuade him about not to commit suicide."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1343.248,1343.554,--Fine.
2014.13-1019,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1343.554,1346.347,And it'll be good for him and good for the company.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1346.893,1347.098,All right.
2014.13-1019,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1349.151,1350.781,"Mr. Goldstein, can I -- can I stop a moment?"
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1350.781,1351.471,Please.
2014.13-1019,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1351.471,1354.872,If the inquiry is about what happened--
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1354.872,1355.112,Yes.
2014.13-1019,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1355.112,1357.623,--at -- at the hearing--
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1357.623,1357.92,Yes.
2014.13-1019,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1359.421,1360.326,--At the conciliation.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1361.212,1361.252,Thank you.
2014.13-1019,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1361.252,1362.245,Okay.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1415.118,1415.217,Okay.
2014.13-1019,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1415.217,1423.249,"--which it's very simple for you to come in and say, we called, we asked to meet, they wouldn't meet with us."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1423.249,1427.668,Here are the things that we want and I do want to talk about what's in the record and why--
2014.13-1019,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1427.668,1428.061,"No, no, no, no."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1434.922,1435.206,--Justice--
2014.13-1019,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1435.206,1444.196,"So if you walked in and said, I'm not going to listen to you until you give me A, B, and C, I might say you weren't acting in good faith."
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1444.196,1444.548,--Okay.
2014.13-1019,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1503.537,1508.74,So you'd have all of the discovery and the conciliation process in 30 days.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1508.74,1509.722,--Your Honor--
2014.13-1019,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1509.722,1512.064,That -- that's basically what you want to -- to have.
2014.13-1019,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1512.064,1512.176,--No.
2014.13-1019,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1550.298,1551.25,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1560.246,1562.82,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1019,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1576.644,1579.737,"Ms. Saharsky, let me just ask you a simple question."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1615.581,1616.889,--Yes.
2014.13-1019,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1616.889,1617.971,"""You"" meaning the government."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1621.001,1622.414,You don't review it.
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1627.263,1628.23,And what -- I'm sorry.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1629.781,1630.449,--That's okay.
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1660.8,1670.764,But what if you have -- you sent a letter that says a representative of this office will be in contact with you to begin the conciliation process.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1677.182,1684.037,"--Well, the obligation of the agency is to say that it has been unable to secure a conciliation agreement acceptable to the commission."
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1684.221,1684.548,No.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1689.091,1694.949,"--Well, if it is challenged, it has to put the document into court that is the notice that it was unable to do that."
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1694.949,1697.651,"And they say here your document is signed by, you know, John Rowe."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1704.101,1711.365,"Well, if the -- if the document which says that the commission was unable to -- to secure an agreement acceptable to it--"
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1711.365,1712.067,"No, no, no."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1720.142,1720.735,--Yes.
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1720.735,1722.42,They said nobody contacted me.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1722.42,1730.013,I think the answer is that it is the process by which the there was an attempt at conciliation is not reviewable.
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1731.979,1736.119,"Is, in my case, judicial review of that question?"
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1736.119,1736.603,--No.
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1736.603,1742.149,"Nobody contacted me; they've got a letter saying they'll contact me, nobody ever contacted me."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1742.149,1747.115,"No, but we do not think that there are any situations in which that will arise."
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1750.894,1752.438,That's just assuming you're always right.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1752.438,1753.222,--That's--
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1753.222,1757.936,"I mean, I don't understand why you can't have a court at least say, okay, there's a direct conflict."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1758.486,1758.892,"--Right, okay."
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1758.892,1761.844,"--consume -- and he says it never got off the ground, and you can have--"
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1761.844,1762.406,Right.
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1762.406,1765.435,--Mr. Rowe file an affidavit and he can file an affidavit and--
2014.13-1019,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1765.435,1772.072,"You know, this is a -- this is Hornbook law, I thought, use it till this point."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1834.516,1835.739,"Well, a couple points."
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1847.107,1851.389,--You're saying if the agency -- the agency couldn't possibly have violated the law?
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1856.559,1861.694,"--I agree that that would be a problem, but that is not what Petitioner is arguing for."
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1862.618,1865.944,"No, it's not a question of what he's arguing for, it's a question of what you are arguing for."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1900.116,1903.802,"--It's the second one, and I'm sorry if I misunderstood your question earlier."
2014.13-1019,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1924.999,1933.715,What -- what -- what can you tell us about what the proper function of the court is in a case like the Chief Justice put?
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1962.31,1977.413,"--Well, what we're saying, Justice Kennedy, is that if it were controverted, if the other side said that there was not conciliation at all -- which is not what this side is saying, they are just saying it wasn't enough effort -- but if there was none at all, that we would put in place the letters that showed that we conciliated."
2014.13-1019,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1985.235,1986.502,But that's the difference--
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1986.502,2000.198,"What's extraordinary -- what's extraordinary is that counsel for the other side files an affidavit saying it never happened, I know you've got this letter, but we normally don't take the government's say-so when it comes to a dispute about whether -- whether something happened."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2000.198,2000.616,Right.
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2000.616,2003.368,"So he can say -- say, okay, here's the affidavit, we never got it."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2004.574,2004.727,Right.
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2004.727,2005.585,--Nothing ever came in.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2007.759,2008.211,Right.
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2018.237,2021.142,"Well, let's go back to the language you quoted."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2034.54,2035.87,"--Acceptable to it, yes."
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2035.87,2036.182,--Yes.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2048.536,2049.787,"Well, I think that--"
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.787,2051.36,"You just say, you know--"
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2051.36,2060.095,--I think that there's a real difference between what the EEOC is doing in its day-to-day activities and court review of the EEOC activities.
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.277,2071.103,--You have to make me an offer.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2075.557,2075.807,--Right.
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2080.82,2081.806,"No, not necessarily."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2082.486,2083.207,"--Well, that's what has happened in the--"
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2083.207,2093.658,"--draw a line somewhere, but -- but if the other side says the EEOC never made me an offer, I had no idea no notion of what I had to agree to."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2093.658,2096.859,"--But that is not what's happening and that is not the argument that they're making, is that--"
2014.13-1019,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2096.859,2098.813,So that's what -- that's where we are.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2168.377,2169.094,--Right.
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.869,2191.384,We don't have adopt a good -- we don't have to adopt a good-faith standard.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2206.67,2207.987,--There are several problems with that.
2014.13-1019,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2214.075,2221.197,"--We're looking we're looking for a safety net, that we said, please, tell us what the minimum rule is."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2227.206,2228.033,"--No, I'm saying that--"
2014.13-1019,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2228.033,2235.593,"And that doesn't answer Justice Breyer's question, and our general question, how do you want us to write what you want to hold in this case?"
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2235.593,2236.154,--What I'd like the Court--
2014.13-1019,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2236.154,2239.514,"All I hear is no review, period, goodbye."
2014.13-1019,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2239.514,2242.059,"Now, I don't want to hear we sent letters."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2267.466,2275.245,"--Well, we do think that the decision that the Court should write should focus on what the obligation is that's on the EEOC, the particular text that Congress enacted."
2014.13-1019,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2285.178,2288.878,"Fine, then what is the Court supposed to do to determine whether that obligation is met?"
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2291.565,2300.826,"--I think what the Court is supposed to do is if it's controverted, look at the letters indicating that there was an effort that was made by the EEOC and, as a general matter, not look behind those."
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2301.512,2302.308,So trust you?
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2302.308,2303.228,--a year-long -- process--
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2303.228,2303.837,Just trust you?
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2303.837,2304.636,--Well--
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2304.636,2307.167,The other side is challenging with whatever evidence it has.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2315.727,2320.801,--There's significant incentives that operate on agencies even when there's not judicial review.
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2324.879,2329.126,"But there are incentives on most people to tell the truth most of the time, but that doesn't mean that's the end of it."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2329.126,2331.953,"--There is also review by the President and by Congress, Congressional committees."
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.451,2337.436,"Ms. Saharsky, I don't even agree with you about the incentives."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2357.05,2369.958,"I don't think that that's true in most cases; and even in high-profile cases where the EEOC may believe that there's a very serious, substantial claim of employment discrimination, it is always easier to come to an agreement then to have to go through the burdens of litigation."
2014.13-1019,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2380.073,2386.152,"I know what your position is, but assume ours is just the hypothetical."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2400.362,2401.614,--Right.
2014.13-1019,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2402.207,2404.16,Give us give us what you don't want.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2404.16,2404.409,--Right.
2014.13-1019,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2404.706,2411.998,Give us a way to write it that gives you the least -- the less intrusion -- the least intrusion but more than what you want to do.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2411.998,2412.388,--Yes.
2014.13-1019,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2493.229,2496.637,What about that analogy with that IRS case?
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2496.637,2502.229,I think that that is a good analogy because the Court recognized that it would not be appropriate to second-guess--
2014.13-1019,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2502.229,2510.81,"So could we copy that, you know, just copy that, making appropriate changes, and say, look, Judge, you have to see -- you have their affidavit."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2553.348,2553.785,--Yes.
2014.13-1019,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2558.406,2558.605,What?
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2558.605,2574.503,"--towards -- the end of your question, you actually raise a really important ancillary point, which is that the process of trying to come to a negotiation and conclusion with someone often requires an element of strategy, that you might wait for them to make the first offer or you might find someone who says, we're never going to come to an agreement on this."
2014.13-1019,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2582.236,2589.653,"Well, what has been going on, in fact, in these cases now with some courts having just general good faith, others having a three factor test?"
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2598.01,2599.195,Yes.
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2632.867,2634.884,Do you disagree that they can publish it in the New York Times if they want?
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2634.884,2640.27,"--Well, partially, the the confidentiality provision has two portions to it."
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.534,2644.099,Right.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2644.099,2645.565,So that does not apply to employers.
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2645.565,2645.893,Right.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2645.893,2649.141,But the second part says that it can't be used as evidence in a court proceeding--
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.141,2649.675,Because that isn't credible.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2649.675,2650.19,--and that does apply.
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2650.19,2652.721,"That's not publishing it in the New York Times, is it?"
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2652.721,2658.515,"Right, but I think in most of these cases, the employers have not wanted this information while they've been in conciliation to become public because they would--"
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2658.515,2660.091,That only cuts your own argument.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2671.384,2673.727,"--Right, but what they can't do is use the evidence in court."
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2688.234,2691.049,"You say that, but it didn't say that it shouldn't be public."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2695.326,2697.061,"Fine, and I'll focus on the fact--"
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2697.061,2698.325,So why do you say the opposite?
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2698.325,2699.276,--I'm sorry.
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2744.221,2748.154,You said a moment ago that employees have no incentive to conciliate.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2749.328,2757.494,"I think that when employers know that they have a potential defense that would get the lawsuit dismissed on the merits, they start to treat the conciliation as an opportunity--"
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2757.494,2759.631,You're kind of assuming bad faith on their part.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2759.631,2760.411,--I'm not assuming--
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2760.411,2766.05,We're supposed to assume complete good faith on the Government's part and bad faith on this employer's part.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2766.05,2767.364,--That's not true.
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2801.96,2802.568,All this stuff is in footnotes.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2802.568,2803.489,--What?
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2803.489,2806.114,"All this stuff is in footnotes, that's where all the important stuff is."
2014.13-1019,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2806.114,2811.035,"It's a rule of brief writing, right?"
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2811.035,2812.096,"Well, you would know."
2014.13-1019,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2812.096,2812.813,Exactly.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2842.831,2845.202,Yes.
2014.13-1019,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2851.262,2851.543,Okay.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2852.167,2852.853,Communicated.
2014.13-1019,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2852.853,2853.368,--communicated.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2853.368,2854.386,Right.
2014.13-1019,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2857.993,2860.352,But you would not object to that; is that right?
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2860.352,2864.786,"--Well, not that the EEOC would have to -- couldn't produce that kind of information."
2014.13-1019,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2867.188,2867.785,"No, no, no."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2868.877,2869.641,--There wasn't enough information.
2014.13-1019,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2869.641,2872.172,--that -- so this goes back to the Chief Justice's first question.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2895.975,2896.318,"Right, I mean--"
2014.13-1019,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2896.318,2900.081,"--But just we told them what the claim is, and we talked about the claim."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2900.081,2900.721,--Right.
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3001.47,3002.375,That's the world.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3012.608,3013.466,I think the problem--
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3013.466,3014.152,That's extraordinary.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3015.637,3022.758,"--What I think is extraordinary, Justice Scalia, is reading something into a statute that doesn't exist, which is there are no standards in the statute."
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3022.758,3023.241,That is fine.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3078.84,3086.071,"Well, the -- the agency has not done that because it needs flexibility in these processes and because it doesn't believe that this is judicially reviewable."
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.541,3097.487,So if we tell you it's -- it's judicially reviewable -- suppose we just decide it's judicially reviewable and remand for the agency to issue rules?
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3097.487,3099.675,"--Yes, then the agency would do that."
2014.13-1019,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3113.483,3120.074,"I -- I'm not a conciliator or a mediator, but those I know who are might be able to create such rules."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3137.567,3138.113,I think that's--
2014.13-1019,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3138.113,3139.692,"And that is, I think, your point."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3147.374,3152.155,"--I think you're right, that to a significant extent the conciliation is more an art than a science."
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3165.553,3171.005,But I thought Justice Breyer said you have to make the phone call if your letter says it's going to make the phone call.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3175.38,3175.895,I think that--
2014.13-1019,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3175.895,3178.504,We're just talking about what the rudiments are.
2014.13-1019,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3178.504,3181.94,They're called conciliation -- what are the three words?
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3181.94,3185.39,"--Conference, conciliation, and persuasion."
2014.13-1019,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3185.39,3186.014,And persuasion.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3186.014,3196.075,"I think -- I think it's helpful to focus back on that language that Congress put in place, because we think that it did not intend and did not show any intention to put any kind of specific requirements like that on the commission."
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3199.245,3207.894,"Why does it -- in terms of additionally saying, yes, we called them, how can you conciliate this question has been asked; I don't know that we've gotten an answer without telling them what you want?"
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3224.046,3225.279,"--Well, two thoughts about that."
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3290.813,3294.42,You want to go -- you want to go to -- Congress wanted you to try to conciliate.
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3294.42,3294.982,Yes.
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3294.982,3303.229,"So to say that it's a good thing to get to the merits it seems to me is not -- doesn't take account of what Congress said, which is, before you go to the merits, try to conciliate."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3303.229,3311.489,"What I'm trying to say, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the point of Title VII is to stop employment discrimination, and that's what we're trying to do."
2014.13-1019,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3331.746,3338.103,"Well, we'll just say -- I'm going to say one more time, I think there's substantial merit to your position that the courts have gone too far."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3342.852,3343.211,Well--
2014.13-1019,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3343.211,3345.087,"Other than to say, no judicial review."
2014.13-1019,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3349.677,3357.328,"--I think that there are some options that Justice Kagan laid out, along with Justice Breyer, in terms of some minimal requirements for the agency."
2014.13-1019,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3376.509,3378.053,"Thank you, Ms. Saharsky."
2014.13-1019,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3380.522,3380.794,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2014.13-1019,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3447.021,3448.256,"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
2014.13-1019,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3451.162,3451.505,"--No, no, no."
2014.13-1019,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3451.505,3454.644,That's a necessary part of conciliation?
2014.13-1019,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3454.644,3469.529,"Justice Kagan, not their minimum, but the following: That is, if I'm the employer and I say, I want to talk, here's my offer, the EEOC can't steadfastly refuse to say what would be an acceptable conciliation, their -- their absolute last best offer."
2014.13-1019,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3472.214,3473.728,That's just good faith bargaining.
2014.13-1019,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3482.537,3482.865,The only--
2014.13-1019,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3482.865,3483.894,And that is a morass.
2014.13-1019,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3483.894,3486.234,"--Justice Kennedy, I'm giving some -- a few basic things."
2014.13-1019,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3493.374,3496.373,"Now, we just started with a tremendous difference."
2014.13-1019,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3507.649,3512.973,"Justice Ginsburg, could I just briefly get out the rudiments, because I think there's been significant interest in that."
2014.13-1019,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3544.509,3545.023,Why is it satisfactory--
2014.13-1019,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3545.023,3546.598,That is intrusive.
2014.13-1019,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3565.028,3565.668,--Justice Kagan--
2014.13-1019,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3565.668,3569.634,"In the context, just to -- where we're not supposed to look at any of that stuff at all?"
2014.13-1019,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3569.634,3571.697,"--We disagree with that, obviously, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-1019,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3579.582,3580.581,Do you have any other rudiments?
2014.13-1019,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3581.642,3582.999,"--No, I don't have any other rudiments."
2014.13-1019,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3596.742,3598.399,Shouldn't the game be on you?
2014.13-1019,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3614.718,3615.062,--Yes.
2014.13-1019,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3615.062,3615.983,--was in bad faith--
2014.13-1019,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3615.983,3616.076,Yes.
2014.13-1019,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3616.076,3616.95,--or didn't happen--
2014.13-1019,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3616.95,3617.403,"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
2014.13-1019,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3617.403,3619.481,--to set forth the circumstances.
2014.13-1019,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3621.929,3630.599,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, what happened is, we've stated an affirmative defense, and they moved to dismiss as a matter of law on the ground that the statute was unenforceable."
2014.13-1019,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3653.118,3654.775,"Thank you, counsel."
