1992.91-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.539,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-1420, Joan Growe v. James Emison."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,59.455,63.24,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,252.997,262.37,"Well, Mr. Tunheim, I guess at least Scott v. Germano says that the Federal district court should set a timetable for the State action."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,262.37,263.905,Yes.
1992.91-1420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.905,271.743,Do you concede that it is the role of the Federal court to do that much?
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,271.743,273.743,"It... yes, I do, Your Honor."
1992.91-1420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.551,298.895,"Now, in this case I take it the Federal district court did not set a timetable for the State to make congressional redistricting?"
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,298.895,306.815,"The Federal court in this case, Your Honor, set a timetable for the legislature to act."
1992.91-1420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,308.916,310.368,On congressional redistricting?
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,310.368,314.154,--For the legislature to act on congressional and legislative redistricting.
1992.91-1420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,314.154,316.772,And for the State court?
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,316.772,325.462,The Federal court did not set a deadline for the State court because it essentially ignored the State court throughout the process.
1992.91-1420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.93,334.568,And we have an election coming up tomorrow.
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,340.138,345.641,The election tomorrow is being operated pursuant to the stay of this Court.
1992.91-1420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.529,354.731,But congressional by the Federal district court plan.
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,354.731,355.564,--But congressional districts by the Federal.
1992.91-1420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.564,367.622,"And do you say that this Court, if we think the district court erred with regard to the congressional plan, should set aside that election?"
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,371.057,377.145,We are not asking this Court to take any action with respect to the election tomorrow.
1992.91-1420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.741,400.443,"Well, suppose we agree with you and say the district court erred."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,403.478,422.876,The relief that we're asking with respect to congressional districts is that the Federal court decision be reversed and the matter be left for the State court to complete the process of congressional district that it... congressional redistricting that it worked on throughout the year.
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.468,444.289,"Well, the... that would happen if the State legislature acted anyway."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,444.289,452.895,"Yes, it would, Justice White, but the State court panel was proceeding in view of a valid--"
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.895,469.689,"Yes, the State... yes, but the State court isn't about to insist on having its own plan govern the 1994 elections if the legislature has come up with a plan of its own that meets constitutional requirements."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,469.689,470.372,--Absolutely.
1992.91-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,503.328,514.717,"Mr. Tunheim, in response to a question from Justice O'Connor, you said that the Federal district court should set a timetable for the... does that mean anything more than a deadline?"
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,523.573,524.507,"No, I'm not, Your Honor."
1992.91-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.417,542.053,"And if it isn't done by that time, then the Federal court says, all right, we can't wait any longer."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,543.955,545.188,That's correct.
1992.91-1420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,545.188,557.312,"And your position is that that deadline applies not just to the State legislature, but also to the State courts, that you set a date and if the State hasn't taken action by then either through its legislature or through its courts, then the Federal courts get in."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,557.312,557.914,That's correct.
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,569.436,572.84,"But in this case, the State court was working, wasn't it?"
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,572.84,574.74,The State court was proceeding.
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.517,594.503,Was that beyond the deadline that the Federal court had--
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,594.503,594.82,--No.
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.728,608.93,--Not for the congressional districting.
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,608.93,618.369,"But for... well, for legislative redistricting and congressional redistricting, both of which are the power of the legislature to draw lines if they can accomplish that task."
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,618.369,618.869,I know.
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,625.975,628.442,"Yes, January 20, the same date--"
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,628.442,632.545,And was the State court willing to wait longer than that?
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,632.545,635.68,--The State court was proceeding through the process--
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.68,637.616,Yes or no?
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,637.616,640.901,--The State court did adhere to that date.
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,650.54,652.376,Prior to January 20.
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,652.376,656.244,"--Well, it was waiting until the legislature had an opportunity in January."
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.736,668.686,Before January 20?
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,668.686,670.338,Before January 20.
1992.91-1420,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,671.771,684.578,"I take it you would agree that the time set, let's say, for State court action should be a time which would leave the Federal courts with time themselves to come up with a plan if the State courts don't."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,686.847,695.286,"Yes, I would, Justice Souter, although I must reemphasize the unique time pressures that are involved in redistricting."
1992.91-1420,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,704.909,705.292,Right.
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,742.517,752.824,"Well, because of the unique nature of redistricting, which is a function that this Court has time and time again referred to as an important State function."
1992.91-1420,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,753.607,758.895,"Well, I know it, but I mean, how does that help you to get to an answer of my... to my question?"
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,758.895,768.167,"--Well, it helps because what is important for the Federal court to do is to leave sufficient time for the State to complete its process."
1992.91-1420,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,771.203,773.003,"Yes, but if I may interrupt you."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,805.34,823.588,"--Well, hopefully, that would not be the case that... if the Federal court would permit a State to go through the process, both legislative and through the State judiciary, and give them an opportunity to complete this process in the 10-month period of time, that is really what is at stake in the abstention rule."
1992.91-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,831.758,842.966,"Well, that is a difference between this case... why should the Federal court have retained jurisdiction here since the State court proceedings were initiated before any Federal court proceedings were?"
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,842.966,851.488,"--Well, I would suggest that that was the rule that was suggested by this Court in Germano, that the court retain jurisdiction."
1992.91-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,851.488,854.457,"Yes, but as you should point out in Germano, the Federal court proceedings came first."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,857.492,867.248,The only reason for the Federal court to retain jurisdiction is just simply to provide some kind of assurance that all concerns of voters will be resolved in the process.
1992.91-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,867.248,867.615,"Well, what--"
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,867.615,870.217,"If a State court is ongoing, there really is no need for a Federal action."
1992.91-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,870.217,874.437,"--Yes, and the Federal court cannot review the State court decree."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,885.578,888.178,I would suggest to the Court that that is a better rule.
1992.91-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,891.213,893.815,But Germano is different factually from this case.
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,893.815,903.873,"--Germano is different factually, although I would... I would hesitate to think that a rule that provided for some sort of race to the courthouse would be the proper rule to apply."
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.966,939.729,"Are you... I gather you're suggesting that... suppose the State court in this case had finished both jobs, both the legislative job and the congressional redistricting, and the... there was also a suit pending in the Federal court."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,957.091,961.543,"I suggest, Justice White, that it should not review the decision of the State court."
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,979.921,982.223,This isn't a question of res judicata exactly.
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1011.242,1013.194,--Absolutely not.
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.056,1037.893,"Of course, the State court hadn't finished the job when the Federal court ruled on congressional redistricting."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1037.893,1038.777,--Pardon?
1992.91-1420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1039.662,1048.017,"The State court had not, as a matter of fact, finished the job on the congressional redistricting when the Federal court acted."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1048.017,1055.671,"That is true, in part because of the first of the Federal injunctions which stopped the State court from proceeding forward."
1992.91-1420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.671,1067.396,What if... how would your rule apply to a case in which the plaintiff in the Federal action raises issues that were not raised in the State litigation?
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1076.335,1094.229,"Well, certainly if there are no issues raised in the State court action with respect to the Voting Rights Act, which is not the case here, but were that to be the case, and there is still sufficient time for a Federal court to review those issues before the election, the Federal court should go ahead and review those because that's an entirely separate action."
1992.91-1420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.229,1096.265,Or if they're challenging a different part of the State.
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1104.104,1119.447,"I would suggest that in that instance the State court should provide, as this Court did, an opportunity for anyone to come forward with their concerns, their one person/one vote concerns, in any part of the State and to resolve those in the State court."
1992.91-1420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1119.447,1123.483,Must the plaintiff challenge in the State court if the plaintiff prefers a Federal forum?
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1123.483,1136.306,"Well, certainly we wouldn't argue a rule that forces a plaintiff to go to State court, although from the administration of justice standpoint, that may be the best rule under the narrow window of the redistricting process."
1992.91-1420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1151.252,1155.37,"Of course, a lot of the time is not always attributable to the Federal proceeding."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1156.204,1156.67,Absolutely.
1992.91-1420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.06,1171.48,"Mr. Tunheim, could you tell me... you made the comment, of course, the State court didn't finish because it was enjoined."
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1178.234,1186.49,The State court issued a final order on legislative redistricting after the Federal court issued its injunction in December.
1992.91-1420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.894,1221.996,That was when?
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1221.996,1222.863,In February.
1992.91-1420,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.863,1223.563,February.
1992.91-1420,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1223.563,1226.365,Right.
1992.91-1420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1229.833,1231.019,"Very well, Mr. Tunheim."
1992.91-1420,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1237.172,1240.29,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1992.91-1420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1257.836,1261.621,Do you take no position at all on the abstention argument that we've just heard?
1992.91-1420,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1261.621,1262.621,We do not.
1992.91-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1530.679,1546.006,"General Starr, I know the Government doesn't take a position on the threshold issues here, but does the section 2 analysis in a Federal proceeding depend at all on what may have happened with regard to section 2 issues in a State proceeding?"
1992.91-1420,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1546.006,1564.252,"It is conceivable, it seems to me just in terms of the orderly administration of justice, that the district court might well be advised to look to the record of the proceedings in the State court case assuming that it had, in fact, had a trial, or at least there were evidentiary submissions and so forth."
1992.91-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1564.252,1578.846,"Well, beyond looking at the record, supposing a State court disagreed with your analysis and found a section 2 violation that you would say was plainly wrong, would there be... would that judgment be entitled to full faith and credit in a parallel Federal proceeding, do you think?"
1992.91-1420,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1578.846,1582.731,"Well, again, we have taken no position at all on that."
1992.91-1420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.731,1592.587,"This is very important because we have ongoing litigation in two systems frequently, and I think the United States... it's strange to me you don't have a position on that issue."
1992.91-1420,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1592.587,1601.359,Primarily because of the inherently fact-intensive nature of these proceedings.
1992.91-1420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1730.894,1738.333,The court said there was no statistical evidence of political cohesiveness in the minority.
1992.91-1420,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1752.908,1753.743,--To the contrary.
1992.91-1420,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1786.897,1789.933,How did the district court handle that?
1992.91-1420,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1798.789,1799.805,Exactly right.
1992.91-1420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1815.897,1824.27,"General Starr, was there a Voting Rights Act challenge to the congressional redistricting brought in State court here?"
1992.91-1420,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1824.27,1824.62,I'm sorry.
1992.91-1420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1828.055,1836.228,And was there any section 2 Voting Rights Act challenge to the congressional plan brought in the Federal district court?
1992.91-1420,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1836.228,1837.761,No.
1992.91-1420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1837.761,1842.965,"And so, what is the error there if there was one?"
1992.91-1420,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1842.965,1848.285,"I'm not sure that there was in the congressional area, and I don't think that there has been an appeal with respect to that."
1992.91-1420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1848.285,1849.135,And you don't... you take no position on that.
1992.91-1420,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1849.135,1850.153,We take no position with respect to that.
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,1858.307,1861.878,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1420,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1937.259,1941.663,"Well, how do you explain Scott v. Germano if you're correct, Mr. Willis?"
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,1941.663,1954.888,"I don't view, although I will have to admit, Chief Justice, that the... we bought into the language used by the appellants describing Scott v. Germano as an abstention case."
1992.91-1420,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1972.682,1997.465,"But that doesn't tell you what should happen if a State court... after the Federal court holds its hand, if the State court decides the issue... do you think Gingles tells... or do you think Scott against Germano tells you that this Federal court can then sit in judgment of how the State court decided the issue?"
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,1997.465,2020.847,"--I'm not... I think that Scott v. Germano is an anomaly, and it is, as this Court knows, a case that arose as part of the spate of decisions across the country that followed Baker v. Carr and Reynolds v. Sims when virtually every redistricting plan in the country was rendered unconstitutional."
1992.91-1420,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.847,2034.44,"So, the main holding was, whether you call it abstention or what, it was the Federal court should not have proceeded to adjudicate the case while the State agencies were working."
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2034.44,2054.335,"I think the case has to be read that way, but it also has to be recognized that that case was brought 2 years in advance of an election, and I don't think that it provides very efficient guidance for Federal courts today operating under the kinds of time constraints that Mr. Tunheim has described."
1992.91-1420,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2054.335,2065.893,"Well, supposing the Minnesota State court had completed its redistricting plan and the plaintiffs in the Federal action said, well, this is all wrong."
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2078.869,2090.01,"I don't think the Federal court reviews the State court plan on the merits, but I think the Federal court has an obligation to adjudicate the claims that are before it no matter what the State court has done."
1992.91-1420,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.01,2093.045,Even though it reaches a result in conflict with the State court--
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2093.045,2093.895,Even if it reaches a--
1992.91-1420,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2093.895,2094.678,--on the same issues.
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2094.678,2098.782,--Even if it reaches a result in conflict with the court on the same issues.
1992.91-1420,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2098.782,2100.901,That's a rather strange result.
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2100.901,2129.385,"It strikes me, Your Honor, that this Court in its decision in New Orleans Public Service 3 years ago rather strongly stated that abstention principles... the Younger abstention principle that has been argued for application here in this case does not require abstention in deference to a State judicial proceeding reviewing legislative or executive action."
1992.91-1420,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.148,2156.036,But the Chief Justice's question to you didn't involve a future or pending State action.
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2164.558,2169.879,I said that the... in my judgment the Federal court could reach an inconsistent conclusion.
1992.91-1420,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2169.879,2183.805,"Do you know of any other area where this is so, where a Federal issue was presented to a State court, the State court decides it and rules upon it, and a Federal court has authority to review that same issue and come to a different conclusion?"
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2183.805,2196.613,"Justice Scalia, we are... in this particular instance, we are dealing with a situation in which the Federal court and the State court, having simultaneous jurisdiction, you know, had claims before it."
1992.91-1420,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2200.748,2203.1,There are lots of areas where claims can be brought in either Federal or State courts.
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2222.68,2225.382,"Your Honor, it's--"
1992.91-1420,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.382,2229.417,You might consider whether the parties are the same.
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2229.417,2231.536,"--Well, thank you, Your Honor, but--"
1992.91-1420,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2281.052,2288.473,"Well, Mr. Willis, now here is it true that the State court suit was filed first?"
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2288.473,2289.489,"That is true, Your Honor."
1992.91-1420,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2289.489,2294.86,And the State court acted in a timely fashion.
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2294.86,2297.561,"Your Honor, we would not concede that."
1992.91-1420,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2332.985,2334.603,"Well, enact plans."
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2338.305,2341.59,It depends on how one reads the State of Minnesota.
1992.91-1420,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2341.59,2348.863,"Well, if one thinks that enactment of a plan refers to a legislative act, then it didn't cover it."
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2348.863,2350.196,"It could be read that way, Your Honor."
1992.91-1420,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2350.196,2355.533,"And if we read it that way, then the State court acted in a timely fashion perhaps."
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2357.017,2358.485,That is arguable.
1992.91-1420,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2358.485,2369.241,And do the respondents claim that the State plan that was enacted for legislative districts is unconstitutional?
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2369.241,2369.777,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1420,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2438.354,2442.306,"So, what we have left is the State court adopted plan."
1992.91-1420,2,18152,bruce_donald_willis,,2446.677,2447.56,--The State court adopted plan--
1992.91-1420,3,33256,john_r_tunheim,,3694.036,3695.436,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
