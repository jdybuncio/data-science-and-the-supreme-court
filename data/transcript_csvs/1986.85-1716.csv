1986.85-1716,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.206,"We will hear argument next in No. 85-1716, Jean E. Welch versus State Department of Highways and Public Transportation."
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,41.827,60.472,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Jean Welch was crushed and injured between a mobile crane and a guard rail in 1981 while employed as a marine technician for the State Highway Department of the State of Texas."
1986.85-1716,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.715,205.866,"Mr. Cucullu, would you say that the constructive waiver theory in Parden is inconsistent with this Court's most recent statements about the need for Congress to use express language to leave no room for another construction if the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity is to be waived?"
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,205.866,207.182,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1986.85-1716,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.087,243.657,"Is it open to us, do you think, to just overrule Parden in this case?"
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,243.657,244.791,Of course it is open to you.
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,288.0,291.804,Do federal courts are exclusive jurisdiction under the Jones Act?
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,291.804,293.038,"No, Your Honor, they do not."
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,293.038,295.204,How about a state court suit?
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,295.204,301.375,"It was an option to the plaintiff, to Ms. Welch, at the time that the suit was filed."
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,302.81,304.11,"What, has the statute run now, or what?"
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,304.11,305.179,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,305.179,314.618,Because it didn't seem to me that the Court of Appeals foreclosed any Jones Act suit in the state court.
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,318.836,326.425,"It was open, but there is language also in the state court in the concurring opinion of Judge Gee, for instance, Your Honor, which indicates that--"
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,326.425,327.108,In the Court of Appeals.
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,327.108,328.141,--The Court of Appeals.
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,342.185,342.851,I see.
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,342.851,349.021,That she has no right to pursue a Jones Act claim against the state within the state court system.
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,350.123,358.044,You think that the judge indicated that Texas has closed its court to Jones Act cases?
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,358.044,381.226,"--It was indicated first of all Your Honor, in the District Court level by the decision of Judge Sire, who was also one of the authors of one of the Texas appellate court decisions before he took the District Court bench, and that foreclosed the issue as far as the State of Texas is concerned, which allowed... which precluded Jean Welch from filing her Jones Act suit within the state system."
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,774.332,778.284,You don't think xxx do you?
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,778.284,779.484,--Pardon?
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,779.484,782.12,The Court of Appeals didn't question Petty?
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,782.12,784.022,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.022,788.676,So your client was a Jones Act employee.
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,788.676,790.442,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,790.442,792.461,"That was the holding of Petty, wasn't it?"
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,792.461,796.43,"No, the holding of Petty was--"
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,796.43,801.315,Didn't they treat a state employee as a Jones Act seaman?
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,801.315,801.498,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.498,802.834,Jones Act seaman?
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,802.834,809.504,As a Jones Act seaman allowing that seaman to pursue his rights in federal court for injuries.
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.426,820.961,Exactly.
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,820.961,835.721,"So if we don't... if we take that out, and if you have a narrow reading of Petty, then the only effect of it as far as this particular case is concerned is that with that clause and with Congressional approval obviously my client should succeed."
1986.85-1716,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,835.721,842.459,We should judge this case as though this client was a Jones Act seaman?
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,842.459,843.142,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1716,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,944.805,948.709,"Do we have the first clearly, a person who clearly as a remedy under the Jones Act?"
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,951.275,956.827,"We certainly do, Your Honor, in connection with the issues--"
1986.85-1716,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,956.827,957.945,"Well, maybe we do, maybe we don't."
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,962.047,964.083,--As to whether or not we have a seaman?
1986.85-1716,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,964.083,968.201,A seaman who can recover under the Jones Act.
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,971.67,974.038,"I don't believe that is an issue in this case, Your Honor."
1986.85-1716,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.412,987.864,"--No, I am not talking about the status as a seaman."
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,997.804,999.506,That is certainly our contention.
1986.85-1716,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1281.622,1291.243,In your brief you also argue that in any event the state has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity.
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,1298.297,1301.849,"It was not presented as one of the questions, Your Honor, and--"
1986.85-1716,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1301.849,1307.737,And it isn't really properly before us or open to us to decide that surely.
1986.85-1716,0,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,1307.737,1314.759,--It is a collateral issue which comes with the constructive or the implied waiver argument quite frankly is why it was included in the brief.
1986.85-1716,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.744,1524.16,"Thank you, Mr. Cucullu."
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,1526.112,1546.01,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to divide my argument into two parts."
1986.85-1716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.25,1565.137,But to ignore the doctrine that you reach jurisdictional issues first.
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,1565.137,1573.243,"No, Your Honor, I think it doesn't ignore that doctrine, because I think in fact... well, let me answer that two ways."
1986.85-1716,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.679,1610.952,"Of course, if you are correct, why would the Petty court have analyzed the thing under two distinct heads?"
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,1623.426,1630.83,"Yes, Your Honor, that is what the Petty court says, but I think the Petty court is wrong, and would offer the Court three proofs."
1986.85-1716,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1884.627,1894.649,"You don't challenge California against United States, then, holding that a state was an employer for purposes of the FELA, because you say the Jones Act is different from the FELA."
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,1894.649,1895.116,--That's right.
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1906.805,1909.876,xxx not follow Petty.
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,1909.876,1913.828,"I think, Your Honor, that Petty is completely dicta."
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.946,1917.646,"Well, anyway, your answer is yes--"
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,1917.646,1918.897,"Yes, the dicta--"
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1918.897,1919.781,--you don't follow that part of Petty?
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,1919.781,1924.433,"--The dicta should be rejected, Your Honor, and I would point out that Petty had two holdings."
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.924,1940.209,The Jones Act applies or that you can sue because of that?
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,1940.209,1950.315,"That there was waiver, yes, Your Honor, on the sue and be sued clause, but the second holding was that the Commission could be sued under the Jones Act."
1986.85-1716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2004.816,2019.225,"Well, you may call it dicta but it was really the rationale, the rationale of finding that the bi-state commission was suable was apparently that a state is suable, and therefore a bi-state would be suable."
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2021.908,2023.177,"I think that is right, Your Honor."
1986.85-1716,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2023.177,2026.212,"I mean, you can all it dictum, but it is a dictum that is part of the rationale."
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2028.545,2032.163,Certainly. You have to reject the rationale of that alternative holding.
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2057.96,2061.496,And I suppose now you are going to say that if you don't overrule Petty you overrule Parden.
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2061.496,2065.967,"Well, if you don't overrule Petty you don't even reach the Parden question because--"
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.967,2067.667,If you overrule it.
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2067.667,2068.918,--Excuse me.
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.286,2077.156,"Now your other argument is Parden, I guess."
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2077.156,2077.706,That's right.
1986.85-1716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.048,2307.833,"General McCown, can I ask you a question about the Eleventh Amendment?"
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2307.833,2308.452,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2308.452,2312.82,Which says that the judicial power of the United States doesn't extend to any suit in law or equity.
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2325.295,2332.818,"It is absolutely settled, and the Court took on both heads of admiralty jurisdiction in New York One and New York Two in 1921."
1986.85-1716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2332.818,2333.284,In the two New York cases.
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2333.284,2346.308,And it said that admiralty in rem jurisdiction against a vessel is barred by sovereign immunity doctrine under the Eleventh Amendment and admiralty in personem jurisdiction is barred by sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.308,2347.26,And Petty accepted that.
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2347.26,2348.227,Sir?
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2348.227,2349.71,And Petty accepted that.
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2349.71,2359.735,"And Petty accepted that as well, so the notion that admiralty somehow has an exception doesn't come into play in this case."
1986.85-1716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2359.735,2363.17,"They didn't really explain it very well in the New York cases, did they?"
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2364.337,2379.197,"Well, I think the explanation was that the Eleventh Amendment is but an exemplification of the doctrine of sovereign immunity, and the doctrine of sovereign immunity comes from the structure of the Constitution and applies to admiralty as well as it does to law or to equity."
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.017,2678.943,What about the statement that the Jones Act cases will not be entertained in the state courts because the only thing that is left is whether the Workman's Compensation Act applies?
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2678.943,2699.94,"Well, that's... the Lyons decision, which was a decision by an intermediary Court of Appeals in Texas, said that there is no Jones Act claim, but obviously were this Court to hold that there is a Jones Act claim against the state, well, then certainly the state courts of Texas would honor that."
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.629,2720.335,Why did Judge Gee say that that case was binding as matter of state law?
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2720.335,2726.59,"Certainly, but any state law case could be superseded by a later opinion of this Court to the contrary."
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.59,2731.642,That wasn't a state... we can't supersede a decision on state law.
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2731.642,2732.392,Certainly.
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2746.783,2758.607,"Maybe Congress can make a state entertain a suit under a federal statute, but absent that can we order a state court to entertain a Jones Act claim?"
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2758.607,2773.033,"I think you can, Justice White, because the only reason that the state court... the only reason the state court refused to entertain the Jones Act claim was because it believed that there wasn't a Jones Act claim."
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2773.033,2785.241,"You think any time there is a... any time unless Congress makes federal court jurisdiction exclusive, any time there is a cause of action under a federal statute a state court has to entertain it?"
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2785.241,2788.027,I don't know the answer to that question.
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2789.645,2793.531,Why must a state court entertain a Jones Act case then?
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2793.531,2802.369,"Well, this Court has held that a state court can, that venue in a state court was proper in the Panama case."
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2817.045,2819.831,What was the ground for that intermediate appellate court decision in Texas?
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2828.687,2833.054,It was that the Jones Act doesn't cover it because of the state's sovereign immunity.
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2833.054,2836.606,It was purporting to decide a question of federal law.
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2836.606,2840.994,"Yes, sir, a question of federal constitutional law."
1986.85-1716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2871.696,2875.881,"Yes, but if we adopted that reasoning we would be finding there is no Eleventh Amendment bar, either."
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2885.939,2889.474,"That would be my position, but it doesn't have to follow."
1986.85-1716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2904.549,2904.984,Is seems to me there is a little tension there.
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2904.984,2906.417,I think that is right.
1986.85-1716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2942.84,2950.41,"Is it not true that it those... and your argument is very persuasive, but if your argument is correct really Petty should have been decided the other way."
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2950.41,2951.576,No.
1986.85-1716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2951.576,2952.11,Wouldn't it?
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2952.11,2952.91,Well--
1986.85-1716,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.91,2957.278,"Most of your argument seems to me about employed by, I forget... a citizen of the United States."
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2960.914,2963.599,--I think that that that rationale would save Petty.
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2963.599,2968.503,Certainly Petty purported to construe the Jones Act.
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2968.503,2970.788,"Yes, it did."
1986.85-1716,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2971.888,2973.573,You say that construction was wrong.
1986.85-1716,1,24319,f_scott_mccown,,2973.573,2975.506,--I think it is wrong.
1986.85-1716,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3005.442,3006.96,"Thank you, Mr. McCown."
1986.85-1716,2,35592,michael_d_cucullu,,3010.679,3021.868,"May it please the Court, just a few comments in response to respondent's arguments in connection with several of the issues raised in this case."
1986.85-1716,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3194.964,3196.964,"Thank you, Mr. Cucullu."
