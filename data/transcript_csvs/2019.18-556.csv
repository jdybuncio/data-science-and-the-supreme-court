2019.18-556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.365,6.325,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-556, Kansas versus Glover. General Crouse."
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,6.325,11.645,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Reasonable suspicion is a minimal standard."
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,117.385,134.62,"Mr. Crouse, many of those cases that you referenced involved at least an officer who testified, speaking about, in his experience, drivers tend to be owners. We don't have anything like that here. We have --"
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,134.62,134.91,We don't.
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,134.91,137.54,-- we have an officer who said he assumed that.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,145.685,146.13,Well --
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,146.13,147.285,What do we do about that?
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,147.285,150.63,"So, to the contrary, we believe that the stipulations are the facts."
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,150.63,154.71,"Well, the stipulation, as I understand it, though, is the officer said he assumed."
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,154.71,155.26,Yeah.
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,155.46,155.775,Yeah.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,160.975,162.03,So -- so there are two aspects to that.
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,162.03,162.86,-- other than an assumption.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,162.86,178.51,"The first of them is with regard to the stipulations, and the parties have stipulated as to what the relevant facts were. If they believed there was information absent from those facts, they -- they could have and would have done that. I think this Court's cases have recognized -- I believe it was the Christian Legal Society's motion --"
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,178.51,180.765,Maybe I'm not being clear what I'm -- what I'm getting at.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,194.125,194.56,Yeah.
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,194.87,199.655,"Here, we don't have any facts from the government, from the officer --"
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,199.655,200.16,So --
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,200.16,203.68,-- about experience or realities on the ground.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,214.765,215.62,"Well, so --"
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,215.62,216.65,Is that a thing?
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,216.65,223.61,-- so what I -- what I would agree with is that there is no evidence or testimony as to the history and experience of this officer.
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,241.44,241.92,But don't -- but --
2019.18-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,241.92,242.48,I -- I admit --
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,242.48,242.79,I -- I'm sorry.
2019.18-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,242.79,243.21,I'm sorry.
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,243.21,243.54,Please.
2019.18-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,243.54,247.46,"I admit there's three cases that hold that, but not 11."
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,298.25,298.7,So --
2019.18-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,298.7,303.845,Or with the lack of anybody with experience in the field.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,319.475,319.92,Yes.
2019.18-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,375.14,381.52,But I think Navarette had to do with the -- with the reliability of the tips -- the tip --
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,381.52,382.055,So --
2019.18-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,382.055,390.47,-- and not with questions -- I know that the majority and the dissent in Navarette argued about what the presumption should be.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,392.4,392.95,So --
2019.18-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,392.95,396.2,-- for us to make our own presumptions and not let the fact finder.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,396.2,397.83,"Well, but -- so a couple of things."
2019.18-556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,412.32,421.76,But the -- but the cause for the suspension can be a number of things that have nothing to do with safety on the roads.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,434.13,435.775,"That's -- that's right, Justice --"
2019.18-556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,435.775,441.3,And was there a way of finding out why the license was suspended?
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,441.3,442.34,So two things.
2019.18-556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,460.73,462.685,But I'm asking about the technology of it.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,474.08,478.34,"So it's not in the record, but my understanding is the answer is no."
2019.18-556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,511.825,514.085,Do I -- let me make sure I understand.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,535.62,536.33,"Yeah, I --"
2019.18-556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,536.33,548.875,"If, for example, it's -- it's, you know, Mr. So-and-So who's the registered owner and the woman -- it's a woman in -- driving the car, he would -- that would be the end of the matter, right? He would not be able to pursue the stop further?"
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,548.875,554.18,He would not be able to initiate the stop if information to the contrary had been present to him.
2019.18-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,562.45,566.19,We have dealt with that question on probable cause.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,582.985,586.15,So I'm not sure I'm understanding you correctly.
2019.18-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,586.49,603.39,"Under probable cause, if a defendant comes and gives you what seems to be a very reasonable explanation for why he did not commit this crime, we don't obligate police officers to investigate that reasonable explanation."
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,613.01,614.58,I -- I don't --
2019.18-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,614.58,621.09,"Under reasonable cause, you're prepared to say the rule is different."
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,626.245,627.805,I don't -- I don't believe so.
2019.18-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,631.91,633.47,But there's only one totality.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,633.47,649.865,"Well, so, in his hypothetical, the situation was, if the officer finds -- believes that they're searching for a 60-year-old man and is able to identify that the driver is a 20-year-old female, then the suspicion that initially attracted the officer to that vehicle would be dispelled."
2019.18-556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,651.51,651.81,But -- but you --
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,651.81,652.59,-- of the circumstances.
2019.18-556,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,652.59,652.68,But --
2019.18-556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,652.68,657.865,-- but you say there is no necessity for the officer to make that check.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,657.865,658.43,Right.
2019.18-556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,667.325,680.12,"And the only basis for the reasonable suspicion is not a totality of the circumstance, it's one circumstance, the registered owner's driver's license has been suspended, period."
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,687.395,691.58,So the totality depends on the particular crime that the officer is investigating.
2019.18-556,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,718.91,739.38,"But you say -- you say it's -- it would be happenstance that the officer was able to do this because the officer doesn't have to make any effort at all. Once he has -- once he knows that the registered owner's driver's license has been suspended, he doesn't have to do one more thing. He can -- he can do a Terry stop."
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,739.38,743.48,So he can initiate the Terry stop to ask additional questions.
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,773.78,774.77,"Mr. Crouse, it seems to me --"
2019.18-556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,774.77,775.175,"General, are you --"
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,775.175,775.46,I'm sorry.
2019.18-556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,775.46,776.38,Please.
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,776.38,787.58,It seems to me that a lot hinges on -- in your case on common sense assumption that the drivers of vehicles typically are the owners of the vehicle. Would you agree with that?
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,787.58,789.965,I think that's -- yes.
2019.18-556,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,789.965,800.72,"And -- and that might be true in our contemporary contingent historical reality, but the next generation, for example, often rents cars."
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,812.345,817.29,So I don't think it is. I think it -- it would be part of the totality that could potentially come up.
2019.18-556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,848.67,864.68,"General, do you -- do you -- do you know the Florida v. Harris dog search case? You're familiar with that? What struck me in reading this case is that you're asking for a very different approach than we unanimously decided was proper in that case. So it's a probable cause case, but I don't think that much -- makes all that much difference."
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,909.075,909.63,Yeah.
2019.18-556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,910.65,910.92,Right.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,911.49,911.995,"Yeah, yeah."
2019.18-556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,951.7,955.61,Does it make a difference -- Justice Kagan pointed out that case was probable cause.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,965.52,973.06,"Obviously, both Fourth Amendment, but the inquiry is much lower or the burden is much lower for an officer to justify a brief investigative decision --"
2019.18-556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,973.06,973.41,The threshold is --
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,973.41,974.17,-- to confirm or dispel.
2019.18-556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,974.17,975.83,-- the threshold is certainly lower.
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,975.83,976.09,Yeah.
2019.18-556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,976.09,987.12,"But why would it be that we would, just because the threshold is lower, essentially throw out the totality of the circumstances analysis and simply say this one fact is enough?"
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,987.12,1017.66,"So we are not asking you to throw out the totality of the circumstance. You have to look at the particular crime that's -- that is implicated, whether it's in Florida versus Harris or -- or Nellis versus, I think, United States, those are relatively complicated crimes. I look at the Cortez case in which the number of inferences and deductions in order to identify Chevron as he -- he was scurrying people across the border, those are some significant inferences that depend upon an educated understanding of the law enforcement officer."
2019.18-556,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1017.66,1019.04,I guess I'm just not seeing that.
2019.18-556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1035.625,1037.46,"Yes, briefly."
2019.18-556,0,63167,toby_crouse,,1037.46,1055.425,"Thank you, Your Honor. So I would say that the -- in this situation, the database alerted that Mr. Glover had a license that had been suspended and he couldn't operate the vehicle. We don't know why the dog alerted and we had to have information as to the officer's training and experience to answer that question."
2019.18-556,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1055.425,1069.365,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Huston."
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1069.365,1074.425,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fourth Amendment asks police officers to be reasonable."
2019.18-556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1095.32,1097.585,But let's -- let's -- I'm sorry.
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1099.48,1110.95,"That's an inference that we commonly rely on in a range of law enforcement situations and the prevalence of the inference supports its reliability. Moreover, this Court has repeatedly explained that reasonable suspicion is a minimal standard."
2019.18-556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1132.59,1150.74,"The -- you say it's reasonable to infer that the owner is the driver, but it's a little less reasonable, is it not, when the owner's license has been suspended?"
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1150.74,1155.43,"I -- I think, Your Honor, it is maybe marginally less probable."
2019.18-556,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1156.455,1164.14499995,Because you're -- you're -- you're positing that most people who have had their license suspended will break the law?
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1164.14499995,1168.7,"I -- I don't think we're positing that people will necessarily break the law, Your Honor."
2019.18-556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1179.075,1182.255,"But you just said, Mr. -- Mr. Huston, marginally less."
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1188.15,1196.48,"Your Honor, there -- we know that there are hundreds of thousands of citations in this country every year for driving on a suspended license."
2019.18-556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1221.07,1237.21,"I guess what I'm trying to say is, what is that common-sense judgment based on? I mean, I understand that if -- this goes back to Justice Gorsuch's question -- if it were based on a particular officer's training and experience and judgment. But, here, we can't say that it's based on any of those things."
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1238.95,1245.27,"Your Honor, I think we can -- I would respectfully dispute the idea that we can say it wasn't based on the officer's training and experience."
2019.18-556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1299.445,1341.93,"You see, I thought it was the opposite, that we really do want particularistic inquiries here, whether the particularistic inquiry is related to the driver or the officer, that we want some way of saying there's reasonable suspicion in this case, not in -- I mean, for example, would you just say -- suppose we just had a statistic that said, you know, that -- you know, that 30 percent of drivers are likely to do this. Would you say that, you know, that alone is enough, if it's just statistical? I'm just trying to find out like, what's the basis? Is the basis purely statistical? Is it something about a particular driver's experience and training? What is the basis?"
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1341.93,1345.925,Your Honor is absolutely right that the suspicion has to be particular and objective.
2019.18-556,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1379.4,1379.84,Why not?
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1379.84,1380.18,-- a reasonable --
2019.18-556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1380.18,1400.78,"But getting to the particular person, doesn't that have to do with geography? Meaning I suspect there are some towns in the United States where people don't break the law no matter what, that it would be -- you know, if your license got suspended, the police officer knows that in this jurisdiction, that presumption is not a good one."
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1410.73,1411.68,Absolutely.
2019.18-556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1411.68,1418.47,So you really are asking us to have one presumption based on no evidence --
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1418.47,1419.01,I respectfully --
2019.18-556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1419.01,1429.725,-- other than a stipulation that says that the driver of that license -- of that vehicle or that vehicle belongs to someone whose license has been suspended.
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1429.725,1452.44,"Your Honor, we're asking the Court to hold that, as a general matter, as a matter of common sense and ordinary human experience, the owner of a driver is very often the vehicle -- the drive -- excuse me, the owner of the vehicle is very often the driver of that vehicle, in the absence of information to the contrary. So, in a circumstance in which, based on geography or other conditions of the area, there's a different standard and a reasonable officer would know --"
2019.18-556,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1452.44,1452.7,That is a --
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1452.7,1453.27,-- that --
2019.18-556,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1453.27,1453.87,Excuse me.
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1474.01,1480.38,My point to Justice Kagan was a generalized observation about how many people in the world commit a certain crime does not provide a basis for --
2019.18-556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1480.38,1482.885,"Well, let me give you a -- a hypothetical."
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1517.715,1518.98,"Generally not, Your Honor."
2019.18-556,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1525.38,1525.49,How --
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1525.49,1526.33,-- this needle out of a haystack.
2019.18-556,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1526.33,1535.07,"-- how is that different -- how is that different from this case? Or, you know, you pull over a teenage driver because you suspect they're texting and there's statistics on that."
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1535.07,1535.71,It's -- it's --
2019.18-556,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1535.71,1540.12,"So it's the same hypothetical as Justice Kagan's, but then distinguish that from this case."
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1540.12,1548.45,"The difference, Your Honor, is that you need a reason -- you need -- the officer needs something that identifies the particularized suspicion that this driver is committing a crime."
2019.18-556,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1548.45,1550.855,"There is the particularized suspicion: Look, she's a teenager."
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1550.855,1565.12,"I don't think -- unless that inference was so overwhelmingly reliable, it correlated so strongly, I guess at a certain point the inference becomes so overwhelming that there's a particular behavior that's so closely correlated with criminal activity that it would provide reasonable suspicion."
2019.18-556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1565.12,1598.015,"So why isn't the requirement, as the Kansas court suggested, that you have to corroborate -- and I take that word very generally -- that you've just got to -- if you can safely, because no one's asking police officers to do things unsafely, okay -- but at least drive by and see if it's an older person, make sure it's not a woman, do something besides permitting one fact to drive a conclusion that's no different than a generalized statistic?"
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1598.015,1599.32,Two responses to Your Honor.
2019.18-556,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1618.28,1619.635,"Well, if you drive by."
2019.18-556,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1630.72,1655.535,"And if the officer does that, Your Honor, if the -- if the officer gains that type of information, that absolutely would be part of the totality of the circumstances, but I think this Court has explained, in Sokolow, that where an officer develops reasonable suspicion, a traffic stop is authorized and the permissibility of the stop does not depend on other less intrusive investigatory techniques that the officer might have pursued. You could make the same argument in any reasonable suspicion case."
2019.18-556,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1672.6,1677.035,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1677.035,1699.49,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Kansas and the United States ask this Court to adopt a bright-line nationwide rule that it is always reasonable to assume that a car is being driven by its unlicensed owner. But, in three briefs and now 27 minutes of oral argument, they have offered literally no way for this Court to assess whether that is, in fact, a reasonable assumption, whether it is, in fact, based on common sense."
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1786.41,1787.285,Ms. Harrington --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1787.285,1787.895,Yes.
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1787.895,1794.775,"-- that last bit is what interests me, that it's a minimal burden that you would impose on the state."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1834.615,1836.13,So thank you for that question.
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1844.16,1844.54,Fine.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1847.07,1847.16,Okay.
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1848.71,1853.69,"The officer will now come in and say -- and recite -- I mean, we're just asking for a magic incantation of words."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1853.69,1854.14,But -- but --
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1854.14,1856.46,"Instead of the one I proposed, it's the one you proposed."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1856.46,1860.185,"So maybe he will; maybe he won't, right? We don't know what the officer's experience is."
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1861.94,1862.25,Really?
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1862.25,1875.05,"What if the officer -- if the officer in this case had said, I was trained that the -- that the driver of a car is usually the owner, even when the driver has a suspended license?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1875.05,1875.89,So then there --
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1875.89,1876.69,Would that be enough?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1876.69,1879.13,"It might be, but there would be opportunity for cross-examination about what the training is."
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1879.13,1888.5,"Well, there was an opportunity here for -- for your client to put in any evidence that he wanted and to subpoena any witnesses he wanted."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1889.35,1893.29,"Certainly, Justice Alito, but it was Kansas's burden to make the evidentiary showing."
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1897.045,1898.955,"Yeah, but that's not responsive to my question."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1906.535,1906.86,No.
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1910.28,1913.28,And was there an opportunity for cross-examination here?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1913.28,1921.25,"There -- but there wasn't that -- if the officer had made that showing, had made that -- that factual assertion, then my client probably would have wanted to cross-examine."
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1925.09,1925.6,But if you could return --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1925.6,1926.38,It's not the defendant's job to --
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1926.38,1926.71,Do you think --
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1926.71,1928.08,-- to my question very briefly.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1928.08,1928.205,Yes.
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1928.205,1931.34,Because I think it's antecedent to Justice Alito's.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1946.815,1948.87,"So it might be, but let me -- let me make just two points."
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1948.87,1948.975,Okay.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1949.42,1961.185,"That could -- that could be said in every single reasonable suspicion -- reasonable suspicion case, right? There's always something the officer can come in and say. But what -- the point of the suppression hearing is that you want to hear what the actual -- what the officer actually is going to say."
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1968.21,1969.19,"Well, let me try this again."
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1969.19,1971.51,And could you have asked the officer in this case just to finish your --
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1971.51,1971.87,Sure.
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1971.87,1973.775,"-- your line of questioning, it's mine too."
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1973.775,1974.1,Yeah.
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1974.16,1979.525,Could -- could the defendant in this case -- did he have the opportunity to ask those questions of the officer?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1979.525,1980.05,Yes.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2011.73,2012.33,No.
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2012.33,2012.86,Okay.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2030.41,2033.84,Are you asking if I think that's enough for reasonable suspicion?
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2033.84,2042.4,"No, I'm asking you if you think that, whether it's reasonable suspicion or not, do you think it is at least a 5 percent chance that it's Fred Jones?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2042.4,2043.06,That the owner is driving?
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2043.06,2045.435,That the owner of the car is driving the car.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2045.435,2047.39,On a suspended license or just in general?
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2047.39,2048.485,Just in general.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2048.485,2049.645,"So, yes, in general."
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2049.645,2050.13,Okay.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2067.55,2068.82,"I don't -- I mean, I don't know what it is."
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2069.2,2071.495,You really don't know? You don't think it's one out of ten?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2071.495,2075.775,I think it is probably one out of ten that an owner with a valid license is driving his car.
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2075.775,2076.15,Okay.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2078.985,2079.37,Right.
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2079.37,2080.975,It's somewhat less than 50 percent.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2080.975,2081.18,Yes.
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2081.18,2084.0,And even you are willing to agree that it's at least 10 percent.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2084.0,2084.475,Yes.
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2084.475,2089.22,"Well, what -- what reasonable suspicion cutoff do you think? Do you think it's one out of five?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2089.22,2091.13,I can't say because this Court has said repeatedly that --
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2091.13,2091.39,"No, but you --"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2091.39,2092.305,"-- none of us can say, right?"
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2092.305,2095.3,"No, the point is most of us can say."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2126.88,2130.74,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not saying that the state has to put in any particular type of evidence."
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2136.47,2142.57,"They don't -- I was just going to say if they're relying on common sense, they don't have to give you anything more than common sense."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2142.57,2144.57,"But how do we know if it is common sense? I mean, I think your --"
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2144.57,2144.82,All we're saying --
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2144.82,2146.35,I already got you to 10 percent.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2146.35,2151.47,But that's in people -- that's about owners who have valid licenses. I think it's -- I think it is not at all common sense.
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2157.13,2159.41,I think the -- the inference cuts the other way.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2163.15,2163.3,"Well, we --"
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2163.3,2168.19,I think it's probably more likely than not that he would break the law saying you can't drive with a suspended license.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2168.19,2182.51,"So, first, you know, the facts on the ground suggest that we don't know that, because, in many states, it's -- it's the inability to pay fines that results in a suspended license, not criminal activities. But, second, this Court has never ever held or come close to holding that evidence that you committed X crime is enough for us --"
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2182.51,2199.73,But this isn't -- this is collateral to your basic proposition. Your basic proposition is that it doesn't rise to the level of reasonable suspicion to think that a car registered in Fred Jones' name is being driven by Fred Jones. That's different than the collateral point about whether he's more or less likely because the license is suspended.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2199.73,2229.04,"No, that's not true. Our -- our basic proposition is it's not a reasonable inference when Fred Jones does not have a valid license, right? And it's not reasonable to think that the -- that the statistics or the rate of driving on a suspended license are going to be the same in every community in the country. If someone lives in Manhattan or Chicago or downtown D.C. and has a suspended license, I think it's significantly less likely that they're going to drive on a suspended license because they have access to public transportation and Uber and all these things to get to the places they needed to go, compared to someone who lives in, say, rural North Dakota or some other place where there isn't public transportation."
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2229.04,2235.225,"In your -- in your opening, you said it would be relatively easy for the police to establish whether the driver is the owner."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2236.63,2237.78,"Well, to establish a reasonable suspicion."
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.605,2258.03,Can I go back for a second --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2258.03,2258.37,And there's others.
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.37,2259.59,-- to the Chief Justice's question --
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2259.59,2259.75,Finish.
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2259.75,2268.82,"-- because I had exactly the same reaction, and I'd like to finish with that or just a step further. Look, I go outside."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2294.18,2295.8,"No, unless you have some reason --"
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.8,2296.23,The answer is no.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2296.23,2296.67,Unless it's legal.
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.67,2298.255,Now we add another fact.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2323.66,2323.96,"Well, but --"
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2323.96,2325.47,But you're asking me to say --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2325.47,2326.83,-- I would have questions for that person.
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2326.83,2340.325,"-- that that person is -- a question, but the question you're asking me to say that that person who still suspects that Charles is driving is unreasonable."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2367.945,2373.78,"Well, I'll point to basically all of this Court's Fourth Amendment cases, which say you have to look at the totality of circumstances."
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2373.78,2374.42,We just did.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2374.42,2378.32,"And you can't just -- no, you can't just assume illegal activity based on one --"
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2378.32,2378.8,I'm not assuming --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2378.8,2379.38,-- isolated fact.
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2379.38,2380.7,-- illegal activity.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2380.7,2381.16,You are if you --
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2381.16,2381.65,It happens to be --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2381.65,2382.91,-- think that he has a suspended license --
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2382.91,2383.9,"Oh, yeah, it happens to be."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2391.535,2392.05,Right.
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2392.37,2393.39,It's different from the teenage case.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2393.39,2398.165,"Justice Breyer, I would point you to the Brignoni-Ponce and Brown versus Texas as two good examples."
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2398.165,2399.51,What -- say it again.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2399.51,2400.36,United States versus Brignoni-Ponce.
2019.18-556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2432.62,2433.26,So what is the --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2433.26,2434.18,-- the presence there --
2019.18-556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2434.18,2442.72999995,-- something else? You're referring to experience and you're making a distinction between the rookie cop and the one who's on the beat for a long time.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2443.89,2444.21,Right.
2019.18-556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2454.98,2455.25,I -- but --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2455.25,2456.15,If that's something the officer knew --
2019.18-556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2456.15,2466.415,"I -- I asked -- I think I asked the question whether there's an easy way to find out what was the reason for the suspension, and the -- the answer to that question was no."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2466.415,2467.29,For Kansas.
2019.18-556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2471.7,2486.02,"Well, tell me how you think the police can safely verify that the -- their suspicion that the owner is the driver is accurate?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2486.02,2490.47,"So, as I said, you can do things short of verifying it, right? You can rely on your experience."
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2511.45,2511.81,Do you have --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2511.81,2512.18,-- African-American man.
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2512.18,2514.565,-- statistics to support that proposition?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2514.565,2515.25,I don't.
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2515.25,2518.965,That it wouldn't have been hard for the officer to pull up next to the car and look over?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2518.965,2521.665,"I do not, no, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2539.915,2540.47,Let's say then --
2019.18-556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2540.47,2560.35,"But if he peers into the window and his glass is -- is tinted and he can't see, so you -- you're saying if -- if he -- he has to -- in that case, he can't make the stop; he lets -- he has to let the -- the driver go on?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2560.35,2564.42,"Unless he can rely on one of the other several things I've mentioned, like his experience with these types of --"
2019.18-556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2564.42,2573.15,"I -- I mentioned one of the problems with experience, that you're making a distinction between the rookie cop who doesn't have any experience and the veteran."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2573.15,2577.32,"But that's going to be true in every Fourth Amendment context, right, where -- where you're relying on officers' experience."
2019.18-556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2581.67,2589.69,What about the manual that says stay behind the car that you suspect?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2589.69,2597.0,"So, if such a manual exists -- and it's not in the record -- you know, then -- then you would need to rely on one of the other methods of establishing reasonable suspicion."
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2611.355,2628.62,"You -- you want the officer, therefore, to follow the driver, and your brief suggests this, until they make a lane change or until they go too quickly on the right turn on red or don't come to a full stop. What sense does that rule make?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2628.62,2630.16,So I think that's -- that's one option.
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2631.26,2633.06,"That's an option you articulate in the brief, and --"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2633.06,2633.12,Yeah.
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2633.12,2637.335,-- I'm trying to figure out what -- what purpose that would serve.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2646.63,2649.46,"Well, you would follow him until you had probable cause of some traffic violation."
2019.18-556,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2655.63,2656.02,But if I --
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2656.02,2656.5,Let's say an officer --
2019.18-556,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2656.5,2671.9,"-- understand you correctly, Ms. Harrington, you don't really require that anybody be followed until they do something wrong, and you don't really require that a police officer goes and checks out who's sitting in the front seat. A police officer could do neither of those things."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2671.9,2672.0,Right.
2019.18-556,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2672.0,2683.645,"As long as the police officer shows up to the suppression hearing and says ""I based this on my training and my experience"" and subjects himself to some form of cross-examination."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2683.645,2684.92,"Just like the usual way, right."
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2684.92,2685.26,How -- how much --
2019.18-556,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2685.26,2685.62,That would be enough --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2685.62,2686.15,We talked about before --
2019.18-556,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2686.15,2686.48,-- wouldn't it?
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2686.48,2697.695,"-- experience -- how much experience does he have to have? How many times does he have to stop a car because he thinks -- well, I guess he can do it -- how does he get experience if he can't do it the first time?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2697.695,2701.55,"Well, he -- I mean, if he has some other basis to do it or, you know, he's -- he's driving with someone."
2019.18-556,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2702.19,2703.97,"I mean, it's just like the dog, right?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2703.97,2704.06,Right.
2019.18-556,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2704.06,2718.4,"It's like, you know, somebody certifies me, somebody trains me, I've seen this done by my partner, I've heard about it being done by other people in my department. It's just you subject yourself to something, which is the point of suppression hearings, isn't it?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2718.4,2718.57,Right.
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2727.19,2731.985,"That was a probable cause case, right? Probable cause, although still less than 50 percent --"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2731.985,2732.19,Yes.
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2732.19,2734.88,-- is significantly more than reasonable suspicion.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2734.88,2735.5,That's absolutely --
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2735.5,2735.65,So it --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2735.65,2735.75,-- true.
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2735.75,2745.2,-- may be the case that you don't need a -- the same level of training and experience and background to make the -- make the assumption that you've already said is at least 10 percent.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2745.2,2752.65,"You may need less, but you -- but the type of analysis you would go through to determine if there is reasonable suspicion, there's no reason that it would be different than in a probable cause case."
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2752.65,2752.86,Let's say --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2752.86,2753.23,But in --
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2753.23,2803.325,-- a police officer pulls up behind a car after having -- is behind the car after having obtained information that the registered owner of the car has a suspended license. What are all of the considerations that you think the officer has to take into account before initiating a stop? Checking -- trying to check with headquarters as to the basis for the license suspension? Whether it's an urban area or a rural area or someplace in between? Whether it's a highway or a city street? Whether it's raining? Whether it's dark? Maybe whether it's a law-abiding community where people who have suspended licenses never drive? He -- the officer has to take into account all of those factors before initiating a stop?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2803.325,2803.99,Not necessarily.
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2812.79,2837.025,"After having done that and when there is a motion to suppress, the -- the -- the judge has to take into account all of those factors? Well, it wasn't really a rural area or a city; it was sort -- sort of in between, and it was raining, but it wasn't raining hard? All those things would depend on an -- an -- an evaluation of all of those factors?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2837.025,2841.735,"Just like in any Fourth Amendment case, Justice Alito, that you have to look at the full factual context."
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2856.32,2864.7,"Is it -- is it your argument that reasonable suspicion can never be based on a single fact, on just one fact? There always has to be more than one fact?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2864.7,2865.47,Not necessarily.
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2874.49,2875.95,How about -- how about a swerving car?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2875.95,2878.36,"So a swerving car, it would depend on the -- on the situation."
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2880.46,2881.65,So sometimes yes?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2881.65,2882.595,Sometimes yes.
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2892.73,2903.89,"Then, on the question Justice Kagan followed up with you on, saying that you weren't really arguing that the officer had to do more to follow the driver, on page 35 and 36 of your brief, you specifically say that."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2903.89,2905.79,We say the officer can do that.
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2909.47,2909.72,You -- you --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2909.72,2910.54,-- in our direction here.
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2910.54,2923.44,"-- said there that it's relatively easy for an officer to do this by tracking the driver until the driver does some minor traffic violation, and then you can pull the -- the driver over."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2923.44,2928.5,"Which is what this Court has said in Delaware versus Prouse. That's the ordinary way of enforcing these types of laws, but I think --"
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2928.5,2932.795,"However, Delaware, that case did not involve someone with a suspended license."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2932.795,2935.64,They were looking for people who had -- who were unlicensed.
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2935.92,2941.95,"That's what they were looking for, but they didn't have information that the owner of the car in question had a suspended license."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2941.95,2942.56,"They didn't, no."
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2942.95,2943.66,That was the whole point.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2948.13,2949.37,"Yes, Justice Kavanaugh, that's absolutely true."
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2967.73,2970.15,I'm just trying to figure out why -- what sense that makes.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2987.54,2987.775,I think --
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2987.775,2990.06,-- it would have been fine because he --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2990.06,2991.07,Sorry.
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2991.07,2995.11,-- swerved or had just barely exceeded the speed limit?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2995.11,3005.44,"Well, I think that the officer has no other basis for having a reasonable suspicion, that the suspended owner is, in fact, driving, but they kind of have a hunch and they want to follow up on the hunch, then they can just follow the person until that --"
2019.18-556,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3005.44,3007.64,You're encouraging pretextual stops.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3007.64,3011.72,"No, it's not pretextual if they see something that raises probable cause for some other violation."
2019.18-556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3019.27,3025.855,"And you mentioned -- you mentioned peering into the window, that that's something that could be done."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3025.855,3042.42,"In some cases, yes. I mean, so our point is just there's a whole number of -- I hope I didn't interrupt you if you have more to your question. There's a whole number of things an officer can do to -- you know, to do more than just say I'm just assuming that the unlicensed owner is driving the car."
2019.18-556,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3042.42,3048.86,"But it does seem -- I think the word formal was used, after this case, suppose you're right."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3072.255,3073.4,That would probably be fine.
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3078.01,3078.5,"Well, if that's --"
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3078.5,3078.88,"Well, he doesn't --"
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3078.88,3080.33,"-- the case -- I'm sorry, Chief."
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3080.33,3091.13,"I'm just -- he doesn't have to say that in his experience the registered owner is the driver, right? He just has to hit one out of ten times, or two out of ten."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3091.13,3091.48,Maybe.
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3091.65,3095.56,"In my experience, you know, I've done ten of these and twice it was the driver."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3096.22,3097.69,That might be enough.
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3097.69,3100.39,-- that strikes me as the right number for reasonable suspicion.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3100.39,3102.44,It might be enough. This Court has never put a number on it.
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3108.13,3123.035,"Well, if -- if it is and if your answer to Justice Ginsburg is correct that all an officer has to say is, in my training or experience, one out of 10, one out of 20, it's -- it's been the driver who is the owner of an unregistered car --"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3123.035,3125.7,"Unlicensed owner of a registered car, yeah."
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3125.7,3126.69,"Unlicensed, yeah, right."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3140.02,3140.575,Right.
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3140.575,3142.44,"I assume this is the driver, okay?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3142.44,3143.37,"This is Kansas, not New York."
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3143.37,3148.84,"This is the owner, okay? (Laughter.)"
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3148.84,3178.845,"Touche. Why -- why isn't that a fair reading, though, of the declaration before us and then it becomes incumbent upon the defendant, if the defendant wishes to raise questions, just as a defendant might about the dog's training and sniffing abilities and record with different substances, to raise some questions about the officer's training and experience or locality, circumstances in Lawrence, which is a very law-abiding community."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3178.845,3179.55,I'm sure.
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3179.55,3181.6,Or whatever.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3188.07,3190.02,I think the simple answer is because it isn't.
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3192.52,3194.52,"I understand literally, counsel --"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3194.52,3194.97,-- the owner was the driver.
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3194.97,3203.46,"-- it says -- it's a different formulation of words, but why isn't it functionally? Why isn't it practically? Why isn't it really exactly what we're talking about?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3203.46,3206.38,Because it's -- it doesn't say I assume that an unlicensed owner is the driver.
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3208.07,3208.34,So it's all --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3208.34,3208.75,That's not --
2019.18-556,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3208.75,3209.1,-- magic words.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3209.1,3209.63,The relevant question.

2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3209.93,3214.62,"It's not magic words. You just have -- it's -- it's -- like I said, it's not going very hard in most cases, but the -- the state --"
2019.18-556,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3214.62,3215.3,Ms. Harrington --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3215.3,3216.06,-- has to do the work.
2019.18-556,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3216.06,3221.285,"-- I read the lower court, the supreme court, Kansas Supreme Court's words literally."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3231.835,3232.29,Right.
2019.18-556,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3232.29,3242.73,"And very carefully it says, here, the problem is not that the state necessarily needs significantly more evidence, it needs some more evidence."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3242.73,3243.0,Right.
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3299.485,3306.67,Do you think in Terry they needed statistics about the percentage of people who walked by a window three times who have some criminal intent?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3306.67,3307.36,No.
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3328.55,3332.89,"So what's -- you said something, it certainly caught my attention."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3341.035,3341.7,It --
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3341.7,3350.685,"End of the matter, until you point out, not them, you point out that here the driver had lost his license."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3364.395,3365.24,Because it --
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3365.24,3366.13,-- and ask him about them?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3366.13,3366.89,Because it's --
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3366.89,3381.67,"And if you want to say no, that's unreasonable given my fact, given my fact, you probably didn't say that because, actually, the statistics show 75 percent, you know, 60 percent, but not here, dah-dah-dah. Okay, we're into that."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3381.67,3381.91,So --
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3381.91,3388.635,But what is it -- what is it that you think is that extra thing in the facts here that should have been in?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3388.635,3391.47,"I mean, I've listed like ten things he could have done and he didn't do any of them, but --"
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3391.47,3392.605,I didn't say that.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3397.65,3397.97,Yeah.
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3397.97,3409.495,"I'm saying, what fact is there other than the two he pointed to and the one you added that you think was relevant?"
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3409.495,3413.42,So the -- the drive -- the behavior of the driver could have been relevant.
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3414.77,3416.435,"No, I'm not asking could have been."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3416.435,3418.23,"Well, I don't -- I don't know because they didn't come forward."
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3418.23,3418.54,"Oh, all right."
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3418.6,3419.33,It's the state's burden to --
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3419.33,3419.62,-- your point is --
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3419.62,3420.18,-- put forward the evidence.
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3420.18,3429.975,"-- you should decide all the facts, but I can't point you to a fact that wasn't -- that was relevant and wasn't decided."
2019.18-556,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3430.69,3430.96,"Well, how about --"
2019.18-556,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3430.96,3432.53,-- you say they shouldn't just do --
2019.18-556,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3432.53,3434.15,How about his experience and training?
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3434.15,3434.38,Yeah.
2019.18-556,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3461.66,3467.13,And what you are proposing is either a trivial decision or a revolutionary decision.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3487.64,3488.06,May I answer?
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3488.06,3488.53,Sure.
2019.18-556,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3488.53,3494.55,"Justice Alito, what we're asking for is that the ordinary Fourth Amendment contextual analysis be required in every case."
2019.18-556,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3501.36,3504.815,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, General Crouse."
2019.18-556,3,63167,toby_crouse,,3504.815,3520.885,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and I'd like to first start with regard to the officer's training and experience and the lack of testimony. The reason that isn't in this case is because Mr. Glover stipulated to the facts below and failed to raise any question as to the officer's training and experience until the red brief in this Court."
2019.18-556,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3522.67,3528.18,But wait a minute. Whose burden is it? Isn't it yours? You have to prove the facts.
2019.18-556,3,63167,toby_crouse,,3528.18,3530.07,We have proved the stipulated facts.
2019.18-556,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3530.07,3530.41,"Well, you proved --"
2019.18-556,3,63167,toby_crouse,,3530.41,3531.3,They didn't challenge those facts.
2019.18-556,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3531.3,3534.09,"-- that fact, but they don't have to if you don't prove enough."
2019.18-556,3,63167,toby_crouse,,3534.09,3534.89,So they didn't --
2019.18-556,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3534.89,3552.645,"They could -- they could -- you could come in and say he wore a red hat, that's why I stopped him, and they would come back and say, that's not enough to make out reasonable suspicion. So, if what they're saying is making an assumption without telling us what the basis of that assumption is, is not enough."
2019.18-556,3,63167,toby_crouse,,3552.645,3565.98,"So the point is they stipulated to the facts that were relevant to the determination, and the Kansas Supreme Court made a determination as to those facts. My point is that didn't arise until the red brief in this Court."
2019.18-556,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3607.11,3613.725,"May I go back to the stipulation? You said it's -- Kansas drew the stipulation, right?"
2019.18-556,3,63167,toby_crouse,,3613.725,3618.165,"The parties drew the stipulation, agreed to them, and presented them to the court."
2019.18-556,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3618.165,3620.39,So it was a joint stipulation?
2019.18-556,3,63167,toby_crouse,,3620.39,3646.11,"The parties stipulated, yes, Your Honor. The fourth point I would like to make is that the Fourth Amendment does not and should not apply differently based upon the age and experience of the officer or the time of day of the Fourth Amendment. The rule that Respondents propose would require the officers to let this vehicle go at night because it's impossible to identify. This Court's cases, except for, I believe, a no knock warrant, does not do that."
2019.18-556,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3661.805,3663.275,You can finish your thought.
2019.18-556,3,63167,toby_crouse,,3663.275,3663.705,Thank you.
2019.18-556,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3671.24,3672.155,"Thank you, counsel."
