2008.08-67,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.418,We will hear argument today in Yeager v. United States.
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,7.323,22.801,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a jury's acquittal resolves an issue in a defendant's favor, that determination is final and the government may not seek an inconsistent determination of that issue from a second jury."
2008.08-67,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,46.681,50.837,"Mr. Buffone, may I raise one preliminary issue?"
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,174.456,177.958,"I do not believe so, Your Honor, for two reasons."
2008.08-67,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,227.186,235.806,"No, I -- I agree that -- that did seem to be the point of the cross-examination, and in fact I guess you set it out in one of the briefs."
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,276.194,283.334,"Well, Your Honor, first there was more to the trial record than a snippet of cross-examination."
2008.08-67,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,292.595,295.079,That's the government's -- that's the government's argument.
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,328.907,344.603,"--Your Honor, first, the instructions permitted alternative ways to reach the first element of securities fraud, and one of the three alternatives was either misstatements or omissions."
2008.08-67,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,351.711,361.269,"I agree with that, but why couldn't they find that there was no securities fraud based on an omissions theory because there wasn't any duty on Mr. Yeager's part to disclose?"
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,361.269,384.666,"--Your Honor, the indictment was an integrated theory of fraud, that had charged that Mr. Yeager and others had planned to make misrepresentations and material omissions for one purpose, and that purpose was to enhance the price of Enron stock so that they could later engage in insider trading to sell that stock."
2008.08-67,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,405.673,407.158,But Ashe is quite a different case.
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,436.724,448.174,"--Justice Ginsburg, first, it is my belief that seriatim prosecutions raise no greater threat to the core values of double jeopardy than was raised here."
2008.08-67,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,460.247,464.539,You're not -- you're not contending that double jeopardy itself was at issue?
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,471.021,472.491,"--Yes, Your Honor, I'd like to--"
2008.08-67,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,472.491,478.333,That means it was necessarily -- the issue was necessarily decided?
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,478.333,479.534,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.08-67,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,533.433,537.996,So the hung counts are equivalent -- equivalent to an acquittal then?
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,537.996,541.868,"No, Your Honor, I think precisely the opposite."
2008.08-67,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.297,576.636,"But we said -- we said in Ashe, didn't we, that you should take into account all the circumstances in determining what was decided in the first acquittal, all the circumstances."
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,605.765,614.153,"Justice Scalia, first, we believe that the -- I believe that the Ashe test relates to the total circumstances on the record."
2008.08-67,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,641.64,651.545,"But in a sense that's Justice Scalia's point, that the jury has in effect told us nothing, and in effect that argument hurts your case in one sense."
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,653.9,665.209,"--Justice Kennedy, I agree that the hung counts are meaningless and that is my point, but I believe that it does further our analysis and the proper analysis that this Court should engage in."
2008.08-67,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,691.823,718.25,"It shows -- it shows that -- that the point on which they -- you assert they were unanimous and the point on which you say later prosecution should be disallowed was in fact a point on which the jury was confused, because they would have come out the other way if indeed they were unanimous on the counts that -- that acquitted."
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,721.17,723.701,"Your Honor, we simply don't know that."
2008.08-67,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,776.041,786.129,"The point is that they were deadlocked and would not have been deadlocked, assuming we don't inquire into -- into the issue that Justice Souter raised."
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,796.22,798.45,"--Your Honor, we know that they acquitted."
2008.08-67,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,847.074,865.629,"Counsel, if Powell extends to subsequent prosecutions -- I know you argue that it doesn't -- but if it does, isn't it unusual that the defendant is in better shape if a jury hangs on the non-acquitted count than if he is convicted on the nonacquitted count?"
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,865.629,870.345,"Well, Your Honor, that's a -- a two-edged sword, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,907.782,914.246,"It's an obvious question, I guess."
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,936.147,937.239,"I agree, Your Honor."
2008.08-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,938.303,938.662,Okay.
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,939.223,940.128,--there's no question.
2008.08-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,940.986,941.27,"--Yes, yes."
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,941.27,942.862,--and we are not going to try to determine what the--
2008.08-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,943.657,942.862,Okay.
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,954.073,958.23,"--Now, Your Honor, that would depend on what happened at the trial."
2008.08-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,958.23,959.727,All that happened was that they hung.
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,959.727,962.57,"Well, if they hung, Your Honor, yes, it would be permitted."
2008.08-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,962.57,962.945,Yes.
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,991.949,994.261,"Your Honor, it would depend."
2008.08-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,994.261,996.886,All that happened is they are retrying it just as they did in case 2.
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,1002.427,1006.896,"Your Honor, the presence of count 1 in your hypothetical is not dispositive."
2008.08-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1008.46,1013.081,I -- I'm going too fast because you didn't take the cases in.
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,1043.536,1044.881,"--Yes, sir."
2008.08-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1044.881,1058.922,"So, now, when we have case 3, which is the same as case 1 except that, instead of convicting him, they had a hung jury, why can't you retry him, just as you could in case 2?"
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,1058.922,1062.701,"Because a hung jury resolves nothing, Your Honor."
2008.08-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1063.2,1073.214,"Oh, everybody agrees it resolves nothing, and that's why you could retry him in -- that's why you could retry him in case 2, because it resolves nothing."
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,1105.26,1106.122,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-67,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1106.122,1115.899,"--That's the logical point I thought the other side was making, and maybe they're not because it seems to be striking you as surprising or maybe I'm not making it in a clear way."
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,1118.148,1132.534,"Your Honor, I believe the -- the clear answer is that for collateral estoppel to attach, there must be a necessary determination of a factual issue, and the necessary determination of that factual issue can occur in your count 1 through an acquittal or a conviction."
2008.08-67,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1140.968,1146.556,"Mr. Buffone, you're -- you're going through a logical analysis."
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,1222.835,1239.47,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe that that is a clear choice, and the rationale for the clarity of that choice is that acquittals have long been recognized as being important for finality purposes for double jeopardy law."
2008.08-67,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1240.328,1248.81,"Look, I know that, and -- and by the same token, hung juries have long been recognized as raising no bar to a further trial."
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,1264.288,1265.414,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-67,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1291.993,1292.512,We have got both.
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,1292.512,1293.167,"All right, so what--"
2008.08-67,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1293.167,1303.521,"What -- what is it -- and I would almost suggest that it has to be something outside the lines of authority, because the issue here is which line of authority are you going to pick?"
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,1312.454,1336.303,"--Your Honor, I think we should go -- the Court should go to the history of its double jeopardy jurisprudence, and that makes clear that the core concepts underlying the Double Jeopardy Clause are, first, finality of jury verdicts, and, second, to avoid all of the constitutional perils of successive trials, because successive trials--"
2008.08-67,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1336.303,1338.537,Can I ask you this about the finality of jury verdicts?
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,1346.863,1357.563,"--Your Honor, I do not believe that -- I am not aware of a constitutional underpinning for that, but certainly the practices in the courts are to permit partial verdicts."
2008.08-67,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1357.563,1358.453,In every State?
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,1358.453,1359.939,I do not know the answer to that question.
2008.08-67,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1359.939,1377.506,"Well, if the Constitution doesn't require that, then why does the Constitution, in your view, require that issue preclusion occur when the jury acquits on certain counts but hangs on other counts?"
2008.08-67,0,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,1401.121,1423.392,"Your Honor, I don't believe that it would be a different result because I think in -- in most jurisdictions, as I understand it, the reaction to that kind of a split verdict would be to try to get the jury to reach a full and final verdict, to give some form of an Allen charge to encourage additional deliberations, to seek unanimity in the jury's verdict."
2008.08-67,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1477.448,1478.571,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1482.742,1497.455,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Two separate lines of double jeopardy analysis lead to the conclusion that the government can retry hung counts that occur in a verdict simultaneously with acquittals."
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1536.485,1540.233,You -- you are asking us for a pretty dramatic extension of Powell.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1543.014,1544.262,No.
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1554.213,1562.648,"Well, that's because in the same proceeding you have two different jury verdicts, one going the other way and one -- obviously, one way and one the other way."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1584.153,1593.149,"--Well, I don't think that it undermines that determination, Mr. Chief Justice, because the acquittals will stand as acquittals, and they will bar re-prosecution on that offense."
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1617.982,1618.546,"Well, why not?"
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1620.356,1624.841,"--No, it's not in the sense, I think, Justice Stevens that the Court used that in Ashe."
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1624.841,1627.543,It is in the sense of an indictment that took place after the other acquittal.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1627.543,1631.555,"Well, that indictment simply embodies non-jeopardy-barred counts that were in the--"
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.555,1653.015,"Isn't there a difference in the fact that in the first case where there's -- where there was a conflicting simultaneous verdict, one can explain the acquittal on grounds of leniency or compromise or something like that, that says that, therefore, we will give effect to the -- the conviction when they're simultaneous because of the reasons why there may be irrationality in the conflict."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1659.589,1669.619,"--Well, no, I think that there is, Justice Stevens, if on the theory that the Petitioner propounds the verdict on the acquittals is inconsistent with the mistrial."
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.396,1682.659,But if they had time.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1687.845,1692.719,"Well, I -- Petitioner's theory would be identical if there were one insider trading count."
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1704.121,1713.195,"When you have a case in which there is no conflict between a guilty and an innocent verdict, there isn't -- there is no reason to doubt the integrity of the acquittal."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1713.195,1719.849,--We're not questioning the integrity of the acquittal as far as it has direct double jeopardy application.
2008.08-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1723.253,1724.127,And why not?
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1772.359,1781.168,"The reason, Justice Breyer, is that the hung counts do not constitute a resolution in favor of the defendant."
2008.08-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1781.168,1781.979,"Of course, they don't."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1795.491,1811.732,"But there's a reason for that, Justice Breyer, that is grounded in double jeopardy policies, and I think it goes to the question that Justice Souter asked as well: Why the Court should prefer the double jeopardy doctrine that allows the government to retry the hung counts when they are all brought together in the same proceeding?"
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1867.819,1872.724,But the reason for that is there are doubts about the integrity of the acquittal.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1875.833,1878.099,"--But, Justice Stevens, that is identical to this case."
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1879.908,1886.467,"--No, here you have sequential prosecutions, and there's no reason to question the integrity of the acquittal in this case."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1886.467,1887.22,No.
2008.08-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1898.524,1901.163,I didn't think it had anything to do with integrity of anything.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1920.673,1921.624,Correct.
2008.08-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1921.624,1922.186,Okay.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1931.622,1934.527,"There are two reasons for that, Justice Breyer."
2008.08-67,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1954.189,1979.867,"But isn't -- isn't the real problem that -- that you raised by your answer the following problem: That in this age in which there are, as Justice Breyer's hypo suggests, lots of overlapping criminal statutes -- you can indict not only for drugs but for telephones, and I don't know what other overlapping crimes there -- there may be."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2060.443,2066.487,"My response to that, Justice Souter, is that double jeopardy has always consisted of a balance of values."
2008.08-67,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2088.637,2096.634,But does the -- does the government ask for something more than one fair chance when it comes in with 117 counts?
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2111.222,2113.562,"Well, let me -- let me give two answers to that, Justice Souter."
2008.08-67,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2120.188,2120.578,"Oh, that's right."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2123.031,2123.389,--it would be the same.
2008.08-67,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2153.126,2158.672,"Why not, when considering what the government did on its second chance?"
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2180.396,2198.934,"I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg, because all of the insider trading counts turn on the same fact: Did Petitioner have inside information -- did he know that the Enron broadband system that he was integrally involved in, was the strategic manager in charge of, wasn't working?"
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2239.715,2246.415,"Well, the -- the point about the big extension, you were rather coy in your brief about what you think about Ashe v. Swenson."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2248.603,2276.558,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that the Court needs to revisit Ashe v. Swenson in order to resolve this case, but I think it's fair to say that Ashe v. Swenson is a doctrine that transposed certain civil policies that are -- are expressed through the doctrine of issue preclusion into the double jeopardy context in a way that was not supported by the history of the Fifth Amendment and is not supported by the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, which requires the same events."
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2276.558,2279.604,"Well, you're not going to talk about -- you're not going to talk about the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, are you?"
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2279.604,2280.852,"Well, I--"
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2280.852,2283.538,"If we rely on that the case is pretty easy, isn't it?"
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2283.538,2293.19,"--I think that it is because it says that the same offense is what you're protected against for double jeopardy, and the offenses in this case are distinct under Blockburger."
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2294.345,2296.782,The person was in jeopardy on the hung offense as well.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2296.782,2305.419,"--Well, this Court has made clear that the jeopardy continues until the government has the opportunity to obtain a verdict."
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2309.996,2313.635,"Under this Court's decisions, but not under the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2313.635,2317.085,"--I think it then becomes a question of what is the meaning of ""jeopardy""."
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2349.151,2353.963,But the key to your argument is the government is entitled to one full and fair opportunity to try its case.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2357.118,2359.883,"Well, I think that this Court's decisions since--"
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2359.883,2365.974,"If there were no separate counts, that would have been -- that would have been a fair -- that would be the end of the matter."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2365.974,2377.455,"--Since 1824, this Court has defined the government's full and fair opportunity to include the right to retry if the jury hangs, and here what the defendant--"
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.455,2384.184,But it has -- but it has the right to retry in the same position as it would have been if it had not brought the first proceeding.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2388.996,2391.839,"--No, I don't -- I don't agree that it's in the same position--"
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.839,2392.244,Why not?
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2392.244,2393.789,--as if it had not bought it.
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2393.789,2394.475,Oh.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2394.475,2399.038,It's -- it -- in this case what the government did was to bring all of its cases together.
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2417.108,2420.683,"That's because we have the Dunn doctrine, which itself is questionable."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2433.899,2435.725,--I'm not relying on Dunn in this hypothetical.
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2484.972,2493.765,--But the whole -- whole doctrine of inconsistent verdicts depends on the assumption that what appears to be an irrational inconsistency may have another explanation.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2493.765,2496.858,"Yes, such as lenity for the defendant."
2008.08-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2511.491,2516.881,"Start the other side, which I think Justice Stevens was suggesting."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2548.681,2549.897,Not under--
2008.08-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2549.897,2550.724,"No, not even a close."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2613.921,2616.561,"--Well, the government should not be worse off."
2008.08-67,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2616.561,2617.138,"No, no -- better."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2617.762,2628.991,"I think that the reason is that when, Justice Breyer, you said that double jeopardy is not involved in the cases involving the government's ability to retry on a hung count, that's not accurate."
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2640.644,2649.453,"I think that's right, and your argument depends upon that interest balancing against the interest in giving effect to the acquittal verdict."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2685.438,2697.604,"Well, I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, because I think you still have to focus on the intrinsic character of the doctrine of issue preclusion, which does depend on a rational jury."
2008.08-67,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2701.274,2705.055,"Well, you qualify it in your statement of the facts."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2720.158,2722.202,"--No, Justice Ginsburg, there is not."
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2841.078,2843.734,"Well, he -- he carried that burden before the court of appeals."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2843.734,2853.261,But the court of appeals relied on the view that Mr. Yeager did not contest that he participated in the planning and preparation and statements that were made.
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2853.261,2857.414,Revisiting of that issue was not included within the question presented.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2857.414,2860.412,"Well, I think it's included in our ability to defend the judgment."
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2877.141,2884.23,"So if we -- if we agree with you on that proposition, then the conflict that we granted cert to resolve would still continue?"
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2884.23,2885.778,"Well, you could resolve it."
2008.08-67,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2938.664,2951.734,"Well, on that first theory, in your theory that a retrial on hung counts is always permitted, I -- I take it there are no court of appeals opinions or decisions that agree with you on that point, or am I incorrect?"
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2951.734,2963.527,"They have not reasoned it the way that the government reasons it, but I think that the Fifth Circuit's result is equivalent to what the government argued as well as the D.C. Circuit."
2008.08-67,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2963.527,2966.431,A different question: Suppose you prevail.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2985.286,3000.934,"I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, because I think that the interest that's being vindicated here is a balance of interests, and it's -- as I responded to the Chief Justice and -- and referred to Justice Souter's question earlier, double jeopardy has never been a jurisprudence of black and white."
2008.08-67,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3024.078,3027.844,Then the government can try year after year to get a conviction and wear the defendant down?
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3030.371,3033.967,"If the -- if the jury hangs, the government can retry."
2008.08-67,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3035.23,3036.467,Is that the rule in all of the States?
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3040.713,3047.631,"--I am not aware whether any States do, but certainly as a matter of double jeopardy, this Court has never suggested that there is."
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3069.592,3075.076,But one hung jury followed by a second when there has been an acquittal the first time around is not customary.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3075.076,3075.903,--But the--
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3075.903,3081.822,"So the difference is in the -- in the first trial, you're not impugning the integrity of the jury's verdict."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3101.378,3112.105,"--Well, I -- I -- Justice Stevens, all I can say is that if the first jury had really believed that Mr. Yeager acted in good faith and was completely innocent, it should have acquitted on all counts."
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3112.105,3113.465,"It should have, but it didn't."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3121.227,3128.974,"We should -- we should presume that, as we do in other areas of the law, that the jury followed the instructions that it was given, and the instructions that it was given--"
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3128.974,3142.938,"But you make the same presumption when there's an inconsistent verdict, but you say even if it's irrational we'll go along with it because of the one jury, and they may have had non -- unsound legal reasons for saying, well, we'll let the guy off on the one count."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3142.938,3153.182,--But I think that there is no reason for the fact that a jury takes irrational action to then be used for the jury's acquittal to block complete prosecution.
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3153.182,3156.353,The jury did not take irrational action in this case.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3160.619,3167.943,"Well, they acted irrationally in the sense that if a fact necessarily determined acquittals on the -- on the insider trading counts--"
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3167.943,3174.267,"It would be irrational if they had returned a verdict, but they said we can't agree -- for who knows why."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3174.267,3184.514,--But the point is they should have agreed logically if they believed that Mr. Yeager never had inside information or acted in good faith.
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3221.763,3229.496,"It's not all that clear, because, as you argue, the court -- the district court was correct in analyzing the -- the estoppel issue."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3240.103,3243.07,--I -- I don't think that it is that difficult of an issue.
2008.08-67,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.174,3257.845,The jury could not have been as confused as the court of appeals was.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3257.845,3258.563,--I'm not sure that ----
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3301.716,3308.121,Your -- your theory depends upon viewing a hung jury as constituting some action by the jury.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3328.376,3331.375,"I assume I can answer your question, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3331.375,3331.768,Yes.
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3331.768,3345.043,"No, because the -- the logic of -- of the situation here is that in order for collateral estoppel to apply, there needs to be a rational jury verdict."
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3383.995,3386.931,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-67,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3386.931,3387.68,Thank you.
2008.08-67,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3387.68,3389.524,"Mr. Buffone, you have six minutes remaining."
2008.08-67,2,41089,samuel_j_buffone,,3389.524,3423.637,"The Solicitor General has essentially asked this Court to take a metaphysical view of the Double Jeopardy Clause, but the teachings of this Court from Sealfon through Ashe is that the important protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause as applied to issue preclusion must be approached with reason, with rationality, with a non-hypertechnical view in order to protect the public policies that underlie the Double Jeopardy Clause."
