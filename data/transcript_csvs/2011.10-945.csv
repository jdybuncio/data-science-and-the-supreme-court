2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.539,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-945, Florence v. The Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,10.522,13.158,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,40.575,46.479,Do you apply the reasonable suspicion rule to all arrestees?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,52.231,54.499,We do apply it to all arrestees.
2011.10-945,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,77.431,87.32,Is the reasonable suspicion test more easily met if it's a felon detained for a serious felony?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,87.32,92.291,"It is in the view of the courts that have considered this question, absolutely."
2011.10-945,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,92.807,93.424,"In your, in your view?"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,93.424,93.807,--Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,94.891,99.378,"Well, then you are going on a case by case basis based on the offense."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,99.378,112.703,"--The category -- There is a categorical rule, and that is -- that was adopted by these Respondents, by the Bureau of Prisons and four court of appeals, that says: If you are arrested for a more serious offense, categorically there exists reasonable suspicion."
2011.10-945,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,121.224,127.714,"Well, how would this work with respect to individuals who have been arrested for serious offenses?"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,141.305,145.19,I think you will have to ask -- I know you want me to answer the question.
2011.10-945,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,154.464,154.981,I understand.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,158.783,159.716,--Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,159.716,169.589,And I'm asking you whether the mere fact that someone has been arrested for a violent offense would in your judgment be sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,169.589,173.126,"If the jail made that judgment, we would think that a court would not overturn that judgment."
2011.10-945,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,185.266,191.337,But I take it -- I take it what we're trying to do is to protect the individual dignity of the detainee.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,219.254,220.173,Right.
2011.10-945,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,220.173,228.027,So it seems to me that your rule imperils individual dignity in a way that the blanket rule does not.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,228.027,230.295,"Well, a couple of points, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-945,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,266.918,268.837,"Well, I'm not sure if it's their rule or our rule."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,270.189,270.839,"--Yes, okay."
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,282.33,284.23,To do -- to do what?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,284.23,285.466,--Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,285.466,292.636,You just said stripped naked is different from a different strip search.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,292.636,293.42,"Yes, exactly."
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,293.42,294.488,So what is permitted?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,298.957,304.86,Showering in the presence of officers is not something that requires reasonable suspicion.
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,316.701,319.87,They -- they can be inspected without their clothes?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,322.489,324.757,There are two different scenarios.
2011.10-945,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,328.809,329.728,A common?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,329.728,333.113,"--A common room, a common shower area, and of course for security purposes."
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,340.952,342.718,"No, I want to know what is permitted."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,342.718,353.093,"--Yes, what is permitted is anything -- what is not subject to a reasonable suspicion standard is anything other than looking at a close inspection of the person at arm's length."
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,371.822,372.288,Sorry.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,383.129,388.366,--I don't think that the courts have had to confront 5 feet versus 2 feet.
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,397.222,397.722,All right.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,402.874,404.226,"No, I'm--"
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,404.226,405.276,--that -- that's at issue?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,405.276,406.744,"--No, it's the closeness of it."
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,418.218,420.551,I'm still unsure.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,420.551,421.087,--Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,421.087,422.253,If it's okay to shower--
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,422.253,422.637,Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,422.637,425.055,--and have an officer watch you shower naked--
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,425.055,425.422,Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,425.422,431.043,--what is the greater intrusion is that you are standing 2 as opposed to 5 feet away?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,431.043,434.495,2 versus 10 feet away or just generally observing the room.
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,435.847,437.947,That is a line that doesn't make much sense to me.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,437.947,438.715,--Okay.
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,438.715,442.684,"Then let's go to the next line, which is -- that's one kind of search."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,442.684,443.201,Yeah.
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,443.201,448.671,The second is I think what some have called a visual cavity search.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,448.671,449.038,Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,449.038,454.241,Whether you are going to have the individual open or expose private parts.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,454.241,454.824,Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,454.824,460.562,Can you make an argument that that is different than just a visual search?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,460.562,461.112,You can.
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,510.409,511.928,"One, not the other?"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,511.928,512.778,--That's correct.
2011.10-945,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.923,544.999,"Mr. Goldstein, what -- what you propose is reasonable enough, I suppose, and some States could adopt that kind of a protocol instead of what they have."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,568.948,571.483,--We don't believe that the premise is correct.
2011.10-945,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.084,609.175,"That is somehow less of an intrusion on your privacy, to be naked in front of a whole bunch of inmates, rather than one jail official inspecting?"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,609.175,614.51,"Well, first, it wasn't a nearly -- the nearly uniform practice that I think your question assumes."
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,646.465,654.637,"But less intrusive than the one, than the search in Bell v. Wolfish, which involved pretrial detainees?"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,654.637,656.672,"No, Justice Ginsburg, we disagree with that."
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,676.317,686.342,Do we know if the pretrial detainees in Bell were also inspected on entry into the facility?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,686.342,687.175,--We do not.
2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,694.029,700.282,"Counsel, is there -- there's a distinction between the simple strip search and the visual body cavity search."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,707.021,707.605,Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,707.605,710.723,So is the visual cavity search therefore off the table?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,710.723,712.273,"No, it is not."
2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,720.679,721.345,"Right, right."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,727.516,731.901,"--We say that under their written policy they should have, but they didn't."
2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,750.114,754.166,So -- so you see a distinction between what they actually do and the written policy.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,754.166,758.97,I -- I do with respect to the Essex -- I apologize -- no.
2011.10-945,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,782.184,783.117,I'm confused about your--
2011.10-945,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,783.117,783.617,Could I--
2011.10-945,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,783.617,784.65,--your position.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,812.969,813.553,It does not.
2011.10-945,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,816.421,820.323,So your -- your only concern is searches that go further than that.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,820.323,821.059,--That's exactly right.
2011.10-945,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,835.502,836.902,Could I just follow up on that?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,842.387,850.743,"--In Burlington County, there is a dispute about the so-called genital lift, whether Mr. Florence was required to lift his genitals or not."
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,864.402,864.652,Counsel--
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,864.652,865.552,--in the entire case.
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,865.552,867.604,--Could you clarify two points for me?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,871.839,874.358,The record is not entirely clear.
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,891.652,897.973,The prior charge against your client was the use -- involved the use of a deadly weapon.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,906.662,913.816,"No, because it depends because of the breadth of the phrase ""possession of a deadly weapon"", as this case illustrates."
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,924.541,935.581,"So now you are -- you are feeding into your adversary's argument that what you are asking the police to do on intake, or the corrections facility on intake, is to investigate in that fine detail?"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,936.864,937.331,--No--
2011.10-945,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,937.331,940.916,"--and see use of a deadly weapon and say, ah, this guy could be dangerous?"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,940.916,941.818,"--No, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-945,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,966.718,969.152,"Well, is the rap sheet always available immediately?"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1003.143,1003.543,--Sure.
2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1073.42,1083.095,"Counsel -- counsel, my understanding of the statistics -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- is that they get about 70 new people going through this process a day."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1097.604,1098.12,Sure.
2011.10-945,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.22,1138.179,"Mr. Goldstein, you have acknowledged that we -- we have held that when you have visitors, you may be stripped -- strip searched after the visit, and the same kind of close examination that you object to here."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1142.733,1144.199,--I have two explanations--
2011.10-945,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.199,1146.185,--That you don't have to have visitors.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1153.857,1154.357,--Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1167.715,1169.217,Are -- are you sure about that?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1169.217,1169.717,--I--
2011.10-945,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1169.717,1177.972,You can -- you can condition certain -- certain privileges upon a waiver of -- of constitutional privileges?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1177.972,1181.958,"--Yes, I believe that that's -- I think that's a fair statement of the law."
2011.10-945,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1212.294,1216.364,"--Mr. Goldstein, there of course were guards there who were watching the visits."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1224.451,1229.705,"--Well, can I just read to you what the Court said about that, just so -- the Court did have a slightly different take, I think."
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1260.793,1261.91,"Well, which is it you're doing?"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1294.881,1295.314,--Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1295.314,1295.897,That's all they know.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1295.897,1296.247,Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1297.399,1300.685,Then you do not want to -- then you are not saying it always has to be reasonable suspicion.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1300.685,1302.87,It's just a debate about words.
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1304.387,1304.97,"Oh, all right."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1306.672,1307.322,I'm sorry.
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1307.322,1322.448,"What helps me is to know what the category of things is that the jail in your opinion is going to have to look into the characteristics of this individual person, and when I look at the ABA, they talked about minor arrests."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1322.448,1322.95,Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1322.95,1334.172,"And when I look at some of the cases, there is a long list, like violence, drugs, and so forth, where you don't have to, where you can just use the general fact that he was arrested--"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1334.172,1334.456,Right.
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1334.456,1335.174,--for the thing.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1339.243,1345.814,"Our rule that we would expect is that, with respect to minor offenders, that's when you assess--"
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1345.814,1346.164,Okay.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1347.666,1348.066,--Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1348.066,1351.384,--who is a minor offender and how do you administer that rule?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1351.384,1351.768,Okay.
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1361.206,1367.895,"But you are trying to state the constitutional rule, and you keep talking about what is their rule, and we are trying to find out what are the limits--"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1367.895,1368.512,Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1368.512,1372.631,"--of the rule, and I think you've already qualified what you said opening."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1391.595,1392.928,"Yes, that's right."
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1397.764,1398.364,"I mean, that of course--"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1398.364,1398.697,Okay.
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1398.697,1402.416,"--unfortunately, I'm asking you and not them, and -- and it's the same question."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1402.416,1402.666,Okay.
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1402.916,1408.986,How do you want us to write this so that jail personnel all over the country--
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1408.986,1409.42,Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1409.42,1412.955,--have to be able to follow it and know exactly what they are supposed to do.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1412.955,1420.461,For 3 decades the rule that was articulated by the Federal courts and applied without difficulty is one that says for minor offenses.
2011.10-945,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1439.439,1453.365,"I can understand that -- I can understand that for cavity searches, but -- but why for the search to see if -- if the person has any fleas or cooties or, you know, any -- any other communicable disease before he is put into the general population?"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1457.234,1458.753,"No, they are not."
2011.10-945,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.753,1465.589,So that line makes no sense for -- for that aspect of the search which is -- is just we want to make sure that we have a clean prison.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1465.589,1466.822,That is not correct.
2011.10-945,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1485.753,1490.572,And that -- that's where the Fourth Amendment invasion of privacy line is to be drawn?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1500.413,1501.446,--That is correct.
2011.10-945,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1501.446,1504.815,That can't be the line as to whether your privacy is being invaded.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1504.815,1509.268,It -- it can be the line and it is the line that has been accepted for decades.
2011.10-945,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1509.268,1510.034,But -- but you -- you would have to--
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1510.034,1510.601,--dividing line?
2011.10-945,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1510.601,1516.355,"--keep the person in custody, say, for 24, 48 hours until the medical personnel could come."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1520.24,1520.807,Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1524.278,1524.928,But they are--
2011.10-945,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1524.928,1534.233,You are -- you are telling us that every county jail in -- in the United States has medical personnel on duty 24 hours a day ready to do a -- a search?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1534.233,1535.416,"--No, I apologize, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1538.149,1542.936,"What you said before was 2 feet is too close, but 5 feet is okay."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1543.886,1550.107,"--Justice Breyer, I'm saying that a close inspection which is intended to examine the person's individual--"
2011.10-945,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1550.107,1550.526,Yes.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1550.526,1554.644,"--genitals, and whether it's at 2 feet or 4 feet I don't think is the relevant line."
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1558.196,1567.887,"--Made I just ask, on your medical personnel, children in school get inspected for -- for head lice, prisoners for body lice."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1569.887,1578.509,"--No, that's right, but if that is right, what happens is that medical professionals are the people who are assigned that responsibility."
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1583.08,1584.897,But that's not constitutionally required.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1584.897,1585.682,--I -- I agree.
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1586.765,1596.405,"So that's another thing that -- that you don't need to -- to -- they can inspect for body lice, and that's -- that's okay?"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1596.405,1599.522,"--If that's what they're doing, I think that that is okay."
2011.10-945,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1630.478,1637.298,But the government tells us that that's true only if they don't put the arrestee in the general population.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1637.298,1638.015,That's not correct.
2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1653.659,1656.695,"We will give you rebuttal time, but maybe just to be clear--"
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1656.695,1657.011,Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1657.011,1664.382,--You don't -- do you or do you not have an objection to the superseding ECCF policy?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1664.382,1673.238,"We -- if the -- we do, because they still have to stand naked directly in front of the correctional officer under the superseding policy."
2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1704.609,1705.626,That is the current policy?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1705.626,1706.794,That is the current policy.
2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1706.794,1707.711,And you have no problem with that.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1707.711,1708.628,We do have--
2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1708.628,1716.5,"I mean, you have no problem with the reasonable, articulable suspicion aspect of the body cavity search."
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1716.5,1717.184,--That's correct.
2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1717.184,1717.667,Okay.
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1720.719,1721.101,Yes.
2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1721.101,1726.105,--your only objection is that the guard is too close to the inmate?
2011.10-945,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1726.105,1727.541,That's right.
2011.10-945,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1727.541,1728.191,Okay.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1734.211,1736.147,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1805.141,1805.757,I'm sorry.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1810.961,1814.08,It -- it's before or during.
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1814.08,1818.465,Because your friend places a lot of significance on how close the examination is.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1818.465,1818.884,Right.
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1818.884,1821.936,So under that policy how close was the examination?
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1821.936,1822.403,Yes.
2011.10-945,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.694,1836.513,Two arms' lengths.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1837.279,1837.646,--Okay.
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1838.912,1839.262,"Well, that's not right."
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1839.995,1841.347,But I'm not--
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1841.347,1842.197,--That's not right.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1844.03,1844.465,--Right.
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1844.465,1845.415,--The person examines the bin.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1845.415,1845.915,Right.
2011.10-945,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1876.853,1881.838,"Visual observation for more than 2 feet, or less than 2 feet?"
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1881.838,1883.857,"Right, although that -- that was not the district court's theory."
2011.10-945,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1885.54,1886.207,What happened?
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1891.611,1893.477,"Well, it depends on whose version of it."
2011.10-945,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1893.477,1893.961,Do you know?
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1893.961,1905.035,"You have to remember, the district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff in this case, so you would have to -- you would have to interpret -- you would have to give us the benefit of the interpretation, which was that it was more than 2 feet."
2011.10-945,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1942.144,1950.248,"Mr. Phillips, if I could understand your position, you think that there is no reasonable suspicion even for that more intrusive body cavity search, is that right."
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1950.248,1952.266,"That's correct, That's the rule of law."
2011.10-945,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1952.266,1964.24,"And does it matter to you whether the person is being introduced into the general prison population, or would you also say that if the person is not being introduced into the general prison population?"
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1967.792,1977.314,"I would say from my perspective, I think even -- even if they weren't going to be admitted into the general prison population, because the risks remain too substantial."
2011.10-945,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1988.872,1990.005,Would a manual search--
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1990.005,1991.157,So that's not a line we draw.
2011.10-945,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1991.157,1995.459,Would you say that regardless of the offense for which the person is arrested?
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2017.308,2019.391,"Yes, Justice Alito."
2011.10-945,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2048.678,2049.378,Try the ABA.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2080.899,2094.14,"--If -- if you look at the expert testimony that was before the court in the district court in this case, both the expert testimony of the plaintiff and the expert testimony of the defendant -- this is at 348a of the joint appendix, it says"
2011.10-945,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2110.266,2120.624,"It's a conclusion, and we have a lot of practical experience because different States have different rules and San Francisco came in with I think the toughest on your side, for your side."
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2137.585,2139.218,"Well, I--"
2011.10-945,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2139.218,2140.187,Do I just say--
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2140.187,2150.393,"--I think you can go back to Bell v. Wolfish, where this Court said that the fact that there is not a lot of contraband being found may be a testament to the effectiveness of the deterrent."
2011.10-945,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2150.393,2152.178,So why do we change the policy?
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2177.311,2179.662,"Well, I think that--"
2011.10-945,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2179.662,2180.678,To invade more.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2180.678,2190.453,"--Well, I mean, I think first of all anybody who thinks that the problems of contraband are less serious today than they were in 1978 is -- is ignoring reality."
2011.10-945,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2190.453,2192.603,I understand contraband is serious.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2207.915,2210.448,"Well, we can debate that."
2011.10-945,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2220.322,2223.341,"Counsel, could I ask you something just in terms of your rule."
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2230.528,2232.213,No.
2011.10-945,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2232.213,2246.207,"If that's the case, are you saying that if the prisons decide on a manual search, every prisoner who comes in, correction officers can manually check their cavities?"
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2246.207,2247.307,"No, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-945,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2248.04,2250.175,So there is some privacy rule there?
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2250.175,2251.175,I can be clear about this.
2011.10-945,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2297.49,2298.74,Can we go back to Justice Alito's question?
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2369.352,2380.227,"Justice Sotomayor, I think what is disturbing about this case is in fact that he was arrested under circumstances in which he candidly shouldn't have been arrested as a matter of State law."
2011.10-945,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2404.025,2406.811,But what are we doing with the presumption of innocence?
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2421.203,2431.342,"If you ask me the way I would analyze it, I would -- if you want to adopt a different set of standards about who ought to be arrested and who ought to be taken to jail, that's fine."
2011.10-945,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2431.959,2432.594,Sure.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2432.594,2459.762,"But I think once you are talking about actually bringing someone into the jail to be admitted into the general population and what is without question one of the most dangerous, most risky environments, in that context I would hope that this court, rather than asking individual jailers to make decisions on the basis of -- where they clearly will not have the kind of information you are asking them to make and where if they make a judgment wrong in either direction all it means is litigation."
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2460.296,2469.884,"I thought -- I thought your friend said that is exactly what you do with respect to the visual body cavity search, reasonable articulable suspicion, under the new policy."
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2469.884,2474.855,--That's what we do with a true anal body cavity search.
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2477.723,2478.373,Right.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2478.373,2481.275,We changed the policy because of litigation concerns.
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2481.275,2485.244,"Well now, as I understand it, with respect to--"
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2485.244,2485.813,Liability concerns.
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2485.813,2494.502,"--with respect to visual body cavity searches, you require a particular individual reason, right?"
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2494.502,2495.019,Yes.
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2495.019,2495.452,Okay.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2499.921,2500.839,Right.
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2500.839,2501.406,Okay.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2516.698,2518.3,Well--
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2518.3,2522.919,"You want -- he says 2 feet is too close, 5 feet or whatever is okay."
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2529.49,2533.192,"--I don't -- well, you can characterize it that way."
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2542.664,2546.682,I'm not interested in what Essex policy permitted it to do in the past.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2553.188,2553.671,--Right.
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2553.671,2558.34,--for everything except simple strip search and observation.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2558.34,2561.809,"Well, see, that's the problem, is that the language there is different."
2011.10-945,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2580.787,2581.373,Mr. Phillips--
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2581.373,2581.773,I'm sorry.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2586.341,2586.841,--Right.
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2593.179,2594.864,Okay.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2598.233,2600.251,"Right, slightly more than a simple--"
2011.10-945,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2600.251,2600.934,But -- but we've just acknowledged here--
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2600.934,2602.451,--But I don't think that is the line to draw.
2011.10-945,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.451,2613.325,"--But there is still an -- an issue in the case beyond the ordinary visual inspection, and that is this, even though you have changed your policy now--"
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2613.325,2614.492,"Right, we are still liable."
2011.10-945,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.492,2629.936,"--The question remains whether that change in policy was constitutionally required, so that when -- when you treated the -- the plaintiff in a different fashion under the old policy, that was a violation of the Constitution."
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2632.12,2633.738,That question clearly remains in the case.
2011.10-945,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2634.355,2634.738,Okay.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2641.242,2641.661,--Right.
2011.10-945,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2651.784,2676.332,"Does the record or common experience justify an argument that if you have the person who's stopped just for a traffic ticket, but that person is going to be in custody for five or six days, that person might well prefer an institution where everyone has been searched before he or she is put into the population with this?"
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2676.332,2694.294,"--Justice Kennedy, there actually is testimony in the record from the warden saying that in order to ensure everybody's safety, we are better off with a blanket policy that says we are going to engage in -- in some form of a search -- Essex has a slightly more intrusive one -- but it's all designed to accomplish the same thing."
2011.10-945,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2704.918,2712.757,--Is there any evidence -- I count seven or eight States anyway that have some variation of the reasonable suspicion rule like what they want -- roughly.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2718.494,2735.538,"--Well, there is the testimony in the record from their expert, who said that in Kentucky, there is today -- the single biggest problem in Kentucky prisons and the biggest cause of death is drug overdose, which suggests that there is a serious contraband issue in Kentucky."
2011.10-945,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2763.957,2767.092,"Are there any -- are there any constitutional limits, in your view?"
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2778.883,2784.103,"--I -- I don't believe that -- my position would be no, there isn't a constitutional impediment, but--"
2011.10-945,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2784.103,2784.67,So there's no--
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2784.67,2789.34,--The balance would tip in favor of the -- of the institution under those circumstances.
2011.10-945,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2807.652,2811.354,You -- you want us to write an opinion that applies only to squatting and coughing.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2812.104,2815.59,"--Well, you may want to write it slightly differently."
2011.10-945,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2815.59,2816.258,Yes.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2818.694,2833.536,"No, but what -- but what I would really like is an opinion that recognizes that deference to the prison and to their judgment is what's appropriate under these circumstances, and that extends all the way to the Bell v. Wolfish line."
2011.10-945,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2852.531,2860.621,"--You are saying that they can do the full -- as far as the Constitution is concerned, all of these searches are permissible."
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2860.621,2863.489,"--All -- clearly, all of our searches are permissible, and I would go--"
2011.10-945,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2863.489,2864.405,In Bell v. Wolfish--
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2864.405,2865.173,--In Bell v. Wolfish.
2011.10-945,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2872.761,2881.617,--But they did -- they didn't stress -- they didn't stress that there was a visitor who could -- who could give the inmate contraband.
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2898.979,2900.396,--Right.
2011.10-945,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2915.271,2924.627,"--The one significant difference between Bell and this case was that in Bell, there was a real opportunity for people to plan, to conspire together to bring in contraband."
2011.10-945,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2934.485,2938.054,"--No, but the policy itself -- may I answer the question?"
2011.10-945,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2957.248,2958.117,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2970.508,2974.727,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-945,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3060.416,3061.349,Then how do you get--
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3061.349,3062.049,--To try to get them to bring it in.
2011.10-945,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3062.049,3067.336,"--That's not the Federal rules, and by the way, the brief was really confusing."
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3108.063,3110.849,I'm sorry if that was confusing.
2011.10-945,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3121.155,3127.058,"Yes, but I want to know how people in this category are treated in the Federal system."
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3128.56,3129.06,--The people--
2011.10-945,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3129.06,3129.826,--You reversed it.
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3138.782,3143.07,--Those people when they go into the jail would be asked whether they are willing to consent to this type of search.
2011.10-945,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3166.183,3166.483,I'm sorry.
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3180.859,3189.229,"--Well, the general jail population has certain facilities, you know, computer facilities and others that you don't get when you are in a cell by yourselves."
2011.10-945,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3210.045,3227.255,"I understand most of the general proposition that your side is advancing, but I have to say, I was somewhat surprised at the evidence, the amount of contraband that was discovered and the amount of weapons that was discovered that is in the literature and citations was somewhat skimpy."
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3232.391,3237.112,"--Well, there are not empirical studies of this type of information."
2011.10-945,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3275.237,3280.056,The issue has to be certainly some misdemeanor.
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3298.77,3303.755,I think that that is a very hazardous thing for courts to do with 20/20 hindsight.
2011.10-945,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3306.874,3307.876,But we don't have 20/20.
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3330.572,3337.228,"--I agree with you, but what I'm saying is that the individuals who are doing the searches at issue have very limited information about people."
2011.10-945,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3346.101,3347.534,I don't have a question about that today.
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3367.014,3372.318,--That may be true but it's not the information that the people who do intake and are doing the searches have.
2011.10-945,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3409.207,3425.284,Suppose we accept the Petitioner's concession that it is permissible to require everybody who is arrested to disrobe and shower under the observation of the corrections officer from a certain distance.
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3431.356,3434.741,--Well there would be contraband found that would be found in body cavities.
2011.10-945,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3441.728,3443.247,That's my -- that is my problem.
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3485.424,3488.893,--I think the fundamental question for the Court is who is supposed to be doing this line drawing.
2011.10-945,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3494.796,3499.6,--The simplest thing for any prison official is say do it for everybody.
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3499.6,3500.5,That's--
2011.10-945,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3500.5,3511.741,And so the fact they do it for everybody and don't try to make some exclusion for traffic violators or something might be consistent with little or no evidence; it might be consistent with some.
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3513.291,3515.693,--There are many good reasons to have a policy to do it for everyone.
2011.10-945,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3522.114,3527.601,"If there is so much sense to the policy, why isn't the Federal policy?"
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3545.395,3546.664,--Yes.
2011.10-945,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3559.305,3560.239,"--I'm sorry, I didn't understand."
2011.10-945,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3564.124,3567.995,"--Yes, to inspect everyone who would be put in the general jail population."
2011.10-945,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3578.783,3580.551,"That you, counsel."
2011.10-945,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3582.651,3583.937,"Thank you, sir."
2011.10-945,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3725.88,3730.684,I don't think you are really arguing for an individualized reasonable suspicion standard.
2011.10-945,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3742.491,3749.495,"--Well, first, there are real categories that are overinclusive in favor of the jails, like if it's a serious offense or if they have any drug history."
2011.10-945,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3796.142,3797.309,"Thank you, counsel."
