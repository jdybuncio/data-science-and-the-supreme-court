1961.430,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,598.597,604.73,Is the arbitration provisions -- are they comparable to those in Lincoln Mills?
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,604.73,609.949,The arbitration provisions set out a grievance procedure.

1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,732.905,737.532,That's right.
1961.430,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1492.031,1504.176,Could -- could the union go into court to get an injunction against the employer that may lock-out and directing the employer to arbitrate?
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1504.176,1518.307,"I would say this that under our arguments relating to Norris-LaGuardia Act, that so long as the Norris-LaGuardia Act is still vital, it covers all areas of labor disputes."

1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1556.973,1567.941,"Well, I think this, Your Honor, that Lincoln Mills demonstrates that the parties have available to them a multitude of remedies which they can agree to."

1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1620.817,1620.858,-- and labor disputes.
1961.430,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1620.858,1626.825,I think that the injunction of the court would be restricted to directing the employer to -- to arbitrate.

1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1702.695,1704.157,I'm sorry to back track a little bit.
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1734.443,1740.368,I would say this Your Honor that the commitment regarding the lockout runs to the union.
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1753.779,1754.298,Assume there wasn't --
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1754.298,1754.471,This is --
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1754.471,1754.713,-- a grievance?

1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1756.711,1757.918,This is my view of the subject.
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1757.918,1759.237,What -- what grievance procedure?
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1760.878,1762.99,There is no grievance procedure but there's no-lockout --
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1762.99,1763.983,There's been no-lockout (Voice Overlap) --
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1763.983,1767.014,I think it is the responsibility of the unions to bring that suit.
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1767.014,1770.782,Do you think an individual employee could not bring a suit?
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1770.782,1771.298,No.
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1786.387,1787.55,Kind of a derivative suit.
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1787.55,1789.708,"Yes, of some kind."
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1846.718,1850.156,"Well, if the union hasn't been locked out, the employees have been locked out."
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1850.156,1850.589,Yes but the commit --

1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1861.218,1873.097,"I submit, Mr. Justice Stewart, that the no-lockout pledge runs to the contracting party and the contracting party in this case is the organization."
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1918.428,1924.02,"Well, could this -- could -- could an employee bring this suit in the federal courts under Section 301?"
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1924.02,1928.698,"I can't see how Your Honor, because Section 301 provides for only suits between employers and --"
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1928.698,1928.899,"No, it doesn't."

1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1940.187,1940.976,-- by labor organizations.
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1940.976,1941.622,-- and labor organizations.
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1941.622,1945.8,It doesn't say who shall bring them or who -- who shall be the plaintiffs or who shall be the defendant?
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1945.8,1966.18,"Well, I would say this, Your Honor, that in this -- the way I would interpret the import of Section 301 is that if an individual brought a suit for breach of the collective bargaining contract, unless the individuals made a party to the collective bargaining contract, he doesn't have sta -- stature to be a party to that lawsuit."
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1966.18,1972.929,Would this matter standing be something which the Federal District Court should refer to state law to determine the answer to it?

1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1977.359,1979.684,You say -- I think you said he didn't have stature and I suppose --
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1979.684,1980.078,That's right.
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.078,1981.05,-- he didn't have standing.
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1981.05,1982.199,That's right.
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1982.199,1984.265,Is this a question of federal law?
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1984.265,1985.879,As to whether or not he is a party to the collective --
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1985.879,1987.573,He has standing to sue.
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,1987.573,1994.881,"Well, I think the federal courts could make a determination whether the individual is a party to the collective bargaining contract."
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2003.22,2003.518,The statute I think --
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,2003.518,2004.301,-- under section (Voice Overlap) -- yes.
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2004.301,2013.312,"I -- I think I'm right in saying that the statute doesn't, certainly by its terms, specify who the plaintiff needs to be."
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,2027.757,2028.377,Yes.
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2028.444,2037.527,-- if he had been locked out by an employer who would sign a collective bargaining agreement saying he would not lockout his employees.
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,2037.527,2049.224,"My answer would have to remain, Your Honor that if an individual brought a suit for breach of the collective bargaining contract, the first question that would have to be asked, ""Are you a party to the collective bargaining contract?"""

1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2083.867,2093.149,"Well, I think we're -- I've alleged a little appeal but I -- I was just testing out the first part of your argument that no suit could be ever be brought against individuals."
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,2096.158,2108.544,"I would say this, Your Honor that I think that'd be very, very unfortunate if the courts were to interpret Section 301 as to allow individual union members to flood the federal courts with suits of breaches of collective bargaining contracts."
1961.430,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2665.599,2665.669,Well --
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,2665.669,2666.035,Disputes --

1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,2680.184,2687.644,"Oh, there's no question, Mr. Justice Douglas that the employer has the right to bring the union in the court and ask for a specific performance of arbitration."

1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,2689.311,2689.779,That's right.
1961.430,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2689.779,2690.679,That's a Lincoln Mills case.
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,2690.679,2691.113,"Yes, that's correct."
1961.430,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2691.113,2693.488,You're not asking for any --
1961.430,0,25134,gilbert_a_cornfield,,2693.488,2702.794,But the question of whether or not these work stoppages occurred and the unions can be held in contempt of court because they occur is another matter.
1961.430,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2702.794,2716.472,"But in terms of the -- of power of contempt, I suppose that would be implicit in the -- if the court had the power to issue an injunction, directing union to arbitrate and the union didn't arbitrate."
