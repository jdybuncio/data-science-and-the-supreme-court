1975.74-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,61.637,We will hear arguments next in Abbott Laboratories against Portland Retail Druggist.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,65.016,68.477,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,197.289,214.563,"But laying aside all of the others categories that are involved, when a hospital sells to a customer who walks in off the street, are they forming a hospital function or a drugstore function?"
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,214.563,218.637,This would depend upon the circumstances of a particular sale Your Honor.
1975.74-1274,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,253.915,268.198,What about this refilling prescription in hospital by former patient of the hospital that has been given a prescription while in the hospital and he constantly gets it refilled at the hospital?
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,268.198,278.916,The refilling of take home prescriptions is one of the three of the so-called minor categories of business that are involved in this lawsuit.
1975.74-1274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,299.446,311.091,"Mr. Clarke, this case process down despite all the weight and breadths and lengths length of the brief to the meaning of the phrase, “for their own use,” does it not?"
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,311.091,313.385,I believe so sir.
1975.74-1274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.385,336.239,"And it is read, it can be read broadly to include, I suppose, certainly the situation that the Chief Justice referred to, the hospital pharmacy selling to somebody who comes in off the street in an emergency or otherwise, because that is for the use of the hospital and the profit is for the use of the hospital."
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,336.239,336.486,Well that is --
1975.74-1274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,336.486,344.092,"That can be read broadly certainly and to the extent that you can read the phrase right out of the statute, can you not?"
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,344.092,344.982,You can.
1975.74-1274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,390.501,393.243,"Well, they sell drugs to make money and they do make money."
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,393.243,394.971,They dispense drug; they charge for them and they make net profits.
1975.74-1274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.971,397.663,And therefore the sale of the drugs is for their own use.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,397.663,398.604,They make net profits.
1975.74-1274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,398.604,399.812,The profit is for their own use.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,399.812,400.56,That is right.
1975.74-1274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,400.56,405.793,"And therefore there is no limit on this. This phrase read that way would not impose any limitation at all, would it?"
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,405.793,408.931,That is never been the position of the petitioners.
1975.74-1274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,416.352,418.007,With hospital patients?
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,418.007,418.66,"No, sir."
1975.74-1274,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.66,423.98,"Because a hospital can define its function, it can say we are going into the retail pharmacy business as one of our functions."
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,423.98,430.669,I would not disagree with that and if this were an appropriate thing for hospitals to do at any given point in time.
1975.74-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,526.186,530.688,Are they all physically located within the hospitals?
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,530.688,540.009,"These are, I believe that a manual hospital has a sort of a campus type arrangement, so it would not necessarily be in the same building."
1975.74-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,540.009,545.005,But they are not wholly miles apart from the hospital?
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,545.005,548.034,The clinics that I am now referring to are not.
1975.74-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,558.153,560.092,But that was diverged on another ground by the Ninth Circuit.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,560.092,565.378,"That is correct sir, but they have separated clinics."
1975.74-1274,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,646.586,663.126,"Now in under a collective bargaining agreement or as a matter of their own self imposed policy to sell drugs to their own employees and their employees families that had cost a low price they can continue to do so, however, this case is decided, can they not?"
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,663.126,671.152,"The question is not Your Honor, whether the hospitals should be selling these drugs in these ways."
1975.74-1274,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,707.408,721.416,And you make the same argument with respect to a surgeon who happens to practice in the hospital with respect to his office patients?
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,721.416,728.234,I think that so far as his patients who are hospitalized there is no problem as there is in any other case.
1975.74-1274,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,728.234,729.712,My question is not directed to that.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,729.712,742.035,"But if the question is whether the surgeon should be allowed to supply his office patients with drugs purchased from the hospital pharmacy, which I -- if I am correctly construing --"
1975.74-1274,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,742.035,744.131,I thought that was one of the categories at issue here.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,744.131,747.629,"This is again, one of the minor categories."
1975.74-1274,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,766.574,768.669,Let me take that one step further.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,783.012,786.872,Not if the hospital does not sell the walk-in patients.
1975.74-1274,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,786.872,788.073,And if it does?
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,788.073,791.291,"If does, well then he would be like any other walk-in patient."
1975.74-1274,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,938.577,951.327,"Mr. Clarke, so far as I get it, the only category you or the only function that you seem to exclude is for their own use is the actual operation of a retail pharmacy."
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,951.327,952.153,I agree.
1975.74-1274,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,952.153,952.86,That is all?
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,952.86,953.563,That is all.
1975.74-1274,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,953.563,957.334,Everything else is hospital use?
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,957.334,963.446,My powers of imagination or inventiveness are perhaps limited and there might be other categories that could be suggested.
1975.74-1274,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,963.446,964.27,Besides the --
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,964.27,970.849,"Beside the general retail store, but that is the obvious limitation."
1975.74-1274,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,990.157,1001.197,I do not see how that excludes the retail off to that.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1001.197,1014.293,"The difference, as I see, is that in the case of a straight commercial retail operation of a kind that Mr. Justice Stewart referred to."
1975.74-1274,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1049.16,1050.457,So you would exclude those or --
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1050.457,1051.865,I do not exclude those.
1975.74-1274,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1062.756,1078.482,"Well then suppose that the hospital is on one side of the street and it has established a retail drugstore on the other side of the street, but it sells drugs to walk-in customers in both places, you would say the retail drugstore is out of bound?"
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1078.482,1083.465,"I would say well -- I am not anxious to build fences around this exemption Your Honor, but I --"
1975.74-1274,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.465,1088.707,I understand that but you have excluded from the exemption retail drugstore.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1088.707,1093.394,I have excluded that from the exemption because I think there is a distinction which I have tried to explain.
1975.74-1274,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1093.394,1100.825,"No, just a walk-in customer, who is never been in the hospital before who is not about to be again, comes in to buy some drugs."
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1123.545,1128.763,Well that isolated kind of sale would have no connection.
1975.74-1274,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.763,1132.848,Well that is one of the categories mentioned in the Court’s opinion below.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1132.848,1141.143,That is correct and the record shows that the policies of the hospitals are to discourage walk-in business.
1975.74-1274,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.708,1146.848,You have brought the case.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1156.816,1172.663,"No sir for two reasons: First, the record shows that the walk-in business which does occur is associated with the hospital function, that is usually in cases of special need."
1975.74-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1182.707,1195.493,"If the Eight Circuit opinion were narrowed to survive that emergency situation were accepted from their ban, would that satisfy your purpose?"
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1195.493,1197.895,I think it would not -- excuse me.
1975.74-1274,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.895,1201.134,"They already have allowed that, did they not?"
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1201.134,1201.765,No sir.
1975.74-1274,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1208.142,1213.874,I did not know they excluded from the exemption of the dispensing of drugs in emergency situation.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1213.874,1217.264,"No, it is in the emergency room which is a special service."
1975.74-1274,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.525,1227.795,They have excluded that from the -- they included in the --
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1227.795,1228.758,That is correct sir.
1975.74-1274,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1228.758,1231.79,But you are talking about some other kind of an emergency.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1231.79,1241.368,"I am talking about -- let us take the example of Emmanuel Hospital, which is located in the Black District to Portland."
1975.74-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1258.478,1273.898,"Now as you said that the hospitals try to discourage the 1%, apparently you use that figure, the 1% of those who come in off the street to buy."
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1294.139,1299.705,"We, our position does not go that far."
1975.74-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1299.705,1303.36,"Well, I am asking you about a tendency."
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1326.998,1332.754,"Obviously, it would do so if the Court put an offense all around it."
1975.74-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1353.876,1366.614,Well what if defense were that the hospital pharmacy could not sell the walk-in patients before 9 in the morning or after 9 o’clock at night.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1376.783,1382.279,Whether that would cover the range of circumstances in which those sales would occur I cannot speculate.
1975.74-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1382.279,1383.227,Would it not be --
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1383.227,1386.476,It would be an artificial kind of a limitation.
1975.74-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1386.476,1393.53,"Well, what an artificial when that is approximately the business hours of the ordinary pharmacy?"
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1393.53,1403.808,"This is the point, this statute represents a congressional decision that was in the area of the statute."
1975.74-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1420.662,1432.986,"Well, what about the language that Justice Stewart read to you, for their own use unless you give this expansive reading to the term “their use.”"
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1432.986,1442.975,It is our position that there must be a nexus between the dispensing of the drug and the operation of the hospital.
1975.74-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1476.58,1482.408,That would mean that they could always sell Aspirin and Bufferin to anyone who had a pain.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1488.889,1494.25,"I would say if they were at the hospital for diagnosis and they are under the care of the hospital, yes."
1975.74-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1494.25,1496.728,I am talking about walk-in patients.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1511.857,1518.718,"I do not think that at this stage of hospital development that it necessarily is, no."
1975.74-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1519.709,1531.893,"Well, then you should have no objection to a court construing that language has not including the casual walk-in customer."
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1531.893,1548.974,"I think that it has to include not exclude, the exemption has to include the casual walk-in customer who is there for whom the hospital is providing a resource that the customer needs."
1975.74-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1548.974,1569.71,"Well but then by your definitions the hospital presumed by determines its own function, and if it decides that that function should be performed out on the series of retail outlets of separated from the hospital you would still say that by selling Buffering and Aspirin in those outlets it is performing a function which their customer need."
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1569.71,1576.396,"Mr. Justice, we do not say that the hospitals have an unlimited discretion to define their own functions."
1975.74-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1578.591,1582.954,I have yet to hear for you any place where you would limit it.
1975.74-1274,0,29413,james_h_clarke,,1582.954,1584.034,The hospital’s discretion?
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,1900.056,1907.593,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1274,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1937.37,1945.98,"Kaiser had a different kind of operation now than the other hospitals, and then its summary judgement was reversed on a much broader ground about the Ninth Circuit."
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,1945.98,1947.33,In a way Your Honor that is true.
1975.74-1274,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.836,1985.679,"But the lawsuit has got to be decided on the basis of the fact that they exist, I presume."
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,1985.679,1988.268,"Well I would certainly agree, yes."
1975.74-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.972,2033.502,But the outpatients include the outpatient clinics.
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2034.94,2038.472,I am not so sure; I can not tell for certain exactly what he has said.
1975.74-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2045.075,2061.357,"Well, in the outpatient clinic or the clinic where the hospital operates a clinic for the public, I take it, the doctors are hospital agents or employees, and anyway the bill the patient get from the hospital."
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2061.357,2062.641,Yes sir.
1975.74-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.641,2081.589,So it is a -- if one of those outpatients in an outpatient clinic is suddenly hospitalized and is there a week and then he is discharged but still an outpatient he will just get periodic bills from the hospital.
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2081.589,2082.675,He would be billed at the hospital.
1975.74-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2125.498,2141.256,Do you quarrel with the hospital filling a prescription or refilling or selling a non-prescription item after normal business hours to meet an emergency?
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2141.256,2142.262,Not at all Your Honor.
1975.74-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2144.343,2159.474,It is not our business or even the Court of Appeals to undertake to prescribed forms and mechanisms but from your close association as both of you gentlemen have had with this case.
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2174.832,2175.645,No at all Your Honor.
1975.74-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2188.727,2191.2,That would be a different term.
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2191.2,2192.125,Yes sir.
1975.74-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2192.72,2197.473,I am talking about within the framework that we have here.
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2207.255,2208.006,Not at all Your Honor.
1975.74-1274,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2211.652,2219.151,"But when you say you would not object you can see that that would be, the purchase of those drugs would have been purchased by the hospital for their own use?"
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2219.151,2220.246,No sir.
1975.74-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2222.233,2227.946,Well I was asking a question on the framework of our entire dialogue here.

1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2292.897,2301.687,Well we think the Court of Appeals decision is correct that it should be limited to a use on the hospital premises by a patient or somebody --
1975.74-1274,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2301.687,2306.356,"I see that would, one, they would dispense to the hospital’s inpatients in the course of treatment."
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2307.448,2308.633,"Yes sir, we concede."

1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2321.035,2322.515,"Yes sir, we think it is."
1975.74-1274,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2322.515,2327.246,"They were provided to departing inpatient as take home prescription, is that for their own use?"
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2327.246,2329.126,"No sir, just the first two Your Honor."
1975.74-1274,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2329.126,2333.869,"Well, only the first two, the other six are all within Robinson-Patman Act."
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2333.869,2337.352,That is correct for the reason Your Honor --[Laughter]
1975.74-1274,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2337.352,2339.815,(Inaudible) is positional.
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2339.815,2364.032,"For the reason that it is not used on the premises, it is not use under the hospital supervision, the individuals has no connection with the hospital once he leaves the hospital, and the reports indicated despite what Mr. Clarke has said that this was not intended to encompass the whirl, that Congress did intend to restrict it to a situation where it was intended to be used on the premises and for that particular function."
1975.74-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2364.032,2381.482,"But does that not overlook the modern trend, when I say modern it is pertaining 30 or 40 years ago to keep people out of hospital if they can and be -- to get them out of the hospital as quickly as possible after surgery or other treatment?"
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2381.482,2385.156,"We will all agree that that is a desire, yes."
1975.74-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2385.156,2387.147,"They just are not enough hospital, are they?"
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2387.147,2388.286,Certainly that is true.
1975.74-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2391.028,2401.657,"As a result there, after the delivery of the baby they are having the mother and child go home sometimes in 24 hours, after surgery that is formerly was two or three weeks."

1975.74-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.649,2532.507,"How about an instance, how about a (Inaudible) where the hospital sells in the hospital or in the clinic."
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2532.507,2535.348,Well I would again say since it defines it in terms of --
1975.74-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.348,2537.097,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2537.097,2542.88,"Yes sir, I would interpret Lilly’s agreement to mean that it has to be used at the hospital."
1975.74-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.692,2545.314,"Well, if the hospital in their premises?"
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2545.314,2548.962,"Alright, then I would say it is a proper hospital use."
1975.74-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.962,2551.252,Unless if (Inaudible).
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2551.252,2553.629,I can hardly speak for them but I would think so.
1975.74-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.629,2555.461,But you disagree with that?
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2555.461,2558.342,"No sir, no I do not disagree with."
1975.74-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2559.779,2560.691,The comes under two.
1975.74-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.691,2564.961,"That comes under two, it is not a an emergency clinic; it is not an emergency clinic."
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2564.961,2567.259,Regardless Your Honor of whether they call it.
1975.74-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.234,2579.573,Do you agree to that is within the exemption?
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2579.573,2581.46,"Yes sir, if it is used at the hospital."
1975.74-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.46,2585.086,It seems to me not broader than one or two.
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2587.209,2590.235,My own position --
1975.74-1274,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2590.235,2592.202,You have just said for consumption there.
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2592.202,2592.514,Yes sir.
1975.74-1274,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2592.514,2606.445,"Suppose the prescription given to an inpatient for 100 tablets whatever it is and when he is discharged tomorrow he has 90 of them left and takes them home, still alright under the Robinson-Patman act?"
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2606.445,2611.004,"No sir, I do not think so, because the point of consumption is no longer at the hospital."
1975.74-1274,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2611.004,2619.784,"So the hospital then, on your theory, would have to purge that between the 10 that were consumed while an inpatient and the 90 that he took home?"
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2619.784,2630.844,"Yes Mr. Justice Blackmun and incidently that is not a difficult thing, because once he leaves the hospital, the hospital rules and the Oregon statutes and the statutes in every state that I am aware of requires that he would be given a prescription number."
1975.74-1274,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2665.69,2674.705,Well going back to the clinic case an outpatient of the hospital clinic is operated on the hospital premises and comes in regularly for shots --
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2674.705,2675.741,Yes sir.
1975.74-1274,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2675.741,2676.822,-- at the hospital.
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2679.795,2681.582,I think it is; I think it is.
1975.74-1274,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2681.582,2685.281,Well that is certainly broader than number two just an emergency.
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2685.281,2687.761,Well Your Honor my difficulty is this --
1975.74-1274,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2687.761,2689.969,"Well, it is though, is it not?"
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2689.969,2703.273,"Well I do not visualize it as such perhaps Your Honor may disagree with me, but the fact is that what is an inpatient and an outpatient is a matter of definition and there is considerable disagreement among hospital administrators as to what that term means."
1975.74-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2744.367,2749.498,"Let me put this in a practical, so that it makes a better question."
1975.74-1274,1,40601,roger_tilbury,,2756.78,2758.05,"Yes, sir."
