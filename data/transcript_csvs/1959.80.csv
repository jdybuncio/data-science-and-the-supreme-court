1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2814.88,2818.199,Because he sold no -- no products that were subject to the use tax --
1959.80,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2818.199,2818.86,I see.
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2818.86,2819.715,-- with which we were familiar.
1959.80,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2819.715,2820.81,I see.
1959.80,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2820.81,2825.465,Did the Scripto man have any connection with the jobbers when he supervised them or anything like that?
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2825.465,2827.595,"Not -- none that -- none that I know of, sir."
1959.80,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2830.031,2838.063,"Well, let me see, Mr. Jacobs, I gather, the products that he sold were subjected to your sales tax collected --"
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2838.063,2838.542,"Yes, sir."
1959.80,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2838.542,2840.98,-- by the retailers who sold --
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2840.98,2841.262,"Yes, sir."
1959.80,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2841.777,2841.806,What --
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2841.806,2843.418,We can presume not to.
1959.80,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2843.418,2846.059,-- the order -- those for which he had taken orders from them?
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2846.133,2847.003,Yes.
1959.80,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2847.505,2856.389,"And so, Scripto is not involved in -- in the sales of those pens and in that sense, as far as your tax law is concerned?"
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2856.389,2861.983,"You -- you will recall that there was another element of the case before the Florida Supreme Court, something to do with that."
1959.80,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2861.983,2862.678,"Yes, I will --"
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2862.678,2863.576,But that was --
1959.80,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2863.576,2863.648,That is not here.
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2863.648,2864.558,-- that is not the subject.
1959.80,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2866.108,2879.667,"Well, that -- so that the salesman, this single salesman, the purpose -- the purpose that this single salesman served you is that by his presence, you say Scripto is localized in Florida."
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2879.667,2880.641,I say that because of --
1959.80,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2880.641,2883.932,So far as the corporation can exist.
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2887.801,2889.382,"That is eminently correct, sir."
1959.80,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2889.382,2889.529,Or -- you --
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2889.529,2891.364,Yes --
1959.80,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2891.364,2892.377,Really?
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2892.377,2892.622,Sir?
1959.80,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2892.622,2895.448,That is domesticated there just because they have a salesman there?
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2895.448,2895.647,"No, sir."
1959.80,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2895.647,2898.835,"Or do you mean that within International Shoe, it has -- as you contacted (Voice Overlap) --"

1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2906.942,2907.794,"Yes, sir."
1959.80,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2907.794,2921.048,Is under your -- is there any liability under your sales and use tax law upon these independent contractors who make these sales?
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2921.048,2921.472,You mean --
1959.80,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2921.472,2922.109,Do you understand?
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2936.761,2937.107,"Yes, sir."
1959.80,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2942.072,2946.988,"And there, they are present aren't they, as independent contractors operating in making these --"
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2946.988,2947.171,"Yes, sir."

1959.80,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2949.175,2953.333,"And to the extent they pay, there could be no liability on the nonresident seller, do they?"
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2953.333,2955.067,"That's correct, sir."
1959.80,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2955.067,2963.778,Could you subject that single salesman for Scripto to a license tax?
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2963.778,2964.704,"Possibly, we do."
1959.80,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2974.426,2989.636,And you -- you think you can license a drummer who comes into the State merely to show examples and then all the orders have to be transmitted outside the State and everything else is been outside the State?
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,2989.636,2991.678,I believe this Court has found on that --

1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,3009.653,3012.21,"As far as I know, he had nothing to do with it."
1959.80,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3078.857,3081.704,How about the capacity to sue in the State of Florida?
1959.80,1,31105,joseph_c_jacobs,,3081.704,3095.14,"I was most concerned about the statement that was made that that related only to out-of-state merchants, if that is -- I'm not aware of any opinion to that effect."
