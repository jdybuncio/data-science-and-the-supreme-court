2008.08-310,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.404,"We will hear argument this morning in Case 08-310, Polar Tankers v. City of Valdez."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,7.37,26.465,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Valdez vessel tax violates the Constitution's Tonnage Clause because it operates as a charge on a privilege of trading in Port Valdez, and that tax is apportioned in a way that is guaranteed to tax extraterritorial values and values that do not have a connection to the city."
2008.08-310,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,28.9,33.554,It's not often that we have disagreements as to the basic facts.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,62.555,71.644,"Well, I think that it means all taxes that are imposed not only by the City of Valdez, but they are including taxes imposed by the State of Alaska that are collected by the City of Valdez."
2008.08-310,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,72.177,74.679,"In which case, that seems really quite irrelevant."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,74.679,75.912,--That is our position.
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,102.014,106.0,"Well, some -- some of those vessels, I take it, are taxed under other statutes."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,106.767,108.852,--I think -- I think not.
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,114.756,131.516,"Well, do you -- do you take the position -- let's say that if the State of Alaska taxed all the other property you had mentioned except for the tankers and the city taxed the tankers, that that would by definition be a discriminatory tax and/or on some other basis violate the Tonnage Clause?"
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,131.516,134.801,"Well, that -- that would be quite a different situation than what we have here."
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,136.753,150.346,"Well, the reason I raised it was that -- that in -- in your response to my first question, you said, well, you didn't think the city was taxing these other -- these other pieces of property, and I'm -- I'm not sure why that is significant."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,150.346,157.75,"--Well, there are -- there's a huge universe of personal property that could be taxed in the City of Valdez."
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,183.734,187.269,"Yes, but you -- you want us to ignore the -- the State tax."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,201.029,202.712,But--
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,202.712,210.218,"Now -- now that the municipality is imposing the taxes that the State used to impose, don't you think you have to count both of them?"
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,210.218,211.837,--I -- I don't think so.
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.205,219.241,You are going to get a fragile judgment if -- if we go on those grounds.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,223.209,228.846,"--Not so, Your Honor, because State of Alaska takes very seriously its stewardship of oil and gas property."
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,238.118,243.522,"How about the risk in the other direction, that the State will simply take over this tax and remit the proceeds to the city?"
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,247.926,252.878,"The -- the result in my view would be the same, but that would be a different and more difficult case."
2008.08-310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,268.006,269.889,"There are some other vessels, too."
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.41,278.279,Including a -- a cruise ship is covered.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,278.712,283.016,"--There is -- there is one cruise ship, Your Honor, that was caught up in the net in the first year the tax was imposed."
2008.08-310,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,291.087,292.539,Why does that -- why does that matter?
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,297.776,298.893,"No, I think that--"
2008.08-310,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,298.893,308.715,"Why are we having all this talk about -- in other words, you think if there was a tonnage tax applicable to everything -- you know, your pickup truck holds two tons; it has got to pay a certain amount or whatever."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,310.75,317.254,--If a -- if a tonnage tax -- look at what the tonnage tax was initially designed to do.
2008.08-310,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,355.362,356.029,I think you're--
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,356.029,356.481,--it quacks like a duck--
2008.08-310,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,356.481,357.114,--Yes.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,374.693,385.049,"--Well, I -- I was using -- in response to the previous question, imagining that they were imposing a property tax and they were measuring it in an unusual sort of way."
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,414.834,424.876,Let's -- let's assume that you're -- that a given tanker came into the harbor at Valdez on one occasion and one occasion only.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,432.195,444.503,"It would, indeed, because the city in its code creating the tax preclusively presumes that a vessel is subject to the tax so long as it takes on cargo worth a million dollars over the course of a year."
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,445.372,448.824,"Well, let me -- let me just change the question then."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,459.413,462.632,"--Well, it would have to take a lot less than half a tankful."
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,463.084,464.951,Whatever it would take to get it under the minimum.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,464.951,465.301,--Yes.
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,475.058,475.558,Okay.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,480.878,486.782,--I think that they -- jurisdictions impose all kinds of different variations of tonnage duties.
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,487.832,502.459,"Well, the -- the point that I am getting to is -- and I'd -- I'd like you to address this: One of the arguments on the other side is that one reason this should not be treated as a tonnage tax is that it relies upon the concept of a tax situs."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,515.885,516.901,"--Well, two responses."
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,533.411,535.53,Where do we -- where do we look to find this out?
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,535.53,539.667,--One would have to look at the practice in the 18th and 19th centuries.
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,540.734,544.636,Do you know of any source that we could look at to support the proposition that you just made?
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,544.636,551.641,"--I -- I can't point you to any authority directly addressing that point, but I can point you to the general treatment of what a tonnage duty is."
2008.08-310,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,576.79,579.392,"But you don't -- you don't suggest that it matters, right?"
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,582.994,583.561,"--No, I--"
2008.08-310,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,583.561,587.648,But you are not going to suggest that the same tax could be valid or invalid depending on why it was enacted.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,587.648,589.115,"--No, I -- I don't, but I--"
2008.08-310,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,589.115,593.468,"May I ask one other question before you leave this, which is where Justice Kennedy started?"
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,662.946,671.136,"--If I understand the example, that -- that might be a tonnage tax, depending upon the--"
2008.08-310,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,671.136,673.42,I described to you the entire tax.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,675.103,683.959,"--Well, if -- if it's a tax on oil and gas property, and that is the definition of the tax and it happens to fall on vessels as part of the--"
2008.08-310,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,683.959,687.18,The way it does is just as I said.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,738.113,743.082,"--Yes, and--"
2008.08-310,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,743.082,744.248,--But if it's Alaska's tax--
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,744.248,745.065,--That's--
2008.08-310,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,745.065,745.532,--what's wrong with it?
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,755.973,768.78,"--Well, what's -- what's wrong with what's going on here and -- and I think this is in answer to your question -- the City of Valdez has the authority to tax an entire -- as I said, the entire universe of personalty."
2008.08-310,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,788.277,792.063,What I'd like to know is: Do you think what I said was a misdescription?
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,812.409,817.296,My -- my understanding of how the tax system works is that this -- this is a State level tax.
2008.08-310,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,840.578,851.851,"As you understand it, with reference to the tax base referred to in the red brief at page 14 where it says it's 11 percent of the tax base, is that tax base all city-imposed?"
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,851.851,853.553,No.
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,870.848,881.905,"--Was your answer to the Chief Justice that if there is a tonnage tax imposed on everything including -- including ships, it would still violate the Tonnage Clause."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,882.522,894.546,"If it's a -- a literal duty of tonnage on the cubic capacity of the ship, it -- it's difficult to see how that could really be imposed in terms on every other item of property."
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,895.646,897.665,It's my -- it's my hypothetical.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,899.215,908.473,"--Well, if the city were -- were to say that every transportation -- device of transportation was going to be -- be taxed on the basis of its cubic capacity, you know, vans and railroads--"
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,908.473,909.323,And you think it would be okay?
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,909.323,911.24,--I think that would be--
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.24,913.092,It's only discrimination that counts?
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,913.092,916.227,"--Well, we focus on -- well, no."
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.684,928.967,"Well, there's some -- there's some fight about that, obviously."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,937.992,939.242,Well--
2008.08-310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,939.242,940.509,How many days.
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.509,941.127,Right.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,943.027,944.063,"--Well, there are two--"
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,944.063,952.383,"Which means, the argument could go that this is obviously a -- a tax for the use of the port."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,970.63,971.98,--I -- I agree entirely with that.
2008.08-310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,978.784,993.71,"And you don't dispute that in light of the benefits provided by Valdez to the shipowners, that there could be a legitimate tax on these vessels?"
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,993.71,996.329,--That is -- that is absolutely right.
2008.08-310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,996.948,1003.534,So could you describe what tax authority you think Valdez has?
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1003.534,1006.803,--There are two ways that Valdez could go about taxing these vessels.
2008.08-310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1043.492,1052.098,"How much property -- you said if they -- if they taxed all moveables, that would be okay."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1057.069,1062.89,"--It -- it may -- I -- I suppose the test would be if it's predominantly focused on vessels, that would be unconstitutional."
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.614,1083.386,But you don't think a daily -- a daily charge on vessels for remaining in port violates the Tonnage Clause?
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1083.386,1084.586,--It would violate the Tonnage Clause.
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.586,1086.421,Is this anything else than that?
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1086.421,1105.217,"I -- I agree with you, Justice Scalia, that however ports, States, or cities go about trying to impose a tax on vessels for the -- I'm calling it the privilege of trading in the port, as distinct from the user fee I discussed with Justice Ginsburg, that would be an unconstitutional tonnage duty."
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1106.335,1107.585,What about a--
2008.08-310,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1107.585,1111.287,"I was going to say, even if it's a flat fee?"
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1111.287,1112.239,--According--
2008.08-310,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1112.239,1114.455,"Every vessel has to pay, you know, $1,000."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1114.455,1118.024,--The Court has so held on several occasions that a flat fee violates the Tonnage Clause.
2008.08-310,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.024,1122.761,"Mr. Rothfeld, can I ask you a question, just focusing on the Tonnage Clause, not the elements of discrimination?"
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1148.245,1152.447,"Well, the recipients of the property are being harmed."
2008.08-310,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1155.649,1161.653,But who -- what State is being discriminated against in the scenario we have before us today?
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1161.653,1169.491,--All of the States that are using the oil shipped through Valdez are paying -- ultimately paying this tax.
2008.08-310,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.577,1182.799,"But you are saying it's an unduly onerous burden on the oil companies and their tankers, and they only ship oil out of Alaska."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1182.799,1198.761,"--Well, the concern that the Framers had in putting the Tonnage Clause in the Constitution, as with the Import-Export Clause, was that States with favorable port facilities were going to be imposing burdens by taking advantage of their favorable geography to impose burdens that are going to be felt by the other States."
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1200.695,1203.13,"Not felt by the other States, felt by the consumers in other States."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1207.182,1208.032,That -- that's right.
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.032,1211.884,"All of whom are going to be outside of Alaska, since this oil is leaving Alaska, right?"
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1211.884,1213.736,That -- that is exactly right.
2008.08-310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.736,1217.104,"It's a neat tax, you know, get somebody else to pay your taxes."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1217.104,1222.842,"That -- that is precisely right, and that's just what the Framers were concerned with, with the Tonnage Clause in the Constitution."
2008.08-310,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1230.947,1233.315,"Well, but just on a -- maybe this doesn't matter."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1239.803,1241.505,That -- that is an interesting question.
2008.08-310,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1258.348,1261.05,"It is -- we have an evolving Constitution, after all."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1261.05,1262.669,"--I will leave that one alone, Your Honor."
2008.08-310,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1263.752,1268.155,"Well, then, do you know -- it's not an entirely frivolous point."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1276.809,1280.13,I don't know a definitive answer to that.
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1305.828,1318.236,"--I thought you said earlier or implied earlier that we couldn't draw a distinction, really, between capacity and value because tonnage in the 18th century was simply a proxy for the -- for the value of the ship?"
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1318.236,1319.155,That -- that's right.
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1321.207,1323.64,So a value tax is going to run into the same problem--
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1323.64,1324.107,--That's right.
2008.08-310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1324.107,1324.742,--as a tonnage tax.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1324.742,1325.275,That's right.
2008.08-310,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1342.287,1363.284,"If the amount of the tax were measured by the number of sailors who were going to come ashore and the number of days they would be ashore, and a small port city wanted to recover the costs that they impose on municipal services, would that be -- would that be subject to the same flaw that you see here?"
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1363.284,1371.973,"It -- it would, although it might be possible for the city to impose some type of user fee calibrated in that direction."
2008.08-310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1463.066,1473.255,"--But that's -- the train is going to be some place throughout its trip, unlike the ship that's going to be on the high seas."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1473.255,1475.29,That's right.
2008.08-310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1523.954,1527.842,Who can tax for the time on the high seas?
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1527.842,1532.127,This Court has held in the Central Railroad case that the taxing authority goes to the domicile.
2008.08-310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1533.394,1538.281,And the domicile here is Texas.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1539.031,1541.316,--The commercial domicile is Texas.
2008.08-310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1544.602,1550.255,"In either case, no ships berth in either Delaware or Texas."
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1551.021,1553.723,These ships do not -- the ships berth in Texas.
2008.08-310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1554.409,1562.996,So the home port might have had in the old days the notion that's really where the vessel is berthed.
2008.08-310,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1577.906,1582.31,"--If I may, Your Honor, I'll -- I'll answer that question and sit down to reserve a little bit of time."
2008.08-310,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1616.248,1617.15,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1622.887,1641.948,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the Wheeling case, this Court said it is too well settled to question that taxes upon vessels based upon their value as property do not violate the Tonnage Clause."
2008.08-310,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1649.602,1652.72,"Well, it says vessels of all kinds are liable to taxation as property"
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1655.856,1661.743,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, precisely in the same manner as other ad valorem property taxes."
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.281,1797.681,"Not fishing ships, right?"
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1797.681,1798.566,--The fishing--
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.566,1801.868,None of -- none of Valdez's fishermen have to pay this tax at all?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1801.868,1804.97,"--They don't have to pay this tax, Justice Scalia, but they pay other taxes."
2008.08-310,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1815.41,1835.423,"But -- but your answer it -- it seems to me does put the issue squarely before us in the terms that the Petitioner has presented, that is to say, sure, suppose you tax the vessel and you tax trailers and small vessels and a lot of other things, but as to all of the latter category, you have -- you have an exemption."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1838.608,1839.175,No.
2008.08-310,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1839.175,1841.827,And I thought that that was the way the case was presented to us.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1841.827,1842.277,No.
2008.08-310,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1856.57,1862.407,But the people's homes only if they are affixed to the property and they--
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1862.407,1865.609,"Now, that's with respect to mobile homes."
2008.08-310,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1865.609,1866.109,--Yes.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1866.109,1870.913,They are taxed as real property when they are affixed in that way.
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.913,1873.115,And nonmobile homes are not taxed as real property?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1873.115,1879.852,"The tax -- cities may impose taxes as real property or -- or personal property, Justice Scalia."
2008.08-310,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1882.637,1884.672,"Now, the question is, what's imposed here?"
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1893.528,1895.162,"No, Justice Kennedy."
2008.08-310,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1896.564,1898.414,"See, we have a problem with the facts here."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1919.143,1925.297,--The -- there are various taxes imposed by Valdez on personal property and real property.
2008.08-310,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1925.297,1926.397,Was my statement correct?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1926.397,1932.201,Your statement is correct only with respect to the ordinance that -- that eliminated the exception.
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1940.723,1942.057,That's a different argument.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1942.057,1942.69,"--Yes, I know."
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1942.69,1943.559,Can we just get to--
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1943.559,1944.075,I know.
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1954.015,1957.417,So was all other personal property exempt from taxation.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1959.351,1971.076,"--Except -- except, under the -- to the extent that personal property was covered by the oil and gas tax, the provisions that I have referred to -- Valdez had been imposing that tax--"
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1971.076,1972.611,That's nicely targeted as well.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1979.848,1993.775,"--If the Wheeling case is correct and the other cases that have repeatedly said this, there is no constitutional impediment for a city or a State to impose a property tax on property being used in--"
2008.08-310,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1993.775,2005.999,"But Wheeling -- Wheeling was -- it was a general property tax, and as I read the case, it said if you are going to tax property, you can include vessels."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2039.887,2058.55,"--There -- well, I -- I think what my point here with respect to this, Justice Ginsburg, is I don't know the answer specifically to that question, but we are looking at what the bundle of taxes that a community or a State imposes on property used that imposes a burden on the community."
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.929,2085.284,But you can't -- you can't make vessels bear the overall burden of municipal governance.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2098.875,2109.067,"--Well, I disagree in part with what you said, with respect, Justice Scalia; these vessels pay 11 percent of the revenue base for the city; 11 percent."
2008.08-310,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2111.685,2113.435,How do you define revenue base?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2113.435,2127.944,"This is the amount of tax collected by the City of Valdez with respect to ad valorem taxes in the city, including ships, mobile homes, cranes, barges, appliances, real property, and so forth."
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2127.944,2129.146,"You are counting the State tax as well, right?"
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2129.146,2129.83,Pardon me.
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.83,2132.682,You are counting the State tax on oil equipment?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2132.682,2140.002,I am -- I am saying to you that the State imposes a tax but the State specifically allows Valdez to impose that very tax.
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2140.002,2141.538,--That makes matters worse.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2141.538,2145.906,Valdez imposes that tax as a part of its total taxation package.
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2145.906,2154.012,"Let's -- let's suppose I accept just what Justice Ginsburg said, and said that it's a hopeless morass if we look at all taxes."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2223.442,2224.192,The answer is--
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2224.192,2224.875,"If I don't, what's the right argument?"
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2224.875,2233.214,--The answer is section 43.56 that allowed -- the State statute may impose that tax you just described.
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.333,2238.035,"""May impose"" doesn't help if you don't do it."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2238.035,2240.987,"Yes, it does impose it, and then, Justice Breyer--"
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.987,2242.104,The state imposes it or--
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2242.104,2250.092,--section 29.45.080 says -- I am going to read it exactly; this seems to be an important point.
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.265,2286.698,"Wait a minute, owed to the State for what?"
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2295.388,2300.942,--A municipality may levy and collect taxes on property under this section.
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2304.444,2306.096,What -- what's it a credit against?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2307.696,2309.798,--The State also imposes the liability.
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2322.656,2325.907,What does the city get a credit against?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2325.907,2326.509,--The--
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.509,2327.525,--as referred to in the--
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2327.525,2337.298,"--The taxpayer, once he pays $10 to the city under this tax, doesn't have to pay $10 to the State under this tax because he gets a credit for--"
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.298,2339.5,"--Oh, I thought it was the city that got the credit--"
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2339.5,2341.519,"--No, it is the taxpayer that gets the credit."
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2348.023,2350.391,--And that happens with all these other properties?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2364.766,2365.717,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2366.2,2367.0,And you write the check to the city.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2367.0,2367.517,--What?
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2368.086,2370.452,All the things you listed on page 11--
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2370.452,2371.538,Yes.
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2371.538,2379.125,"--The -- the oil and gas, motor vehicles, machinery, appliances, supplies, and maintenance equipment."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2379.125,2381.244,Those are money paid to the city.
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2381.244,2382.762,So they write a check to the city.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2383.379,2383.929,Yes.
2008.08-310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2390.75,2392.368,"Well, that's exactly the question I wanted to ask you."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2403.76,2404.81,"No, it would not be."
2008.08-310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2406.211,2407.277,It would not be constitutional?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2407.277,2410.163,"--It would not be -- it would not be unconstitutional, Justice Stevens."
2008.08-310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.163,2414.698,"Oh, but then why is the -- what other people pay on other taxes even relevant?"
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2414.698,2416.317,I don't think it is relevant.
2008.08-310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2437.581,2454.108,"So we can take as a -- as a given, for the purpose of analyzing the issue, that this tax is either the only tax that's relevant to our analysis or that it's so much higher than all the other taxes, it should be treated as the functional equivalent, as the only tax we have to look at?"
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2454.108,2464.464,"--I'm saying that it would not make any difference if this was the only tax that the city imposed unless it was a tonnage tax, and the tonnage tax -- this Court has repeatedly--"
2008.08-310,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2464.464,2475.456,But the answer to Justice Stevens's question is we can take this case as presenting to us the fact that the ships pay more than other property?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2475.456,2475.972,--No.
2008.08-310,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2475.972,2477.224,And you say that doesn't make any difference.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2477.224,2479.591,"No, the ships do not pay more."
2008.08-310,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2538.579,2555.839,"But is it -- do you -- do you contest the point that was made in the reply brief that, back at the end of the 18th century, tonnage was considered a proxy for value, that it was the customary mode of measuring the value of a ship?"
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2555.839,2558.141,"--I do contest that, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.718,2606.188,"--Which is -- for a commercial vessel, is a rough calculation of how much it's worth."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2606.188,2607.14,--It is not--
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.14,2610.676,"The more cargo you can carry, the more valuable the commercial ship."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2610.676,2614.543,"--That is not correct, Justice Scalia, and it's -- and it's not correct in this case."
2008.08-310,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2644.73,2645.315,But all you're saying--
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2645.315,2646.049,And--
2008.08-310,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2646.049,2655.87,--All you're saying is that there are other factors that -- that preclude using tonnage simply as a single crude measure.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2680.272,2687.276,"--Well, if -- if everything else was equal, the bigger, the more capacity, the more valuable the vessel might be, that's true."
2008.08-310,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.964,2702.768,"So as long as you are taxing on the basis of the value of the ship, then you have no Tonnage Clause problem."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2716.428,2717.945,--That is what this Court has said.
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2728.353,2730.186,What about a porthole tax?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2730.186,2730.721,Pardon me?
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2730.721,2732.855,Is a porthole tax in your view okay?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2732.855,2733.572,A what?
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2733.572,2734.889,A porthole tax.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2743.76,2744.776,That's not a tonnage tax.
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2744.776,2746.962,"So, in your view, a masked tax."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2746.962,2754.801,"To the extent that the tax is on a vessel as an instrument of commercial conveyance, what this Court has said--"
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2754.801,2762.455,"Oh, but the porthole tax applies, by the way, to that ship's captain who has retired, who has built his house with portholes instead of windows."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2763.073,2763.623,--I have--
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2763.623,2769.66,"So there are 2 or 3 percent of the -- I mean, it's only 99.9 percent on ships."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2769.66,2770.793,--Let's start with -- with the basics.
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2770.793,2771.427,Yes.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2771.427,2779.099,"When the Constitution was written, the Constitution did not intend to take away the power from the States to impose taxes."
2008.08-310,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2849.095,2864.539,"Counsel, if you -- if you are right that any type of ad valorem tax is okay, well, then why in the world would the Framers have adopted a -- a prohibition on a tonnage tax, if you could just say it's a tax on value, which is going to have the same impact on commerce?"
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2864.539,2871.026,"--Because -- because, if you are taxing -- I think that the Court had reasons for the conclusion it came to."
2008.08-310,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2884.102,2887.554,"Well, putting aside what the Court has said, I'm looking at what the Framers have said."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2890.506,2891.006,--It does--
2008.08-310,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2891.006,2891.722,--if you are right?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2891.722,2905.349,"--It -- if it's -- if it's a State using a tax on a vessel qua vessel as an -- as an instrument to limit commerce, that is something that the Framers did not want to do."
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2907.149,2909.468,It offended them aesthetically?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2910.151,2911.686,"--No, because -- for--"
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2911.686,2916.824,So all the State has to say is we are not -- we're not taxing you qua vessel.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2917.424,2918.34,"--No, Justice Scalia--"
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2918.34,2919.359,"I mean, what--"
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2919.359,2937.737,"--What the Framers were concerned about and what I was trying to say in response to the Chief Justice's question is that there was a limitation on the States' power to tax imports or exports because of the fact that that would put the States on the coast at an advantage, and they would pass those burdens on to the inland States."
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.593,2947.109,--Mr. Olson--
2008.08-310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2947.109,2947.843,But suppose you could--
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.843,2950.811,--let me ask you something about -- about discrimination.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2997.209,2998.676,You can--
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2998.676,3002.596,--It's getting somebody else to bear the burden of your taxation.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3002.596,3003.446,"--If you do, it would be--"
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.446,3011.201,"Taxing that equipment raises the price of oil, almost all of which the oil goes out of Alaska and is paid for by people in other States."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3029.58,3032.449,--That then might -- that might be a Due Process Clause problem--
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3032.449,3032.882,No--
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3032.882,3033.949,--but it wouldn't be a Tonnage Clause problem.
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.397,3066.872,"--And if -- if California taxed vessels, I would not allow California to come in and say, oh, we are just subjecting them to the same tax that our own citizens are subjected to."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3066.872,3067.522,And Justice Scalia--
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3067.522,3069.388,I wouldn't let them point to the Silicon Valley tax.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3069.388,3075.192,"--You would -- you would, I submit, then, say that vessels are exempt from property tax."
2008.08-310,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3075.192,3078.244,That may be the only way they can accomplish what they want to.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3100.176,3106.663,"Well, it's going to require an amendment to the Constitution because what the Framers talked about was a Tonnage Clause, and they were talking about--"
2008.08-310,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3106.663,3107.297,--But we have said--
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3107.297,3108.113,--and they did not exempt--
2008.08-310,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3108.113,3115.603,"--Mr. Olson, we -- we have said it's not just tonnage."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3141.301,3159.763,"--Well, I guess I have to resort to the fact that every time this Court has considered it, or at least in almost every case, the Court has gone out of its way to say: They were not intending to prohibit States from taxing the value of property, if it's an ad valorem tax."
2008.08-310,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3159.763,3172.105,"But -- but in all of those cases, the vessels were being taxed as one item of property in a general moveable property, personal property tax."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3186.615,3198.59,"If this -- this is an ad valorem tax, it has various different statutes and ordinances that it comes from, but there's ad valorem taxes in Valdez across the board for all kinds of property."
2008.08-310,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3198.59,3201.542,This statute deals with one category of property.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3203.475,3205.244,"Well, there's -- no."
2008.08-310,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3221.103,3228.026,That was the other -- the State taxes were no part of the Alaska Supreme Court's decision in this case.
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3228.026,3238.298,"--Well, I think what we are talking about is whether or not this -- this community can impose a tax on the people that own property in this community."
2008.08-310,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3267.234,3268.184,And on what else?
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3276.09,3282.327,"The only thing that the Court talked about because it was -- like this, it was an as-applied case."
2008.08-310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3297.086,3305.776,"What about the -- Grier -- you haven't mentioned that -- Grier in Norris v. City of Boston, where he says the tonnage -- you know what he says; it's on the front page of their brief."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3323.238,3338.83,"--And what -- what the thrust of the overall bulk of the cases including the language by this Court repeatedly is that property taxation based upon the value of property, not imposing a value -- not imposing a tax on the ship."
2008.08-310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3349.888,3350.421,--May I ask a--
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3350.421,3353.673,--You don't get charged a fee for entering the port.
2008.08-310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3362.029,3367.183,"--May I ask you a question that I don't think has come up, but I just wondered if anybody has argued this?"
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3383.876,3409.86,"I think -- I think you're correct, Justice Stevens, that what the Framers were concerned about was a substitute for an export or import tax by taxing what was in the ship, and that ""tonnage"" referred to that, but it wasn't the value of the vessel itself because the Court -- the Framers wouldn't have wanted to take away the power of the States to tax commercial activity using property in their communities in the same manner that they taxed other property."
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3409.86,3413.395,"If that's all it applied to, then the wharfage tax would have been perfectly okay."
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3413.395,3414.162,The wharfage tax--
2008.08-310,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3414.162,3414.795,You can't say that was--
2008.08-310,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3414.795,3419.381,--The wharfage tax has been upheld by this Court frequently.
2008.08-310,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3430.689,3433.006,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-310,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3436.141,3439.895,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.08-310,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3460.375,3462.092,Where -- where does the money go?
2008.08-310,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3464.844,3468.462,"If the city collects it, it keeps it, but it has been authorized to do that by the State."
2008.08-310,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3468.462,3471.081,"Well, then I think we ought to regard it as a city tax, not a State tax."
2008.08-310,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3474.968,3476.768,But it -- it's imposed by the State.
2008.08-310,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3480.604,3485.924,"Well, I suppose the State can regulate what cities and municipalities and counties can do throughout the State."
2008.08-310,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3490.412,3495.716,"--That -- that's true, but this particular tax is a tax that is imposed by the State at the State level."
2008.08-310,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3559.772,3566.126,What about the -- the broader tax situation at the -- at the -- in -- in 1789?
2008.08-310,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3585.706,3593.129,--My -- my understanding is that real estate certainly was subject to tax and that ports would have the authority to tax other types of property.
2008.08-310,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3597.764,3608.889,"So -- so that the argument they are taxing other things, therefore it's okay to tax this, would have been an argument just as potent in the 18th century or impotent, as the case may be, as it is now?"
2008.08-310,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3608.889,3609.822,That's right.
2008.08-310,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3609.822,3610.372,Okay.
2008.08-310,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3610.372,3615.893,And so setting aside vessels in a -- in a unique category when other things could be taxed would have been problematic--
2008.08-310,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3615.893,3621.363,"How -- under your view, how is a city supposed to impose a property tax on a vessel?"
2008.08-310,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3621.363,3627.08,--It -- it should impose a tax by imposing a tax on personal property generally.
2008.08-310,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3644.192,3651.565,So -- so you think we should resolve the tax by seeing how generally applicable property taxes are in Valdez?
2008.08-310,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3651.565,3657.702,"I -- I think it's an easy case when, as in this situation, there is only one item of property that is taxed, and that's a vessel."
2008.08-310,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3657.702,3664.29,"Well, but your -- your brother suggests that other items of property are taxed under other provisions of the tax ordinance."
2008.08-310,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3664.29,3667.307,"Again, Valdez does not."
2008.08-310,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3680.734,3681.567,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-310,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3682.634,3683.353,"Thank you, Your Honor."
