1980.79-1997,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.123,We'll hear arguments now in Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat.
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,79.235,81.733,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1997,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.764,332.541,"When you say, Mr. O'Neill, the testimony was, what, 75, 85, 90 percent?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,335.461,337.429,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1997,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,337.429,339.461,"What was the average time, Mr. O'Neill?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,339.461,340.755,The average time?
1980.79-1997,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,340.755,341.505,Of service?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,341.505,351.61,"The testimony on average time came from the same witness who testified on the percentage of pardons, Mr. Gates, who was then Chairman of the Connecticut Board of Parole."
1980.79-1997,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,354.609,360.124,"For about 75 percent, is it, of those sentenced under these sentences?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,360.124,368.808,"I think the fairest statement of the testimony is that it's somewhat more than 75 percent, I think is the fairest--"
1980.79-1997,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,368.808,373.416,"In that sense, there was a pattern, was there?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,373.416,374.869,--In that sense--
1980.79-1997,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,374.869,377.4,Of parole within 14 to 17 years?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,377.4,379.149,"--Pardon, Your Honor."
1980.79-1997,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,379.149,380.944,"Pardon, within 14 to 17 years."
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,380.944,382.147,Within 14 to 17 years.
1980.79-1997,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,390.065,398.559,"Well, may I ask, may we accept that as what the practice has been?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,398.559,435.405,"Well, following the... Mr. Gates is a very knowledgeable man and he has been around in the corrections area in Connecticut for decades... following the decision of the 2nd Circuit and before this Court granted certiorari, we did embark upon a process of reviewing the minutes of the Board's meetings for the past five or six years, I believe, to see if we could put together some kind of a pattern, but we really didn't get all that deeply into it when this Court granted certiorari, and we stopped."
1980.79-1997,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1053.108,1058.31,"Mr. O'Neill, your opposition really isn't asking for very much here, is it?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1059.855,1060.855,Yes.
1980.79-1997,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1060.855,1074.287,Do you feel that your Board of Pardons is able to deny relief for no reason at all?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1074.287,1084.955,I don't think that any state agency has the right to be capricious and whimsical.
1980.79-1997,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1097.543,1103.557,"Well, wouldn't the question be, is the Board entitled to grant a pardon for no reason?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1103.557,1112.631,"I don't think they deny or grant pardon for no reason, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-1997,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1112.631,1114.147,"Well, where does the burden of proof lie?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1134.92,1156.457,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the answer to your question derives from the concept of a pardon, the Connecticut Board of Pardons, such as this Court indicated in Schick, takes the position that if a man has been sentenced, there's no challenge to the sentence, no challenge to the conviction."
1980.79-1997,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1184.416,1198.552,"May I ask, Mr. O'Neill, is it... am I correct that the practice, or rather, procedure followed by the Board is, unless a member of the Board moves that a pardon be granted, that's the end of the matter."
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1207.08,1212.545,"Well, I don't know if it's as formal as making a motion, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1980.79-1997,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1230.725,1239.144,"But what if someone doesn't say he'd like to discuss Stephen O'Neill's case, there's no consideration of pardon for Stephen O'Neill?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1239.144,1240.16,That is consideration.
1980.79-1997,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1240.894,1242.268,"Oh, that is consideration?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1242.268,1243.549,--I would claim that it is.
1980.79-1997,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1257.387,1263.948,"If a reason were given to Stephen O'Neill in that circumstance, what would the reason be?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1265.649,1280.346,"--Well, the reason would be, as I... the real reason would be that I had not given the Board sufficient reasons in their mind to--"
1980.79-1997,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1280.346,1281.628,For someone to move it?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1281.628,1284.376,--to even consider giving me relief.
1980.79-1997,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1285.423,1288.063,What is this Board?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1292.123,1298.948,"It has five members, one of whom by statute must be a Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court."
1980.79-1997,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1307.069,1310.068,For a term of how long?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1310.068,1314.958,I really don't recall.
1980.79-1997,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1314.958,1317.988,So there's some turnover on the Board?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1317.988,1319.112,There is a turnover.
1980.79-1997,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1319.112,1320.534,A new governor can't have a new Board?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1321.003,1325.828,Each governor could conceivably have a new Board.
1980.79-1997,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1325.828,1326.546,Have a brand new Board?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1326.546,1328.39,"I believe, have a brand new board."
1980.79-1997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1337.495,1343.603,"Mr. Attorney General, maybe I missed it, but what is the reason that they don't give reasons?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1343.603,1352.457,"--Well, again, one goes back to the philosophy of the Board."
1980.79-1997,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1361.376,1365.562,Something like our practice of not giving reasons for why we deny certiorari?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1365.562,1375.276,"We don't claim to be a court or to have judicial powers, but it is along those lines, Your Honor; yes."
1980.79-1997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1389.317,1392.925,Is there a statute that says that they don't have to give the reasons?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1392.925,1395.191,The statute says nothing on it.
1980.79-1997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1399.329,1399.391,You don't say?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1400.219,1401.86,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1980.79-1997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1401.86,1405.422,I still want to know what the reason is why you couldn't give a reason?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1405.422,1414.308,"Well, you mean, just administratively decide that, absent constitutional or statutory requirements?"
1980.79-1997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1414.308,1418.025,"There is no reason, right?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1418.025,1420.648,There is no constitutional requirement requiring it.
1980.79-1997,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1434.222,1442.671,"Well, there might be five different reasons."
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1446.373,1447.622,There might well not be.
1980.79-1997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1449.825,1452.356,"Well, if there are five, give me one of the five."
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1452.356,1453.214,--All right.
1980.79-1997,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1468.395,1469.098,And that would be true in every case?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1469.098,1471.925,"--However it was phrased, that would be the message."
1980.79-1997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1471.925,1478.845,I don't see how Mr. Justice Stewart can sit here in Washington and know what's going on in the Board in Connecticut.
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1484.686,1486.732,"However, it was stated that would be the reason."
1980.79-1997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1486.732,1488.996,"You're speaking for the State of Connecticut, right?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1488.996,1490.746,"For the Board of Pardons, yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1490.746,1492.542,For the State of Connecticut.
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1500.851,1509.269,"The reason would simply be to the inmate, you haven't shown us why we should extend that act of clemency."
1980.79-1997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1511.58,1513.736,"Well, I mean, that's your idea of a reason."
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1513.736,1514.579,--or how that would help anybody--
1980.79-1997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1514.579,1515.783,That's your idea of a reason?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1515.783,1522.483,"--That is the reason, that is the thought process that the Board goes through."
1980.79-1997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1522.483,1527.871,Didn't one member of the Board or former member testify there would be no problem in giving a reason?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1527.871,1566.137,"Well, he's testified that administratively, if one devised a form with four or five patented answers, it would be no great problem to check two or three boxes on that printed form, but I think he also testified that in his mind that wouldn't tell the inmate much of anything, and doesn't advance or promote any cause or any justice, it's simply a pro forma useless act, that's what I think he was really saying."
1980.79-1997,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.245,1577.663,"Mr. O'Neill, I gather that in a fairly large number of cases the Board does act favorably to the request for shortening the sentence?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1577.663,1579.491,In reducing the minimum term.
1980.79-1997,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.491,1579.866,Yes.
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1582.724,1583.332,"No, it does not."
1980.79-1997,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.332,1604.746,"It just acts without explanation, either granting or... well what... and there's an issue in this case, or at least there's a question in the case as to... if there is some kind of a liberty interest at some point in time, nobody's really decided when it might attach, and I guess the lower courts were at the view it depends on how soon there's a significant number of people who are getting some kind of relief."
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1619.224,1624.879,"The only evidence in the record was that somewhere between 14 and 17 years, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1997,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1624.879,1626.94,Then over half of them would get some kind of relief?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1626.94,1629.533,"Roughly around 75 percent, yes."
1980.79-1997,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.533,1630.251,It's over 75?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1642.84,1643.965,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1980.79-1997,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1643.965,1648.994,"Or any governor, where there is still executive clemency?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1653.696,1655.991,"Not, really."
1980.79-1997,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1667.017,1670.017,"But otherwise, your Board of Pardons system has taken over completely?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1670.017,1671.765,That is correct; that is correct.
1980.79-1997,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.765,1681.308,"Do you know on the basis of your experience what is the general... well, why do they let 75 percent of the people out early?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1692.476,1712.655,"There are a multitude of attitudes and philosophies and guidelines and goals that the individual members of the Board use, some of which are really hard to define, as this Court, as a majority of this Court noted in Greenholtz."
1980.79-1997,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.655,1721.933,"These are all cases in which the Legislature has provided a mandatory minimum sentence and in 75 percent of cases the Board of Pardons just decides to overrule the Legislature, is that right?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1721.933,1726.541,"Well, one must read, one must read the Legislature's acts together."
1980.79-1997,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.694,1740.878,"And says, well, we really don't mean it in 75 percent of the cases, is what it boils down to, I guess."
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1766.993,1769.914,--That has happened and that has been the reason.
1980.79-1997,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1769.914,1772.241,"Yes, but not in 75 percent of the cases, I don't suppose?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1772.241,1772.46,No.
1980.79-1997,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1772.46,1779.784,"But that's one of the kinds of cases that they might consider, is that true?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1779.784,1785.969,"That... there have... and there was testimony in the record to that effect; yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that that has been a factor."
1980.79-1997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1810.022,1814.958,How do cases get before the Board?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1814.958,1817.472,The inmate must apply.
1980.79-1997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.472,1819.128,How does he know that?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1819.128,1822.002,"I believe it's in the record, Your Honor."
1980.79-1997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.562,1830.046,But how does he even know he can apply?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1836.778,1837.887,"--Yes, there are rules."
1980.79-1997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.414,1848.272,"Well, does the Board... has the Board issued procedural regulations?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1852.333,1857.159,"That you must apply; yes, there are written procedures; yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.159,1862.97,And does it indicate what must be contained in the petition?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1864.5,1864.939,Petition; yes.
1980.79-1997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.047,1872.077,But is there... does the Board provide a form?
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1872.077,1873.231,A form is provided.
1980.79-1997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.337,1888.225,"Yes, and do they... and the form says, please give reasons why, or does it say, does it ask some specific questions that it wants answers to?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1888.225,1889.88,I'm looking for a form now.
1980.79-1997,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1918.806,1922.54,"So, it doesn't indicate at all any of the reasons that might be relevant to the Board?"
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1922.54,1928.349,"--No, but it gives the inmate a large box to state why the Board should give him some relief."
1980.79-1997,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1934.097,1939.44,Very well.
1980.79-1997,0,41832,stephen_j_oneill,,1941.83,1942.298,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1997,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1942.298,1944.453,Mr. Wizner.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,1944.453,1950.746,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1977.439,1984.795,"Well, the real question in this case is whether or not the Constitution requires the Board to give reasons for its failure to grant a pardon."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,1984.795,1985.17,"--That's right, Justice Stewart."
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2014.955,2022.764,Didn't the Greenholtz opinion for the Court emphasize the key to it was the language of the Nebraska statute?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2022.764,2023.717,"Yes, it did, Your Honor."
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2023.717,2025.731,What's that got to do with its practice.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2025.731,2035.994,"Mr. Chief Justice, if I may respond to that, this Court as you well know, in Greenholtz stated that in that case the Nebraska statute by its terms created an entitlement."
1980.79-1997,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2079.382,2082.678,So that it's in effect boxed itself in?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2082.678,2086.083,"Well, not really, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1997,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2091.346,2105.684,"But if after this decision they started not granting any relief at all or granting relief to 20 or 30 percent rather than 70 percent, then the case would be wholly different, I take it."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2105.684,2106.778,It would be and we think they can do that.
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2133.798,2147.432,"Well, on the basis of that argument, could not an equally plausible argument be made that since you're granting 70 percent in the past, you must grant 70 percent this year?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2150.791,2151.869,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2154.571,2155.367,But isn't it equally plausible?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2155.367,2158.321,"With all respect, Your Honor, I think it is not equally plausible."
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2187.9,2188.384,Mr. Wizner?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2188.384,2189.869,"Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall?"
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2189.869,2191.962,What would happen if they gave the following reason?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2196.631,2199.255,"Mr. Justice Marshall, we do not think--"
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2199.255,2200.036,Would that be enough reason?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2200.036,2200.333,--No.
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2202.941,2205.004,Would you mind addressing to what kind of reason?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2205.004,2205.628,"--Yes, I will."
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2205.628,2210.891,"Because, you know, I don't know of any case where we've spelt out what reasons ought to be given."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2210.891,2211.485,All right.
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2211.485,2213.704,In due process things.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2213.704,2214.095,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2215.5,2219.546,"And does the 2nd Circuit have a rule for rehearing which says,"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2226.23,2227.542,--It's a reason for them.
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2227.542,2228.979,Isn't that a reason?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2228.979,2231.76,That is a reason for a court not to grant rehearing.
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2233.492,2235.524,"But... I'm just working on the word, ""reason""."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2235.524,2235.836,--Yes.
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.084,2240.646,"What kind of reason, please?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2240.646,2241.162,--Very well.
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.319,2279.615,"Well, wouldn't the next step after that be that if the inmate denied the reason, there would have to be a hearing?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2279.615,2287.439,The Connecticut Board of Pardons already permits an inmate to come back and try to correct any misunderstandings the Board may have.
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2287.439,2289.985,"Well, I know, but you would say it would be constitutionally required?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2289.985,2290.829,We wouldn't say--
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.829,2293.579,If this was a liberty... if it's a liberty interest?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2293.579,2300.997,"--I would say that some mechanism would have to be offered to the inmate to review an erroneously based decision, if the Board--"
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.997,2306.104,"No, only that there would have to be a mechanism of some kind, a hearing or some other suitable?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2306.104,2306.526,--That's right.
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2310.822,2311.523,How about an attorney?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2311.523,2313.398,"No, we don't claim a right to an attorney."
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2313.398,2315.46,"Well, you don't now, but, soon?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2315.46,2316.006,No.
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2334.125,2342.435,"Well, Mr. Wizner, what Mr. O'Neill told us, or I thought he did, about their present practice, which is that they have a list of names."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2353.744,2354.322,That's right.
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2354.697,2368.974,"Now, what they'd have to do, they'd have to sit down, they'd have to take up John Jones, or Stephen O'Neill, and decide that, why in Stephen O'Neill's case they ought not grant it if they're not going to."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2370.879,2372.315,"--Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2372.315,2373.284,By a majority vote or something like that?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2373.284,2378.076,"Justice Brennan, yes; in that respect Justice Rehnquist is correct, they have painted themselves into a corner."
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2390.961,2392.648,"They'd have to agree upon the reason, wouldn't they?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2392.648,2393.569,--And they would have to deliberate.
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2407.767,2417.92,"Well, why wouldn't it satisfy your requirement if all members of the Board indicated his reasons individually and they had no meeting of the Board?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2417.92,2421.403,"--That would satisfy us, if we got a reason from each member of the Board."
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2423.309,2425.777,"They'd have to agree by majority vote, then, on a single reason?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2425.777,2427.76,--It doesn't have to be a majority vote on a single reason.
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2427.76,2432.337,"Each of them, Jones, Smith, so forth, can have a separate reason?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2432.337,2432.853,Yes; yes.
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2432.853,2434.289,And it wouldn't need to have a meeting or deliberate.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2434.289,2435.084,That's right.
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.548,2447.814,How many members of the Board are there?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2447.814,2448.594,There are five.
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2448.594,2451.124,So he might have been told five different reasons?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2451.124,2458.294,He might have been told five different reasons and in fact the kinds of reasons which the Chairman testified did control these decisions were at least five.
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2459.996,2463.634,"And if one or more of the five is incorrect, what to do?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2465.946,2469.71,If four out of the five members have valid reasons--
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2469.71,2477.098,"If we have five separate reasons, as you suggest would satisfy the requirement, but one or two is incorrect, what happens then?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2477.098,2479.05,--The issue is not whether or not they're incorrect.
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2486.72,2492.342,"Nevertheless, there may be a stated reason by one of the Board members that the prisoner says, that just isn't true."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2494.326,2498.497,--He would have to be afforded an opportunity to correct that reason.
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2498.497,2499.791,Even though the other four were accepted?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2499.791,2500.025,Yes.
1980.79-1997,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2507.039,2521.784,"Well, Mr. Wizner, supposing that the Parole Board... you say that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court of Connecticut and the statute confer upon it unfettered discretion, at least by statute."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2521.784,2522.251,Statute; yes.
1980.79-1997,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2522.251,2541.604,"And supposing it chose to operate in a manner that, simply, they met once every six months and any member of the Board could put an applicant's name on a list to be considered, and if the applicant's name wasn't put on the list to be considered he simply never would be considered."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2541.604,2549.756,"Yes, we think that would be constitutionally permissible and consistent with the kind of traditional plenary exercise of the pardon power that was described by the Court in Schick."
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2563.782,2568.015,Why do you distinguish between an administrative body and a judicial body?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2568.015,2569.092,--If Your Honor please--
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2569.092,2570.764,For constitutional purposes?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2570.764,2578.823,"--For constitutional purposes, for the same reason that judges are not required to give reasons for their sentences and juries are not normally required to give reasons for their verdicts."
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2595.395,2595.973,What about this Court?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2595.973,2597.018,But not by this Court.
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2600.064,2607.841,"When we deny certiorari, as I suggested to your friend, you do not suggest that we must give a reason?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2607.841,2613.824,"--While some of us might like reasons, I wouldn't suggest that you're obligated to or that we're entitled to them."
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2615.667,2628.255,"What if each of the members of the Board filed a statement essentially saying, denied because the petitioner has presented no reason that it should be granted?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2628.255,2637.188,The Connecticut Board of Pardons would be perfectly within its discretion to do that if it weren't granting relief to almost every member of our class.
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2639.892,2641.58,I understand.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2652.651,2654.9,"--Mr. Chief Justice Burger, that is not a reason."
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2663.086,2665.21,These are only inmates serving life sentences?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2665.21,2665.663,These are--
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2665.663,2667.035,And why is that?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2667.035,2670.565,"--There is an explanation for this, Your Honor."
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2670.565,2671.628,I'd be interested in it.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2671.628,2681.436,"And it's an explanation that I... I puzzled, as did Justice Stevens, about why all of these lifers who are after all, all of them convicted of murder, why they are getting relief so consistently."
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2682.436,2684.92,"Well, why is the plaintiff class limited to those serving life sentences?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2684.92,2692.448,--Because they're the only ones who are not eligible for parole unless the Pardon Board grants them a sentence commutation.
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2693.901,2696.697,"I thought that a life sentence meant 20 years, if the person--"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2696.697,2699.18,--Here's how a state life sentence works.
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2753.939,2754.642,--To earn good time?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2754.642,2755.424,To earn good time.
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2755.424,2756.408,Until they've served--
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2756.408,2758.578,Until they have served--
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2758.578,2759.25,--Twenty years.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2759.25,2760.031,--the full 20 years.
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2761.39,2762.28,"That law has been changed, hasn't it?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2762.28,2763.42,--That law has been changed.
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2802.31,2803.216,Thirty-five--
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2803.216,2803.685,Or 35.
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2807.934,2808.386,--Perhaps not.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2815.008,2833.5,"That's not the only offense, and there's a footnote in our brief that... all of our clients have committed murder, but there's a footnote in our brief that also provides for life sentences in certain limited situations for persons who lie in wait and pluck out the eyes of the victim or do damage to certain parts of their bodies."
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2833.5,2834.985,There's nobody in the Connecticut prisons convicted of--
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2834.985,2835.344,No.
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2835.344,2842.621,"--Mr. Wizner, have you ever read an opinion of a court which says,"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2848.775,2853.148,"I have read opinions like that, Your Honor."
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2853.148,2853.476,Yes.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2864.847,2867.003,"O'Neill, I think, was the example, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2867.003,2872.626,"Well, Marshall, and we find no merit in it."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2874.967,2876.108,"No, it would not, Justice Marshall."
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2876.951,2887.619,"Why would that... would a conviction that puts a man in jail not require it, but this one to get out of jail does require it?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2887.619,2895.085,--Because the Legislature has made clear in the case of a man convicted and sent to jail what it is that has to be found before that can happen.
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2900.707,2905.238,"Well, what rules are there in Connecticut that tell the court how to decide a case?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2905.238,2907.44,"--There is only the statute, the Legislature--"
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2907.44,2908.252,"Well, what statute?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2910.236,2913.671,--The statutes defining crimes define the elements of the offenses.
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2913.671,2915.889,Does the statute define what reasons have to be given?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2915.889,2923.136,The reasons have to be that the defendant has been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of each and every element of the offense prescribed by the statute.
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2923.136,2927.697,Does the statute say what reason the appellate court has to give?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2930.759,2930.868,"No, it does not."
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2932.274,2932.743,Right.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2932.743,2935.085,I should listen to your questions.
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2935.085,2942.222,"Now we're back to your case, in which you say that for this reason you must get more than you get out of an appellate court."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2942.222,2959.215,"The reason why you must get more is, first of all, when the appellate court is reviewing a decision of the trial court, it is deciding several things, but above all it is looking at a conviction for a crime in a criminal case where each of the elements of the offense has been proved to the satisfaction of the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt."
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2978.895,2984.159,"Well, didn't some of your people go all through a trial and an appeal?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2984.159,2986.408,All of our people were convicted.
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2986.408,2987.018,I thought so.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2991.547,2995.124,"Your Honor, Mr. Justice Marshall, I'm not here asking for the release of my clients."
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2995.124,2995.811,You see my problem with that?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,2995.811,3007.649,"I am not here asking for the release of my clients, and it may well be that a requirement that reasons be given will inhibit arbitrary granting of relief as well as arbitrary denial of relief, and I really don't know what the consequence of it would be."
1980.79-1997,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3015.068,3023.83,Do your defendants have that sort of reason-giving in the process of finding their guilt?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3032.233,3033.608,"No, I don't, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3043.478,3049.414,But a jury's verdict of guilty is defined by the metes and bounds of the instructions on the law given to it.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3049.414,3049.959,That's right.
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3061.097,3078.291,"From what you have said so far, Mr. Wizner, I get the impression that you're saying that when a prisoner files the petition it should be in effect treated as an order to show cause directed to the Board why, to state why he should not be released."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3080.978,3083.82,"With all respect, Mr. Chief Justice, that is not the practical effect."
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3083.82,3084.367,You tell me why it isn't.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3084.367,3085.647,I will tell you why it isn't.
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3092.786,3106.827,"Well, then, is not the petition, doesn't it function as a direction to the Board, on your submission, that you must give me a reason why you do not release me, or else release me?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3108.796,3109.388,I'm not seeking release.
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3136.083,3141.923,"Well, and as long as you don't challenge it as being inaccurate, in which event you suggest that there should be a review procedure."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3141.923,3144.032,"But the Connecticut Board of Pardons already permits that, sir."
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3144.032,3148.592,"Well, I know, but you are also saying, I'm sure, that it would be constitutionally required?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3148.592,3152.404,If the Board of Pardons decides a case on constitutionally impermissible grounds.
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3152.404,3152.857,"No, I didn't say that."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3154.45,3159.823,"The scope of review would be like the review of an administrative agency, very narrow."
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.823,3161.291,"Well, review by whom?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3161.291,3165.539,"It could be review by the Board of Pardons itself, or judicial review in the state courts."
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.539,3169.678,"I know, but would you say the Constitution required judicial review of it?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3169.678,3172.584,I don't say the Constitution requires judicial review.
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3176.769,3186.749,"Well, let's suppose one of the five says, I'm not going to vote to give you a pardon, because you battered your cellmate over the head with a club the other day."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3198.213,3200.416,--He has the burden of proving that it didn't happen.
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3200.416,3200.9,I know.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3207.335,3214.676,"I think the Board is entitled to rely on the information it receives from the prison authorities, provided that he had a fair institutional disciplinary hearing."
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3214.676,3219.815,"I know, but he says, I will carry the burden of proving that I never did anything of the kind."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3229.358,3232.262,"He is entitled to some review, to a chance to show that--"
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3232.262,3240.431,"All right, and the member who gave that reason is finally persuaded that, no, it wasn't true, and I withdraw those reasons."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3241.119,3245.319,"--Then he gets whatever the Board orders that he gets, either--"
1980.79-1997,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3245.319,3248.927,Four other members have given other reasons which he hasn't challenged.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3248.927,3250.739,--Then he has nothing left.
1980.79-1997,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3259.423,3269.124,"Mr. Wizner, isn't it probable in the case where a Board member relied on a disciplinary infraction, that would have been supplied to him in some kind of a report as a result of a proceeding that had already taken place?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3269.124,3270.027,That's the point I was trying to make.
1980.79-1997,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3270.027,3273.573,"He doesn't know about the facts that go on in the prison, other than what's supplied at the Board hearings."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3273.573,3274.526,"That's correct, and that's what--"
1980.79-1997,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.526,3277.4,And the review presumably would have already been had on that kind of an issue.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3277.4,3278.494,"--That's right, Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1997,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.494,3289.989,"I just want to be sure you've said everything you want to say on the question of, why must these officials give reasons when judges don't have to give reasons in a whole host of situations?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3305.404,3305.92,"No, it doesn't."
1980.79-1997,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3305.92,3306.357,And why not?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3306.357,3318.243,"It doesn't, Justice Stevens, although assuming it would favor a rule which required trial judges to give statements of reasons for sentences, the Legislature in the case of sentencing has created outer bounds for sentencing."
1980.79-1997,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3318.243,3318.462,That's right.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3319.882,3332.159,"And here we have outer bounds too, but we have an agency which has limited its own bounds, it has structured the exercise of its discretion by acting in a certain way over and over and over again."
1980.79-1997,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3332.159,3333.347,Trial judges do this too.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3360.663,3376.36,"It has to be constitutionally significant, although I agree with you that... I don't know if I'm agreeing with you... I would prefer, obviously, to have judges give reasons, but I think that when a state agency and a branch of the executive acts, it's different than when a court or a judge acts."
1980.79-1997,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3396.711,3416.47,"Supposing, following up on Justice Stevens' question, that a particular judge has a reputation for being very severe on narcotics cases and generally sentences to the maximum authorized by law in those cases, say in 90 percent of the cases that come before him, but in ten percent he doesn't."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3441.037,3463.419,"There might well be such a reason in that case and the analogy I think of, Justice Rehnquist, is the draft evasion cases where appellate courts held that where judges automatically sentenced draft evaders to the five-year maximum sentence under the statute, the cases had to be remanded to the trial courts so that the trial judge would exercise discretion in determining what sentence should be applied to the particular offender."
1980.79-1997,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3463.419,3465.23,Did this Court ever hold that?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3465.23,3466.559,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1980.79-1997,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3495.64,3501.341,But how would you know that discretion was being exercised unless you had a statement of reasons.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3507.151,3513.79,I think a sentencing judge who is engaging in the practice I have just described ought to be required constitutionally to give reasons for what he's doing.
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3519.739,3528.721,In abolishing parole did Connecticut also set definite terms for certain crimes?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3528.721,3529.439,"Yes, it did, Your Honor."
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3529.439,3532.796,And eliminated judicial discretion to a great degree?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3532.796,3533.28,"Yes, it did."
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3546.839,3553.149,So a good many times it wouldn't do a judge any good to have any reason at all?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3554.585,3554.898,That's right.
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3563.674,3573.483,"But Connecticut has retained, while eliminating discretion, has retained this provision giving the Board complete discretion on parole?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3573.483,3574.045,That's right.
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3588.977,3593.851,Are you familiar with how many states have abolished or cut back their parole statutes?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3593.851,3594.476,I am not.
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3600.862,3612.545,I am sure it is not a desire on your part to see this dispensation that now exists under the Board in Connecticut abolished too?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3614.545,3616.137,--I'm not asking the Court to do that; certainly not.
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3634.49,3635.505,Mr. Wizner?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3635.505,3636.396,"Yes, Justice Marshall?"
1980.79-1997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3636.396,3639.316,Is it true that in Connecticut you can appeal the sentence?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3639.316,3639.769,Yes.
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3646.485,3647.922,Upon a conviction?
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3649.125,3651.546,"No, I don't think lifers are eligible for sentence review."
1980.79-1997,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3654.232,3654.607,"Well, that's what I wanted to know."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3654.607,3664.369,"That's another reason why the Pardon Board may have been granting relief on a higher percentage of cases of lifers than other people, that they can't get the benefit of their good time and they can't get their sentences reduced any other way."
1980.79-1997,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3664.369,3675.365,"Well, it would be the next... it would a consistent step to take for Connecticut to eliminate this discretionary part of sentencing also, wouldn't it?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3675.365,3675.849,"Yes, it would."
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3683.251,3686.328,"But that isn't your objective, you've indicated previously?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3686.328,3694.387,"That is not my objective, Your Honor, I would not come to court to seek the elimination of discretion and the denial of relief to clients whom I'm representing."
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3702.775,3718.753,"But you are aware, I take it, that the states which have abolished parole have done so because of the difficulties imposed by entitlement claims over the last few years?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3718.753,3721.282,"That is correct, Your Honor, and I am not opposed to that."
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3763.14,3778.931,"But it's only 15 or 20 years ago, Mr. Wizner, though not literally every one, but almost every one dealing with these problems thought the indeterminate sentence was the great wave of the future, the best thing that ever happened."
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3791.396,3791.801,"That's right, Your Honor."
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3791.801,3794.972,--And there's a move to abolish it and make sentences fixed.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3817.431,3818.353,We are not.
1980.79-1997,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3818.353,3828.99,"If the Court should create a liberty interest, would it not follow that these inmates would be entitled to a hearing as well as a statement of reasons?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3828.99,3833.847,"I hesitate to argue against myself, but I do not think so, Justice Powell."
1980.79-1997,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3877.11,3885.404,I understand that the liberty interest you are asserting in this case would not even require that the Board hold a meeting.
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3886.059,3894.635,"I think that's true, except that... I hesitate to say that it's true, again because of the consistency with which relief has been granted."
1980.79-1997,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3936.056,3944.616,"Isn't it true your 90 percent figure is a little bit misleading because in any set of applicants in one day, 90 percent of those don't get relief on that day?"
1980.79-1997,1,42203,stephen_wizner,,3944.616,3945.146,That's right.
1980.79-1997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3966.325,3968.779,"Thank you, gentlemen."
