1986.85-1277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.689,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-1277, the School Board of Nassau County, Florida versus Gene H. Arline."
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,14.926,16.876,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,159.785,160.118,Mr. Hayes?
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,160.118,160.318,Yes.
1986.85-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,160.318,162.251,Was she at any time hospitalized?
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,162.251,169.641,In 19... our... the transcript of testimony indicates that in 1957 she was hospitalized.
1986.85-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,169.641,170.907,"I mean, during this period."
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,170.907,172.943,"No, during this... well, yes--"
1986.85-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,172.943,177.045,"Well, aren't infectious people hospitalized in Florida usually?"
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,177.045,180.448,"--They are oftentimes, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,180.448,182.081,"Compulsory, if necessary?"
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,182.081,183.298,"Yes, that's correct."
1986.85-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,183.298,184.766,Why wasn't it done in this case?
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,184.766,193.506,"It was not in this case, as we understand, largely because through Dr. McEuen's testimony, that it's no longer necessary with the new drugs since 1950."
1986.85-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,200.326,201.695,That's uncontradicted?
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,201.695,214.003,"That's uncontradicted, that she was not... now, she was hospitalized, she testified at page 77 of the transcript in the trial, about her being hospitalized at age 14, at Sunland Center in Tallahassee."
1986.85-1277,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,365.3,370.169,Did the school board consider whether she would be qualified to teach in the high school?
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,370.169,370.788,Yes.
1986.85-1277,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,399.355,403.259,She did not have a certification to teach beyond the elementary level?
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,403.259,405.592,"Absolutely, and she did not seek to get it."
1986.85-1277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,485.96,486.793,Mr. Hayes?
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,486.793,487.843,"Yes, sir, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.843,500.803,"On your point that she is not a handicapped individual, you're not merely arguing that she was discriminated against by reason of her handicap, but you're also asserting that she is not a handicapped individual."
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,500.803,501.37,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,501.37,511.908,"Yet you say that she has been, by reason of a disability produced by the tuberculosis, hospitalized on several occasions."
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,511.908,524.585,"In... the evidence was, and the Solicitor General will speak to that extensively, sometime in the past, in 1957, which we didn't know about, as it turns out, until the trial... so that goes to the question of solely by reason of: did we use that as a basis."
1986.85-1277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.585,527.62,"Okay, but I'm not concerned about ""solely by reason of"" right now."
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,527.62,527.82,Okay.
1986.85-1277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,527.82,529.103,I'm concerned about whether she's handicapped.
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,529.103,531.905,"Well, that goes to the question, the definitions of impaired."
1986.85-1277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.393,538.943,Had a record of such impairment.
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,538.943,539.628,--That's correct.
1986.85-1277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.228,544.999,"Well, now, what does it take to establish a record of such impairment, beyond being in the hospital?"
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,544.999,553.502,"Well, the impairment... the question there would be whether or not the impairment related to the contagiousness, or to the disease of tuberculosis."
1986.85-1277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.97,558.472,"Well, that goes to whether she was dismissed because of it."
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,561.608,567.345,"--Well, there is a question... there's no question in the record that as a child she was hospitalized for this disease."
1986.85-1277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.53,571.566,"So you have to say she was a handicapped individual, don't you?"
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,571.566,574.016,--We... we... as the trial judge--
1986.85-1277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,574.016,577.803,"Or else you tell me what else that phrase, has a record of such... right now she wasn't impaired."
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,578.886,579.036,--That's correct.
1986.85-1277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.036,583.438,But she had a record of being so debilitated by tuberculosis that she had to be hospitalized.
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,583.438,583.957,Correct.
1986.85-1277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.957,586.057,"Now, what does that language mean if it doesn't cover that?"
1986.85-1277,0,17714,brian_t_hayes,,586.057,603.918,"We would, at this time, at least for point two, suggest that we would accept, as the trial judge did, that if she was indeed... if she was indeed impaired or had a record of such impairment by hospitalization, for the purposes of point two, we suggest it's not important, because she would be not otherwise qualified."
1986.85-1277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,607.905,610.79,"Thank you, Mr. Hayes."
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,611.79,627.884,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,763.072,767.559,"Mr. Fried, what is the handicap of someone who's diseased?"
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,773.546,776.415,"The statute couldn't be clearer, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,784.854,787.556,Is employment a major life activity?
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,791.592,794.21,Those are all major life activities.
1986.85-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.014,908.483,"Mr. General, how do you respond to Justice Scalia's question?"
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,911.185,913.037,"--Well, she's plainly a handicapped person."
1986.85-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,913.037,913.77,"Oh, you do--"
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,913.77,916.155,"Oh, plainly a handicapped person; no question of that."
1986.85-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,928.38,929.097,"--Well, Mister--"
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,936.367,937.817,"Oh, indeed not."
1986.85-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,944.288,947.14,She wouldn't be contagious if she didn't have tuberculosis.
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,947.14,948.942,"--Oh, yes."
1986.85-1277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.227,1035.698,And you would say... you would say that she would not have been a... the only reason you acknowledge that she's a handicapped person is because of the prior history of hospitalization.
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1043.22,1047.605,"So far as the record indicates, there is no other basis for concluding that she's handicapped."
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1072.221,1078.441,"General Fried, wasn't she otherwise qualified, within the words of the statute?"
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1078.441,1081.159,"We believe she was not, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1081.159,1081.678,Why not?
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1081.678,1088.582,"She was not otherwise qualified, because a person who poses a risk--"
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1088.582,1090.534,You did rehire her twice.
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1094.736,1100.073,"--At the time she was terminated, she was contagious."
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1101.39,1107.794,"But before that, she had taken time off, and had been rehired twice."
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1107.794,1109.846,"--I believe so, Justice Marshall, that's correct."
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1109.846,1111.281,"Well, then, wasn't she otherwise qualified?"
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1111.281,1115.416,Not at the time her... not at the time she was excluded from the classroom.
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1115.416,1115.932,Why not?
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1115.932,1120.784,"At the time she was excluded from the classroom, she was in a contagious condition."
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1121.903,1124.355,"Well, wasn't she in a contagious condition that first time?"
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1124.355,1126.572,--Not to the knowledge of the school board.
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1126.572,1134.394,"Well, I thought that your opponent said that twice she was released on full salary."
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1134.394,1137.06,"Oh, she was released on full--"
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1137.06,1138.179,And why was she released?
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1138.496,1139.529,--She was released--
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1139.529,1141.048,--Because she was contagious.
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1141.048,1143.081,"--She was released from the classroom, Justice Marshall."
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1143.081,1144.75,Because she was contagious.
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1144.75,1145.316,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1145.316,1147.618,So she was otherwise qualified.
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1147.618,1151.237,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1151.237,1151.62,Why not?
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1151.62,1154.939,Because the exclusion was the exclusion from the classroom.
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1155.657,1157.69,"Well, what other reason was she excluded from the classroom?"
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1157.69,1158.759,--Because of her contagiousness.
1986.85-1277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1159.592,1162.961,"That's what I... well, that makes her otherwise qualified."
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1166.663,1169.698,"Forgive me, I think I misunderstood."
1986.85-1277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1181.958,1191.647,"Mr. Fried, suppose someone has an accident, is burned, and becomes hideously disfigured."
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1209.608,1212.56,"I believe that is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1218.131,1218.964,"Well, they do."
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1228.403,1241.06,"In regard to irrational reasons for excluded, handicapped reasons, I hope that our argument would say that those are not sufficient reasons, and they constitute discrimination."
1986.85-1277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1241.444,1245.298,"Well, what about the person who's just disfigured as a result of a previous injury?"
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1245.298,1259.791,"--In our view, that person is not handicapped because, to quote the statute, that person is not impaired in respect to a major life activity, except by virtue of the exclusion."
1986.85-1277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.874,1264.409,"What do we do about the regulations, then?"
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1266.361,1275.467,"That particular phrase in the regulation, in our view, exceeds the purpose and the language of the statute, Your Honor."
1986.85-1277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1275.467,1278.668,You don't even think it's a reasonable reading of the statute?
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1278.668,1281.37,We think it's an incorrect reading of the statute.
1986.85-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.345,1295.297,"Mr. Fried, what about a person who loses one arm."
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1304.32,1307.188,Such a person is... would clearly be considered handicapped.
1986.85-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.188,1307.771,Why?
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1307.771,1314.342,"Because there are some life activities, if I may traverse the assumption--"
1986.85-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1314.342,1319.678,"Some of these people do magnificent achievement, and are able to do things that everyone else can do."
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1324.899,1326.599,--I don't believe so.
1986.85-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.521,1337.54,Major life activities?
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1337.54,1338.873,I believe so.
1986.85-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1338.873,1341.659,But employment is not one of them?
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1341.659,1346.163,"Well, employment certainly is one of them."
1986.85-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1367.291,1372.177,"Well, what if the parents of the children wouldn't let the children enter the classroom because they were afraid of contracting the disease?"
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1375.629,1384.318,"Well, that... it would certainly interfere with it."
1986.85-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1386.252,1388.304,"You would have to have some pupils in order to be able to teach, I suppose."
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1388.304,1393.841,"--If I may, I'd wish to reserve the balance of the time for Mr. Hayes' rebuttal."
1986.85-1277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1393.841,1412.921,"Mr. Fried, may I inquire before you sit down about the last part of the section defining handicapped individual, which says someone, a person with an impairment, who is regarded as having an impairment is a handicapped person."
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1415.973,1418.991,"That sweeps no more broadly than the term, impairment."
1986.85-1277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1429.314,1431.633,Or who is regarded as having such.
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1431.633,1436.953,--Then you are regarded as not being able to engage in a major life activity.
1986.85-1277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1453.046,1465.854,"And you don't think that if the school board thought that one manifestation of tuberculosis was contagiousness, and because of the tuberculosis, which they regarded as her impairment, that that puts her under the act?"
1986.85-1277,1,18942,charles_fried,,1465.854,1471.008,"--No, I don't think so, Justice O'Connor, because tuberculosis is not the impairment."
1986.85-1277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1497.341,1499.777,"Thank you, General Fried."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,1501.327,1503.762,Thank you.
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1538.168,1539.854,That's not quite true.
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,1545.841,1548.71,--Justice Scalia--
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1548.71,1570.707,"As I understood both arguments, if the reason for the firing is that the person is not able to teach because they're ill now and then, or something of that sort, a person with tuberculosis would be covered, just as a person with any other disease that causes impairment would be covered."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,1580.479,1594.703,"--Justice Scalia, if I can refer to the first question presented on review, which was presented in the cert petition of the school board: Whether the contagious, infectious disease of tuberculosis constitutes a handicap within the meaning of Section 504."
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1612.748,1616.367,"Well, I think everybody agrees on the point, as you've... as you've just put it."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,1625.555,1628.59,The question as originally presented was a per se question.
1986.85-1277,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1684.76,1694.866,"Well, Mr. Rahdert, on that first point for a moment, as I understand it, the Eleventh Circuit held that all people with tuberculosis are handicapped."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,1698.668,1717.029,"Justice O'Connor, as I read the Eleventh Circuit opinion, and I will concede that there are... there are some loose dicta preceding their actual holding... they are saying that someone who is afflicted with infectious, contagious tuberculosis, such as Mrs. Arline, can be covered because that--"
1986.85-1277,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1717.029,1718.331,"Well, let me phrase it another way."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,1724.652,1726.921,--I certainly agree with that proposition.
1986.85-1277,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1729.206,1734.175,"And if the Eleventh Circuit meant something broader than that, they were wrong."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,1734.175,1740.245,"If that's the reading of the Eleventh Circuit opinion, it certainly stands to be clarified."
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.164,1771.55,"Mr. Rahdert, maybe there's not as much agreement on the first question as I thought."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,1784.96,1798.85,"--I interpret it... and if you will read the petitioners' initial brief, the petitioner initially argues that it can never constitute a handicap, because Congress meant to exclude all contagious diseases from the coverage of 504."
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1909.338,1919.545,"Suppose somebody, an employer, is superstitious, and thinks that left handed people are unlucky, and chooses not to hire left handed people."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,1920.462,1926.216,"As a matter of fact, left handedness has been ruled in the lower courts not to be a handicap."
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.216,1927.318,"Now, that's pretty irrational, isn't it?"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,1927.318,1933.472,"It's an irrational consideration, but it's not a consideration of a condition of impairment."
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1933.472,1936.59,"Ah, that's exactly what's being argued here."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,1946.713,1951.683,"Justice Scalia, certainly the act does not reach all irrational decisions."
1986.85-1277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1988.421,2003.514,"Mr. Rahdert, the Government, as I understand it, contends that the handicapped act, one way or the other, was not intended to reach what they describe as the web of local and state regulations governing communicable diseases."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2024.094,2028.082,I think the act is clear.
1986.85-1277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.123,2079.929,"But does that bring each individual person who is perhaps quarantined in some way by the local governments, does that bring her into Federal court for a case-by-case determination under this act?"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2079.929,2084.751,"If there were discrimination, it would be subject to review in the courts."
1986.85-1277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.155,2099.928,"Well, supposing someone had scarlet fever, if people still get scarlet fever anymore, and they're quarantined for three weeks or something like that."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2102.63,2110.867,"Your Honor, that would depend on the medical facts pertaining to that impairment, whether it fits within the three-part criteria."
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.319,2118.354,The mere fact that it's contagious would not cause it to be a handicap?
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2118.354,2128.079,"Contagion alone is not a self-defining, an automatic definition of handicapped."
1986.85-1277,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.51,2170.719,"Well, if a discharge or termination is by reason of the contagion, which isn't itself a handicap, why... why is there coverage?"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2170.719,2180.559,"--Justice White, we suggest that a decision based on contagion is not going to be made abstractly, or isolated from the underlying impairment."
1986.85-1277,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.757,2214.148,"Well, I take it, if you find the person who has tuberculosis, but there's no... the person is just a carrier."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2215.948,2217.767,--If I can--
1986.85-1277,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2217.767,2219.469,"--but she's contagious, or he's contagious."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2219.469,2223.171,--If I can respond to that on the specifics of tuberculosis.
1986.85-1277,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.848,2237.964,Yes.
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2240.132,2248.655,"The impairment would be a respiratory system dysfunction, which is specifically defined under the regulations."
1986.85-1277,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.655,2257.225,"So anyone who has... any contagious person who can transmit person, you say, is a handicapped person?"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2257.225,2260.693,It's a serious impairment when it reaches the contagiousness stage.
1986.85-1277,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2283.792,2295.766,"Well, what about a different disease where the person is not handicapped, not impaired, but is a carrier?"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2295.766,2305.539,"With respect to a different disease, it would depend on the medical facts of that disease, as well as how that person is regarded."
1986.85-1277,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2305.539,2307.658,"Yes, assuming the person is not physically impaired."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2307.658,2316.429,"It still is a fact question, first as to coverage, whether the person is regarded in some manner as being impaired."
1986.85-1277,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.904,2356.954,0 xxx.
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2356.954,2359.423,Justice White--
1986.85-1277,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2359.423,2361.458,Which I thought you said awhile ago.
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2361.458,2371.481,"--I would suggest that contagion itself is not a handicap, but the underlying impairment to which it is inextricably bound, could be a handicap."
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2371.481,2373.516,What's the impairment?
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2375.468,2376.152,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2376.152,2379.587,Why isn't the impairment the consequences of tuberculosis?
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2379.587,2383.122,The impairment is defined in terms of--
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.122,2385.241,"In other words, you have three things."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2407.42,2412.641,--The point... I agree with you that impairment has consequences.
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.431,2453.135,Is the impairment due to the difficulty in breathing or to whatever other--
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2453.135,2453.718,--Certainly.
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2453.718,2454.501,--physical difficulty there is?
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2460.205,2460.739,That's right.
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2460.739,2463.924,--which produces impairment and also produces contagion.
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2474.881,2475.415,I would--
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.415,2478.183,"And it can produce contagion without impairment, or impairment without contagion."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2478.183,2482.837,--I would submit that the impairment is tuberculosis.
1986.85-1277,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2497.664,2501.366,"Well, what about if it's in remission?"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2501.366,2514.607,"If the tuberculosis were in remission and not contagiousness, coverage would depend on part two, which is history, and part three, how that person is regarded."
1986.85-1277,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2617.907,2629.049,"Mr. Rahdert, do you intend to explain how someone who is actively contagious with an impairment of tuberculosis can be otherwise qualified to teach small children?"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2629.049,2635.969,"I intend to present that to the District Court, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1277,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2656.715,2665.821,"If someone is actively contagious with tuberculosis, how can that person be otherwise qualified to teach small children?"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2665.821,2675.594,"--We would not contend for a moment, Justice O'Connor, that an actively contagious person... tuberculosis sufferer should be in a classroom."
1986.85-1277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2729.395,2730.68,When was the trial?
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2730.68,2732.549,The trial was in 1983.
1986.85-1277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2732.549,2736.001,And when was Mrs. Arline discharged or suspended?
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2736.001,2738.453,"At the end of the school year, 1979, I believe."
1986.85-1277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2738.453,2747.809,"Well, do you think that's terribly relevant that she was found not contagious in 1983 when the question is whether it was a discriminatory discharge in 1979?"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2747.809,2766.603,"I think the relevant question would be, was her contagion revealed in I believe November of 1978 under control at the time that her future in her career as a teacher was being weighed and determined."
1986.85-1277,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2781.03,2784.648,"Well, do you think accommodation requires finding another job for the person?"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2787.6,2798.158,"--I think accommodation primarily refers... and whether she's otherwise qualified, it's essentially the same question... refers to medical condition primarily."
1986.85-1277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2847.305,2856.78,"Well, are you suggesting that one form of accommodation that the statute might require was that even if she were contagious, she could continue to teach elementary school children?"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2856.78,2857.246,--Not at all.
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2918.169,2930.209,"Excuse me, before you go on, Mr. Rahdert, that fact-bound question would become a Federal question in every cases, if your argument's right, correct?"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2941.284,2967.751,"--Justice Scalia, I don't think it would be that severe, because if proper medical procedures were followed... we don't have a record of that precision in this case... I would suggest that following state health guidelines, as the state health guidelines are constituted would not in any manner constitute discrimination."
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2967.751,2974.338,"Well, I can think of a lot of, you know, nice questions that can be raised about the remedies you suggest."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,2994.485,3003.091,"Justice Scalia, the questions you raise, first of all, there are instantaneous testing methods for tuberculosis."
1986.85-1277,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3084.161,3093.934,"Well, Mr. Rahdert, that is what was asserted to have happened here with the State public health officer, who said she wasn't... she shouldn't be allowed in the classroom."
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,3093.934,3105.456,"Justice O'Connor, it's not clear on this record whether the state officer said, at this time; whether she said, this lady should be terminated completely for all times."
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3210.659,3211.525,What about just substantial ugliness?
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,3236.224,3244.496,The regulations answer that question in terms of... defining an impairment as a medical deficiency.
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3252.066,3255.887,Now how do you get that from the statute?
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,3255.887,3257.387,"From the regulations, Your Honor."
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3257.387,3260.006,"Well, where do the regulations get it from the statute?"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,3260.006,3266.576,"The regulations get it from a substantial impairment of a major life activity, of--"
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3266.576,3275.063,"But if a major life activity is associating with other people, and people shun you because... I don't know why--"
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,3275.063,3277.698,--It would have to be--
1986.85-1277,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3277.698,3283.518,--ugliness produced by burns is any different from people shunning you just because of run-of-the-mill homeliness.
1986.85-1277,2,25963,george_k_rahdert,,3283.518,3286.47,"--To just answer this question, it would be an impairment."
1986.85-1277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3312.852,3314.121,"Thank you, Mr. Rahdert."
1986.85-1277,3,17714,brian_t_hayes,,3317.989,3319.473,"Yes, sir, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1277,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3348.508,3350.294,What about the person in this case?
1986.85-1277,3,17714,brian_t_hayes,,3350.294,3353.496,"--Well, this is a situation--"
1986.85-1277,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3353.496,3355.614,Did this person have a handicap?
1986.85-1277,3,17714,brian_t_hayes,,3355.614,3361.518,"--If she had a handicap, Justice White, it would only be on the basis of a past record--"
1986.85-1277,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3361.518,3368.356,"Well, then, you... I take it the Solicitor General said that this person was a handicapped person."
1986.85-1277,3,17714,brian_t_hayes,,3368.356,3369.022,--Yes.
1986.85-1277,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3369.022,3370.089,You don't agree with that?
1986.85-1277,3,17714,brian_t_hayes,,3370.089,3370.641,Yes.
1986.85-1277,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.791,3372.158,Yes what?
1986.85-1277,3,17714,brian_t_hayes,,3372.158,3384.848,"--We suggest, Justice White, that she can be... for purposes of this argument, she can be considered handicapped, that is, get by the threshold question, so we can explore then the question of, solely by reason of, and the question of, otherwise qualified."
1986.85-1277,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3384.848,3386.3,"I know she can be, but is she?"
1986.85-1277,3,17714,brian_t_hayes,,3386.3,3386.85,No.
1986.85-1277,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3386.85,3388.252,Is she handicapped?
1986.85-1277,3,17714,brian_t_hayes,,3388.252,3391.971,"I don't think, as a matter of fact, there's any record that she was impaired in any way."
1986.85-1277,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3395.537,3396.321,The statute doesn't require--
1986.85-1277,3,17714,brian_t_hayes,,3396.321,3396.823,I understand that.
1986.85-1277,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3396.823,3398.206,--It just requires that she have a record.
1986.85-1277,3,17714,brian_t_hayes,,3402.175,3408.714,"I concur, the petitioners concur 100 percent with the Solicitor General, who says, those regulations, to that extent--"

1986.85-1277,3,17714,brian_t_hayes,,3412.78,3414.882,"--She had a record of handicap; there's no question about it, Justice Scalia."
