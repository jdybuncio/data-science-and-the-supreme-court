2018.18-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.48,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-431, United States versus Davis. Mr. Feigin."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,6.48,52.84,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In order to render Section 940 -- 924(c)(3)(B) unconstitutional, Respondents need to show that the only plausible construction is one in which a defendant's guilt or innocence hinges on a judge's imagination about how an ordinary defendant might act rather than a jury's finding about how a particular defendant acted. That's a very unusual way to draw a line between criminal and non-criminal conduct in the context of a jury trial, and I don't think lower courts would readily have accepted it if Section 924(c) were the only or the first context to present a choice between a categorical approach and a circumstance-specific one. The operative language of the statute --"
2018.18-431,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,52.84,58.2,"Mr. Feigin, what do you think Congress intended in 1986?"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,58.2,63.16,I -- I think Congress in 1986 probably didn't focus on this question --
2018.18-431,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,63.16,63.48,I -- I --
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,63.48,64.04,-- particularly heavily.
2018.18-431,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,64.04,65.52,-- I understand it didn't.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,65.52,68.04,But I think if Congress had thought about it -- JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,68.04,68.28,No?
2018.18-431,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,68.28,98.44,"I didn't ask ""had,"" because that's rewriting their intent. Given the circumstances in 1986, that 16(b) had been read in the categorical approach, that they adopted it for the Bail Reform Act, and you're not challenging that that's a categorical approach, that for decades you have been saying that 16(b) is better read as the categorical approach, what do you think Congress intended in 1986?"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,98.44,99.88,"Well, a couple of points, Your Honor."
2018.18-431,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,100.2,103.32,Without reference to our later holding.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,103.32,103.56,Yeah.
2018.18-431,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,132.04,133.4,"Well, you thought for --"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,133.4,134.52,-- trafficking crime.
2018.18-431,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,134.52,143.04,-- over -- you thought for a very long time that the language was best read as applying the categorical approach?
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,143.04,192.48,"Well, Your Honor, so, as far as the government's role in this, after a few fits and starts, there were briefs we filed that urged a circumstance-specific approach. And I'd also note the Sentencing Commission read the language in a circumstance-specific way from 1987 to 1989. After a few fits and starts, we settled into the categorical approach because that's where courts seemed to be going, particularly after the ACCA's residual clause and the rest of the Armed Career Criminal Act were enacted, and because it appeared to be workable, it appeared to be constitutional. Now I know you didn't want me to reference this Court's decisions, but after Dimaya and Johnson, it's clear that it is neither workable nor constitutional, so we've gone back and taken a fresh look. And I think if you take a fresh look at the statute, you'll see that it's better read or at least reasonably read, as the canon of constitutional avoidance would demand, to have a circumstance-specific approach."
2018.18-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,192.48,193.16,But the case --
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,193.16,194.0,The operative --
2018.18-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,194.0,200.56,"-- this case was not adjudicated on a circumstance-specific approach, right?"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,200.56,201.64,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2018.18-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,202.28,206.48,So you -- you would have to have at least a redoing of the trial?
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,206.48,225.6,"Well, Your Honor, we think that the error could be found harmless, but we would be -- if the Court doesn't agree with us on that, it could send it back to the court of appeals and possibly there could be a retrial. But, if you -- if you look at the operative language of the statute here, it clearly uses the term ""crime of violence"" in a context-specific way."
2018.18-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,255.2,265.2,"Well, when -- if we accepted your -- your theory, who -- you say it would have to be a jury finding."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,280.12,286.36,"So the use of a firearm could be a factor, but it couldn't be the only factor that renders a crime violent."
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,370.52,404.6,"Mr. Feigin, looking at the language of (c)(3), the word ""offense"" is in a prefatory clause before (A) and (B). And as I understand the government's position, (A), we will continue to read ""offense"" to mean the offense charged on the books and look at the elements. But, with respect to (B), you'd like us to look at the facts and treat the word ""offense"" there to mean what did the defendant actually do. We don't normally read prefatory language to mean two different things in two clauses that follow."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,422.24,446.2,"Well, Your Honor, I think we are giving it a single construction, and let me explain why. First of all, the term ""offense"" has always been understood, particularly if you look at this Court's double jeopardy jurisprudence, which interprets the term ""offense"" as the framers used it, to mean transgression of a law, and that encompasses both the acts that the defendant committed and the elements of the statute that the defendant violated."
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,477.12,481.0,"I -- I -- I'm -- I'm sorry, we're running a little far afield for me."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,483.6,483.8,Sure.
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,483.8,490.68,"As I understand it, in (A), you would have us read ""offense"" to mean the offense of -- that's charged on the books."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,499.32,500.08,"Yes, Your Honor --"
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,500.08,500.2,Okay.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,500.2,501.04,-- but if I can qualify that?
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,501.04,501.16,All right.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,502.68,502.8,Okay.
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,502.8,504.28,-- you can qualify it in a minute.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,504.28,504.6,Okay.
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,504.6,506.08,But we agree -- we agree on that much?
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,506.08,508.08,"Well, let me just -- let me just make one --"
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,508.08,509.44,"No, we can't agree on that much?"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,509.44,510.76,I would just make one thing clear.
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,524.36,531.52,"I guess I'm not tracking you at all. As I understand in (A), we would look at the offense on the books."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,565.0,572.12,"Well, Your Honor, I guess -- I guess my answer to you is that I don't think we are giving that same word two different constructions."
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,576.48,577.72,Let's not -- let's not -- let's just stick --
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,577.72,579.0,-- how -- how the term has been understood to work both ways.
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,579.0,581.0,"Help me where I am, okay?"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,581.0,581.28,Okay.
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,581.28,583.56,"I'm on this statute, all right?"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,583.56,587.64,"So let me -- so ""offense"" means a transgression of a law."
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,606.76,607.2,"Well, in double jeopardy --"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,607.2,607.88,-- adopted that same approach in Hayes.
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,607.88,610.4,-- in Blockburger -- and I -- I'll let you go in a second.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,624.6,624.76,Well --
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,624.76,626.12,So I don't -- I'm not sure that helps me.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,628.12,630.88,"So, Your Honor, Blockburger is only one part of the double jeopardy test."
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,638.4,638.48,"Uh-huh, uh-huh."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,638.48,638.92,But the way in which we're --
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,638.92,640.12,But we're not talking about that here.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,642.32,643.68,So if we talk about -- if we talk about --
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,643.68,644.28,It's the same crime.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,644.28,651.84,"-- a transgression of the law, I think it's perfectly natural to talk about both the elements and the particular way in which it was committed."
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,688.8,689.2,Off you go.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,690.0,693.6,"Your Honor, I'm happy to take further questions if I haven't --"
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,693.6,694.4,"Well, Mr. Feigin --"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,694.4,694.88,"-- satisfied you, but --"
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,694.88,766.6,"-- can I -- can I ask you some further questions about the language of the statute? And I guess I want to do it by comparing it to this bill that's currently pending in Congress which is meant to change this provision in order to make it fact-specific. And so this bill, rather than says -- rather than saying an -- an -- an offense that by its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used, instead says an offense that by -- excuse me, an offense that based on the facts underlying the offense -- so they substitute ""by its nature"" for ""based on the facts underlying the offense"" -- and then they change the tense and they say involved a substantial risk that force may have been used, right? So ""by its nature"" versus ""based on the facts"" and changing the tense to make it clear that what we're looking at is something that has occurred and that we're able, actually, to make a fact-specific determination about it. Now that's the way you would write a provision of the kind that you want."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,790.52,804.8,"Well, Your Honor, just as a prefatory matter, the first thing I'd say is if that language is clear to you, I think that's another answer to Justice Gorsuch's question, because even that clarifying construction that Congress might be considering also uses offense to --"
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,804.8,805.44,That -- that language --
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,805.44,807.04,-- have an elements clause portion --
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,807.04,814.68,"-- in its -- in -- in that particular portion, which it tried to solve, yes."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,814.68,822.6,"Now -- now, to your -- well, so I'd just point out that that is another place in which everyone agrees that ""offense"" could be used in -- in both ways. But --"
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,822.6,826.28,"Yeah, you're not answering Justice Gorsuch's question anymore, Mr. Feigin."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,826.28,831.2,"Fair enough, Your Honor. To go to your question, I think that language is clearer."
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,897.76,898.56,"Well, that's because --"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,898.56,898.88,-- the current version --
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,898.88,899.48,-- you prefaced it --
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,899.48,901.36,-- of Section 924(c)(3)(B).
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,901.36,901.64,"-- with the word ""situation""."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,926.16,926.64,Well --
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,926.64,929.16,"I mean, tell me how that's fact-specific."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,929.16,930.04,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- I would --"
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,930.04,930.8,Murder by its nature --
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,930.8,931.6,-- I guess I would say --
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,931.6,935.04,"-- robbery by its nature, burglary by its nature?"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,935.04,938.72,"So let me start with ""by its nature"" and I -- I would like to get back to offense."
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,960.76,960.88,Yeah.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,970.0,977.6,"Well, Your Honor, then I would want to know whether you were talking about murder in the abstract or a particular murder."
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,977.6,981.36,But I'm -- I'm just repeating the language of the statute with a particular offense.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,982.84,985.56,"Well, Your Honor, that's not how we interpret ""offense"" here."
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,992.4,993.52,"Well, that goes back --"
2018.18-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,993.52,994.28,"Well, that's the --"
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,994.28,1001.84,"-- to Justice Gorsuch's example, because you clearly can't mean it that way, because then Section (a) would be incoherent."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1001.84,1006.76,"Your Honor, that's exactly the interpretation the Court gave in Hayes, if I could just explain that for a second."
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1042.24,1050.4,"But -- but, Mr. Feigin, you're pointing to a statute where there was something else in addition to the language that's in this provision."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1074.88,1082.24,"Well, Your Honor, if you're with me -- if that is the question you're now raising, then we've gotten past offense that is a felony."
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1086.84,1088.52,"Well, it could if there's other language --"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1088.52,1090.88,-- and a circumstance-specific approach.
2018.18-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1090.88,1091.88,-- that suggests that.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1091.88,1114.2,"And then -- and then we're just on the question of whether Section 924(c)(3)(B), read in light of the canon of constitutional avoidance, can reasonably be read to invoke a circumstance-specific approach. And I think ""by its nature"" there does both what I said about the offense offender and also captures the idea of essentially the word ""otherwise""."
2018.18-431,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1128.08,1128.92,"Mr. Feigin, if I --"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1128.92,1129.16,Yeah.
2018.18-431,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1129.4,1129.64,Oh.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1136.76,1144.08,"I'm sorry, Justice Alito. As I was saying earlier, it can't just be that the firearm itself creates the risk."
2018.18-431,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1150.2,1157.32,"No, no, no. So I'm interested in the practical implications of our decision in this case."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1165.6,1184.56,"Well, Your Honor, very few of them have their own subsection-specific definition of ""crime of violence."" So I think the Court's decision here is going to certainly -- would certainly -- if the Court held that the ordinary case categorical approach applies, would certainly invalidate Section 924(c)(3)(B)."
2018.18-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1245.8,1246.0,"Well, you keep --"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1246.0,1249.36,-- predicates actually can serve as Section 924(c) predicates.
2018.18-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1249.36,1255.16,"The government in all of these cases keeps upping the ante, even though they continue to lose hands."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1276.2,1282.28,"Well, Your Honor, the only federal statute I think we would see next, if it came up, is the Bail Reform Act."
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1302.16,1302.28,Well --
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1302.28,1304.68,-- the entire U.S. attorney community and the Department of Justice.
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1304.68,1323.44,"-- on that -- on that, what do you say to your friend's argument on the other side that, while resentencing may be required for a large number of persons, the likelihood of significant changes in prison sentences is low, given that this is usually thrown in as an additional charge, one among many stacked on top of others?"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1323.44,1326.12,"Well, I -- I don't think that's correct, Your Honor."
2018.18-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1351.92,1367.48,"But, just to be clear, do we have any -- we have this very impressionistic argument, you tell us the end of the world is near, or maybe now, after the Chief Justice, it's not quite so close as we thought, and then your friend's going to argue, well, it's not going to really change much at all."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1378.4,1385.72,"Well, fortunately, Your Honor, this -- we haven't faced this amount of collateral litigation yet because most of those cases are on hold."
2018.18-431,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1415.92,1416.64,I -- I thought one of your --
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1416.64,1417.12,So I'm not --
2018.18-431,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1417.12,1424.92,-- excuse me -- one of your points was that this was going to significantly lower the sentences of many violent criminals.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1424.92,1433.36,So there are going to be cases in which we can't -- that that is -- there are going to be cases we cannot get under 924(c)(3)(A).
2018.18-431,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1440.36,1440.68,Right.
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1441.08,1442.52,-- probably lower sentences.
2018.18-431,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1442.52,1464.44,"-- and I think the length of sentences is one of the concerns you have to confront squarely here when dealing with 924(c), and so your response to that and what Congress was thinking about in 1986 with respect to why they wanted -- why Congress wanted long sentences for these kind of violent crimes?"
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1464.44,1533.52,"Well, I think it is crystal-clear in the legislative history that Congress wanted additional -- and, frankly, in the text of the statute, that Congress wanted additional terms on top of the sentences that the defendants would receive for any underlying crime of violence that was also charged for the 924(c) offense. And I think what Respondents' approach here would do is essentially eradicate that judgment, whereas adopting our approach, the only defendants who are going to -- eradicate their judgment as to anyone who would have fallen under 924(c)(3)(B), and I don't think that's the right approach to take when 924(c)(3)(B) can at least plausibly be read to have a circumstance-specific approach. Whereas, under a circumstance-specific approach, the only defendants who are going to be able to obtain relief are the ones who actually committed their crimes nonviolently. I think that is exactly the result that Congress would have wanted, had it understood, as the canon of constitutional avoidance presumes, that its choice of an ordinary case categorical approach, had it even imagined one in 1986, would be held unconstitutional. If I could reserve --"
2018.18-431,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1533.52,1533.8,Mister --
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1533.8,1535.8,"-- the balance -- I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.18-431,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1535.8,1536.8,"No, no, go ahead."
2018.18-431,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1536.8,1538.04,If I could reserve the balance of my time.
2018.18-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1538.04,1545.84,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Beck."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1545.84,1565.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. Your Honors, this case is about following the text of a statute where it leads and, when necessary, requiring Congress to speak more clearly on what is prohibited. And there are three reasons why the 924(c) residual clause should suffer the same fate as Section 16(b)."
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1583.88,1590.88,"Those cases -- those cases were concerned about the jury, protecting the right of the jury to find the facts."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1605.0,1610.4,"Your Honor, the constitutional concern is absent in this case. Of course, there may be --"
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1610.4,1618.0,"And that -- and you agree with me that that concern undergirded Taylor, it undergirded Johnson, it undergirded Dimaya?"
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1618.0,1623.84,I disagree with you that that played a central role in the decision in Taylor versus United States.
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1625.48,1633.04,It's specifically identified -- it's specifically identified in Taylor as a concern on page 601 of the opinion --
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1633.04,1633.52,Yes.
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1633.52,1638.08,-- where the Court talks about abridging the right to a jury trial.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1638.08,1644.24,"And, Your Honor, my reading of that portion of Taylor is it's raising a question of judicial economy."
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1648.24,1648.52,Right.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1648.52,1655.96,"And it's simply raising the question, are we now going to be faced with the problem of every defendant appealing saying they were denied a jury trial?"
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1655.96,1681.4,"And I -- I raise this because I think the prior cases interpreted language in a way to avoid a constitutional problem, namely, the Sixth Amendment problem when you're focusing on prior convictions, but that reason to stretch the language in one direction is not -- not present here as I see it. This is -- the jury was all -- the -- all those cases were about the jury, and the jury would be able to find the facts here."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1681.4,1684.4,"And, Your Honor, I want to be able to answer your question clearly."
2018.18-431,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1707.48,1709.88,"If there are other interests, why don't you list them."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1714.72,1715.24,"Your Honor, Tay --"
2018.18-431,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1715.24,1719.04,-- the categorical approach endorsed?
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1719.04,1735.0,"Your Honor, Taylor began with the text, then went to the history, and then noted practical and workability concerns. But Leocal versus Ashcroft in 2004 didn't discuss practical or constitutional concerns at all."
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1750.96,1753.68,"Well, let me ask this question about the text."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1803.12,1808.8,"And, Your Honor, I'm -- I'm aware of the presumption of constitutionality, but I'm not sure --"
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1808.8,1811.24,I'm not talking about the presumption of constitutionality.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1815.96,1818.96,I think that's relevant when construing a statute.
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1822.84,1830.56,"So, if the language can be read in the workable way as opposed to the way that's completely unworkable, we would choose the way that's workable."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1836.76,1842.32,"Your Honor, we -- we must begin with the text when trying to determine what Congress meant."
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1857.72,1864.04,"Well, let me ask you this textual question then, and look -- this is looking at subsection (B)."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1886.64,1889.2,"I disagree under this language, Your Honor."
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1889.2,1896.68,So what would the -- what does the Court look to besides the elements to determine what is the -- the typical case?
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1896.68,1913.76,"Well, as this language been -- has been construed, this Court would imagine the crime's imagined ordinary case, and we get there from this Court's opinion in James versus United States, noting the dual inherently probabilistic language that's present here."
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1913.76,1914.56,"Yeah, okay."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1933.0,1944.76,"You think of how burglary is often or ordinarily or typically committed, and you then ask the question is -- what is the risk associated with that."
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1944.76,1945.36,Okay.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1945.96,1947.96,Now that's if it's constitutional.
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1947.96,1951.68,-- what is typically done in a burglary beyond the elements of burglary?
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,1951.68,1956.56,The problem with this is we can't answer that question.
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1969.56,1970.44,"Well, I understand --"
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1970.44,1971.32,Why is it impossible?
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1971.32,1975.52,"-- that, but if I could just -- I'm sorry, Justice Breyer, go ahead, please."
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1975.52,1977.48,Go.
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1978.8,2011.32,"If -- if you can't tell me what beyond the elements of burglary one would take into account under (B) in determining the typical burglary, I think that what we're talking about there under your categorical approach is the risk that's inherent in the elements of burglary. And if that's the case, why is there no reference to elements in (B) when there is a reference to elements in -- in (A)? Doesn't that tell you we want to look at something other than merely the elements of the offense?"
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2011.32,2015.0,"I would agree, Your Honor, but not conduct."
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2037.76,2038.76,I -- I understand that.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2053.92,2054.12,Because --
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2054.12,2058.8,"Now I -- but let me tell you why not, and then you tell me why I'm wrong. (Laughter.)"
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2058.8,2099.64,"What we had in Johnson was a statute that said, in defining the relevant crime, burglary, which is sometimes violent; arson, probably a lot of violence; extortion, hardly ever violent; explosives, often violent; or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious risk, potential risk of physical injury. And it's that last phrase that the Court sort of, with Justice Scalia writing, threw up their hands in that context."
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2168.64,2180.16,"-- is there -- is there some absolute -- you know, is there some killing argument against it, which there may well be, which should tell me I'm really either alone or out of my mind or et cetera."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2181.16,2205.48,"I understand, Your Honor. One of the reasons we have the void for vagueness doctrine is to support the separation of powers by not delegating to judges and prosecutors the authority to define the contours of a criminal statute, particularly a criminal statute that takes sentencing discretion away from judges and imposes harsh mandatory minimums, in this case, 25 years."
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2205.48,2205.76,But the --
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2205.76,2206.96,But I want to tell you --
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2206.96,2207.84,Keep going.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2207.84,2209.92,I want to tell you why this is like Johnson.
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2237.0,2237.68,The risk -- the risk threshold --
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2237.68,2238.24,-- interpretation.
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2238.24,2271.24,"Wait, let me follow up for a second, because the words are ""substantial risk,"" okay? Substantial risk of physical force. So what the Court writes -- I'm not saying we should -- is, in clause A, it is -- it's an offense that is a felony, has an element, the use, attempted use, or threatened use to physical force, right? So we get the pre-sentence reports and we see what the average risk of those crimes is in terms of physical force, and then we say (B) means the same."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2298.4,2307.8,"Well, to address your proposed solution, Your Honor, at that point, we'd be delegating to United States Probation the authority to define this."
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2311.16,2320.68,"Well, they write the pre-sentence reports according to the facts and anybody who wants at trial as to any fact in respect to a pre-sentence report and have a jury to find it or the judge, if it's inappropriate, can do it."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2320.68,2323.76,And then we run into the same problem in Johnson and Dimaya.
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2331.88,2332.24,But it --
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2332.24,2333.72,-- because it's an unanswerable question.
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2333.72,2367.96,"But on -- in Johnson, we said -- we distinguished cases about prior convictions where you're looking at risk from this case and said, ""more importantly, almost all of the cited laws require gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages on a particular occasion."" So that was to say -- and then went on to say ""as a general matter, we do not doubt the constitutionality of those laws."" So why would a law that refers to substantial risk be unconstitutional when the Court in Johnson said that's not an issue?"
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2367.96,2370.56,"Well, it's certainly not always the case, Your Honor."
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2370.56,2372.2,But it's usually the case.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2375.44,2375.88,Yeah.
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2375.88,2376.96,-- of all those laws.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2376.96,2382.96,"Oh, no, I would agree with you that most of the time a jury is capable of making a risk assessment."
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2389.24,2389.6,Right.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2389.8,2389.88,Here --
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2389.88,2391.24,-- I take your point on that.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2397.0,2401.36,"A combination of fair notice and the support of separation of powers, Your Honor."
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2401.36,2417.12,"And hasn't -- Congress in 1986 was concerned about the enormous problem of gun violence, violent crimes committed with guns, which was, bad as it is now, extremely bad, worse, much worse, in 19 -- in the 1980s."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2417.12,2417.72,No question.
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2417.72,2426.2,"And every -- put everyone on notice, on notice, fair notice: If you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away for a long time."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2442.56,2446.28,"Well, if that's what the statute said, I would certainly agree with you, Your Honor."
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2469.24,2503.48,"Well, on the question of what Congress was thinking, maybe we could just take a -- a glimpse at what actually happened in this case, which is that the defendant conspired to commit and then committed a series of robberies of convenience stores, where they put a sawed-off shotgun to the head of a clerk and then robbed cigarettes. Now you really think Congress would say, well, that's not really a crime of violence?"
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2503.48,2521.48,"The defendants in this case are guilty of every offense you just described, and we're not challenging any of those convictions. The difference here today, if we were to win and remove one of the six counts that they were convicted under, is that either they would die in prison or be released as very old men."
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2521.48,2522.88,But that's not my question.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2529.52,2531.72,"As to the robbery, certainly, I would agree with you."
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2533.36,2537.48,"As to the conspiracy -- as to the conspiracy, they would say that's not a crime of violence?"
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2537.48,2541.52,"Congress has not spoken clearly on that question, not with the language it chose."
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2541.52,2543.48,Do you have any doubt what they would say?
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2543.48,2556.68,I certainly do have doubt about what -- whether Congress included -- intended to include conspiracy when it was thinking about traditionally violent crimes simply because conspiracy is an inchoate offense.
2018.18-431,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2556.68,2562.8,"Counsel, looking at what Congress actually wrote, in terms of canons of construction --"
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2562.8,2563.28,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.18-431,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2563.28,2579.6,"-- we sometimes consult, one we've heard about so far and talked a little bit about is the canon of constitutional avoidance, that this Court will attempt, when possible, sometimes, to avoid a construction that renders Congress's work null."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2579.6,2580.28,Yes.
2018.18-431,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2580.28,2606.96,"We also have, though, the canon of construction on the rule of lenity, that we don't typically construe statutes to be as grievous as they could possibly be read, and -- and for the notice problems that you've talked about and the separation of powers problems, if Congress wants to act more grievously, it needs to speak more clearly before it deprives a person of his liberty. Usually, those two canons point in the same direction."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2618.04,2620.52,"It's a difficult question to answer, Your Honor."
2018.18-431,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2637.96,2639.96,"Well, before we get to what makes sense --"
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2639.96,2640.4,Yeah.
2018.18-431,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2640.4,2643.24,-- we -- we hear a lot about what makes sense in this room. (Laughter.)
2018.18-431,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2643.24,2645.36,I'm curious about what the law is.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2645.36,2646.16,"Okay, okay."
2018.18-431,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2646.16,2660.28,"Have you done any examining of historical sources? You know, I don't know, Joseph Story, you know, a pretty good source; The Commentaries of the Constitution or Blackstone; something you could point me to in the -- that's law --"
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2660.28,2660.84,Okay.
2018.18-431,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2660.84,2666.16,"-- about how those two get reconciled? And if the answer's no, that's a perfectly fine answer."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2669.4,2671.24,"I'd like to start with no, but I would --"
2018.18-431,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2671.24,2671.56,Okay.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2671.56,2673.96,-- like to take another attempt at answering your question.
2018.18-431,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2676.16,2676.76,I -- all right.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2678.88,2679.16,Okay.
2018.18-431,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2679.16,2680.24,You'll -- you'll do -- you'll do better work elsewhere.
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2680.24,2689.28,"Well, I thought we had said the rule of lenity only kicks in after you've done all the other tools of statutory interpretation, which would include constitutional avoidance."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2689.28,2690.52,"And, Your Honor, that -- that --"
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2690.52,2693.24,I thought we said that many times.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2693.24,2697.12,I've read it inconsistently in -- in application there.
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2727.08,2749.76,"Well, can I come back to the question about the meaning of the word ""offense,"" which you addressed -- I'm sorry -- which Mr. Feigin addressed extensively earlier. Does that same problem exist under ACCA? And if it doesn't, are you --"
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2749.76,2750.52,Certainly.
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2750.52,2753.84,-- saying we should -- it does? The problem exists under ACCA?
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2753.84,2762.96,The -- the problem in the sense of the crime has to mean the same thing for purposes of both subsections because it has the same subject.
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2770.12,2770.32,All right.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2789.6,2793.12,"I think so, Your Honor, absolutely."
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2793.12,2795.2,"Well, could you just explain how that is?"
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2795.2,2795.92,Sure.
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2802.8,2809.4,"Well, I -- I thought -- I prefer if you can do it with the language. If you don't have the language in mind, then I'll just leave the question."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2809.4,2812.44,I -- I have the language. The same problem exists in both.
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2826.4,2844.16,"No, but what I'm getting at is this -- your argument that the provision here under the government's reading interprets the word ""offense"" to mean two different things, element at one point and facts at the other. The way ACCA is worded, that problem doesn't arise."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2858.4,2866.96,"We do have the same problem because what's modifying ""crime"" is not ""presents"" but ""involves"" conduct."
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2876.16,2882.28,So you don't think there's an important distinction in this respect between the language of this provision and the provision of ACCA?
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2882.28,2888.4,"Certainly not, Your Honor. And I think the plurality of this Court answered that question in Sessions versus Dimaya just last term."
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2888.4,2895.28,"So, if I don't think that there is that problem under ACCA, then I shouldn't think there is that problem under this provision?"
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2895.28,2896.76,"I -- I would agree with that, Your Honor."
2018.18-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2896.76,2898.16,"Okay, good."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2898.16,2925.4,"If we go back to 1984 when Congress created both Section 16 and for the first time narrowed the application of 924(c) from all felonies to just crimes of violence, there was -- they were conjoined with a cross-reference. At that time, even if we didn't know what Section 16 and Section 924(c) meant, we know Congress intended them to mean the same thing."
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2925.4,2926.36,But they changed it in '86.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2928.08,2930.8,"They removed the cross-reference, but what they did --"
2018.18-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2930.8,2932.44,So doesn't that defeat your whole point there?
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,2932.44,2935.64,"It does not, Your Honor, because they used the same language."
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3036.0,3042.08,Suppose you -- so this -- the basic question we're asked is the question of whether it's too vague.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,3049.24,3049.96,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3049.96,3062.0,"Well, so what -- what do -- what do I do if I think -- do you see these words here, ""a substantial risk that physical force against the person""? What they mean is the same risk of physical force as in (A)."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,3075.44,3076.16,Yeah.
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3076.16,3094.28,"-- see -- see -- see, if you -- if you were to do that, it would be very specific and it wouldn't really be like Johnson, because Johnson put a lot of weight on the fact that they have three examples which cut in -- four examples cutting in different directions and there are state crimes and suppose I just wrote that and said that hasn't been argued."
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,3094.28,3095.64,Here's -- here is the difference --
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3095.64,3099.36,"What -- what -- what would you do if you were -- unless you see some obvious problem, what is --"
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,3099.36,3103.64,"Here's the difference. Subsection (A) is asking the question, does it have an element of force?"
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3103.64,3103.96,Uh-huh.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,3103.96,3110.16,"Subsection (B) is asking a different question, what is the risk of force posed by the nature of the offense."
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3110.16,3110.56,Uh-huh.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,3110.56,3118.12,"Those are two very different questions, although I would agree with you that subsection (B) sweeps more broadly."
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3118.12,3120.84,Maybe that is -- maybe that's right.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,3120.84,3121.28,Yeah.
2018.18-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3121.28,3122.76,I'll think about it. Thank you.
2018.18-431,1,63119,brandon_e_beck,,3122.76,3126.04,I'd like to address the government's use of Nijhawan and Hayes.
2018.18-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3252.64,3256.76,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin, you have four minutes remaining."
2018.18-431,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3256.76,3331.08,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I just have, I think, four points. One is I think my friend agreed in a number of points that our burden is simply to show that this is a plausible interpretation of the statute. Second, I think it's helpful in that respect to think about whether this particular self-contained provision, if it were to have come before the Court as the first time anyone was ever urging a categorical approach, and a criminal defendant were coming before this Court and saying, no, you should apply the rule of lenity for me because I want a circumstance-specific approach. I understand that an ordinary defendant who commits commercial sex trafficking with a minor does so by threatening the minor with force, but that's not the way my crime was committed, and I want to prove that to a jury. And I were arguing the other side, I were arguing for the government that that didn't matter, it just matters what an ordinary defendant does, you have no right to show the jury what you did. I don't think anyone would think that that was a slam dunk case for the government that the court should apply an ordinary case categorical approach. Third, I think that shows why the rule of lenity shouldn't have any application here because it cuts both directions."
2018.18-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3345.64,3346.48,Mr. Feigin --
2018.18-431,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3346.48,3346.96,-- a string of --
2018.18-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3346.96,3347.48,Mr. Feigin --
2018.18-431,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3347.48,3347.92,Excuse me.
2018.18-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3347.92,3404.96,"-- the reason that you seem to be touting this reading is that it's going to expand -- has to be -- over the categorical approach the number of defendants that this statute now will apply to. Otherwise, you wouldn't be fighting so hard. If it was really a draw, and your brief sort of walks this line in saying there's no empirical evidence to support how large the difference is, but logically speaking, the use of a gun in the vast majority of cases -- I spot you that there's a few where this wouldn't happen -- is itself always going to provide a substantial risk of violence. So I -- I -- I'm not buying that there isn't lenity because, for a very large number of people under your reading, they're going to have this statute now applied to them."
2018.18-431,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3404.96,3405.8,"Well, Your Honor, let me --"
2018.18-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3405.8,3406.68,If we accept your reading.
2018.18-431,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3406.68,3408.64,Let me answer that in -- in two ways.
2018.18-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3512.92,3513.64,Mr. Feigin --
2018.18-431,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3513.64,3513.84,-- and --
2018.18-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3513.84,3536.88,"-- with all of those cases, nothing about our ruling will affect the discretion of district court judges if they choose to give the same sentence and even more, because, once a defendant opens up a sentence, a judge has the discretion to go up, down, or stay the same."
2018.18-431,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3536.88,3537.48,May I answer --
2018.18-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3537.48,3537.8,Sure.
2018.18-431,2,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3537.8,3542.92,"-- Mr. Chief Justice? Your Honor, it's not always going to be possible to impose the same sentence."
2018.18-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3566.88,3567.8,"Thank you, counsel."
