2009.08-103,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.26,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-103, Elsevier v. Muchnick."
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,6.528,8.743,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-103,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,43.417,46.525,"This is a lot harder case than Arbaugh, though."
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,54.289,61.738,"Well, Arbaugh relied heavily on the Zipes case, and the Zipes involved a statutory threshold condition much like the one here."
2009.08-103,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,98.443,105.407,"I think you are right that Arbaugh at least set forth a clear statement rule, but I think that's significant only going forward."
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,111.685,121.903,"Well, the Court did apply -- reiterate and apply the Arbaugh rule in the Rockwell case with respect to a provision that had predated Arbaugh, and nothing in Arbaugh said that."
2009.08-103,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,135.177,148.391,Do you agree with the -- with the government that it's mandatory for the district court but prohibited to the court of appeals?
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,177.5,183.576,"--Justice Ginsburg, we certainly agree with the government with respect to the court of appeals."
2009.08-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.53,335.505,"Can -- can I ask you, one of the points made by the amicus is that, if I recall it correctly, that what -- what Congress had in mind in phrasing it this way was to enable -- enable the party who had not gone to the Copyright Office to go after dismissal on jurisdictional grounds, and the implication is that if it were not held to be jurisdictional, there would be a merits dismissal because of the failure to have gone to the Copyright Office first."
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,340.532,344.486,--I don't understand the amicus to be making that argument.
2009.08-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.828,346.296,I don't--
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,346.296,357.541,"--the third -- the third sentence of 411(a), I think that's the principal argument she makes as to why this satisfies Arbaugh and we think, quite to the contrary, the third sentence of 411(a)--"
2009.08-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,357.541,360.29,"--No, I didn't -- I didn't think it related to the third sentence."
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,386.936,400.147,"--Your Honor, I think that the -- because of the way 411(a) is phrased, dismissals under 411(a), whether we are correct that it's not jurisdictional or whether they are correct that it is, I think ordinarily--"
2009.08-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,400.147,400.834,You would be--
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,400.834,402.019,--without prejudice--
2009.08-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.019,403.474,--You'd be able to come back anyway?
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,403.474,404.098,--Absolutely.
2009.08-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,404.098,405.018,That's what I thought.
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,405.018,406.051,That's the nature of this requirement.
2009.08-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.051,406.955,That's what I thought you'd say.
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,406.955,407.47,Yeah.
2009.08-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.47,408.422,Yeah.
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,408.422,412.091,With respect to the Arbaugh--
2009.08-103,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,412.091,414.939,"Would -- if the statute of limitations had run, could you still come back?"
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,414.939,421.98,"--The problem in this case, and really the reason why the settlement agreement has turned out the way it did is there is no effective--"
2009.08-103,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,421.98,424.323,"I mean, not -- not necessarily in this case, but in -- but in a typical case."
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,424.323,426.367,"--There is no effective statute of limitations in these cases, Your Honor."
2009.08-103,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,426.367,427.65,I said in a typical case.
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,427.65,428.274,Well--
2009.08-103,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,428.274,431.804,Or is it just--
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,431.804,445.783,"--In -- in a case where the infringement is the existence of something on the web, then there is no statute of limitations effectively, because the argument would be that the making available is an infringement."
2009.08-103,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,508.881,518.034,"Mr. Sims, it has been pointed out that you have taken inconsistent positions."
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,543.93,547.07,"--Your Honor, I don't think it's fair to say that we made that argument."
2009.08-103,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,553.331,553.924,The argument--
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,553.924,564.903,"--But I think it's -- I think it's different, because the issue in the district court was the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the settlement and there was an attack on the different valuation for unregistered claims."
2009.08-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.422,588.935,And -- and--
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,588.935,602.225,"But as -- but as the Court decision in that case said, there was no need to overrule Robinson or Smith because really what was going on there was the Court had been saying the rule was mandatory, and the additional language that was jurisdictional was loose language."
2009.08-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,617.219,626.386,"--Well, you shouldn't use loose language, especially when it's the same loose language, supposedly, that seems to have been used by all the courts of appeals and all the district courts."
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,626.386,627.681,Not all the courts--
2009.08-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.681,628.273,For years and years.
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,628.273,637.644,"--Your Honor, the first court of appeals which said that 411(a) said -- not held -- was jurisdictional was in 1990."
2009.08-103,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,720.423,730.823,--But still it's a statute and didn't this Court say in Bowles that a statutory qualification on the right to sue is generally jurisdictional?
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,730.823,733.292,--I don't think the Court said that.
2009.08-103,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,745.374,763.663,"But I thought they made a distinction to distinguish the other cases, the one -- I forgot -- the one involving Criminal Rule 33, on the ground, well, that's a court rule, but when Congress makes the qualification then it's jurisdictional."
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,763.663,766.883,--But this doesn't involve a time limit.
2009.08-103,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,784.638,789.684,"Well, if you are talking about the language, what about John R. Sand & Gravel?"
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,798.525,801.382,"I think not, Chief Justice Roberts."
2009.08-103,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,832.318,836.178,"No, that was -- that was a statute of limitations provision, right?"
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,838.175,844.671,"--Well, John R. Sand involved a special situation of suits against the government and considerations of sovereign immunity."
2009.08-103,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,844.671,847.467,I thought the Court said it was mandatory.
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,850.013,865.962,"Well, I think John R. Sand held that provision was jurisdictional, but I think the decision went off on -- on stare decisis, and the fact that the Court had, with respect to the Tucker Act and matters of suits against the government, taken a different position."
2009.08-103,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,901.323,904.977,We have forms for copyright infringement actions?
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,904.977,905.617,You do.
2009.08-103,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,908.647,909.443,Live and learn.
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,909.443,913.896,"And because they haven't changed very much in 70 years, you probably haven't spent much time with them."
2009.08-103,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,913.896,915.502,It's Form 19.
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,915.502,917.097,Yes.
2009.08-103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.121,968.32,Can I ask a sort of basic question I never understood about this case.
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,979.613,980.486,"Well, not -- not quite."
2009.08-103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,997.526,1002.885,"--But those were people who owned some registered copyrights, but had other works that were not -- had no registered copyrights."
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,1003.509,1004.401,I--
2009.08-103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1004.401,1007.431,Were there any of those people who had no -- no copyrights at all?
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,1007.431,1013.865,"--Well, they -- I don't know, Your Honor, whether the objectors had any registered works."
2009.08-103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1019.208,1020.159,But they had some registered works?
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,1020.159,1021.08,Yes.
2009.08-103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.08,1028.86,"You see, one of the -- one of the risks involved here is whether people who had no registered works are being adequately protected by this Class C settlement."
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,1028.86,1029.39,Yes.
2009.08-103,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.872,1033.418,And just to get the question on the table -- I don't want to take up much of your time.
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,1041.743,1045.132,--I don't think that has anything to do with the fairness of the settlement.
2009.08-103,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1057.91,1060.644,"And that -- that, certainly, would be open."
2009.08-103,0,20001,charles_s_sims,,1074.013,1074.855,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-103,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1080.774,1082.415,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1090.116,1092.191,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-103,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1131.412,1137.297,So your position is that the district court really should have dismissed this case at the outset?
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1137.297,1145.389,"--I think that, in the ordinary case, the district court should -- when -- when the defendant waives the requirement, which would be the rare case, when the defendant doesn't assert it."
2009.08-103,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1190.276,1191.497,Maybe this is the same question.
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1193.4,1196.87,"Yes, we are representing the interest of the Library of Congress."
2009.08-103,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1226.857,1236.462,"You were candid to say that this is in a hybrid category, that the government was taking an intermediate position."
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1253.954,1271.37,"I believe this Court has recognized that waiver doctrines in general are discretionary, and so, particularly in the area of res judicata, the Court has recognized in the Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm and Arizona v. California that the Court has some discretion to enforce res judicata on its own motion."
2009.08-103,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1271.37,1272.774,"Very, very limited."
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1284.834,1286.097,That's correct.
2009.08-103,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1326.629,1335.122,"Is your discussion of that, including in your response to Justice Ginsburg and in your brief, do you think that that's within the question presented, rephrased?"
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1335.122,1350.229,"I think it is fairly within the question of whether the rule is jurisdictional or not, I think, is -- also encompasses the question of how the rule should be enforced, assuming that it is non-jurisdictional, of what should happen in this case."
2009.08-103,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1380.779,1386.776,But how -- how would we get to hold what -- what you say is the law?
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1419.028,1421.73,"I don't think you have to get into it, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-103,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.214,1422.869,Which means we shouldn't.
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1424.278,1448.657,"--Well, that may be the case, but I think we are simply trying to -- trying to explain to the Court what we think how the rule should be applied in the district court, in the -- in the ordinary case, and then, in the rare case, this one, where the defendant has waived, and permitting the settlement to go forward, it wouldn't adversely affect the public interest that are normally in force here."
2009.08-103,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1448.657,1451.125,Do you have an example of the non-ordinary case?
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1466.244,1474.928,"I think that the -- that in general, the requirement would be considered waived if it's not raised before judgment."
2009.08-103,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1479.725,1481.971,So it's more -- so it's more or less jurisdictional after judgment?
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1481.971,1483.284,"No, I'm sorry."
2009.08-103,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1498.683,1500.306,"Well, that's normal, but not invariable."
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1500.306,1521.844,"--Well, I think that's the rule -- that's the rule that this Court has applied to constitutional rights with the plain error rule, and also, with respect to structural constitutional rights that might implicate other public interests, the general rule is that if the requirement has not been raised during the -- during the trial stages of the case, then it can't be enforced for the first time on appeal."
2009.08-103,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1521.844,1522.971,Unless it is plain error.
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1522.971,1536.4,"Unless it's plain error, and in this situation, if the plain error standard applied, or something even more -- even more heightened in the civil context, we can't think of a case in which registration requirements--"
2009.08-103,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1536.4,1538.412,It's pretty plain that the things haven't been registered.
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1551.55,1560.342,"--Well, I think those -- those circumstances would be true in most cases in which the -- for some reason, the requirement hadn't been reached at the trial stage."
2009.08-103,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1588.19,1592.531,"There really are, in our recent decisions, it seems to me, two different lines of authority."
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1612.148,1621.109,"--I think it's similar to a lot of language that's used in statutes of limitations, which are traditionally considered non-jurisdictional, that no statute -- no suit shall be instituted."
2009.08-103,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1655.393,1660.05,What about the congressional reaction to the Second Circuit's decision?
2009.08-103,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1689.428,1690.988,--I don't think so.
2009.08-103,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1717.146,1719.458,"Thank you, Ms. Anders."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,1735.485,1745.636,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: We will start with the statutory language as the Court has been discussing for the last half-hour.
2009.08-103,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1767.344,1767.937,"""Until""."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,1769.216,1769.812,--Until?
2009.08-103,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1769.812,1773.264,Until preregistration or registration has been made.
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,1773.264,1775.354,"That's correct, Justice Scalia, and that makes--"
2009.08-103,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.354,1776.169,That's our limitation period.
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,1776.169,1780.462,--That makes -- it's a -- it's a requirement that registration be made.
2009.08-103,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1957.982,1973.635,"In -- aren't there statutes that have exhaustion requirements, or like the EEOC filing requirement, that say, you can't sue until you have gone to X administrative agency?"
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,1977.523,1978.537,That's correct.
2009.08-103,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2070.542,2093.421,"I thought that -- that last sentence is just relating to the court can -- has authority to decide this particular issue, copyrightability, even though the registrant has chosen not to enter the suit."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2098.697,2105.245,"That's the most immediate reference, Justice Ginsburg, but the three sentences work together."
2009.08-103,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2172.479,2186.74,"I would have thought that cut against you in the sense that the same paragraph Congress used the word ""jurisdiction"", but they didn't use that in the provision that you are arguing, does deprive the court of jurisdiction."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2186.74,2205.387,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, because when Congress revised this statute in 1976, it had before it 60 years already of courts construing its language, no action shall be maintained, which was the previous 1909 language as a jurisdictional limit."
2009.08-103,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2287.105,2291.211,"It's not -- it's not a very big deal to register your copyright, right?"
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2291.211,2293.005,"It is not at all a big deal, Your Honor."
2009.08-103,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2301.595,2311.669,"And -- but -- but doesn't that mean that it would be odd to make jurisdiction over an action for infringement hinge on whether you've, you know, dotted an ""I"" and crossed a ""T""?"
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2311.669,2317.841,"Not at all, Your Honor, because again, the copyright statute has a different history than other jurisdictional statutes."
2009.08-103,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2406.944,2429.153,"Isn't it true, though, that -- that most copyright holders, most people who write articles, freelance articles, even if it's only $65, it's not -- it's not worth it because they really don't expect to get -- they don't think anybody is going to infringe, in the first place, and if they did what establishes to be, just wouldn't be economically worthwhile?"
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2434.603,2449.832,"--The beauty, Your Honor, though, of the solution that Congress adopted with the registration, moving the registration to a jurisdictional element rather than to an element of the claim, as it was in the 19th century, is that the copyright owner may do this any time."
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2564.082,2565.974,"Well, there's some that can't be found."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2571.738,2572.861,Justice Breyer--
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2572.861,2575.641,"I mean, that's the problem that's underlying the fairness of this thing."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2575.641,2576.936,--I'm--
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2576.936,2582.965,"In terms of if we take your approach, no matter how hard it is to find owners, you are just out of luck."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2597.568,2602.972,"--Justice Breyer, that concern exists for everybody, not just for electronic databases."
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2605.53,2606.045,That's right.
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2613.793,2617.635,--Because Congress wants to protect the rights of copyright owners.
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2648.921,2650.608,That's the underlying fairness.
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2689.764,2700.335,"--This is a -- the system that Congress put in play is, Your Honor, one in which copyright owners have an absolute right to control the disposition of their works."
2009.08-103,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2755.72,2764.654,"Do they -- if they are just suing, not for money but for an injunction, do they have to register before bringing an injunction suit?"
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2764.654,2766.935,"Yes, Your Honor, they do."
2009.08-103,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2869.731,2876.416,"May I ask -- I just hate to reveal my ignorance on something like this, but I had the same problem with your opponent."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2891.44,2895.001,"It depends on the brand of mandatory, Your Honor."
2009.08-103,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.761,2915.774,But would you not make all the arguments directed at the fairness of the settlements and so forth if it were merely mandatory?
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2915.774,2933.735,"--Yes, because then the two versions of mandatory are -- the flavor of mandatory that the Solicitor General urges is that the district -- this is very mandatory, as in Hallstrom -- even if a party doesn't raise the issue, the district court sua sponte should raise the issue on its own."
2009.08-103,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2933.735,2935.498,The -- so mingle -- rule.
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,2945.102,2948.635,That was -- that was what Ms. Anders argued.
2009.08-103,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2987.774,3005.315,"If we -- if we are talking about the ordinary case, and someone sued for infringement apart from this settlement in the context that we are in, certainly it's not going to raise that question whether it's mandatory, optional or whatever."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3021.135,3026.399,"Actually there are quite a number, Your Honor, just as there are defendants who will waive statutes of limitations."
2009.08-103,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3052.633,3054.368,Then let's switch to the plaintiff.
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3071.455,3083.294,"The problem, Your Honor, is that there are many naive people who believe that famous movies and novels have infringed their freshman college essays."
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3119.887,3121.26,They wouldn't waive it then.
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3185.282,3193.074,"--All of the people who haven't registered yet, Your Honor, will not be able to bring suit, because the class action will extinguish their claims."
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3194.263,3197.636,Maybe they can't do that because it would be an unfair result.
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3205.038,3207.585,"--This provision, if we go back to section--"
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3207.585,3208.508,"Maybe it won't, by the way."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3208.508,3209.023,--Right.
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3209.023,3210.505,It depends on what the terms of the settlement are.
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3224.437,3238.663,"Justice Breyer, once again the Copyright Act itself already makes that choice that no person may -- and I'm not talking yet even about the jurisdictional provision -- no person may use another's copyrighted work without their permission."
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3238.663,3242.727,In 1909 Congress thought all this through with the databases and so forth?
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3242.946,3243.695,"Oh, yes."
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3323.584,3324.473,But why doesn't it?
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3326.848,3329.425,--Because it is -- it is part of the original collection -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3336.468,3338.325,"--Well, you say if somebody who owns the copyright."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3338.325,3338.481,--Yes.
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3339.307,3339.903,Yes.
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3359.112,3359.642,--That's correct.
2009.08-103,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3360.219,3360.672,--All right.
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3372.105,3378.946,"This law relates to the question, Your Honor, because this law relates to the access to the Court."
2009.08-103,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3444.34,3452.272,"So the rulemakers got it wrong in Form 19, when they did not write 411(a) as jurisdictional."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3470.592,3486.151,"As the -- as the Congress made -- I'm sorry, as the Court made clear, in issuing those forms, they are advisory only, and they are not -- they are not intended to give legal advice to counsel about what the issues in the case are."
2009.08-103,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3486.151,3495.615,"I suppose, if you picked up any copyright complaint, you will see the jurisdictional allegation will say 1331, 1338, and nothing about 411."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3495.615,3510.063,"And that is quite common, Your Honor, because, in many situations, what Congress has done is given a general grant of jurisdiction in 1331 or 1338 and then pulled it back for a subcategory of cases, which is what 411(a) does."
2009.08-103,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3542.344,3543.47,Finish your sentence.
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3543.47,3549.608,And the questions today have revealed striking the balance between the public and the private interest is a difficult one.
2009.08-103,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3549.608,3550.716,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-103,2,21228,deborah_jones_merritt,,3550.716,3550.872,Thank you very much.
2009.08-103,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3550.872,3554.292,"Mr. Sims, you have two minutes remaining."
2009.08-103,3,20001,charles_s_sims,,3554.292,3554.884,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2009.08-103,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3694.323,3695.621,"Thank you, counsel."
