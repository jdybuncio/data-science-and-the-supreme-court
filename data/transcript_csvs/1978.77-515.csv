1978.77-515,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.076,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 77-515, Holt Civic Club against The City of Tuscaloosa."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,16.958,20.661,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.77-515,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,60.258,63.679,"Mr. Still, how old a statute is this Alabama statute?"
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,63.679,70.931,"The statute was passed in the early 1900s, one of them, a second one was -- I believe it was 1907."
1978.77-515,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,76.784,80.741,"So, they're pretty old statutes to be challenged at this late date, aren't they?"
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,80.741,83.603,They are old.
1978.77-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,83.603,93.294,"You say, counsel, that the statute empowers and directs the municipal corporations of the cities to do these particular things."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,105.132,108.703,You mean the legislative activities of the city or the three statutes?
1978.77-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,108.703,109.4,Of the city.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,109.4,135.94,"Yes, sir, I believe that it does because Section 11-40-10 which is the primary police jurisdiction statute, contained in Addendum (b) to the brief, the grey brief, says that ordinances of the city or town shall have force and effect in the limits of the city or town and so, that is a mandatory statement there and I believe that they would have effect whether the city intended them to or not."
1978.77-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,144.061,146.624,What page is Addendum (b) in the grey brief?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,146.624,150.989,"It is about three pages from the back of the grey brief, Your Honor."
1978.77-515,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,152.899,154.449,Of your first brief?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,154.449,158.906,"Of the grey brief, Your Honor, of the brief of the appellants."
1978.77-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,170.574,187.451,"It said in the second paragraph of the -- of Section 11, after defining the police jurisdiction, the second paragraph begins ""ordinance of a city or town enforcing police or sanitary regulations."""
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,196.31,196.821,"No, sir, Your Honor."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,233.799,235.496,It's descriptive in other words.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,235.496,237.41,"Yes, sir, it is descriptive of a class of ordinances."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,237.41,246.571,Any ordinances falling into those categories are effective and within the extraterritorial police jurisdiction of the municipality.
1978.77-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,249.635,254.384,Your can -- is the case that interprets it that way cited in your brief?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,254.384,254.721,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,378.162,395.062,What if the State of Alabama provided that the City of Tuscaloosa shall be governed by a five-man commission appointed by the Governor of Alabama so that the city -- the residents within the city boundaries of Tuscaloosa would have absolutely no say in the composition of that commission.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,399.681,412.646,"No, Your Honor, I do not believe that it would because, in that case, the city -- the state would have essentially abolished local government except through commissioners of some sort, agents that it appointed from the central government."
1978.77-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,434.06,436.653,"Yes, that boils down almost to an equal protection claim."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,446.276,460.29,"Yes, sir, and that is the question that we have briefed most extensively but, as I said, the question usually does not arise even that it's a due process claim, but we have raise that in this case and I think it is a sufficient grounds."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,460.29,461.949,It's arisen a good many times.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,501.448,502.386,"Yes, sir, Your Honor, they were."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,502.386,504.91,Perhaps it isn't quite so obvious as you indicate.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,504.91,505.649,"Well, I was talking about a more recent --"
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,505.649,517.116,"The article went on to say, I should say, if -- in your behalf that, in the ling of the modern developments of the equal protection law, the result might be quite different."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,517.116,517.423,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,522.015,524.231,Well in the early years of this century anyway.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,524.231,526.724,"Yes, sir, or the early part of this century."
1978.77-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,642.72,654.205,"If the City of Tuscaloosa were to attempt to enacts the police jurisdiction, would some sort of consent on the part of the residence in the police jurisdiction be required, some sort of a referendum?"
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,654.205,658.177,"Some sort of consent is required under Alabama law, Your Honor."
1978.77-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,684.374,696.117,What if in this situation the city had sought to enacts the police jurisdiction that you're complaining about and the citizens in the affected area had refused to be enacts.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,697.901,698.187,"No, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,721.435,735.252,Well -- but doesn't the ci -- doesn't the State of Alabama have some concern with the added law enforcement problems right around the ring of an urban area that enable it to do some things that it might not be able to do way out in the country?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,735.252,735.596,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,832.785,841.05,"You rely primarily on the reapportionment cases in this Court, don't you?"
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,841.05,851.131,"Not so much the reapportionment cases, Your Honor, but that line of cases beginning with Kramer versus Union Free School District which are not so much reapportionment cases as they are voting rights cases."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,851.131,852.875,Yes.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,866.522,869.495,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,869.495,873.824,"In that School Board election in the State of New York, as I remember it."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,873.824,874.054,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.054,880.21,"What he asked for in his complaint was that he be allowed to vote, wasn't he -- wasn't it?"
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,880.21,880.533,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,895.772,901.291,And he was going to be taxed if the tax levy or bond issue was passed by the --
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,901.291,903.025,"Well, he was going to be taxed indirectly."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,904.385,905.673,"He was a tenant, as I remember."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,905.673,906.569,That's right.
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,909.244,910.05,I don't --
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,910.05,911.128,And so --
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,911.128,913.304,"You may remember I dissented in that case, so I don't --"
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,913.304,914.799,"Yes, sir, I do."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,914.799,919.23,"But, in any event, the relief he was asking was that he be allowed to vote."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,926.1,926.423,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,977.163,987.426,"But, in any event, those cases would seem to indicate that the constitutional injury perceived by the Court was in prohibiting those plaintiffs from voting."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,987.426,988.103,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,988.103,992.303,"And, that was the constitutional injury."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,996.213,1013.037,"Yes, sir, we allege the flip side of that because these residents of the Holt area are not allowed to vote, they -- and, they are governed then they are deprived of a constitutional right."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1013.045,1017.125,"Mr. Still, you're not asking for redress for that constitutional injury."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1019.928,1020.34,"No, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1042.069,1050.306,"Well, in Reynolds against Sims, could the Court have granted the relief of relieving the City and County of Denver of any jurisdiction of the State of Colorado?"
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1050.306,1051.851,"No, sir, I don't believe that they could."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1051.851,1052.071,It was Lucas --
1978.77-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.071,1052.678,Why is that --
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1052.678,1053.943,Lucas against 44th General Assembly.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1053.943,1053.981,Yes.
1978.77-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1053.981,1055.486,"Lucas, yes."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1057.201,1071.734,"Because, in this particular case, if we remove the City of Tuscaloosa's jurisdiction over these people, they will still be governed by the County of Tuscaloosa and by the State of Alabama and, yet, they will not be governed by the City of Tuscaloosa."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1113.138,1131.859,"But your lawsuit is analogous to what those voting cases and reapportionment cases would have been had the plaintiff in the reapportionment cases said this legislature is mal-apportioned, therefore, anything it does is null and void."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1146.798,1147.467,"Yes, sir, Your Honor."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1153.838,1172.905,"We've had cases, for example, where a mal-apportioned legislature has enacted laws and those laws are attacked as invalid because they were enacted by an unconstitutional legislature and the Court, I don't remember any opinions dealing with it in a plenary way, but the Court, at least by some reaction, has rejected those claims."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1172.905,1187.448,"Yes, sir, but in many of those case -- reapportionment cases, the -- I believe the plaintiffs, in addition, sought to have the present legislature just removed from office immediately and that--"
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1187.448,1198.807,"Well, they sought to ask this Court to hold constitutionally invalid state laws enacted by concededly mal-apportioned legislatures."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1198.807,1199.416,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1208.425,1213.034,"But, often, the remedy identifies the constitutional injury about which you're complaining?"
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1213.034,1220.228,"Yes, sir, and we have identified the constitutional injury as these people being governed and not being allowed to vote."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1220.228,1229.19,"Well-- so, the -- if the constitutional injury is that you're not being allowed to vote then the redress for that injury is that you be allowed to vote."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1229.19,1231.457,It may be that the Court -- the District Court will hold that.
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1270.196,1277.249,Where do you get the judicial fiat when you got a state statute involved?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1277.249,1277.998,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1277.998,1280.681,It's not the decision of this Court that would do it.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1283.443,1284.332,"Yes, sir, but I'm saying that --"
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1284.332,1285.328,Am I right?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1285.328,1286.336,"Yes, sir, but I'm saying that the Court has a choice."
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1286.336,1295.938,And what you want us to do is to find that this state statute is unconstitutional and then dream up a remedy for you.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1295.938,1296.924,"No, sir, I'm not asking this Court to --"
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1296.924,1300.906,"And, I mean dream because you haven't told us yet what you want, have you?"
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1300.906,1301.752,"Yes, sir, I have."
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1302.813,1304.071,Or try it again toward the end?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1304.071,1315.57,"I have asked that the city's jurisdiction over these people who do not live inside the City of Tuscaloosa be removed from them, that the City of Tuscaloosa are not being allowed to govern them."
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1315.57,1317.157,And how do you do that?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1317.157,1322.345,You simply tell the City of Tuscaloosa they can't send their police into that area anymore and they can enforce the order.
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1322.345,1324.489,It's your injunction?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1324.489,1326.054,"Yes, sir, I believe that you could."
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1326.054,1327.549,"Well, did you ask us to?"
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1327.549,1328.375,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1328.816,1330.892,Did you ask it before right now?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1330.892,1331.37,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1355.693,1357.81,And whatever they said you put on.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1357.81,1360.385,We have never been allowed to put any evidence on in this case.
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1385.333,1387.447,But you did have discovery.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1387.447,1387.731,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1395.178,1406.083,"Well, I notice you put great weight on the fact that you said embodied your complaint and, for other relief, you're not relying on that, are you?"
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1406.083,1418.102,"That, Your Honor, is a standard way of doing things in Alabama but, as I pointed out, the federal rules of federal procedure allow the Court to grant such other relief as it may find proper."
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1421.256,1424.972,"That's just what I -- a minute ago, I used the word ""dream up."""
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1426.613,1427.178,"No, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1431.731,1434.366,And are you limited to that now in your argument?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1434.366,1434.724,"No, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1450.484,1453.774,Without any suggestion from you?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1453.774,1454.231,I believe that I --
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1454.231,1454.99,But you--
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1454.99,1469.124,"I have some right to make suggestions, but if the Court finds that I'm only entitled to (a) and I ask for (b), but (a) is encompassed within the cause of action that I ask for, that they will grant that sort of thing."
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1490.506,1495.155,"Well, what do you want us to do other than to issue these injunctions?"
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1495.155,1508.84,I want this Court specifically to reverse the case and send it back to the District Court which would then issue the injunctions and declare two statutes unconstitutional and enjoin the third statute from being enforced.
1978.77-515,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1508.84,1509.8,And what else?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1511.531,1513.066,"That would be sufficient, Your Honor."
1978.77-515,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1514.12,1530.751,"Mr. Still, when the Court noted probable jurisdiction in this case, as you've already observed, it indicated that four justices had enough doubt about jurisdiction so as to postpone the resolution, and you have elected to submit that on the brief."
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1533.793,1543.405,"Yes, sir, I am, unless -- but I'm certainly ready, willing, and able to answer questions if anyone has any on the jurisdictional question."

1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1567.138,1570.03,"Well, Your Honor, it's a little bit more than just sending the police."
1978.77-515,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1589.92,1593.152,You're talking about speed limits and parking restrictions?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1593.152,1594.697,"Yes, sir, that sort of thing and all sorts of business regulations."
1978.77-515,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1594.697,1598.028,"And what else, what about criminal laws and city ordinances?"
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1598.028,1598.453,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1606.51,1612.087,It's different from state criminal provisions?
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1612.087,1613.742,"Yes, sir, some of them are."
1978.77-515,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1649.285,1650.461,I've seen it.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1650.461,1653.333,"Which list all of the ordinances of the City of Tuscaloosa which, in effect --"
1978.77-515,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1653.333,1658.213,And the answer to my question would be the same even if no taxes were imposed on the residence of the county.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1658.213,1660.769,"Yes, sir, I believe so because the police power is so pervasive."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1660.769,1662.693,There are no taxes involved here.
1978.77-515,0,23085,edward_still,,1662.693,1663.861,"No, sir, there are no taxes."
1978.77-515,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1664.657,1665.755,License fees.
1978.77-515,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1665.755,1668.641,"Well, I was thinking of the license fees."

1978.77-515,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1676.037,1677.648,Mr. Finnell.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1677.648,1681.474,Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1822.611,1824.671,"As I understood, Mr. Finnell, of course --"
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1824.671,1825.952,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1825.952,1830.024,Police power has at least two meanings.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1846.042,1846.731,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1846.731,1867.144,"I understood my brother Powell's to -- question to be more limited that is, supposed it had been confined only to sending the city policemen out there, and that's quite a much more limited concept and was pointed out by your brother on the other side that this would involve also the extension of legisla -- of the city's legislative power out into the police jurisdiction."
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1867.144,1868.402,It does.
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1869.085,1888.69,"When you say this is confined to the police power, you're perfectly accurate and, if that term is understood as being the appropriate power of the municipality to govern itself, it's only part of the police power that is extended but it's certainly much more than simply sending the city policemen out there to enforce the law, the state law."
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1888.69,1889.403,"Yes, certainly, it involves --"
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1889.403,1895.325,It's an extension of the legislative power the municipality beyond its territorial limits.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1895.325,1896.583,"Absolutely, Your Honor."

1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1903.607,1903.847,"Yes, sir?"
1978.77-515,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1903.847,1923.332,"Suppose in the area outside of Tuscaloosa, which we're talking about, the people in a 14 sq. block area say, ""look, we haven't seen a policeman in the last 14 years, and we need some policemen here."""
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1925.757,1928.242,"We had that complaint quite often, Mr. Justice."
1978.77-515,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1928.242,1931.026,How would they go about getting them?
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1931.026,1943.565,"They would call the police department or the police commissioner or simply come before the Commission Board, as they often do, and ask that the patrols be extended on a more regular basis."
1978.77-515,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1943.565,1947.93,"And if they refuse, what could they do?"
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1947.93,1954.278,"If they refuse to go into -- I don't think the city could be required to do that, Your Honor."
1978.77-515,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1954.278,1967.086,"Well, in -- the people inside of Tuscaloosa, couldn't they go one step further and say, ""Dear Mr. Commissioner of Police, if you don't put them in there, we'll vote you out of office""?"
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1967.086,1967.895,"They could do that, Your Honor."
1978.77-515,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1967.895,1968.608,Couldn't they?
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1971.117,1972.279,"No, sir, but --"
1978.77-515,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1972.279,1974.578,"That is a difference, isn't it?"
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1974.578,1980.417,"Well, in the sense that if you're not talking about a person engaged in business --"
1978.77-515,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1980.417,1985.171,"They'll come out and vote on it, a qualified registered voter."
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1985.171,1986.1,That's quite true.
1978.77-515,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1989.023,1996.652,And they have no authority at all as to whether they shall have good or bad police.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,1996.652,1998.562,"No, sir."
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1998.562,2000.987,Is there a county police force?
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2002.424,2010.628,"There is a county sheriff and there is a county police force, and it is, of course, the duty of the sheriff to police in this area."
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2041.012,2044.958,Does the county police have -- do they have jurisdiction within the city?
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2044.958,2045.773,"Yes, sir, they do."
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2046.695,2048.485,Countywide including within the city.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2048.485,2049.083,Countywide.
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.857,2055.275,That's a matter of practical division of labor.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2055.275,2055.995,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2055.995,2057.246,But they do have jurisdiction in the city.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2057.246,2057.905,"Yes, sir, they certainly do."
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2057.905,2059.94,And is there a state police force?
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2059.94,2060.36,Sir?
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2060.36,2061.018,Is there a state police force?
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2061.018,2063.947,We have -- the state highway patrol also has jurisdiction.
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2063.947,2065.175,Only highway patrol.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2065.175,2065.558,That's all.
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2065.558,2071.097,That is -- does it -- its name seems to imply that it has jurisdiction only of traffic offenses.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2072.534,2073.732,They have other jurisdiction.
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2076.391,2077.074,So how --
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2077.074,2077.337,The highway patrol.
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2077.337,2080.092,I'm familiar with the State of Ohio which is very careful.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2085.649,2087.085,"No, we have other police too."
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2097.47,2098.332,Specialized.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2098.332,2099.979,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2099.979,2102.458,"But there's no general state police force, as you -- I understand you to say."
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2102.458,2104.314,"Other than the highway patrol, no."
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2104.314,2110.272,But its name certainly doesn't indicate that it's a general police force.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2110.272,2112.069,"In practice, it is not either, Your Honor."
1978.77-515,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2112.069,2112.901,Right.
1978.77-515,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2112.901,2115.207,"Mr. Finnell, you mentioned liquor licenses."
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2130.351,2134.267,"Of course, they have to have a county license as well as a city license."
1978.77-515,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2134.267,2140.614,But can the city prohibit a tavern from opening in a particular loc -- a particular part of that whole area?
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2140.614,2147.201,"The city could prohibit the sale of liquor, a liquor license."
1978.77-515,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2180.873,2189.58,"And, conversely, if both the city and the county grant a license for a particular location, the residents in the neighborhood have no place to complain."
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2191.46,2195.023,"Complain to the county or they can complain to the ABC Board, which is often done, yes."
1978.77-515,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2195.023,2195.802,State --
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2195.802,2196.604,State Board.
1978.77-515,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2196.604,2206.873,"What about decision in whether, in a particular part of the three-mile area, there should be one-way streets or what the specific speed limit should be and stop signs and that kind of thing?"
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2208.64,2222.372,"The city can do that and does do it in certain cases, and I would like to -- in connection with that, Your Honor, I'd like to answer a question, too, about the annexation procedures in Alabama because I think they're tied together."
1978.77-515,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2308.538,2312.364,"This has puzzled me a little bit, Mr. Finnell."
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2325.688,2328.287,"I agree, Your Honor, and I think that explains the --"
1978.77-515,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2328.287,2332.083,It doesn't -- that doesn't decide the constitutional question.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2332.083,2332.562,"No, sir."
1978.77-515,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2332.562,2333.55,But --
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2333.55,2341.543,"It certainly explains, I think, though why there's no person that had -- pays a tax, engaged in the likes of businesses of plaintiff in this suit."
1978.77-515,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2346.664,2347.742,Mr. Finnell.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2347.742,2348.67,"Yes, sir?"
1978.77-515,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2348.67,2377.385,"On page 11 (a) of the jurisdictional statement where Section 9 is set out, in the second sentence of that section where it says ordinan -- beginning, ordinances of a city or town enforcing police or sanitary regulations, is that construed in Alabama as requiring, if a city is going to apply an ordinance in a police jurisdiction, it must also apply it in the city."
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2380.026,2384.212,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I've been a city attorney for over 25 years."
1978.77-515,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2426.973,2439.944,"But could the city con -- the converse of what you're saying, could the city decide that ""we want to enforce a particular type of ordinance just in the police jurisdiction but not in the city?"""
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2439.944,2443.381,"I don't-- Your Honor, I would say no."
1978.77-515,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2451.699,2476.613,"If a liquor license or any other license is granted where the location becomes a factor and you say the City of Tuscaloosa reserves the right to issue that license, does the county licensing process get into the fixing of the location, too, or just the city?"
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2476.613,2478.41,"Primarily, I think it's a city."
1978.77-515,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2505.434,2519.35,Does the budget of the City of Tuscaloosa segregate and identify the cost of the taxpayers of Tuscaloosa to provide these services for the appellants in this case?
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2519.35,2524.44,"Since 1977, Your Honor, in the Burge case in Alabama, it will certainly do so."
1978.77-515,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2531.799,2544.524,"There being no record on that in this case, is that a matter the Court could or did take notice of judicially as to how much services these people were getting for nothing?"
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2544.524,2545.177,I think not.
1978.77-515,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2548.56,2552.746,But you can take the Court -- the District Court could have taken judicial notice of the budgets of Tuscaloosa.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2552.746,2557.56,"Take judicial notes, certainly, yes, sir."
1978.77-515,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2558.668,2563.099,"Mr. Finnell, along the same line, I'm bothered a little bit."
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2565.944,2566.357,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-515,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2566.357,2567.136,Among other things.
1978.77-515,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2567.136,2573.597,Is there any factual controversy at all enforced?
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2573.597,2578.627,"Your Honor, I would say no."
1978.77-515,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2631.7,2636.85,Are we entitled to disregard it on a motion to dismiss?
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2636.85,2639.0,"Yes, sir, I would think so."
1978.77-515,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2740.152,2740.212,Mr. Finnell.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2740.212,2757.098,"Now, that puts an issue just one question, as I understand it, and that would be this, whether or not a state statute granting any vestige of extraterritorial jurisdiction to its municipality is unconstitutional per se."
1978.77-515,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2775.27,2784.007,"Mr. Finnell, on this -- again, considering the fact we have a motion to dismiss, have the plaintiffs alleged that they were denied a right to vote?"
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2784.007,2785.019,"Yes, sir, they did."
1978.77-515,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2787.977,2789.444,I don't think they had.
1978.77-515,1,30220,j_wagner_finnell,,2802.762,2806.618,"I had thought, Your Honor, that they allege they'd been denied the right to vote."
1978.77-515,2,23085,edward_still,,3524.395,3525.743,May it please the Court.
1978.77-515,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3525.797,3536.36,"What do you have to say about the -- even though you've waived it, I'd like to have your comment on the lack of pervasive statewide impact here."

1978.77-515,2,23085,edward_still,,3597.512,3606.518,"Yes, sir, but I think the question presented in the Roberson case was whether or not zoning is included within the term ""police power,"" and so --"

1978.77-515,2,23085,edward_still,,3612.74,3632.195,"No, sir, I do not because I believe even an enabling Act -- I believe that the complaint, fairly read on its face, shows that the statute is being enforced or is being utilized by numerous jurisdictions around the State of Alabama and I don't think we have the factual controversy."

1978.77-515,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3765.883,3767.53,Paragraph 10 just points this out.

1978.77-515,2,23085,edward_still,,3795.474,3808.827,"I believe that we do, Your Honor, because we say that not being allowed to vote and being governed is the conflict that creates the constitutional problem in this case."
