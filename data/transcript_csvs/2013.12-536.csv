2013.12-536,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.504,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-536, McCutcheon v. The Federal Election Commission."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,8.72,11.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,46.112,47.079,How is that?
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,47.079,50.933,Because Bicker imposes numerous direct circumvention measures.
2013.12-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,65.525,84.42,"Now, all these were there at -- but for one -- were there at the time of Buckley vs. Valeo, and I guess the Court thought something could happen like the following: Candidate Smith, we can only give him $2600, but he has a lot of supporters."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,122.212,125.314,"Well, there's a couple problems with that hypothetical, Your Honor."
2013.12-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,129.299,130.218,"$5,000."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,130.218,133.337,--and on what a PAC can give to a candidate.
2013.12-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,133.337,134.687,"$5,000."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,150.146,153.5,"Without doing the math, I will tell you that earmarking and proliferation restrictions--"
2013.12-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,153.5,154.033,"No, no."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,154.533,155.016,--But -- but there's--
2013.12-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,155.016,161.587,--because earmarking requires that you write on a check or in an accompanying letter that you want the money to go to something.
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,161.587,162.856,--But actually it does not.
2013.12-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,162.856,163.739,It does not?
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,163.739,167.324,Earmarking -- the FEC's earmarking regulations are broader than that.
2013.12-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,171.628,172.045,"No, no."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,175.247,184.185,"--And at that point, then you don't have the kind of traceability you're talking about because there is more money coming into the PAC than can find its way to any one particular candidate."
2013.12-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,184.185,196.593,"I would think if you named the PAC after a particular candidate as the hypothetical assumes, I would be surprised if the Federal Election Commission wouldn't come after you for earmarking."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,196.593,198.112,That's -- that's exactly my point.
2013.12-536,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,198.112,198.929,"Well, let's say this one, Ms. Murphy."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,245.176,248.045,"A couple of responses to that, Your Honor."
2013.12-536,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,257.568,261.77,"This candidate knows all of his $100,000 donors."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,266.273,270.208,But they're not actually donors to him at that point.
2013.12-536,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,275.279,277.212,Five of the most contested Senate races.
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,298.311,308.916,"--I don't think it works to think of these as direct contributions in excess of the base limits because the PAC is limited itself in how much it can contribute, so you would have to have--"
2013.12-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,308.916,312.035,"All we're trying to do, because it's hard to do in oral argument."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,380.363,381.882,--Two responses.
2013.12-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,399.26,403.478,"I just want to be clear what your answer to Justice Kagan was, her hypothetical."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,414.453,420.257,That's part -- it can pose both earmarking concerns and proliferation concerns if we're talking about something.
2013.12-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,422.459,427.678,--So is part of your answer to her there that the hypothetical isn't real or isn't going to happen or--
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,427.678,429.279,"--Yes, I think--"
2013.12-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,429.279,430.662,--or can't happen under the existing law?
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,431.231,432.497,--That's part of the answer.
2013.12-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,436.033,440.003,Would the other side concede that this is true?
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,440.003,443.539,I -- I doubt they would concede that it's true.
2013.12-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,454.597,467.571,"I can't imagine that if you have a PAC which says we're going to give money to Smith, that's bad, but if you have a PAC that says we're going to give all the money that you contribute to us to Smith and Jones, that's okay."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,472.139,474.924,--Exactly.
2013.12-536,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,478.026,488.151,"Ms. Murphy, if you think it's earmarking that have a PAC that gives money to the five most -- the candidates in the five most contested Senate races, I just don't think any FEC would say that that's earmarking."
2013.12-536,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,488.151,491.536,"Well, I may have an overly suspicious mind, but I don't know."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,513.366,515.051,--I think that's absolutely right.
2013.12-536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,516.837,530.228,"Well, suppose -- suppose a number of PACs -- I forget the number in Justice Kagan's example -- said we're going to give to congressional and senatorial candidates who want to cut down on governmental spending."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,533.68,534.465,--Well--
2013.12-536,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,558.664,561.282,"Ms. Murphy, can I give another one?"
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,616.684,618.803,"That is not legal, Justice Kagan."
2013.12-536,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,622.705,627.225,A candidate can transfer a maximum of $2600 to another candidate per election.
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,627.225,631.094,"--A candidate can transfer $2,000 to a candidate per election."
2013.12-536,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,633.395,634.914,I stand corrected on the basis of $600.
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,634.914,637.699,--That's a hard contribution limit on how much they can contribute.
2013.12-536,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,653.126,653.842,You're exactly right.
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,682.811,699.571,"I think even if you accept this scenario where all of these candidates are independently deciding to give all their money to one candidate, you can't have a law that is designed to prevent this one person from circumvention by prohibiting everybody else from engaging in contributions that don't--"
2013.12-536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,699.571,710.296,"Ms. Murphy, on the “ everyone else ”, can you give us an idea of whose expression is at stake?"
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,730.209,732.661,--I don't have a percentage on how many are able.
2013.12-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.767,748.021,I assume that a law that only -- only prohibits the speech of 2 percent of the country is okay.
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,748.021,749.354,Absolutely not.
2013.12-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.354,750.873,"Oh, it isn't?"
2013.12-536,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,750.873,762.347,"Ms. Murphy, we haven't talked yet about the effect of the aggregate limits on the ability of donors to give the minimum amount to as many candidates as they want."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,770.084,770.786,That's right.
2013.12-536,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,771.769,777.69,Is there a way to eliminate that aspect while retaining some of the aggregate limits?
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,789.831,797.27,"--Well, it's certainly a necessary consequence of BCRA's scheme in which there's a distinct aggregate limit on contributions to candidates alone."
2013.12-536,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,817.232,819.117,"I'm a little confused, okay?"
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,833.444,834.61,--Well--
2013.12-536,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,834.61,838.513,"I mean, I can go into the news, as Justice Breyer suggested."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,868.867,872.152,--I guess I'm not sure what you're talking about happening.
2013.12-536,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,887.078,888.111,"Here is the actual ad, the actual ad."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,944.415,946.133,"Two points, Your Honor."
2013.12-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,956.073,960.142,"Ms. Murphy, do -- do we need a record to figure out issues of law?"
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,960.142,961.176,--And that's my second point.
2013.12-536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,961.926,962.411,"No, no."
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,981.473,986.277,--And you shouldn't need one here either because these limits are facially over and under-inclusive.
2013.12-536,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,988.077,993.264,You're taking a position -- you're taking a position that the law stops corruption.
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1000.417,1001.453,--I'm suggesting that--
2013.12-536,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1001.453,1002.003,As it is?
2013.12-536,0,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1007.607,1011.492,"--Even if the government could prove that proposition, there would still be an over-and under-breadth problem."
2013.12-536,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1013.344,1013.761,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-536,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1640.736,1643.022,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-536,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1723.057,1728.128,That's because they can transfer the funds among themselves and to a particular candidate.
2013.12-536,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1776.358,1781.595,"--So, Mr. Chief Justice, I want to make two different points in response to that question."
2013.12-536,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1821.505,1838.349,"What is the framework -- what is the framework for analyzing -- I agree with you on the aggregation, but it has this consequence with respect to limiting how many candidates an individual can support within the limits that Congress has said don't present any danger of corruption?"
2013.12-536,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1852.559,1855.91,--Let me make a specific point about that and then work into the framework.
2013.12-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.637,1901.707,And that does not -- that does not evoke any gratitude on the part of the people?
2013.12-536,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1922.038,1922.905,The foundation--
2013.12-536,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1922.905,1926.907,It's not that we're stopping people from spending big money on politics.
2013.12-536,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,3488.852,3490.804,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-536,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3556.747,3558.281,"Thank you, counsel."
