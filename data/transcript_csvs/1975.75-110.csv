1975.75-110,0,42183,stephen_b_tatem_jr,,74.196,79.278,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.75-110,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,200.45,223.815,"We did – it was settled in the federal courts generally that the findings of novelty well non, utility well non, obviousness well non of the District Court are subject to the standards of Rule 52 i.e. that there is findings of fact not of law."
1975.75-110,0,42183,stephen_b_tatem_jr,,223.815,229.434,"Mr. Justice, it is my understanding and I confess that I am not a patent attorney."
1975.75-110,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,262.413,271.982,"Well, Mr. Tatem, I don't know if Justice Stewart feels completely satisfied with your answer to his question, but I am anyway left with some uncertainties."
1975.75-110,0,42183,stephen_b_tatem_jr,,295.58,302.219,"Well, I believe that the validity of a patent is a question of law."
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2063.175,2065.953,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.75-110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.596,2105.324,"Having brought that analogy and I wonder if you think it would be appropriate for us to take judicial notice of the common variety of patent that's available to every body, in stating the obviousness of this device."
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2105.324,2114.512,Yes I certainly do Mr. Justice Stevens and as you know there is a completely different principle under which the ordinary toilet works.
1975.75-110,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2147.161,2149.985,"(Inaudible) hydraulic pressure, do they not?"
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2149.985,2166.37,"Well, I think that any cleaning whether it's by hose or whether it's by bucket or in any way, everyone has been trying to get rid of cow manure in barns for about thousands of years."
1975.75-110,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2428.057,2430.411,Is there a diagram in the record that the –-
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2430.411,2431.288,Yes.
1975.75-110,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2532.144,2536.727,"Where about on that diagram on Page 66 is 265, I don't seem to see it --"
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2536.727,2544.404,The 265 appears in the lower left hand corner just above 260.
1975.75-110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2557.514,2567.829,"May I interrupt Mr. Kolisch, McCornack I guess is the name of this patent, does this contemplate the use of the flushing technique without prior cleaning by hand, shoveling and oil --"
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2567.829,2582.146,"No, it talks in the patent that there maybe used, they're maybe necessary to use hand cleaning also because this does not cover all the barn floors area."
1975.75-110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.79,2594.27,"Let me change the question slightly, to the extent that this device is intended to flush portions of the barn, does the device contemplate to those portions which previously be cleaned manually?"
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2594.27,2605.816,"No, I think that under the McCornack patent, those portions of where the water is discharged in the gutters and on the shield that supposedly they would be cleaned."
1975.75-110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.827,2611.545,What's the difference between concept --
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2611.545,2620.212,The difference in the concept is the difference between taking a hose and --
1975.75-110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.212,2622.075,It's not a hose?
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2623.1,2624.357,The McCornack hose –-
1975.75-110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.357,2624.603,"Oh, is it?"
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2624.603,2624.949,"Oh, yes."
1975.75-110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2631.582,2633.295,Pipe as distinguished from hoses?
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2633.295,2635.014,Well –-
1975.75-110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.014,2636.323,"They're different, are they not?"
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2639.36,2639.628,Yes.
1975.75-110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2643.731,2644.859,They are not hoses?
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2644.859,2645.189,No.
1975.75-110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2648.777,2655.348,"The difference in concept, the different method of getting the water propelled through the gutters?"
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2655.348,2675.154,"Well, it's a difference in the way in which the water acts once it is released, whether it's a pipe or a hose the water comes out in the form of the orifice from which it has been discharged and it is a point in impingement and it must be whether it comes from a pipe."
1975.75-110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2675.154,2680.147,The difference -- is one huge flow rather than several separate flows simultaneously?
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2680.147,2687.383,"The invention eliminates all hoses, pipes, and gutters."
1975.75-110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2700.865,2709.626,So that is the difference between cleaning everything at once in cleaning only a portion of the barn and also try and articulate what the difference is?
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2709.626,2711.448,I appreciate that Mr. Justice Stevens.
1975.75-110,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.277,2730.589,Simultaneously?
1975.75-110,1,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2730.589,2741.577,"Yes, but many pipes simultaneously you simply have perhaps this type of effect, a spray in effect, but it is not hydraulically."
