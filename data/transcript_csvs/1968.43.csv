1968.43,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,3.395,Mr. McCarthy.
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,3.395,4.316,May it please the Court.
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,574.679,582.816,What is the provision in Rule 11 on which you rely for that last argument?
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,582.816,597.153,The -- there is no provision in Rule 11 concerning a duty of inquiry but the provision in Rule 11 is that the district judge must address the defendant personally and determine.
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,599.145,601.401,In determining that the plea is made voluntarily?
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,601.401,606.673,Voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,655.418,662.303,"Well, may I -- I hope this won't disturb the order of your argument."
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,697.469,702.744,"Judgment was entered on September 14, 1966."
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,702.744,712.207,"And at that time, I think the record shows that the judge had before him and had consulted the pre-sentence report."
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,712.207,713.49,"Yes, he did Your Honor but this I --"
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,713.49,731.239,"And at that time, did he try correctly recall that he referred to the certain bookkeeping difficulties revealed by the presentence report?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,731.239,732.116,"Yes, he did."
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,732.116,745.694,"Now, do you argue that there was no explicit finding however by the court in September of that it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,746.562,748.332,"No, there was no finding."
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,748.332,755.049,"Now, you do not argue that the Court has to make such an explicit finding, do you?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,756.02,758.693,I don't argue that there must be an explicit finding.
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,758.693,761.052,Why not?
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,761.052,765.41,"The rule, the wording of the rule itself does not require an explicit finding."
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,765.751,776.58,You read -- you read unless it is satisfied as referring to a mental state which a judge does not have to make explicit?
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,776.58,781.97,"Well, the one thing I see in there is explicit, is that the judge must make a determination."
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,786.883,789.232,"I understand that, that is the first part of your --"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,789.232,801.938,"The latter part of the rule, I read to require the judge to be satisfied in the circumstances that a factual basis exists for the plea."
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,811.73,827.461,"Well, what do you think that last sentence means and you think that how can it be satisfied if the plea is justified without being having some basis for believing that the defendant did the act?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,827.461,834.345,"Well, I think that this is the argument which we have made Your Honor and our brief is that there are two elements to the crime."
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,839.11,843.174,"Yes, but you don't tie them as I remember perhaps I'm wrong."
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,847.685,852.177,Perhaps not as artistically as I should have but this is --
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,852.177,867.143,"No, I don't say that critical, I'm trying to find out your theory after all, I believe I'm correct in saying that this is the first time that the amendments of Rule 11 has been before us."
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,867.143,869.049,As far as I understand that that's correct.
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,869.049,918.006,"And I've try and I confess with a little surprise that the sort of lack of reliance on that last sentence what I've take it now from which you have said that you regarded as referring only to a mental state in the court which did not have to be reflected in any finding or any statement by the court and I suppose that at the time of the entry of judgment, the court had before it a presentence report which did not however make any reference whatever to the particular crime."
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,955.787,957.239,"No, I don't think it would Your Honor."
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,957.503,970.084,"Well, what, what -- I missed in your brief any discussion of question as to whether this last sentence was or was not satisfied in your case."
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,970.084,971.914,My argument is this.
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,999.299,1013.114,Free -- that's where I read your brief and so it means that if we don't agree with you about the first part of Rule 11 that there are the court so far as your argument is concerned.
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1031.574,1031.728,"Well, I have --"
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1031.728,1053.908,"I don't agree with you about that and your argument falls because you treat the last sentence as a mere appendage then you get some support from that I agree from the reporters note, the advisory note but that is -- am I correct about your argument?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1053.908,1060.426,I have not argued with that last part of the rule is mandatory because of the language of the rule itself.
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1147.321,1151.778,Why do you think -- why do you think the Committee put that sentence in the rules?
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1151.778,1154.608,Concerning the factual basis of the plea?
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1187.305,1194.214,Why is that the judge can satisfy the last sentence says that the judge.
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1194.214,1194.746,I'm sure that this imposes --
1968.43,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1194.746,1200.873,Must have been satisfied with one -- than that appeared just for the language of that sentence.
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1229.054,1234.855,This is a second part of our argument Your Honor that there is an abuse of discretion in this case.
1968.43,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.304,1258.598,"I understand that your brief on pages from 24 to pages 29 some 5 or 6 with bold printed pages, the thrust of your argument is almost precisely what Mr. Justice Fortas' questions have suggested, i.e. that there was not compliance in this case with the final sentence in newly amended Rule 11."
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1258.852,1269.218,"Exactly, Your Honor but I frame it in terms of an abuse of discretion in the part of the District Court because I don't find that language to be sufficiently specific."
1968.43,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1271.274,1272.474,Satisfied.
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1272.474,1279.115,And that's why I (Inaudible) the argument in terms of the discretion and an abuse thereof.
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1310.019,1317.508,"Mr. McCarthy, do you split any responsibility on retained counsel?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1317.508,1320.535,"Of course there is responsibility on retained counsel, Your Honor."
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1320.535,1327.75,"Well, is your position that the fact that they didn't call the Alcoholic Anonymous man was enough?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1327.75,1329.034,"No, my position --"
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1329.034,1333.483,"Or what should the Court do, go out and subpoena witnesses?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1333.483,1345.126,"The Court is required under Rule 11 to address the defendant personally and determine that he, the defendant understand the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea?"
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1345.126,1356.898,"Well, don't you think the judge is right in taking consideration that this man might have been fit Alcoholics Anonymous but that wasn't sufficient?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1356.898,1358.902,"Well, I'm quite sure that being a member of Alcoholics Anonymous --"
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1358.902,1365.281,What else did the court have other the lawyer statement that this mans was a fit subject of Alcoholics Anonymous?
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1367.676,1369.724,The judge had the age of the defendant.
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1373.869,1375.437,"That's discretionary, isn't it?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1375.437,1375.853,"Certainly, it is discretionary."
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1375.853,1378.672,That's why he put a 65-year-old man in jail?
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1378.672,1378.887,Certainly it's --
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1378.887,1379.987,That's discretionary.
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1379.987,1386.202,"Well, the question isn't whether or nor to put a 65-year-old man in jail."
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1397.822,1401.266,Would your argument be the same if he was 45?
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1401.266,1405.804,I think a man more in the prime of his life would be less likely to be confused --
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1405.804,1408.958,Where would you draw the line?
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1408.958,1417.396,This is perhaps in the discretion of the Court but this is precisely my argument that the discretion of the court was not properly exercised.
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1417.396,1417.726,Why?
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1417.726,1423.467,Some men of advanced years are extremely -- have extreme acumen some do not.
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1423.467,1425.866,"Well, what should the judge do at that stage?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1428.258,1438.456,Rule 32 requires at the sentencing hearing that the district judge address the defendant personally of this again --
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1438.456,1440.47,"Well, indeed it's original hearing?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1440.47,1451.823,"He did inquire of the defendant at the sentencing hearing and the defendant said the following -- He said, if it were not for my health and the things that I have gone through, it would not have happen and it is not deliberate."
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1459.978,1461.857,"Well, what should the Court have done then?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1461.857,1466.139,The court should have inquired as to what he meant by “It is not deliberate.”
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1466.228,1468.706,"And suppose he had done that, would it be alright?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1470.298,1470.409,Oh!
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1475.377,1476.531,The military calls?
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1476.531,1481.275,"Well, I cited to this Court cases from the --"
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1481.275,1482.16,"Yes, I know."
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1482.16,1483.993,-- United States Court of Military Appeals.
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1483.993,1485.296,I'm still wondering.
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1485.296,1489.302,I just used the phraseology which they used.
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1501.523,1514.501,"Well, couldn't the defendant with or without the advice of a retained counsel have volunteered what was good for him?"
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1514.501,1514.857,I'm afraid I don't.
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1514.857,1521.862,Or do you think the Court is obliged to inquire into all of the materials?
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1521.862,1522.051,"Yes, I think."
1968.43,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1522.051,1523.887,I come back to my original question.
1968.43,0,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,1527.589,1530.157,"Yes, of course you're retained counsel does."
1968.43,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1617.143,1619.51,Mr. Springer.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1619.51,1622.354,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1734.394,1736.716,Is that what he was convicted of?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1736.716,1737.198,Yes.
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1737.242,1739.95,"$15,000.00"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1739.95,1742.003,"Yes, well of course, there was no specific finding."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1746.847,1747.773,Oh!
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1751.431,1751.551,Yes.
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1751.551,1753.163,But the other two are dismissed?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1753.163,1753.96,"Yes, I'm sorry."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1816.718,1827.393,"If it had not been willful, if it had been neglected, it would have been an included offense, would it not?"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1827.393,1829.516,"Mr. Chief Justice I believe, it would not."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1847.829,1864.216,"If a defendant had misunderstood that word willful and it had been a matter of neglect as far as he was concerned it would have been a minor offense, wouldn't it?"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1864.216,1867.475,"In fact, I believe it would have been no offense at all."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1872.541,1872.712,Whether any --
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1872.712,1874.192,-- each of the three basic ones --
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1874.192,1874.23,"Well, --"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1874.23,1875.034,--each requires will --
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1875.034,1878.325,"-- let's put it this was, were there any included offenses?"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1881.677,1885.577,"No, in fact that is I believe what this Court held in the Sansone case."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1891.577,1897.955,But the district attorney does have a right to charge it either as a misdemeanor or as a felony is he not?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1897.955,1909.31,"Yes, he does but when the charge is made, it is a single question and there is the one question of willfulness."
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1948.707,1994.893,"Well, apart from what the merits may be, I suppose the Government's position is that the petitioner having pleaded guilty, it was his responsibility upon being personally addressed by the court to come forward with some sort of showing that would indicate that would give a basis for a claim at that time or subsequently that can be done that he did not plead guilty unknowingly, isn't that right?"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1994.893,2011.059,"Yes, in fact it's our position that if in fact the defendant now has available to him some factual indication that the plea was not knowing or for that matter that there was not an adequate factual basis for the plea, he can raised this collaterally."
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2011.059,2026.9,"Well, the question is whether it have to be a showing made at the time, some showing made at the time that the prisoner is addressed by the judge and if so what form that has to take?"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2026.9,2028.641,"Yes, but as I say --"
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2028.641,2041.88,Is it or is it not the Government's position whether raised collaterally or on direct appeal that that is the time when a showing has to be made under Rule 11?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2041.88,2045.984,"No, we would not stand on the proposition that that is the only time it could be --"
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2045.984,2048.099,Do you believe it can be made collateral?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2048.099,2062.699,"Yes, and in fact we would submit that there's no substance to the petitioner's contentions that he is in any way barred from raising this matter either under Rule 32 (b) or under Rule 2255."
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2062.699,2087.972,"But what you're saying to us then comes down to the proposition as I understand it that there is no evidence or nothing from which we can rely in this record to show that the plea was not voluntarily and knowingly made, is that right?"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2087.972,2089.264,"Yes, yes."
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2089.264,2089.717,Or is it --
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2089.717,2091.634,"In fact, --"
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2091.634,2106.303,-- and also that nothing before us to show that the necessary element of the crime that is to say the knowing evasion of taxes was not present.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2106.303,2122.734,"Yes, in fact to the first point, we would submit that there is enough in this record to show that there was ample basis for the inference which the prior judge evidently made that the defendant understood the nature of the charges."
1968.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.734,2139.304,"Wouldn't you think that to comply with Rule 11, the judge himself must as you just suggested at least go through to the process in his own mind of determining like Rule 11 requires that the defendant understood the consequences of his plea of the nature of the charge."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2139.304,2147.38,"Yes, Mr. Justice we do not believe however that there's anything in the world that requires a specific identifiable finding in the record."
1968.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.38,2153.668,I know but it is not enough for you to win your case just to say that there's no evidence in the record to indicate that he didn't know.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2153.668,2161.837,"No, no we are prepared to argue to the contrary though there is enough evidence in the record to support such an inference."
1968.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2161.837,2163.027,Don't you have to?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2163.027,2163.937,"Yes, yes we certainly do."
1968.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.937,2170.287,And you're willing to decide this case on the basis of Rule 11?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2170.287,2190.338,Well on the basis of the compliance by the Court with the real substance of Rule 11 which we feel is that a determination at least within the judges on mind be made and that there be an adequate basis for that determination.
1968.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.337,2209.946,"As far as there being a factual basis for the charge or for the plea, I gather that the only issue in the case was knowing or not."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2216.556,2219.129,In effect he did that based on his --
1968.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.129,2223.398,"He said in my opinion, the matter which the books were kept was not inadvertent."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2225.28,2235.408,I would think so and that plus some other related discussions plus in fact what the defendant's counsel said at the sentencing indicates that the judge of course familiar with the presentence report.
1968.43,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2235.408,2246.665,But this is a different matter wholly of -- this is a different matter from satisfying himself as the defendant himself understood the nature of the charge and understood what he was pleading guilty to.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2246.665,2255.392,"Yes, this is really the objective question and the other is the subjective question as to voluntariness and so forth."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2255.392,2268.82,I understand you to say that there's enough in the record to support an inference by us that the court did satisfy this rule.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2276.906,2281.244,"I -- Mr. Chief Justice, I would suggest that that perhaps becomes a semantic question of course we cannot contend that he --"
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2281.244,2285.086,"No, it isn't semantic at all."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2304.524,2310.251,"Well, of course I have to say that the Rule 11 did direct him to address the defendant and he did not do that."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2310.251,2312.202,That he did not?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2312.202,2313.644,In that sense.
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2313.644,2334.469,Do you think it is too much for this Court to insist that Rule 11 be followed by district judge before he sends a man away the prison for a term of years when the defendant has plead guilty is safe to state the trial.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2351.407,2352.831,"Certainly not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2352.831,2356.779,Then why do you support this?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2356.779,2363.523,Because I think that the fact that judge did not fully comply with Rule 11 is not dispositive of this case.
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2364.934,2372.68,That we ought to give a benefit to the -- of doubt to the judge rather than to the defendant?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2372.68,2376.54,"Well, first we would say there was an effect to determination."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2377.277,2377.448,"Now, --"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2377.448,2377.523,-- this Court does not --
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2377.523,2380.344,"In effect, you qualify everything you say."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2388.273,2391.442,"As I say Mr. Chief Justice, that we have to concede."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2411.782,2429.552,"His counsel told the court, this man because of his drinking was negligent in doing these things and it was negligence that brought this around rather than deliberation and that did not prompt the court to go any farther at all."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2429.552,2439.117,"Well, I think that there's -- those I believe are counsel's inferences from the record which I believe on its --"
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2439.117,2444.654,You get back to inferences again.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2447.068,2477.167,"If the reference is to statements by the defendant's counsel at the sentencing hearing Mr. Chief Justice, I would suggest that reading those statements as a whole does not to my mind at least disclose any inconsistency with either the existence of the factual basis for the charges or the defendant's understanding."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2477.443,2490.11,"Now, I think we are getting into semantics when you refer it that way and his violation but reading it, the effect of it is that it didn't injure the defendant at all."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2494.229,2502.159,"If it be so, I have to concede that our case does to that extent depend upon that."
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2527.378,2541.738,Does the appendix of page 20 and 21 and 22 correctly set out the conversation that took place between the judge and the prisoner?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2541.738,2557.263,"Yes, Mr. Justice Black, that in fact is a quotation by the Court of Appeals confirm the plead record which is set forth completely at pages 6 through 8."
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2557.263,2559.086,That's what happened?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2565.819,2567.073,He did not directly.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2567.073,2567.68,To say what?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2572.318,2573.243,"No, Mr. Justice Black."
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2577.06,2579.874,But they had the conversation which was shown?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2579.874,2579.92,Yes.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2579.92,2581.052,I misunderstood you.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2581.052,2581.909,Yes.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2591.204,2591.321,"Well, --"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2591.321,2591.878,-- charges.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2591.878,2595.909,"-- he asked him about several things that he understood, didn't he?"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2595.909,2608.033,"Yes, he asked him whether he understood the -- that he would be depriving himself to a jury trial by pleading guilty whether he understood that he would be subjecting himself to a long sentence --"
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2608.033,2608.867,Why?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2608.867,2620.445,"-- whether he was pleading voluntarily, whether any promises had been made to him, or whether any threats had been made to induce the plea."
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2629.225,2629.244,How was he --
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2629.244,2630.319,-- a series of questions about the understanding --
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2630.319,2632.928,-- exactly how did he ask that under the rule?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2634.402,2637.303,"I think it would not be enough simply to say, do you understand the charge?"
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2637.303,2639.53,What it would not be enough?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2644.481,2648.319,"I think in this case because of the simplicity of the case, it could have been --"
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2648.319,2649.397,Because of what?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2649.397,2652.885,Because of the simplicity of the charge it could have been a simple question.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2652.885,2658.844,What is it you say that had didn't ask that the rule requires him that?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2658.844,2672.651,"He did not ask, do you understand that in order to be convicted of this charge, you must have willfully filed a false tax return understating your income?"
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2695.35,2698.827,Does the rule say that he should ask him if he willfully did it?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2702.796,2708.734,"Well, Mr. Justice Black the rule does say that he shall personally address the defendant --"
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2708.734,2709.069,Which he did --
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2709.069,2710.638,-- and determining.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2710.638,2712.462,-- and determined?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2712.462,2715.546,That the plea is made voluntarily and with the understanding of the nature of the charges.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2715.546,2718.286,"And he did that which is voluntarily, didn't he?"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2718.286,2718.886,"Yes, he did."
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2724.779,2730.295,But he asked about three or four understanding but he didn't sweep in the whole thing he says.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2730.295,2732.203,"Yes, and that --"
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2732.203,2734.217,"That may be right, I'm just asking."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2734.217,2741.323,Yes and what we have to concede that that is something that the rule directed him to do that he did not.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2746.169,2754.006,I'm not joining issue with you rather I'd see just exactly what was?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2754.006,2765.733,"As to the basis for the inference which we feel the district judge properly drew characterize it as you will, the defendant was a mature man."
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2771.463,2773.459,What about his business?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2773.459,2794.948,It appears that he was some kind of printing jobber at the end of the sentencing proceeding was a reference to a request for a stay of execution of the sentence because he was handling the printing of some ballots for the county at that time.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2795.815,2802.261,You say they could raise this collaterally in one or two ways.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2806.623,2808.017,On direct appeal?
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2808.017,2809.17,Yes.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2813.776,2813.84,I submit that --
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2813.84,2815.773,You told me you decide against it?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2818.388,2819.794,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2821.159,2831.909,So then what you want is just to show what happen or why go over all that fight just accept a retain a plea of guilty?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2831.909,2832.783,I'm sorry.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2833.085,2840.485,Why go over all that fight just to retain a plea of guilty when you could just try him again?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2840.485,2841.77,Why?
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2856.185,2860.403,"That's right, not his will but what if it's shown that there are mistakes."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2870.71,2888.028,I would simply urged that the kind of the outburst of that that having pleaded guilty he should not have the option of undoing what we believe the record shows was a thoroughly considered intelligent act on his part.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2888.028,2896.183,The courts have been very liberal and haven't been admonished to be liberal in connection with letting people withdraw their pleas of guilty.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2903.315,2919.587,Of course the Rule 32 relating to that does draw a distinction between a withdrawal of the plea before a sentencing which can be done quite freely and the withdrawal of the plea after sentencing which can be only done only upon a showing of manifest into justice.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2919.587,2924.866,Of course the Government wouldn't want to keep a conviction and demand rarely had not violated along way?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2924.866,2943.459,"No, certainly not Mr. Justice and we would urge that that is a -- if this record is not sufficient to support the acceptance of the plea and the entry of judgment upon it that those facts should be explored in a hearing so that we will know whether or not there was a factual cases --"
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2943.459,2948.421,And a collateral proceeding or just a remand for what?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2948.421,2953.91,We would suggest that it would be more orderly if it were done collaterally.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2969.834,2983.453,As I understand that you concede that they raised the question in connection with the judge which if it was correct he wouldn't have been justified for pleading guilty.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2983.453,2985.5,It is raised only on appeal however.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2986.148,2992.403,I thought that his lawyer was raising it and saying that he had been drinking and that he didn't know.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2993.62,3008.647,"No, I think the discussion towards the references had been made or a discussion in elaboration of the defendants statement in allocution that the lawyer was not arguing that the plea was improper and that he --"
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3008.647,3010.276,But what did he say about it?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3011.455,3013.487,"About the plea, he said --"
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3013.487,3018.096,About the defendant's knowledge.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3018.096,3019.774,He said nothing directly about the defendant's --
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3019.774,3030.064,And did he say from which something could be inferred about his drinking?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3030.064,3032.551,It's a rather elaborate statement.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3034.017,3037.023,Just that part of it.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3037.023,3047.211,It appears in a number of places in trial counsel statement on seeking to mitigate the sentence that refers to problems that relate to drinking in this case.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3055.709,3056.342,Was it in that --
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3056.342,3056.402,-- statement.
1968.43,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3056.402,3059.009,I believe the impression with the judge?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3065.507,3073.45,I think not speaking very honestly upon a whole in reading of the entire record.
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3110.494,3140.515,"Well, didn't counsel say specifically to the court that the (Inaudible) report this was a matter of negligence on the part of the defendant and not intentional but he realized that if some circumstances, negligence could be equated to that?"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3140.515,3143.249,The word he used Mr. Chief Justice in fact was neglect.
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3144.412,3146.571,"Neglect, yes."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3146.571,3146.751,But he --
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3146.751,3148.532,Instead of negligent consent?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3148.532,3154.154,"I would suggest that what he seems to me to have been meaning by neglect was the failure to do something, --"
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3154.154,3154.401,Yes.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3154.401,3156.796,-- the failure to record income accurately.
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3156.796,3157.441,Yes.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3157.441,3160.611,However this man was an experienced lawyer.
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3162.683,3163.022,You mean --
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3163.022,3164.346,-- United States Attorney.
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3164.346,3164.87,"-- counsel, yes."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3164.87,3167.779,Yes.
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3183.452,3187.386,I tell you frankly what concerns me in this case.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3299.521,3325.673,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would only say that in this case, because of the failure to make that simple inquiry at the plead receiving, the Government has imposed upon it what may be the subversive substantial burden of going through a collateral proceeding having to prove that in fact there was an understanding of the nature of the charges."
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3325.673,3329.685,"Well, Mr. Springer that's -- you surprise me."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3380.386,3381.429,Yes.
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3381.429,3388.767,"Alright, on July 15, the judge did address this defendant directly."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3390.077,3390.651,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3390.651,3397.627,He did ask him about his understanding of the consequences of the plea.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3398.219,3398.922,Yes.
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3398.922,3407.459,"Those were the words added strangely enough by the July, by the amendment effective July 1, 1966."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3439.318,3439.913,Yes.
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3439.913,3441.472,You agree with what I've said?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3441.472,3442.259,He did fail.
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3444.078,3453.332,And you assert that that question can be raised on the collateral attack.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3453.332,3454.715,"Yes, yes, yes, we do Mr. Justice."
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3454.715,3457.1,Is there any authority to that effect?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3495.635,3496.251,"Well, perhaps I should --"
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3496.251,3508.516,"Is there any authority to the effect that that question, that narrow question of what happens after plea of guilty and on acceptance of the plea of guilty under Rule 11?"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3513.696,3520.886,"Yes, there are several Court of Appeals cases.Perhaps, I –- just to be absolutely thorough I should rephrase that point."
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3543.647,3544.666,Alright.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3544.666,3545.388,-- and the defendant.
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3546.953,3551.771,Let's leave that confusion where it is and let's go to the next phase.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3573.968,3574.705,Yes.
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3574.705,3575.138,Alright.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3588.927,3589.087,Yes.
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3589.087,3591.195,-- when judgment is entered.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3641.47,3641.62,Yes.
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3641.62,3663.186,"In the hearing, in the colloquy in September, according to this record the judge did refer to the what he referred to as more or less deliberately confused bookkeeping of the defendant as disclosed by the presentence report."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3664.126,3664.847,Yes.
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3664.847,3673.947,So that there is some indication here that the judge did have before him some information going to what actually happened here.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3677.468,3679.105,"Yes, and that information as --"
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3679.105,3679.141,"Now, --"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3679.141,3679.312,-- far as the record shows.
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3679.312,3700.372,"-- is it the Government's position at all its -- that is essential that it is essential to comply with that last sentence, there be some indication of some sort on the record that the Court did look into and was satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea."
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3705.108,3707.341,I think there should be some indication in the record.
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3710.309,3715.992,Do you think there should be some indication but that the indication here is enough?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3715.992,3720.565,The crucial point being that it is indicated that the judge considered a presentence report.
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3720.565,3732.411,Alright and you say that the Court doesn't have to enter anything on the record to the effect that it is satisfied that there was a factual basis for the plea.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3732.411,3737.765,"No, we would suggest that sufficiently implicit in the entry of judgment and I think --"
1968.43,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3737.765,3743.615,There was no such -- nothing on the record to in this case to that effect.
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3743.615,3756.078,"No, the judge did not say I am satisfied or would we suggest that the language in the last sentence of rule 11 was chosen advisably."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3765.336,3770.564,Was a presentence report available to the defendant in this counsel?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3770.564,3785.499,"Under a contemporaneous amendment as the court knows of Rule 32 (a), the trial judge has told that he may make the presentence report available as I have requested."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3785.499,3786.392,In this case?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3786.392,3788.577,"No, here was not made available to the defendant."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3788.577,3797.234,How do we know what the judge said that he actually got that even from a presentence report which is not available to the defendant?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3805.636,3807.284,"That certainly is, it's not precluded."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3807.284,3812.848,"Certainly doesn't show that he got it from any illegal way, does it?"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3814.241,3815.067,No.
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3832.695,3844.07,What is there in this record to support the statement that the judge is satisfied with the fact that he didn't properly keep his books but kept them intentionally wrong?
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3854.323,3856.832,"There is very little, we have to --"
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3856.832,3860.822,"There is nothing, isn't that correct?"
1968.43,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3860.822,3864.767,"There is nothing in the ordinary sense of evidence, yes."
1968.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3864.767,3869.828,Alright.
1968.43,2,36303,maurice_j_mccarthy,,3872.724,3877.227,If I might make two brief points Your Honor.
