1965.471,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,16.34,"The City of Greenwood, Mississippi, Petitioner versus Willie Peacock et al and number 649, Willie Peacock et al., Petitioners versus City of Greenwood."
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,18.297,22.307,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1965.471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,728.409,743.569,"Well, it is possible is it not to read Section 1 of 1443 to say something pretty much right along those lines and that is to read it the way Judge Sobeloff in the Fourth Circuit suggested and that it might be read."
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,743.569,747.477,"Your Honor, I'll come to that in a moment but let me say this --"
1965.471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,747.477,747.612,Come (Voice Overlap)
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,747.612,757.207,"This Court in seven cases, in seven straight cases have held that statute the denial and inability to enforce relief to the state court."
1965.471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,757.207,758.738,(Voice Overlap) state court.
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,758.738,759.309,Yes sir.
1965.471,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,759.309,762.474,"Because as I say as a matter of reading it, it is possible to read it the other way, is it not?"
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,762.474,763.605,Now in which one -- yes sir.
1965.471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.649,977.362,[Inaudible]
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,977.362,978.538,I don't know sir.
1965.471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.481,985.536,[Inaudible]
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,985.536,985.928,Yes sir.
1965.471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,985.928,989.121,[Inaudible]
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,989.121,991.439,I don't know sir.
1965.471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,999.712,1001.651,[Inaudible]
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1001.651,1020.263,"I don't know that either sir, but the fact that I'm getting at is that Congress since 1879 has not amended that statute, has reenacted it and therefore it appears to us, it certainly endorsed the opinions of this Court which have been settled law in the United States."
1965.471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.897,1071.977,What would you do in case [Inaudible]
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1071.977,1086.839,"I think under the liberal interpretation given this statute by this Court in those seven cases, you would say that the state court would follow, you just presume the state court would follow that state statute and therefore you'd say that you could remove."
1965.471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1086.839,1090.92,[Inaudible]
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1090.92,1091.273,Yes sir.
1965.471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.045,1103.022,[Inaudible]
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1103.022,1123.275,"No sir, but they said this that in any case in which you could point to a state constitutional provision or statute as interpreted by the highest court of the State or as reasonably read which would cause -- if the state court followed it, would cause you to be denied or unable to enforce your equal civil right that then the case was removable."
1965.471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.275,1126.554,[Inaudible]
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1126.554,1127.611,"No sir, certainly not."
1965.471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.611,1131.18,[Inaudible]
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1131.18,1133.472,And follow the state statute.
1965.471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1200.288,1202.545,What happens in the indictment?
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1208.431,1209.478,Yes sir.
1965.471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1209.776,1211.621,[Inaudible]
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1211.621,1212.382,That's right.
1965.471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1223.67,1232.608,[Inaudible]
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1232.608,1234.975,"Well, his petition doesn't make out any case for removal."
1965.471,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1240.647,1245.745,May I put a case to you if it may?
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1294.185,1311.477,"I would say they could be removed if he could point as this Court has held to a state constitutional provision or statute which he followed by the state court in his case, would result in the denial of some right conferred on him by some statute that the United States provided the equal civil rights."
1965.471,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1311.477,1325.615,"Well, that maybe a gloss with some of our earlier decisions has put on the removal statute, but doesn't the removal statute speak in terms of the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right like free exercise a religion in my case."
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1325.615,1326.38,No sir.
1965.471,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1334.894,1345.921,"The mere fact of the arrest and the prosecution is unconstitutional taking at the face value of the allegation, is it an unconstitutional deprivation?"
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1345.921,1351.066,"Yes sir, that is, but the Congress hasn't given you removal jurisdiction in such a case."
1965.471,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1351.066,1352.4,"Well, that's a question in this case, I guess."
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1352.4,1352.744,Yes sir.
1965.471,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1528.391,1539.421,"Mr. Lott, I don't read Circuit Judge Bell's opinion that way and I'd like to get your help on this."
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1682.48,1683.307,Your Honor --
1965.471,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1683.307,1694.773,And I don't -- the question I'm asking is whether you differ with that reading of this or whether your position is that that amounts to an inquiry into the motive of the prosecution.
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1694.773,1698.913,My disagreement with that is on this basis.
1965.471,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1721.872,1722.059,Yes.
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1722.059,1722.81,And --
1965.471,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1722.81,1732.766,The Circuit Judge Bell's opinion says that that discrimination with respect to grand jury selection was not based on any state statute or constitution.
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1732.766,1733.219,That's right.
1965.471,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1734.008,1736.491,I'm not suggesting I agree with that course.
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1736.491,1750.164,"Now, in this case he's saying that when a police officer brings a charge and not a grand jury but a police officer brings a charge improperly that that is a distinction in which those seven cases don't apply to it that they only --"
1965.471,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1750.164,1751.259,That's what he's saying.
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1751.259,1751.672,"Yes sir, but now--"
1965.471,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1751.672,1759.637,He says that that is the application of a state statute in an invidious way.
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1759.637,1776.854,"Well now, in the seven cases that was decided by this Court Your Honor, those law of state statutes, one against murder, one against rape and the charge in that case in all of those seven cases was improperly brought by the grand jury in the sense that the court officers stacked that grand jury."
1965.471,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1873.196,1875.185,"Mr. Lott, may I ask you?"
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1881.381,1881.649,No sir.
1965.471,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1881.649,1883.408,Repealed at 1874?
1965.471,0,27492,hardy_lott,,1883.408,1906.186,"I didn't know that Your Honor until I read the case which is not yet reported of the -- I forget the title of it – it is Raines versus the City of Danville from the Fourth Circuit -- Baines, I said Raines, it's Baines, B-A-I-N-E-S."
1965.471,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1930.275,1934.299,Mr. Smith.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,1934.299,1939.542,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1965.471,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2574.306,2586.356,"Mr. Smith, why do we have to allege in your petition to remove this back to the -- or to get the federal court to think --"
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2586.356,2590.877,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that what you have to do is like the statute says."
1965.471,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2599.056,2600.188,I beg your pardon.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2603.346,2605.342,"Short, brief, concise statement --"
1965.471,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2605.342,2605.935,Yes.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2605.935,2628.401,"-- of the grounds upon which you remove but I think if you track the language of the statute, I think if you simply make the allegation like I did in Peacock that you've been deprived of certain constitutional rights and I said, you've been deprived of the right -- is denied, I'm saying denied."
1965.471,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2646.017,2648.872,What statute is unconstitutional here?
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2648.872,2661.175,"Well, I was saying that the statute, to be frank with you in the Peacock case, I think that I had reference to the statute under which he was being charged this courthouse picketing statute, not courthouse picketing but the blocking the sidewalk statute."
1965.471,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2661.175,2661.433,Alright.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2661.433,2689.215,"But I think that it can be reasonably inferred Mr. Chief Justice that I was also talking about the fact that he was going to be tried under a system of strict racial segregation because in that paragraph by saying this statute is vague and definitely unconstitutional on its face, it's unconstitutional and arbitrarily applied and used and is enforced in this instance as a part and parcel of the unconstitutional and strict policy of racial segregation of the State of Mississippi in the City of Greenwood."
1965.471,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2711.726,2719.71,"Well, now assume that the State comes in and denies that in these general terms as you have alleged here."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2719.71,2719.962,Yes sir.
1965.471,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2719.962,2721.753,Now what is the procedure?
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2722.573,2736.941,"My thoughts on the procedure would be that if I have to defend that, if I was the removing petitioner, I'd sit down and institute a hearing on the jury selection process in that county and I'd also call in the sheriff and I'd call in the law enforcement official."
1965.471,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2815.226,2822.048,The reason I ask that was because I understood counsel in the case just before yours --
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2822.048,2822.298,Yes sir.
1965.471,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2822.298,2843.308,-- to say that he didn't think that was necessary that this applied not because of discrimination but because it applied now to all states because Congress had made an irrebuttable presumption that it was necessary to do that.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2844.355,2844.636,No sir.
1965.471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2884.736,2906.524,[Inaudible]
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2906.524,2907.338,Yes sir.
1965.471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.338,2911.081,"For example, we say that we do it in a petit jury."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2911.081,2911.695,Right.
1965.471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.695,2919.535,Or I suppose you would also say [Inaudible]
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2919.535,2919.908,Yes sir.
1965.471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.91,2926.214,[Inaudible]
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2926.214,2927.512,I think it could arguably.
1965.471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2931.064,2936.774,[Inaudible]
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2936.774,2938.015,Yes sir and it might work out.
1965.471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.789,2942.427,[Inaudible]
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2942.427,2944.243,"Well, that's right."
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2958.507,2965.188,"Mr. Smith, do I gather correctly, you're asking this you have it said so, overrule the Rives-Powers claim?"
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2965.188,2968.118,"Yes, I don't see the basis for those cases."
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2968.118,2971.349,"You don't suggest that can be distinguished, you just think we have to overrule it."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,2971.349,2972.014,I don't think so.
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2995.435,2997.551,May I ask one other question Mr. Smith.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3009.767,3009.898,Yes sir.
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3009.898,3016.347,And that's been concluded that it is affirmatively that state courts would be unfair then what did you say what happened to Plessy.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3016.347,3018.445,I'd try the case in the federal court.
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3018.445,3019.484,Try them on the merits?
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3019.484,3020.271,Yes sir.
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3020.271,3022.548,You wouldn't dismiss the prosecutions?
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3022.548,3029.282,Well after a man is charged for example with rape or murder and he is indicted.
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3038.726,3040.342,"Well, take that case for example."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3049.639,3050.298,Yes in this case --
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3050.298,3057.774,"And that they were not engaged actually in obstructing any sidewalks in any manner that would not be privilege, is that it?"
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3057.774,3059.982,No more than you'd be doing it by walking down the sidewalk yourself.
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3059.982,3060.203,Yes.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3069.284,3070.649,"Well, I think that will be a dismissal there."
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3070.649,3071.053,Dismissal --
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3071.053,3072.614,I think it would be a dismissal there.
1965.471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3072.614,3078.967,"But if it was a petty jury question or a punishment question, you are to go ahead and you help the court try the case."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3082.616,3086.953,"Yes, I can't understand the previous counsel talking about sending it back for trial in the state court when that's the --"
1965.471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3086.953,3088.385,He doesn't mean to send it back.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3095.987,3096.145,Oh!
1965.471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3097.599,3107.956,You would also say there should be a remand if you -- the fact you put on a case about discrimination in the petit jury and the judge ruled against you and he was affirmed on appeal.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3113.095,3117.0,You mean if the judge found there was no state discrimination and he was affirmed --
1965.471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3117.0,3117.38,Yes.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3117.38,3119.978,Then I think the state court would be the proper forum.
1965.471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3119.978,3121.41,There's jurisdictional issue.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3121.41,3124.031,"That's right, but all we're looking for is a fair trial."
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3124.031,3127.913,Is that -- may I ask you this question?
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3181.038,3186.098,I wouldn't put the state court on trial anymore than the recusation statute to do now.
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3230.12,3231.39,Is there anything --
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3231.39,3232.02,"Go ahead, I'm sorry."
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3232.02,3232.954,"Alright, sorry."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3271.229,3271.58,Yes sir.
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3318.559,3339.937,So was it -- would you limit removal of possibility under 1443 to situations in which the action for which a person is being prosecuted in the state court where that action takes place in a civil rights context.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3344.584,3345.083,Yes sir.
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3345.083,3349.349,Or a case of murder with no civil rights connection at all.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3363.566,3379.291,"I think it's just as important because if you take a Negro in the south is charged and one of this country parishes or counties where no Negroes have ever served and we held a hearing in the Fifth Circuit in December, but we have five or seven cases Button case and a whole bunch of others."
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3386.333,3386.756,Either you --
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3386.756,3387.743,And we know about it.
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3387.743,3388.186,Yes.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3398.622,3399.197,I think so.
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3415.081,3422.356,"I think I maybe wrong but I thought that in Rachel, there were a couple of White persons, civil rights workers."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3422.356,3423.064,"Well, it might have been."
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3424.991,3425.77,Two in here.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3425.77,3427.447,Two in Peacock case are White.
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3427.447,3451.885,"And I suppose also that this would apply -- let me just assume this situation in which a White man was arrested for some racial business, miscegenation or whatever it might be or some crime involving a person of the opposite race."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3451.885,3452.322,Right.
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3452.322,3457.356,That 1443 would theoretically be available there.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3457.356,3458.11,I think so.
1965.471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3541.092,3552.099,Are you relying on any particular part of 1443 or any particular language or just on this general history in purpose as you understand?
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3552.099,3558.956,"Well, the language is pretty broad Mr. Justice Stewart and I'm relying upon a lot of the history."
1965.471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3592.769,3595.399,How would it be true even in a rape or a murder case you think?
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3595.399,3596.262,Sir?
1965.471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3596.262,3604.372,"If you could show that the arrest was -- the arresting officer was segregationist, do you think that would be true in a rape case or a murder case (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3604.372,3607.059,"No, I don't think that apply in that kind of a case."
1965.471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3608.389,3608.554,Well --
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3608.554,3609.557,I don't think that a (Voice Overlap)
1965.471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3609.557,3611.817,-- on what language (Voice Overlap).
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3620.612,3633.56,"I rely upon the second part there that says, “Cannot enforce in the courts of such state against any person who cannot enforce in the courts of such state, a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens.”"
1965.471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3650.942,3656.248,You don't then rely on Section 2 of 1443 at all or do you also rely on that?
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3656.248,3663.602,"Well, I think that Willie Peacock and his group, I say in the second part of my brief that they were possibly commentators too."
1965.471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3723.216,3724.52,Are you talking about Section 2?
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3724.52,3726.035,"Yes sir, you've asked me about it."
1965.471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3726.035,3743.826,"Yes, I did and how do you -- do I understand then that you would agree that the language of Section 2 applies only to those who are officers of the federal government or acting under the authority or as officers?"
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3743.826,3744.154,No sir.
1965.471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3746.098,3749.598,Posse comitatus -- members of a posse comitatus as you say?
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3749.598,3753.39,"Well, I think I make a pretty good argument on that posse comitatus -- comitatus."
1965.471,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3753.39,3754.858,"Comitatus, if you will."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3758.064,3770.786,But I don't disassociate myself from the Solicitor General's position in this case which I think is a very well reasoned argument which Mr. Claiborne will bring out after I finish about how it applies to everybody.
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3830.182,3841.589,"Mr. Smith [Inaudible] situations where Negro is indeed out, drumming up registration."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3841.589,3842.416,Yes sir.
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3842.416,3846.423,But he is guilty of some violence.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3849.869,3859.161,"I've got a case right now where a civil rights worker registered to vote in Forrest County, Mississippi and he filled out his registration form and only that it says “Have you ever been convicted of any crime?”"
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3894.051,3900.141,"Well, that -- that's a situation as I understood you earlier that would be a trial on new merits in the federal court."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3900.141,3900.689,Yes sir.
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3900.689,3913.015,"I'm trying to think of a situation in which as I understand your petition here, it is that you've established in the federal court that the activity was all protected activity."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3913.015,3913.535,Yes sir.
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3913.535,3914.894,Even in that circumstance --
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3914.894,3915.289,Yes.
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3915.289,3918.246,The result would have to be a dismissal of the prosecution.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3918.246,3919.031,That's right.
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3919.031,3929.867,"And suppose in carrying on protected activity, some overstepped the violence then what happens in the Federal District Court?"
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3929.867,3937.568,"Well, I think that -- you mean if they've act -- they may have actually committed a crime in the process of protected activity."
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3937.568,3940.457,(Voice Overlap) with someone for example.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3940.457,3946.35,"Well, I don't think that just because they're doing civil rights work makes them immune from the prosecution (Voice Overlap) I think they'd be prosecuted."
1965.471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3946.35,3950.702,They actually block the streets or block the sidewalk.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3950.702,3954.778,"I think under those circumstances, they would have to be prosecuted."
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3954.778,3957.233,In the state court.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3957.233,3962.656,"Well, it depends if they're going to go to -- I don't want to one of those state juries now."
1965.471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3965.269,3974.309,"That's for a different reason, but you think any criminal case in the federal court would come down in putting any difference on what the charge was, wouldn't you?"
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,3974.309,3975.429,I'm afraid I'd have to.
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3986.625,4005.071,"Well, this is only a Mississippi case, but this is I suggest not merely a Mississippi decision that would come out your way and I'm trying to figure out what would happened let's say in the Watson situation where there were some legitimate protected conduct of some kind but it was in response to a violence --"
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4005.071,4005.403,Mr. Smith --
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4005.403,4006.749,-- that there was a removal.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,4006.749,4009.913,"Well, I would say that -- I would say that it have to be tried."
1965.471,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4011.351,4012.528,Tried where?
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,4012.528,4025.411,In the federal court to get a fair forum unless there was a fair state forum but not just because they were involved in protected activities and then overstepped the boundaries is not going to -- I don't think that you can protect them any further.
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4025.411,4048.548,"Mr. Smith, am I correct in understanding that your position makes it rather irrelevant what the particular charge is whether the person is arrested for an ordinary everyday murder or an ordinary everyday rape or for violence and breach of peace or what not?"
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,4103.377,4104.912,"Yes sir, it would be."
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4104.912,4108.64,And it doesn't matter what the basic charge is.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,4108.64,4110.416,"Yes, I will say again Mr. Justice Fortas."
1965.471,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4120.43,4121.136,Right.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,4121.136,4123.863,Now maybe Congress shouldn't have done it.
1965.471,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4129.26,4131.653,May I ask what you mean by that?
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,4136.852,4137.794,I think --
1965.471,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4137.794,4141.488,"All White people, all in the labor unions."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,4143.758,4153.051,"Mr. Justice Black, I think that the history -- I'd like to be able to see it removed if you had due process as the question but I don't think that's historically correct."
1965.471,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4162.301,4171.246,"So you don't think that a labor union is arrested under the same circumstances, made the same allegations, would he have a right to remove it or not, labor union?"
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,4171.246,4172.872,Yes.
1965.471,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4185.56,4210.285,"Your argument seems to me to be in that forceful argument that this was -- this is always said for the protection of the colored people and because of the situation which existed and then it applies to them so that they should have a right to have a case removed whenever they can -- whenever they allege, they can't get a fair trial in that place."
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,4210.285,4210.597,Yes sir.
1965.471,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4210.597,4211.703,Or any reason whatever.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,4211.703,4221.436,"And they ought to be entitle -- in addition to that -- yes sir, in answer your question then in addition to that, they're ought to be entitled to keep that case in the federal court if they can prove their allegations."
1965.471,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4228.347,4239.453,Of course that's putting a gloss on the statute because the statute reads in terms as you know against any person who is denied the right of equal protection.
1965.471,1,18082,benjamin_e_smith,,4239.453,4245.64,"Well, Mr. Justice Douglas, I'm getting a lot of opposition from lawyers generally and from this Court."
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4297.238,4301.01,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4617.304,4633.491,"Mr. Claiborne, haven't some to those cases -- didn't some of those cases involve these provisionary findings about the grand jury where anything that happened to the grand jury had already occurred in denying the petition for removal?"
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4633.491,4635.116,That is true Mr. Justice White.
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4635.375,4643.528,And the court -- the state court relies on the absence of the statute to rule properly in a motion to dismiss the indictment.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4643.528,4669.93,But the attitude or the approach this Court took even though a motion to quash in some of those cases are actually been denied with reference to the discriminatory selection of the grand jury was that this was still a correctable error and that the prediction that we justify removal was a prediction that the Court at some later stage of the proceeding or that the Appellate State Court would decline to correct the error.
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4669.93,4677.767,"Yes, but all the time that amounted to the alleged deprivation had already taken place and was adjudicated -- it was adjudicable right then."
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4677.767,4679.132,"But Mr. Justice White, this --"
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4679.132,4681.399,Isn't that true or not?
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4681.399,4689.948,Not all of the conduct because this Court viewed the conduct which were justified removal as a final refusal to quash as it were.
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4708.625,4711.301,That could be true in the cases you have here.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4711.301,4713.318,That is true.
1965.471,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4757.841,4763.232,"That was in the First Amendment area, was it?"
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4763.232,4763.788,If those cases --
1965.471,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4763.788,4763.88,In Dombrowski?
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4763.88,4770.404,"If those cases have been --I think largely, if not, entirely confined to the First Amendment area."
1965.471,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4770.404,4773.662,"Well, do you suggest this is First Amendment (Voice Overlap)?"
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4773.662,4774.744,No.
1965.471,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4790.511,4792.145,What exercise of what right?
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4792.145,4798.531,"Well, here, we're talking about as far as the petition is alleged, registration for voting primarily."
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4807.257,4811.416,Are all of these people [Inaudible]
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4811.416,4815.272,"I don't know that they were all prospective registrants, Mr. Justice White."
1965.471,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4903.183,4920.841,"Your version of Section 2 or I suppose under any version of Section 2 of 1443, a person charged with murder or with rape or with burglary just could not make a case for removal, could he?"
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4920.841,4926.396,Certainly not in the latter two instances but it's conceivable --
1965.471,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4926.396,4936.154,Well I suppose there could be such a thing as rape in the furtherance of somebody's -- in line with the civil rights but it's rather difficult to imagine.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4936.154,4938.275,I would have difficulty with the -
1965.471,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4938.275,4939.814,Or murder of burglary.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4939.814,4943.866,"But in the case of murder, it could conceivably be a case of self-defense."
1965.471,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4943.866,4944.395,That's --
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4944.395,4950.256,"The charge would be murder, the petition was denied that it was murder but would admit it was homicide."
1965.471,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4970.821,4972.589,"Now, I suppose -- just to finish this."
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4990.611,4992.262,Not on either of the clauses that I've mentioned.
1965.471,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4992.262,4995.254,"Not under either of the clauses as you now read them, is that right?"
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4995.254,5008.923,"No, of course, under the Inability to Enforce Clause if they were the kind of demonstration of racial discrimination in the selection of the jury that satisfied the cases in this Court to Rives."
1965.471,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5028.012,5032.079,Right.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5032.079,5041.164,Now it seems to us that what we contend for under the Color of Authority Clause presents the classical case for removal.
1965.471,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5318.822,5335.329,Excuse me Mr. Claiborne but are you saying that the allegations allege an equal protection right and then the case in the federal court want to go ahead and try it.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5345.312,5345.543,I think that it --
1965.471,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5345.543,5347.291,Because I don't -- is that what you're saying?
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5347.291,5349.24,That is largely what I was saying.
1965.471,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5349.24,5351.69,Because you said then you go ahead with the jury trial.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5354.382,5354.799,No sir.
1965.471,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5355.501,5367.809,"So that -- well, are the allegations of the petition for removal to be taken as conclusive?"
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5374.227,5378.969,"Well, I think there are probably several distinguishable situations Mr. Justice Fortas."
1965.471,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5439.194,5464.649,You are then saying that if the petition for removal adequately sets forth a case for removal regardless of the contest -- of contesting allegations by the State and then the -- there would be no remand to the state court and the trial won't go ahead on the merits in the federal court.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5464.649,5465.51,Yes Mr. Justice Fortas.
1965.471,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5495.188,5515.365,And then in this delightful a la carte menu that you and Mr. Smith and Mr. Amsterdam have presented to us this day and I suppose your position is substantially closer to Mr. Amsterdam's and Mr. Smith's.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5515.365,5518.308,Except perhaps on this one point Mr. Justice Fortas.
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5531.333,5549.337,"Mr. Claiborne, what about the case where it's intended to the removal is justified because otherwise a valid state law, a trespass or something else has been applied in a discriminatory manner and that's the allegation in the removal petition."
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5565.366,5565.526,In --
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5565.526,5579.472,"-- from what you said in your brief that you would try out merely the additional question someway either by the judge or the jury and if the allegations were proved, you would dismiss the case entirely."
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5579.472,5579.997,That is under the --
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5579.997,5583.255,If they have to prove them you have to remand it to the state court.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5583.255,5584.666,I may have misstated.
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5598.5,5599.438,And those --
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5599.438,5602.924,"And there, we would have a preliminary hearing or --"
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5602.924,5604.195,By the judge or the jury.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5604.195,5607.772,By the judge in which the issue is not guilt or innocence.
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5607.772,5608.176,Right.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5608.176,5611.138,The issue is unequal application of the law.
1965.471,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5611.138,5617.26,"And that issue would all -- would be determined I gather under your brief, by the judge without a jury is that right?"
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5617.26,5618.138,I think that is correct.
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5618.138,5633.089,And you would say also that you -- that where the issue is whether a conduct is protected by a federal statute as in Rachel that the allegation is that -- that this could never be a Section 1 case.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5633.6,5636.233,"Well, I don't think it makes any difference Mr. Justice White if --"
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5636.233,5640.403,It's not a difference on how it's tried out in the federal court under your theory.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5640.403,5658.612,Even in a case under Section 2 if the prosecution's version of the facts makes out albeit a violation of the trespass law but at the same time conduct which is clearly privileged by the --
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5658.612,5661.122,Sure.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5661.122,5664.549,"-- federal law, there would be no decision by a jury."
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5668.458,5669.512,How does this consent us?
1965.471,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5673.225,5674.931,Whether it was violence.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5674.931,5681.176,I should think that this is the preferable solution in such a case is to leave that issue to the judge.
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5681.176,5681.718,So that -- so that --
1965.471,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5681.718,5682.727,In the federal court.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5682.727,5683.35,In the federal court.
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5683.35,5687.371,Whether you view it under one or two.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5687.371,5696.934,"Well, I would not view that case as being sufficiently clear to fall within the denial clause under one and therefore we would bring under two."
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5696.934,5704.442,"Mr. Claiborne, would you mind telling me what the procedure would be in this situation now."
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5736.412,5756.973,"Mr. Chief Justice, insofar as they sought removal under the theory which was upheld by the court below, it would not matter what they were doing and they would simply have to show that they were prosecuted whereas others engaged in similar conduct that is Whites engaged in similar conduct would not have been prosecuted."
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5767.91,5775.202,This as I understand it is for operating vehicles with improper license tags.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5775.202,5776.501,I didn't (Voice Overlap) answer.
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5776.501,5790.133,Just what would you have to prove as a practical matter there that there were other licensed people with improper license tags running around the community or what?
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5790.133,5801.62,I assume that they would have to either show -- either deny the guilt of the charge that is denied that they failed to have the proper license tag.
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5801.62,5807.811,"Well, is that sufficient to raise civil rights question for the Court to pass on?"
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5807.811,5811.178,"No, that alone would not."
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5874.249,5879.365,Would that give them any right to have unregistered license?
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5879.365,5886.096,"No, that I think would have to be combined with the denial of guilt under the local ordinance, but all I'm showing is --"
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5886.096,5896.689,But would you try the question of guilt on the -- in determining whether they're entitled to the remand?
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5896.689,5898.245,Not --
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5898.245,5899.45,Or removal?
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5899.45,5908.498,"Under Section 2, Mr. Chief Justice, I would have the entire question determined at trial that is to say by a jury in the federal court."
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5908.498,5908.634,I know --
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5908.634,5936.803,"This is assuming that they could particularize which I find difficult to visualize, to particularize the claim of exercising the right -- advocacy of voting while driving a car, but they might be inheriting respective voters back and forth or in some other way engaged in civil rights activity albeit driving a car."
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5936.803,5959.15,But would there have to be a preliminary hearing before the judge to determine whether this charge was within the civil rights of these people or would you go ahead and let them try it and determine it on -- before the jury.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,5959.15,5976.361,"Provided that their allegations were sufficient to on its face make out a claim of privilege in judge's mind now, because the judge views the petition and he there -- by allowing it or disallowing it, he makes a ruling as to the scope of the federal privilege."
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6009.536,6037.219,"Well, would they say before the question of remand was determined that there was a prosecutor down there who is prejudiced against Negroes and he prosecutes us more vigorously than others and there's a judge down there who is unfair in his decisions so far as Negroes are concerned or the sheriff is unfair and so forth."
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6052.742,6079.555,"I would suppose that that sort of evidence Mr. Chief Justice would be relevant in the removal under the Denial Clause, however, I would think it -- I would think any judge should properly be reluctant to remove a case on this testing out of personalities which is a delicate matter and which it should be avoided it seems to me if it all possible."
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6079.555,6079.851,Yes.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6092.781,6112.1,If your -- if I understand correctly Your Honor's question of -- I take it to be what would show the discriminatory application of the statutes to such an extent as to justify the federal judge in halting the prosecution after removal is sustained.
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6112.1,6120.236,Whatever you have to -- whatever you have to allege and prove in order to keep it in the federal courts?
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6120.236,6172.192,"I would think that the defendant would have to show that this is a statute which show that some period of time, has not been invoked in the same circumstances with respect to a different class of persons much as this Court found with respect to this grading statute involving Cox versus Louisiana in which the Court found, as I remember it, that on the evidence -- in the record from that case that no prosecution for violation of the parade ordinance had been known in that community in Louisiana where the parade was not by Negroes or their sympathizers."
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6179.554,6188.975,Suppose it was a crime where they do normally prosecute people for that kind of a crime.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6188.975,6219.474,"In that case, Your Honor, there would be no basis in my view for removal under the Denial Clause and as I say, only a basis for removal under the other clause if the defendant denied that he had violated the local law and showed that he was at the time engaged in protected civil rights activity by which I mean activity protected by law providing for equal rights in terms."
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6219.474,6222.95,I'm just thinking of the ramifications of these things.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6254.107,6264.998,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would say that that's too remotely related to the concern of the statute to justify removal at all."
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6265.876,6270.889,It's pretty hard to draw a line of this between one and another.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6270.889,6281.827,"Well, these matters, I suggest to the Court which need exploration which need to be articulated in the lower federal courts which need in this case to be articulated."
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6329.927,6340.538,"Mr. Claiborne, I just read the facts alleged in this petition for removal."
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6352.152,6354.25,I think not Your Honor.
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6370.005,6372.79,What fact you need to be headed to us.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6372.79,6374.86,"Well, if Your Honor is speaking of the Peacock --"
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6374.86,6376.117,That's what I'm speaking of.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6376.117,6396.311,"-- petition, I would want to know, was the judge when -- or the question of removal was before me in what way, in what numbers these people were picketing."
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6435.861,6437.555,What is that?
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6437.555,6456.787,So that I as the judge could determine whether assuming these facts could be true which the jury will later test if federally protected activity is stated or rather a violation of state law which -- as to which there is no immunity.
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6456.787,6460.239,I guess I misunderstood you.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6474.424,6479.854,"That is as to our position under subsection (2) that is the position, yes Mr. Justice Black."
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6479.854,6494.226,"In other words, anyone by alleging the facts, the facts enough to bring them under the statute whether they are true or not, gets a removal and is tried in the federal court."
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6494.226,6499.514,"Yes, subject to it because it's a verified petition subject to the penalties of perjury for alleging --"
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6499.514,6503.774,What I'm talking about is right at the trial in the federal court.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6503.774,6505.514,His right to trial in federal court.
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6505.514,6507.774,It depends all together on allegation.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6507.774,6510.308,In the same way that removal and diversity jurisdiction --
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6510.308,6510.737,How could the court --
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6510.737,6511.814,-- depends on allegations.
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6511.814,6527.101,How could the courts be protected if that is the purpose of it and that's the interpretation from having hundreds and hundreds of cases imposed on them filed every year when there's really no justification for it in fact.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6527.101,6529.08,"Well, Mr. Justice Black, defendants --"
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6529.08,6533.51,"That would be no excuse if Congress has said, I agree to that."
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6533.51,6546.249,"But more than that Mr. Justice Black, the defendants will remove to the federal court only if they do have basis for thinking their trial in the state court will be unfair to them."
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6546.249,6547.981,You say they will do that?
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6547.981,6549.5,There's no advantage to removal.
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6549.5,6551.12,(Voice Overlap) pretty active.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6563.216,6563.702,I would think --
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6563.702,6566.622,If all they have to do is allege it.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6566.622,6585.681,"Well, there are some defendants who take seriously their constitutional right to a speedy trial Mr. Justice Black and who want acquittal and to who inordinate delays and inconveniences are not an attraction if they feel secured in the local court they will get justice."
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6585.681,6589.131,You're going on the assumption the defendants wouldn't take advantage of that.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6589.131,6594.432,I'm sure that Your Honor is correct in assuming that many defendants will take advantage of it.
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6600.636,6601.958,It's an action I think.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6610.671,6612.482,Guilty defendants Mr. Justice Black.
1965.471,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6612.482,6616.955,Any defendant.[Laughter]
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6616.955,6636.59,"Mr. Claiborne, do you agree with Mr. Alexander that this applies all over the country to every state in the union or do you think that it's restrictive to a certain number of states where Congress has felt that these rights have been abused."
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6636.59,6640.274,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not think it is sectional legislation."
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6665.775,6668.812,That manner of proof would be the same for the country.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6668.812,6669.653,Exactly.
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6669.653,6670.712,Yes.
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6670.712,6690.311,"Mr. Claiborne, do you suggest that all of these cases in the Peacock case, in this proceeding are sustainable under Section 1 like the Fifth Circuit said it was or do you think you must resort to Section 2 for any of these cases?"
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6690.311,6696.196,"I think that, Mr. Justice White, must abide the hearing which the Fifth Circuit has --"
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6696.196,6704.592,So you think we could treat this case in the abstract and set down some ground rules and remand.
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6704.592,6710.98,"Mr. Justice White, let me emphasize that the remand makes a big difference, the terms of the remand makes a big difference."
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6720.57,6735.797,"You have to think that they didn't say that -- they didn't say that if discriminatory prosecutions were shown, they were all sustainable they're all removal under Section 1."
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6735.797,6766.992,"But it may well turn out Mr. Justice White that some of the defendants will be unable to prove the discriminatory application of these statutes as to them in which event they, in our view, should have available to them not a dismissal which would be the result of that remand order but a trial in the federal court if on the more particularized petition which I would require, they can show that they were engaged in protected activity -- activity protected federal law."
1965.471,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6766.992,6781.884,"And by the way, on removal in diversity cases, you certainly don't just hear the case on federal court on allegations insofar as the jurisdiction of the Court is concerned."
1965.471,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,6810.023,6823.385,"Well, I suppose I should say that in the criminal case, it seems over more fitting that the facts should be tried by the jury at least those facts which do go to the merits."
1965.471,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6823.385,6826.519,Very well.
