1982.81-1489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We will hear arguments next in Xerox Corporation against Harris County, Texas, and Houston."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,84.237,110.285,"Chief Justice, may it please the Court, this case concerns Xerox copiers that were always in foreign commerce, never in domestic commerce or part of the common mass of property in the state of Texas, paused only temporarily in Texas, and were stored in a Customs bonded warehouse, always under the custody and control of the United States Customs Service."
1982.81-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.39,207.265,"Mr. Hoddinott, you used the term ""Customs bonded warehouse in Houston"", and I know the Court of Civil Appeals opinion certainly speaks in those terms, too."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,212.502,217.24,It is a warehouse that is maintained by a warehouseman.
1982.81-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.534,240.752,Is the warehouseman generally a private individual?
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,240.752,241.286,Yes.
1982.81-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,241.286,244.238,And how about the building in which it is stored?
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,246.121,248.29,"Generally, I believe it is, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,249.806,253.177,And what is the distinction between the numbers?
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,258.379,264.984,"There are, I believe, eight Customs bonded warehouses, Your Honor, and they are for varying purposes."
1982.81-1489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,276.273,278.042,What is the nature of the bond?
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,278.042,280.677,"Money, I believe, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,280.677,281.494,Is it?
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,284.963,285.981,It's for the benefit of the United States.
1982.81-1489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,288.517,294.937,"I take it if you break that bond, you commit a federal offense."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,297.706,299.639,"Your Honor, I don't know."
1982.81-1489,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,299.639,306.561,Why didn't Xerox store this property in Mexico?
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,306.561,310.93,"The record is silent on that, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,318.536,321.488,"That is your basic point, I gather, is it?"
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,321.488,322.421,"It is, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,322.421,329.492,"Under the import and export clause, that is unlike Michelin Tires, for example, which were... I gather, from the domestic market."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,329.492,330.825,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,330.825,331.425,These are not.
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,331.425,332.075,These were not.
1982.81-1489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,337.979,340.479,"Now, why do you say that makes a difference?"
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,340.479,356.989,"--Because they are totally in foreign commerce, and all of the interstate commerce cases that have been cited by the Appellees, I submit, are inapplicable, and this Court has said in Japan Line, your honor, that the constitutional analysis will be more extensive when it is foreign commerce."
1982.81-1489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,356.989,367.844,"Now were there instructions... printed instructions with these things, as there are so often, that accompanied the machine?"
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,424.434,425.886,They are not at issue in this case.
1982.81-1489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,484.823,489.894,Does the record show how long some of these machines remained in the warehouse?
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,489.894,490.243,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,542.694,545.813,"Well, how about the ones that were there in three years?"
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,551.634,569.346,"I submit they are, Your Honor, because the law is that until they pass the barrier of paying the customs duty, it is as, as this Court said, it is as they... as if they never came into the country, they were detained at the border, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,569.346,588.973,"During that time, I presume that the Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department would have to come to the aid of the owner of the private warehouse in the event there was a break-in and Xerox's goods were going to be stolen, or in the event there was a fire that would have destroyed Xerox's goods."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,588.973,604.935,"There is no doubt about that, Your Honor, but the owner of that warehouse is also taxed, and we submit that Houston's services are supported by the common carrier that was used, by the warehouseman, by the stevedores, all of whom, we submit, are undoubtedly taxed by Houston."
1982.81-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,604.935,616.474,"But you say that this is different even though Xerox's stuff, if it had been destined for domestic use, you have paid taxes on it and it would be taxable."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,616.474,618.576,"I am sorry, I didn't follow the question, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,618.576,630.8,"If the same amount of Xerox computers had been stored in exactly the same warehouse but destined for domestic use, you, of course, have paid taxes on them."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,630.8,649.798,"When you say destined, Your Honor, if they had already passed the Customs barrier, and the duties had been paid, then I would agree, but until the Customs duties are paid, I submit they are not taxable."
1982.81-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,649.798,654.165,"But it makes no difference to your case even if they were in the Houston warehouse for 20 years, I take it."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,654.165,654.682,No.
1982.81-1489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,669.711,693.326,"Are you suggesting that in terms of the local protection, the local tax problem that Justice Rehnquist referred to, that all of that cost of protection, fire and police and others, are reflected in the rent that you're paying and is passed on to Xerox?"
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,693.326,713.538,"I submit that is so, Your Honor, and I also submit that as this Court said in Japan Line where you are talking about foreign commerce, where there is a need for federal uniformity, that Texas's remedy is with Congress, because we are talking about foreign commerce."
1982.81-1489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,713.538,732.6,"From your point of view, I take your argument to be that this is just legally and constitutionally the same as though these machines were in a big cargo airplane and happened to fly over the lower part of Florida."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,732.6,733.583,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,739.919,750.608,"Well, in the middle of the ocean it wouldn't have much contact with the continental United States, but in an airplane they would at least have some semblance of contact by flying over Key West."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,750.608,751.008,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,751.491,768.069,"Mr. Hoddinott, in Japan Lines, the Court said that California's tax on cargo containers that were only in the state less than three weeks would pass muster under the commerce clause, and were not in transit."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,777.025,802.325,"Because I submit, Your Honor, that pursuant to the Warehousing Act of 1846, Congress has said, we want to encourage foreign commerce, and in order to encourage that foreign commerce, we want to have transshipment of goods through our ports, and to encourage that transshipment, they said, you may keep those goods there for three years."
1982.81-1489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,802.325,807.711,You are resting your argument on the possible interference with national foreign policy then?
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,807.711,809.679,"That is certainly one of our arguments, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,898.037,909.512,"Mr. Hoddinott, I see in a footnote to your brief on Page 12 you mention that in 1978 Congress extended the period from three years to five years."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,909.512,910.445,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,910.445,917.785,Would that cover your case if it had been in effect when this situation arose?
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,917.785,918.568,"I believe it would, sir."
1982.81-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,918.568,924.855,"So that you could then store goods in Houston for five years, at least five years under your theory."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,924.855,926.056,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,926.056,935.579,"Well, I gather, Mr. Hoddinott, you would regard that as simply a regulation by Congress to that extent of foreign commerce."
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,935.579,936.512,"Yes, I would, sir."
1982.81-1489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,943.333,958.945,"Mr. Hoddinott, is there any risk of foreign retaliation against the United States for a tax policy of local government like this if there are American goods stored in some foreign country?"
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,958.945,969.65,"--I think there is a risk, Your Honor, perhaps not with respect to Xerox, because Xerox is a domestic corporation."
1982.81-1489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1051.953,1053.67,It shows what a big state Texas is.
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,1056.155,1080.371,"--We believe that for the reasons set forth in our brief, however, the regulation was still controlling during the relevant time period, and as this Court said in McGoldrick, there is no doubt that the Treasury regulation merely reflects Congress's intent to free the warehouses from state tax."
1982.81-1489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1087.775,1088.408,"Mr. Hoddinott, may I interrupt you?"
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,1093.576,1095.328,"The date was November 1st, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.799,1104.001,November 1st of this year?
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,1104.001,1104.734,Of this year.
1982.81-1489,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.703,1107.403,I see.
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,1112.273,1113.439,"Yes, it is, sir."
1982.81-1489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.593,1120.327,You just thought it was surplusage anyway.
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,1120.327,1121.493,"Pardon me, sir?"
1982.81-1489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.493,1123.945,You thought the footnote was surplusage anyway.
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,1128.397,1133.235,"We believe at the least it is that, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1143.824,1146.359,Do you think it is in any way related to the case?
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,1146.359,1157.516,"Since the Treasury Department did not say why they were deleting it, it may be an oversight for all I know, so I can't say that it is relevant, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1157.516,1162.82,"Counsel, I take it we have only one year's taxes involved here, do we not?"
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,1162.82,1163.87,No.
1982.81-1489,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1168.891,1169.341,Two.
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,1174.295,1175.095,"They have, sir."
1982.81-1489,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1175.095,1177.997,"Are you still using Buffalo, New York?"
1982.81-1489,0,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,1177.997,1180.199,I don't believe so.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,1730.23,1745.322,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Courts the crucial question for consideration is, does the State of Texas have the power to tax goods in Customs bonded warehouses."
1982.81-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1761.082,1769.521,"If that is so, Ms. Chapman, then what is the purpose of the bonded warehouse in relation to the operation of the Customs Service?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,1769.521,1777.174,The purpose of the bonded warehouse is to ensure that the government will collect its revenue duties.
1982.81-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1778.96,1779.91,The federal government.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,1779.91,1780.828,--The federal government.
1982.81-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1780.828,1781.412,The federal government will.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,1781.412,1796.255,The importer posts the bond as liquidated damages if it should fail to pay Customs duties or if the imports for some reason enter into domestic commerce.
1982.81-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1796.255,1802.925,"Could Texas have levied a duty, assessed a duty on this property when it came in from Mexico?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,1802.925,1806.611,The State of Texas has no power under the Constitution to assess a duty.
1982.81-1489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1813.281,1820.37,"Ms. Chapman, somewhere would you touch upon the issuance of the exemption letter by the county?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,1824.238,1824.938,--Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1824.938,1827.357,"Somewhere, would you touch on that?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,1832.844,1855.592,"The county's position did not... the county in 1976, prior to this Court's ruling in the Michelin decision, initially determined through a tax agent, initially determined that those goods were subject to tax immunity under Michelin... under Low v. Austin doctrine of governmental--"
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1855.592,1857.377,"You mean original package, Ms. Chapman?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,1857.377,1869.934,"--Yes, As a result of this Court's holding in Michelin, the county re-examined the taxability of those goods, and back assessed those goods for the year 1976."
1982.81-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1891.633,1920.45,"What would you say if these copiers had been taken on board ships out of some eastern port of Mexico, placed on the ships, destined for either this enclave in New York or for Argentina, but stopped for repairs or fuel in one of the Texas ports?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,1925.854,1928.056,We do not believe it can be taxed.
1982.81-1489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1936.412,1941.03,Do you have a free trade enclave in Texas?
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,1941.03,1947.719,"We have two, I believe, one in Galveston and one somewhere else."
1982.81-1489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1947.719,1953.54,"And your brief concedes that if these goods had been in such an enclave, that they would not be taxable."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,1953.54,1964.396,"No, we have re-examined the Foreign Trade Zone Act, and we do not know whether or not those goods would be subject to tax."
1982.81-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1996.617,1998.819,What is the purpose of the free trade zone?
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,1998.819,2012.544,The purpose of the free trade zone is to ameliorate or to compensate for the problems that we're having now.
1982.81-1489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2041.929,2047.3,"Well, what concessions does Texas give those who use the free trade zones in Texas?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2047.3,2060.226,"--The concessions are determined by the federal government, and we will... they are determined by the federal government."
1982.81-1489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2060.226,2060.626,Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2072.367,2073.117,"No, we are not."
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.771,2090.246,"Could you tell me, if you know, why the federal government provides for free trade zones in addition to bonded warehouses?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2100.518,2113.325,"Under the bonded warehouse... under our Customs bonded scheme, manufacturers cannot, under the... the word is manipulate."
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2119.463,2120.015,I see.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2120.015,2121.381,--And in a free trade zone--
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.381,2122.515,So they can't really work on them.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2122.515,2123.598,--Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.598,2124.198,I see.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2129.835,2130.652,"Yes, they do."
1982.81-1489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2130.652,2132.121,I see.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2168.627,2179.185,The Texas Constitution mandates that all property be taxed in a uniform and equal manner.
1982.81-1489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2237.471,2258.637,"In the McGoldrick case, it seemed to me that the Court relied on the footnote to the regulation that Mr. Hoddinott indicated is now being dropped, in saying that there was in effect pre-emption."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2261.589,2267.242,--McGoldrick in our opinion is an entirely different case.
1982.81-1489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2270.194,2278.864,How has the regulation changed the footnote to the regulation since McGoldrick other than the numbering?
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2278.864,2280.05,The Secretary--
1982.81-1489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2280.05,2283.085,Is there any language change whatever since McGoldrick?
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2283.085,2296.16,"--Yes, the Secretary of Treasury deleted the provision from the Customs regulations some time after the McGoldrick decision, and it is now an appendage to the regulations in the form of a footnote."
1982.81-1489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2296.16,2297.945,But it's the same language.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2297.945,2300.278,"It's the same language, and we--"
1982.81-1489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2300.278,2302.73,"It has been renumbered, in effect, relocated."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2302.73,2303.396,--Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2498.157,2508.996,"If Gulf Oil had withdrawn some of that oil for domestic consumption on payment of duties, just like Xerox could have done theoretically--"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2508.996,2510.53,"In that case, it could not have."
1982.81-1489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2587.948,2588.931,--You say the record is what?
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2588.931,2604.19,"The record reflects... Xerox admits in its deposition, the deposition of its witness Ricarlo Perez, as well as in their answers to interrogatories, that the copiers could have been converted for domestic--"
1982.81-1489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2604.19,2610.26,"I will be interested in what your opponent says about that, because as I read the briefs, I thought there was a flat dispute on this one."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2610.26,2617.664,"--No, this is in the... It is contained in the deposition of Ricarlo Perez and--"
1982.81-1489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2617.664,2622.568,"Well, he can answer."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2624.354,2624.72,--Okay.
1982.81-1489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2624.72,2631.29,"But in any event, none were converted."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2631.29,2632.574,No.
1982.81-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2632.574,2654.753,"Well, suppose you had automobiles manufactured in the same setting as this, destined for England or Sweden or some other country where they have the right-hand drive."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2673.782,2674.234,Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2698.515,2707.038,"But that would be independent of whether they could be modified for domestic use or not, in your view."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2707.038,2718.763,"Yes, and this Court has addressed that issue in the case of Kosydar versus... National Cash Register versus Kosydar, where the goods were only designed for foreign use."
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2718.763,2734.438,"Well, a bonded warehouse isn't available, is it, for an importer who simply wants to store his goods in a bonded warehouse pending domestic distribution?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2734.438,2735.472,"Yes, it is."
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2735.472,2742.009,So you can bring your goods in and delay the payment of duty until you get a market for it in the United States?
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2742.009,2746.913,And that was the original purpose of the Customs bonded warehousing scheme.
1982.81-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2746.913,2752.234,Does that have any other consequence than deferring the payment of the duty?
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2752.234,2754.269,No.
1982.81-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2754.269,2765.91,"When it enters the country, instead of paying the duty immediately on entry if it goes into a bonded warehouse, the duty is deferred until it is taken out of the bonded warehouse for sale in the United States."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2766.894,2767.677,That's correct.
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.677,2776.949,So a company can just get cheaper warehousing by using a bonded warehouse.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2781.251,2790.84,"That's correct, and that is the likely result if Xerox obtains immunity under the Customs bond theory."
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.84,2799.094,So it really doesn't make any difference in this case as to whether they were destined for a foreign market.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2799.094,2800.362,Absolutely not.
1982.81-1489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2800.362,2811.135,"Except do you contend that the state could levy the tax, though, before the federal government could collect the duty?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2811.135,2829.716,"No, we do not, and this particular regulatory... the laws governing goods detained under revenue laws prevent us from affecting the federal government's rights to Customs duties."
1982.81-1489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.716,2838.321,"Well, if you say you'd have to wait until the federal government collected a duty, supposing the goods were still under a bond, within the three year period."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2840.387,2843.039,In a--
1982.81-1489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.039,2849.26,I thought all the copiers were still in Texas at the time you levied the tax.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2849.26,2850.212,--That's correct.
1982.81-1489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2850.212,2855.581,"Well, then, you did seek to collect the tax before the federal government was free to collect any duty."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2891.587,2896.139,"We would have a lien, as does the warehouseman have a lien, as does the carrier have a lien."
1982.81-1489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2896.139,2911.466,"And this would be true even if these were goods... if it were not an American company, but a Japanese company, for example, that shipped in some product which it then intended to transship to Mexico, and it was... you would say you could impose a lien on those shipments."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2911.466,2919.154,"If that property had acquired a taxable situs under the... if they had been there under the same circumstances, yes, as Xerox."
1982.81-1489,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2919.154,2923.725,"How long, in your view, would it take for the goods to acquire a taxable situs?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,2923.725,2937.199,"Well, those are not... the facts of this case, Xerox at all times had maintained an average inventory on a daily basis of over 4,000 copiers, which we did assess."
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3003.427,3013.283,"Ms. Chapman, for what year... I gather... Is it the city's tax or the county's that is for one year?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3013.849,3015.166,The city's tax is for one year.
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3015.166,3015.832,And what year is that?
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3015.832,3017.032,Seventy-seven.
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3017.032,3018.118,Seventy-seven.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3018.118,3018.684,Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3018.684,3024.022,And these are copiers that were there from '74 until '77?
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3024.022,3024.655,Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3024.655,3031.559,And what happened in '77 that caused you to impose the tax that year and not in '76 or '75?
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3031.559,3040.247,"In '76, this Court decided that goods in Customs bonded... I mean, that imports were not immune from taxation."
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3040.247,3040.663,"Oh, that's Michelin."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3040.663,3041.013,Michelin.
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3041.013,3041.613,I see.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3041.613,3042.063,Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3042.063,3043.282,That decision that year.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3046.984,3048.917,"January 1, 1977."
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3048.917,3049.852,1977.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3052.304,3059.208,"The copiers... Xerox... during each of the taxing years at issue, Xerox maintained an average daily inventory--"
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3059.208,3059.775,"Of 4,000."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3059.775,3060.175,--Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3060.175,3064.127,"Now, you imposed the tax then as of January 1, 1977."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3068.011,3068.761,We did nothing.
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3070.613,3074.232,"Oh, and so you have never actually tried to collect."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3074.232,3074.934,"No, we have not."
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3074.934,3075.55,I see.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3082.138,3082.971,That's correct.
1982.81-1489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3082.971,3086.556,And you sent out a paper notice that this is the amount of the tax?
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3086.556,3087.242,Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3087.242,3089.558,You simply didn't try to enforce it--
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3089.558,3090.577,"No, we did not."
1982.81-1489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3090.577,3093.996,--because there was an intervening suit for declaratory judgment.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3093.996,3094.812,Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3094.812,3104.454,And also because you wouldn't try to enforce if someone didn't pay until the federal government permitted you to do so.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3104.454,3104.903,That's correct.
1982.81-1489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3106.403,3107.103,Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3132.104,3141.377,--We agree that our... We cannot exercise summary seizure and... summary sale and seizure of that property.
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3171.979,3191.956,"Ms. Chapman, maybe this isn't relevant and I shouldn't take your time with it, but suppose then Xerox, come December 31, 1977, you have not yet tried to enforce payment of the tax, and they move the copiers up to New York, as I gather they did."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3195.594,3196.944,Sue them for--
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3196.944,3199.629,"Well, suppose you can't get them in the state."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3199.629,3202.248,--We would--
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3202.248,3208.985,You could sue them in another state.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3210.437,3212.554,"--Yes, we could."
1982.81-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3212.554,3215.156,Xerox is pretty much everywhere.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3215.156,3215.806,Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3218.523,3220.292,They have other property in the state.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3220.292,3222.244,They did have other property in the state.
1982.81-1489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3222.244,3230.148,"Well, what I have been thinking about, Ms. Chapman, Justice Stevens mentioned, suppose it was a Japanese company that had done this?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3230.148,3232.6,That's a problem that we face on a continuing basis.
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3233.567,3234.552,Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3238.004,3238.621,--Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3238.621,3240.873,"And does the state impose a tax, too?"
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3240.873,3241.539,Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3241.539,3243.158,So there are three taxes involved.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3243.158,3244.175,"No, there is a--"
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3244.175,3245.225,Just one?
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3245.225,3252.431,"--No, there are several taxes involved here for several taxing jurisdictions, including for the State of Texas."
1982.81-1489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3252.431,3253.214,I see.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3254.882,3255.649,Yes.
1982.81-1489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3430.627,3438.031,"Ms. Chapman, you haven't mentioned your jurisdictional arguments."
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3440.316,3444.101,"We have raised those points in our brief, Your Honor."
1982.81-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3587.877,3590.995,Your time has expired.
1982.81-1489,1,18635,cheryl_helena_chapman,,3590.995,3591.479,All right.
1982.81-1489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3591.945,3594.281,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Hoddinott?"
1982.81-1489,2,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,3594.281,3598.149,I would be happy to try and answer Justice Blackmun's question.
1982.81-1489,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3622.864,3624.732,Or you can use it just the way it is.
1982.81-1489,2,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,3624.732,3628.684,You couldn't use the Xerox copier just the way it was--

1982.81-1489,2,16222,alfred_h_hoddinott_jr,,3629.551,3631.803,--because of the electricity.
