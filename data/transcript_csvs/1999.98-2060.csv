1999.98-2060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.734,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-2060, Ronald Edwards v. Robert Carpenter."
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,48.502,68.384,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This habeas case is about the need for an explanation when a defendant misses his opportunity in State court to assert ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in order to reopen his original direct appeal."
1999.98-2060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.867,155.147,"Mr. Foley, as I understand it, the district court in this case held that there was not an adequate and independent State ground for the State court ruling, and the court of appeals simply didn't pass on that."
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,155.584,156.966,That is correct.
1999.98-2060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,156.966,165.046,"So that... if we were to reverse on your point, that would be open in the court of appeals to the respondent here."
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,165.046,165.771,Exactly.
1999.98-2060,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.206,185.019,Is there any suggestion here that the respondent can show cause and prejudice for the procedural default of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim?
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,185.019,202.971,"We don't believe so, and for one reason is that he had a lawyer in 1992 in a time in which he could have raised his ineffective assistance claim, so we don't think he can make out the showing, but no court in this case has yet entertained the cause inquiry."
1999.98-2060,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,202.971,245.654,"What are we supposed to do with his claim that, look, this lawyer on appeal, the reason that I didn't file my request on time there is because the Ohio statute which sets up a procedure whereby an appellate court reopens a matter was itself very confused in light of a Supreme Court decision which suggests for this class of case you didn't use that procedure, and therefore there was nothing to use, and that whole matter wasn't clarified until much later and, in respect to the time it was clarified, my thing was timely."
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,252.528,254.912,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-2060,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,285.408,314.502,"Mr. Foley, may I ask you to back up, because as I understand Justice Breyer's question, you have already said the district court ground is not the issue before us now and that, indeed, if we reverse on the ground on which the Sixth Circuit rested, that would be wide open, that the grounds on which the district court ruled were never passed on by the Sixth Circuit, and they would be open to be considered on remand."
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,314.502,315.494,Correct.
1999.98-2060,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.494,326.726,"So we should focus only on what the Sixth Circuit ruled, because the district court's ruling would be open for review by the Sixth Circuit."
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,326.726,328.208,Correct.
1999.98-2060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.822,366.102,"Mr. Foley, do you know whether respondent, in its brief in opposition to certiorari, made that point?"
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,366.102,379.595,"--I do know the answer to that, and respondent did not object in the opposition to certiorari on that ground, in effect recognizing that the question was properly presented, suggesting that it wasn't worthy of the Court's review."
1999.98-2060,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,431.659,435.286,Your answer to Justice Ginsburg resolves my question.
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,435.286,436.368,--Okay.
1999.98-2060,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,572.998,589.5,"What bothers me about it is, I mean, it's a totally logical argument that you've made and it is, State, there's a constitutional claim, 1) blocked by State ground, right?"
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,589.5,591.238,We're talking about the three--
1999.98-2060,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,591.238,592.214,Then we have step 2.
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,672.513,675.537,"--Several responses, Justice Breyer."
1999.98-2060,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,805.062,832.305,"Is one way, then, to state the difference between the parties in this case that the difference is one of the definition of exhaustion, that he... that the respondent concedes there has to be exhaustion, but he defines it just in terms of presentment, whereas you agree there has to be exhaustion, but you say exhaustion must be a proper presentment."
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,835.249,859.281,"Well, we definitely believe there must be proper presentment, and we think that's the procedural default requirement, because exhaustion would be satisfied if a State like Missouri... which has a strict 90-day deadline, no exceptions whatsoever... exhaustion would be satisfied on day 91 no matter what the reason for the default."
1999.98-2060,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,873.372,877.745,"Yes, I recognize there can be procedural defaults that are not exhaustion."
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,895.158,895.654,Correct.
1999.98-2060,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,897.148,917.548,"And in this case could we resolve the case in your favor by saying that what we're concerned with here is exhaustion as a subset of different kinds of procedural defaults, and that the exhaustion here was not complied with because there was not proper presentment of the claim?"
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,917.548,919.089,--I think--
1999.98-2060,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,919.089,922.225,I... and maybe you have a different theory of the case.
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,922.225,923.03,--No.
1999.98-2060,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,950.513,964.374,"Well then, you would agree with the respondent that exhaustion is satisfied if there's mere presentment, even though it hasn't been properly exhausted, and you would say it's something other than exhaustion."
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,976.454,977.937,Well--
1999.98-2060,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,977.937,983.526,I take it you'd be pleased with a judgment in your favor under any circumstances.
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,983.526,984.054,--Absolutely.
1999.98-2060,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,985.34,991.34,But what is the theory that you think is the proper one for us to adopt in this regard?
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,991.34,1018.246,"Well, I think in my view it's analytically a little clearer to say that exhaustion only asks for whether there's been presentment, or, alternatively, it would be futile to present, because the Court's cases do say that exhaustion is technically satisfied if you can look to a rule, like the Missouri rule, and you know that it would be absolutely futile to present, you've satisfied exhaustion."
1999.98-2060,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1018.246,1031.441,"Is it the case that, if I agreed with you, would I... is there... would I be accepting... would I have to accept the following: there is a constitutional ground, unfair trial."
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,1079.425,1080.471,No.
1999.98-2060,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1080.471,1081.068,No?
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,1081.505,1096.476,"Well, I think if I understand correctly we're only saying that the double default situation, if you will, the need to have two causes applies in a situation where it is the constitutional claim, and all we're asking for in this--"
1999.98-2060,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1096.476,1098.273,But how do I say that?
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,1117.335,1118.674,--Correct.
1999.98-2060,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1118.674,1119.047,All right.
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,1143.74,1146.343,"Well, Carrier answers that question."
1999.98-2060,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.775,1217.17,May I ask you two questions?
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,1239.244,1240.247,Absolutely.
1999.98-2060,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1241.394,1264.578,"My second question is, the underlying claim here, am I correct in saying that the failure to put in any evidence, other than the statements of the prosecutors that supported a guilty plea, that the absence of witness testimony, is that just a State law requirement or is this a Federal constitutional requirement that there had to be something more?"
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,1264.578,1269.223,"To answer that question, we don't think there's a Federal constitutional requirement."
1999.98-2060,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1279.634,1280.263,I see.
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,1292.012,1294.578,--I want to answer that in--
1999.98-2060,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.578,1298.21,"As to actual testimony, to take a guilty plea in a case of this kind?"
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,1298.21,1300.951,"--I'd like to answer that in a couple of parts, if I might."
1999.98-2060,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.092,1334.46,I understand that.
1999.98-2060,0,22273,edward_b_foley,,1334.887,1340.146,But what's been presented is this alternative Federal alpha derivative claim.
1999.98-2060,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1393.303,1394.242,"Yes, you may, Mr. Foley."
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1396.519,1408.855,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Robert Carpenter's appellate ineffectiveness claim is not procedurally defaulted."
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1429.666,1431.5,Are you talking about an Ohio rule?
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1431.5,1433.175,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-2060,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1507.794,1511.052,"Would you point out exactly where the Sixth Circuit did that, because I don't recall it."
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1511.052,1513.282,"--Your Honor, it's in the joint appendix."
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1534.012,1539.063,"Well, how does that footnote bear on the question presented here, Mr. Bodine?"
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1539.063,1544.194,"It bears on the question presented here, Your Honor, because unless the rule is adequate--"
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1544.194,1549.415,But we... the court of appeals didn't pass on it.
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1552.786,1553.554,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1562.636,1563.159,Right.
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1563.159,1577.98,"There has been no Federal finding in any court that Mr. Carpenter's appellate ineffectiveness claim is procedurally defaulted, and our argument is, until there is a cognizable procedural default, Mr. Carpenter need not present cause in prejudice arguments."
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1577.98,1595.612,"But the State raised that question in the Sixth Circuit and... as I understand it, and the Sixth Circuit said no, you don't need to show... you don't need to show the cause here for this kind of claim, and that's the question we granted certiorari on."
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1595.612,1601.548,Whether a procedurally defaulted claim may nevertheless be used as cause.
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.548,1602.028,Right.
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1602.028,1603.5,"There's another reason, though."
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.322,1605.612,Another reason for what?
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1605.612,1610.599,"--Another reason the question is inadequately presented here, Your Honor, is because Mr. Carpenter has--"
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1610.599,1617.714,"Well, are you saying that the question presented that we granted certiorari on isn't adequately presented?"
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1617.714,1619.762,--That's our first argument.
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.762,1621.378,"Well, what does that mean?"
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1621.378,1625.356,It means that there's no controversy in the case.
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.73,1631.991,I would suggest you pass on to your next argument.
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1631.991,1638.311,The second argument that we're asserting is that the procedural default argument should not be applied to cause arguments.
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.458,1655.228,How about Stewart v. LaGrand?
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1655.228,1661.191,"Stewart v. LaGrand, as we note in the merit brief, Your Honor, was a case about waiver."
1999.98-2060,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1805.09,1829.751,"I really thought, counsel, that Murray v. Carrier indicates that the... that if the ineffective assistance of counsel claim was procedurally defaulted, that the court can't go on and reach the sufficiency of the evidence claim."
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1843.671,1848.22,"--In this case, yes, Your Honor, although the district court did hold that there was no default."
1999.98-2060,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1849.639,1852.402,"But that hasn't been reviewed, as has been pointed out and--"
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1852.402,1853.676,"--By the Sixth Circuit, correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-2060,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1853.676,1859.394,--I don't see how the Sixth Circuit judgment can stand in light of Murray v. Carrier.
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1859.394,1881.49,"If that's the case, Your Honor, then the adequacy of the rule certainly would need to be resolved, but Murray v. Carrier does say that before ineffective assistance of counsel can be asserted as cause it need be presented to the State court, it need rise to a level of Sixth Amendment violation, and an individual need be prejudiced by it."
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1916.306,1920.626,May I ask a question about the ineffective assistance of counsel claim?
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1944.903,1946.258,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1961.676,1975.468,"I thought he only was... eliminated the possibility of the death penalty by reason of the agreement with the State that enabled him to make this plea, and that if you set aside the plea, that would have put everything back to square 1."
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1975.468,1978.002,"Honestly, that's how we get around the problem in Ohio."
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.484,1998.898,"Yes, but he avoided all that--"
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,1998.898,1999.495,Correct.
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1999.495,2008.45,"--by the deal that he made, and it seems to me... and you're telling me that, as a matter of Ohio law, if you prevail he would not be exposed to the death penalty now?"
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2008.45,2019.687,"Under Ohio law, if an individual goes to a sentencing phase and is essentially acquitted of the death penalty, the State may not later on remand charge him, but--"
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2019.687,2023.106,"I don't want a general answer, but what happened in this case?"
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2031.538,2034.732,"--If we were in that position, I would certainly argue that--"
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2034.732,2035.074,"Oh, okay."
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2035.074,2040.455,"--the sentencing phase, penalty phase proceeding was an adjudication."
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.455,2056.471,"Because it seemed to me that counsel might well, even if he had a valid reason for attacking the plea arrangement, it might have been a very sound strategy, just as it was in the initial plea agreement, not to do that, because he wouldn't want to risk the death penalty for his client."
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2056.471,2072.023,"Exactly, Your Honor, and as I said, that type of arrangement is how the courts have permitted us to get around the problem with pleading guilty to a capital crime and then, by default, pleading guilty to the death penalty itself."
1999.98-2060,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2079.676,2097.094,"Well, I'm sorry, I don't understand your answer that it's not implicated here, because one of the striking things about this case is the difference in the bottom line, that the district court was just going to send it back to have another direct appeal, but the Sixth Circuit said no, you go all the way back to square 1."
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2113.97,2117.554,"--I was answering a different question I think, Your Honor."
1999.98-2060,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.312,2159.618,Suppose I then agreed with you... suppose I agreed with you on your point here.
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2161.89,2167.01,"--If you agreed with my point with respect to the cause in prejudice argument, Your Honor?"
1999.98-2060,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2167.01,2167.32,Yes.
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2167.32,2173.293,Then Mr. Carpenter has proved two constitutional claims and he is entitled to a new trial.
1999.98-2060,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2173.293,2173.928,Why?
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2208.402,2209.181,Two separate claims.
1999.98-2060,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2215.725,2218.85,"No, but go back and get the direct appeal under Ohio law?"
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2244.472,2258.648,"--What the Sixth Circuit said is that the violation carried with it due process implications, because Ohio has established a procedure to protect against an inappropriate plea to a capital crime."
1999.98-2060,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2277.682,2283.688,What about... what do you think of his responses to the two things that were worrying me on your cause in prejudice point?
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2336.733,2349.981,"On those two particular points I actually agree, because in this case, no matter how many times the question is asked with respect to what is cause for the default, it is always the ineffectiveness of Mr. Carpenter's original appellate counsel."
1999.98-2060,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2376.397,2378.962,Is there any reason for that distinction?
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2378.962,2390.472,"The comity doctrine, the interest in finality that a State has always asserted, has only ever revolved around constitutional claims."
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2441.533,2445.837,May I ask another question about the appointment of counsel?
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2451.97,2452.781,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2452.781,2456.461,Was he also represented by your office in the plea negotiations?
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2456.461,2460.605,He was represented by a different public defender office.
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2474.285,2478.674,But they do... that county public defender does appellate work as well as trial work?
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2478.674,2480.344,"For Franklin County, Ohio."
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.344,2486.002,"Well, then when he got new counsel for appeal, was that a different lawyer within the Franklin County Public Defender's Office?"
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2486.002,2493.234,"Within the Franklin County, and the supreme court of Ohio has addressed that issue and said that that is acceptable."
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2500.28,2500.872,I see.
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2500.872,2506.941,"I think that's the question you're getting at, is it essentially the same individual who represented him through that direct appeal process."
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2506.941,2510.818,But presumably there would be... those lawyers would talk to one another.
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2516.184,2517.426,"Presumably, Your Honor."
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2517.426,2529.778,--And so at least it's conceivable that whatever motivated the trial counsel to enter into the plea negotiation might also have motivated the appellate counsel not to challenge the plea negotiation.
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2529.778,2531.928,"Conceivably, but we're not aware of that."
1999.98-2060,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2531.928,2534.2,But we should treat them as different lawyers?
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2534.2,2535.128,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.509,2540.744,"And your office, Mr. Bodine, is a State Public Defender?"
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2540.744,2555.219,"We're Statewide, Your Honor, and what we do is, we represent individuals in counties that do not have a public defender system set up, especially in those smaller counties where there are not enough appointed counsel to represent individuals."
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2555.219,2558.531,So how did you happen to pick up this case?
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2562.509,2566.333,"We do a lot of outreach training and try to provide what support we can, Your Honor."
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2578.926,2579.459,Thank you.
1999.98-2060,1,29173,j_joseph_bodine_jr,,2579.459,2581.934,"If Your Honors don't have any other questions, thank you."
1999.98-2060,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2581.934,2583.694,"Thank you, Mr. Bodine."
1999.98-2060,2,22273,edward_b_foley,,2586.147,2589.23,A few brief points.
1999.98-2060,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.675,2633.241,"But even under the Sixth Circuit's view, if I understand it, there would have to be established that it was a Federal constitutional violation of the plea agreement, not merely that it violated Ohio law."
1999.98-2060,2,22273,edward_b_foley,,2633.241,2653.267,"--Absolutely correct, and also, just to reiterate, we don't want to concede in any way that there was a violation of Ohio law, and in fact the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit remanded for some further proceeding on this waiver issue, so we want to preserve that point."
1999.98-2060,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2801.059,2803.049,"Thank you, Mr. Foley."
