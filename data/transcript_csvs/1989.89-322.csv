1989.89-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument next in Number 89-322, United Steelworkers of America v. Tharon Rawson."
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,17.843,21.664,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.972,206.016,"Well, Mr. Cohen, if the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement are clear, although they give the union very little authority, and perhaps the Supreme Court of Idaho has piled on a lot of responsibility commensurate with that authority, I don't know that that goes to the preemption question."
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,211.337,215.705,"Well, with two... there is two aspects of the preemption issue."
1989.89-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,220.793,223.895,So you don't rely on the interpretation aspect?
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,223.895,240.189,"Well, parenthetically, as we have argued in our brief, there is no question but that before the question of whether or not the union assumed any duty, because before the union... unless and until the union assumes a duty, there can be no tort liability."
1989.89-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.682,259.918,"Well, but you... I still don't think you have answered my question."
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,269.959,270.326,--No.
1989.89-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,346.292,351.328,"Now, what... what of our cases supports this, what you are, is apparently your primary position?"
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,351.328,369.305,"--Well, the case that supports our primary position is Vaca v. Sipes, for the basic proposition that insofar as the representational function of processing of grievance and administering the grievance arbitration proceeding is concerned, there is a Federal duty."
1989.89-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,385.834,389.203,"Certainly Vaca doesn't say it is the exclusive duty, does it?"
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,389.203,389.886,--Yes it does.
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,418.055,430.046,"Suppose, Mr. Cohen, the contract here expressly put a... placed a duty on the union, namely that the union did promise to inspect the mine."
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,445.222,448.524,"I think I would respond as follows, Justice White."
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,515.635,518.087,"Well, what about, what about my question now?"
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,518.087,521.371,"Your question, as I understood it, was in that--"
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,521.371,527.709,"Suppose the union undertakes, in the collective bargaining agreement, to inspect the mine?"
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,527.709,529.728,"--That would not, obviously, be this case."
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,529.728,531.761,Because that is what this case is.
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,538.834,539.267,The state--
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.267,541.286,"So, let's assume that is right."
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,544.488,544.955,"--All right, now--"
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,544.955,547.44,What would be your primary position then?
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,547.44,553.761,--Our position would basically be this Court has not addressed that problem.
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.399,564.901,"Well, why not?"
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,565.851,581.328,"--Because the argument would be, Mr., Justice White, the argument would be, in that kind of a situation the union arguably is displacing the managerial function of inspecting, and the union then would be assuming what would traditionally be an employer role."
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,581.328,586.165,--Do you agree that the Idaho Supreme Court interpreted the collective bargaining contract to put a duty on the union--
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,586.165,586.932,Absolutely.
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.932,587.982,--to inspect?
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,587.982,589.1,Absolutely.
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.1,589.7,Well--
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,589.7,590.784,But we... but in fact--
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.784,592.219,"--Now, suppose we accept that?"
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,592.219,592.952,"--But, in fact--"
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.952,594.036,Suppose we accept that?
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,606.311,615.667,--Accepting the construction of the contract as the findings were made here was that all the union did was accompany.
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.857,625.89,You're just not answering my question.
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,625.89,629.677,--the state court characterized it as doing more.
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,629.677,631.727,"Well, so, if we, suppose we agree with them."
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,631.727,651.174,"If we did more, if we did more our position would be as long as the union was basically performing a representational function, and what they were trying to do was influencing the way the employer carried out its safety and health responsibility, that would continue to be preempted."
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,652.574,655.292,It would be preempted because of the duty of fair representation?
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,655.292,656.411,"--Yes, yes."
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.411,660.446,Not because it's... it would be a 301 action?
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,660.446,666.6,It would... it would be preempted because it was essentially a duty of fair representation case.
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.694,681.56,"Well, that is your fallback position, isn't it?"
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,681.56,682.243,"Well, yes."
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,885.126,886.328,"Excuse me, Mr. Cohen."
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,886.328,886.678,Yes.
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,886.678,905.54,"Is it your position, then, that there is a Federal common law of torts against the union for any... any negligence in its assumed exercise of bargaining activities?"
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,905.54,910.277,"Justice Scalia, I wouldn't say it is a Federal common... Federal common law of torts."
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,927.988,947.117,"You, you would say that this Court, that this suit could have been brought in Federal court, then, on a Federal theory that the union, through its actions, assumed the obligation to inspect, and its... its breach of that assumption gives rise to a Federal cause of action?"
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,947.117,952.104,We would say that there is a Federal claim for the breach of the duty of fair representation.
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.691,959.025,"No, no, no."
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,979.171,986.258,"I am sure you can appreciate, Justice Scalia, that the union, I know of no instance where a company would have allowed a union--"
1989.89-322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.258,986.877,"Well, I know that, but this... it happens--"
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,986.877,987.427,--to engage in that.
1989.89-322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,994.514,996.483,--And... and there would be a Federal cause of action.
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,996.483,1016.296,"And the Federal... it would be a Federal cause of action, but that would be the only cause of action for that kind of conduct, because what the union is trying to do in that circumstance is to influence the manner in which the employer is providing, is satisfying its relationship to that union."
1989.89-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1034.425,1039.71,"Mr. Cohen, take Justice Scalia's hypothetical a step further, if you will."
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,1061.075,1064.11,Absolutely could sue via common law action.
1989.89-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1077.018,1090.076,"So, so if we were to conclude that the duty of fair representation really played no part in Justice Scalia's hypothetical, then that would mean that that... this... that action too would be... could be brought in state court?"
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,1090.076,1090.678,"--Yes, but I want to--"
1989.89-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1090.678,1093.345,"Your position is contrary, I realize that."
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,1093.345,1097.581,--Our position is you have to look to the nature of the conduct in question.
1989.89-322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1145.146,1147.598,"Suppose that, take it a step further."
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,1172.147,1182.187,"--Well, the question would be whether or not there was a misrepresentation by the union, and whether it would be reasonable for anyone to rely on that circumstance."
1989.89-322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1182.187,1183.971,You know what the Idaho tort law is.
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,1189.341,1190.674,I... I still believe--
1989.89-322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1190.674,1192.376,Is it somehow displaced by Federal law?
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,1192.376,1209.136,"--In that situation, I think, once again, we are in the area where you have at least, the argument would at least be you're predominantly involved in the union's conducting its exclusive representative status and providing services to individuals."
1989.89-322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1252.414,1259.485,"In my situation, my hypothetical, I want you to stipulate that the union was negligent in what they did."
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,1262.02,1276.78,"Well, insofar as a Federal cause of action is concerned, mere negligence or bad judgment does not on the merits make out a claim for a breach of the duty of fair representation."
1989.89-322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1300.328,1302.514,"This isn't the duty of fair representation, though."
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,1340.889,1341.655,I don't believe it does.
1989.89-322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.655,1342.705,There is just no such tort.
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,1344.357,1349.745,"I am certainly not aware of one that does this, but we are still back to our fundamental proposition."
1989.89-322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1380.28,1383.466,--So in effect you are arguing for a Federal immunity?
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,1383.466,1384.668,Not a Federal immunity--
1989.89-322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1384.668,1391.405,"You say that there is only duty of fair representation, and that it doesn't include that, and it's not state law--"
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,1391.405,1397.975,"--Justice Kennedy, the... if the Federal duty of fair representation applies, then there is a legal standard--"
1989.89-322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1397.975,1400.694,--But you're telling us that it doesn't.
1989.89-322,0,25102,george_h_cohen,,1400.694,1415.186,"--In the case that we are concerned with, we have a Federal duty of fair representation that is at work, is the exclusive duty and the governing duty as to our conduct, and the Plaintiffs have abstained proceeding on that basis."
1989.89-322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1557.427,1558.494,"Very well, Mr. Cohen."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1564.665,1567.717,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.832,1596.819,"Well, didn't... didn't the Idaho Supreme Court find a duty on the union to inspect?"
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1596.819,1597.602,Yes... yes--
1989.89-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.602,1603.825,"And didn't they base that on the collective bargaining contract, their interpretation of the collective bargaining contract?"
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1603.825,1609.043,--Yes and no.
1989.89-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1609.043,1610.895,How do you say it's no?
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1610.895,1618.049,The supreme court in its... it had three opinions on this particular case.
1989.89-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.514,1648.151,"Well, I know, where did they find... purport to find the duty to inspect?"
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1648.151,1648.984,--The duty to--
1989.89-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.984,1655.655,They didn't say that just any collective bargaining agent for miners has a duty to inspect a mine.
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1655.655,1656.59,"--No, clearly not."
1989.89-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.59,1658.007,"Well, then, under state law."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1659.376,1662.328,The duty to inspect comes from the undertaking itself.
1989.89-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1662.761,1663.428,What undertaking?
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1663.428,1666.196,--The undertaking of going down and inspecting.
1989.89-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.741,1687.693,As I understand it they didn't find a duty to inspect.
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1698.434,1703.821,"--Justice Scalia, I believe that they did find a duty to inspect based upon the facts in the record at this point in time."
1989.89-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.641,1713.343,Then I really don't understand the case.
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1724.818,1725.184,No.
1989.89-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.184,1727.27,They said there was a duty to inspect.
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1727.27,1737.542,"I believe that they said if we can prove, if the plaintiffs can prove that there was in fact an inspection taking place, that is our obligation, then there is a duty to do it carefully."
1989.89-322,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1742.196,1744.496,"So... so... well, all right."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1747.265,1749.45,"I am sorry, I don't understand."
1989.89-322,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1749.45,1751.051,They did not find a duty to inspect.
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1756.453,1756.789,That's correct.
1989.89-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1757.889,1771.197,"May I ask then, if... if instead of a union we had here a trade association which was interested in improving mine safety throughout its... all the member companies, and they sent a committee along, to go along with the routine inspection by the employer."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1786.309,1797.93,"Justice Stevens, the Idaho law relating to this subject requires certain foundational elements be proved before you can determine whether somebody has established the necessary undertaking."
1989.89-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.501,1806.536,"Well, I am asking... I think Justice Scalia and I are both trying to find out what the source of the duty is."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1811.757,1812.49,--That is correct.
1989.89-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.49,1817.011,"But is that... if that is enough, then in my trade association example they would have the same duty."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1817.011,1824.767,"If the inspection rises to the level necessary to meet the elements of the cause, the state recognized cause of action, yes."
1989.89-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.767,1825.667,"But what, what elements are there?"
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1857.869,1862.571,"To the extent that we have the words of the Idaho Supreme Court, the answer to your question is yes."
1989.89-322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1875.58,1880.651,I take it that includes some reliance on the part of the injured party?
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1880.651,1893.042,"Some reliance on behalf of either the injured party or, if it is 324... or excuse me, 324A, it can be the undertaking that is, an undertaking taken on behalf of someone else for the protection of a third party."
1989.89-322,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1898.696,1916.574,"Well, how can you proceed in the tort action in Idaho without establishing or relying upon the collective bargaining agreement provision regarding the union participation in the inspection?"
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1916.574,1917.241,Justice O'Connor--
1989.89-322,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1917.241,1920.859,Won't that have to be part of your cause of action?
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1930.751,1935.619,--The duty recognized by the Idaho Supreme Court does not rely at all upon the collective bargaining agreement.
1989.89-322,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1938.988,1947.011,But you say it did rely on a restatement view of this type of tort action.
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1947.011,1947.827,--That is correct.
1989.89-322,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1948.463,1952.998,"So, ultimately there is going to have to be some kind of duty established."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1970.292,1973.678,"--Do not... we do not take that position, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-322,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1973.678,1980.815,"So you have to rely on the nature of the duty created under the collective bargaining agreement, don't you?"
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,1980.815,1982.1,Not under the collective bargaining agreement.
1989.89-322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2008.115,2024.027,"Well, I take it under Justice O'Connor's hypothetical, if you have some... and Justice Stevens', if you have some independent volunteer that goes down there and makes an inspection, that person is liable (a) if it is negligently done and (b) if the injured party reasonably relies on it."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2027.395,2029.181,--Those are two of the elements involved.
1989.89-322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.01,2054.646,You mean... you don't mean undertaking in the sense of a promise.
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2061.735,2063.052,"That is correct, Justice White."
1989.89-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.306,2073.876,"It is crucial to the Idaho law that it be for the benefit of another, right?"
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2095.489,2098.408,"Justice Scalia, yes, absent some showing that they undertook for that--"
1989.89-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.408,2098.791,For the miners.
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2098.791,2099.158,--Right.
1989.89-322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.158,2108.431,"So the only way you really get this union is because the union did it for the workers, and doesn't that really get you into the collective bargaining agreement?"
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2123.892,2126.108,"Justice Scalia, I don't believe that it does."

1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2189.418,2199.441,"I don't believe, Justice Scalia, that the Idaho law or the Restatement of Torts requires that it be for the benefit necessarily of the union members."
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2246.337,2247.487,May I just ask one other question?

1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2258.978,2259.411,Yes.
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2259.411,2260.847,"--complaint, not the interrogatories and--"
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2260.847,2261.13,Yes.
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2261.13,2262.313,"--No, there is not."

1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2273.07,2273.487,--I think--
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2273.487,2275.689,"At least they appear to be, that they undertook--"
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2275.689,2288.08,"--I think, Justice Stevens, that they were written at a time when the basic notice pleadings were the foundational view that we were taking in this particular case."
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.049,2297.686,"--The failure is you... they failed to require fire drills, and they failed to require personal protective equipment."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2306.292,2315.481,"--No, there were failures in terms of the conduct of what was done and what was done negligently with regard to this particular undertaking."
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.253,2340.549,"I still... it's still hard for me to understand... somehow or other before you can find a tort you have got to find what the duty was that was assumed, just exactly what its dimensions were that you alleged were... I am still... and the Idaho Supreme Court really is not very helpful."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2359.343,2360.293,In this particular case?
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2360.293,2363.062,And how it arose.
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2363.062,2372.751,"The union, by actually engaging in the inspections, by going underground and by factually addressing issues in an actual capacity--"
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2372.751,2375.02,What do you mean by an actual capacity?
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2375.02,2377.305,"--Going underground, making the inspections--"
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.305,2378.055,Right.
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2378.055,2379.924,--for the purposes of an inspection.
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2422.501,2427.738,"But if their conduct measures their duty, they obviously did what the conduct shows."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2430.338,2436.325,"--No, what I am saying, Justice Stevens, is that once they engage in that duty, then they have to do it in a reasonably prudent fashion."
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2441.978,2446.532,"Well, say they... they look at a lot of things and they acquire some information."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2457.507,2459.807,"They have a duty to do something with that information, yes, to act--"
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.807,2461.792,And where is... what is the source of that duty?
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2461.792,2465.577,"--The duty just, again, is to act with regard to reasonable care."
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.526,2498.215,"Well, but if they're... they're being accompanied by management personnel, and they both look at the same thing, are you in effect saying that they saw something that management didn't see, and they had to tell management about what they saw?"
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2502.886,2517.296,"--But there may be a number of things that you see underground, maybe jointly, maybe not, but the obligation then is to carry out some kind of an activity to bring those deficiencies to the attention of the individual who has the ability to correct them."
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.946,2557.468,"Well, I think they, I think they agree that if they promise to inspect they have a contractual duty to inspect."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2557.468,2568.292,"--Justice White, I think that... at least my reading of the union's position is that to the extent that they undertook a duty to inspect, which they deny... specifically they deny that they inspected in this case."
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2568.292,2571.327,"How do you know what they undertook to do, in the way you use undertake?"
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2573.613,2577.898,"We have to, we have to get... glean that information from the factual circumstance of the case."
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2582.119,2594.51,"Don't you think the union... is it fair to say that the union undertook, or what it did underground was what it bargained the employer out of letting them do?"
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2609.952,2619.642,"The position which the union has taken, and I, which I concur in, quite frankly, that the collective bargaining gave them by way of rights is several things."
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2625.129,2625.914,"Well, just attend."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2628.531,2629.864,"That's all, that's all they are saying they had to do."

1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2772.306,2776.108,"Well, Justice White, I don't think they would be ill advised at all."
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2813.883,2816.835,You think there is a competitive market out there for unions.
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2816.835,2817.601,I do.
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2817.601,2821.703,Really?
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2837.415,2838.265,That is correct.
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2839.265,2850.557,"So that you, you don't rely at all on a theory of the union making... at this point in the case, making misrepresentations to its members about its own ability to conduct inspections or the success it has had in inspecting, or anything like that?"
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2850.557,2851.19,"No, Justice Stevens."
1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2852.675,2856.126,Just that they were negligent in doing the inspection.

1989.89-322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2858.328,2863.197,"Conduct, all right."
1989.89-322,1,33848,kenneth_b_howard,,2863.197,2887.432,One of the aspects of this case with regard to the duty of fair representation that is interesting with regard to the union's position at any rate is that there are a number of developing areas where unions are now starting to engage in traditional roles which had heretofore been strictly the roles of employers.
