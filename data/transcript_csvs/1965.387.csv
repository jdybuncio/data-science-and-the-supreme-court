1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,17.8,21.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.387,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,81.829,85.649,Is that second question here?
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,85.649,87.326,"Yes, Your -- yes Your Honor, it is."
1965.387,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,87.424,87.992,Did he --
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,87.992,90.219,I may have stated a little differently than it is in the book but it is here.
1965.387,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,90.219,90.809,I see.
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,91.553,92.299,"In the event, the court --"
1965.387,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,92.299,94.191,There's no question about it being here?
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,94.191,94.969,I think not.
1965.387,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,94.969,96.459,Yes.
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,96.459,107.631,"On September 1st, 1955, the union -- the petitioner in this case entered into a collective bargaining agreement for the Hoosier Cardinal Company."
1965.387,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,117.492,119.327,Yes.
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,119.327,135.866,"There was a further provision that employee's who were eligible for vacation on the basis of time's work -- time worked and who had not taken their vacation on the previous year should receive vacation pay at the time of termination, if they were terminated for any reason."
1965.387,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,726.136,732.692,The court has -- the court ever done anything like that or to take out --
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,732.692,733.332,Well --
1965.387,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,733.332,734.778,(Inaudible)
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,734.778,746.008,"I think Your Honor suggested it, McAllister case suggested that you might look at the statute in the Jones Act to apply to other cases."
1965.387,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,746.008,750.63,"Well, I think (Inaudible)"
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,755.759,756.336,That is right.
1965.387,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,756.336,765.347,"-- on unseaworthiness (Inaudible)But I don't think I -- (Inaudible) ever before said, well, a median of six years to be good."
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,768.948,769.33,"Well, as I see -- well --"
1965.387,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,769.33,770.819,"-- the legislature rules that, doesn't it?"
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,770.819,778.962,"Mr. Justice Brennan, as I see the development of this law there are two sources for the development of 301 -- of law under 301 (a)."
1965.387,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,798.006,817.781,"Well, suppose we assume that that's so, it should be federal law but in other cases we have found a period which the Congress have fixed for some or at least I thought so, I think in McAllister, Congress picked three years, wasn't it, in the Jones Act (Inaudible)"
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,817.781,818.642,"Three years, yes, Your Honor."
1965.387,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,818.642,825.118,"I suggested that maybe that would be a good one because Congress had picked -- but here, we don't have anything like that, do we?"
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,825.118,830.247,We don't have a congressional indication of a time period or -- on this particular statute.
1965.387,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,837.19,838.595,I got the contract.
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,838.595,840.009,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.387,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,847.923,852.423,Would the six-year limitations -- statute limitations help you in this case?
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,852.423,861.482,"It would, Your Honor, if the court follows through with that federal reasoning and then follows its tolling principles as set out in Burnett against New York Central Railroad."
1965.387,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,884.248,886.863,Did you argue that in the court below --
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,886.863,886.902,"No, we didn't Your Honor."
1965.387,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,886.902,888.169,-- in the Court of Appeals?
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,888.169,888.182,We didn't --
1965.387,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,888.182,888.868,I beg pardon?
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,888.868,890.188,"No, we did not Your Honor."
1965.387,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,891.417,893.007,"So, is it properly here then?"
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,893.007,894.209,I think it is Your Honor.
1965.387,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,928.433,933.587,How did you know if the Court of Appeals would do until it -- until the case was over?
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,933.587,934.952,"Well, I guess we couldn't really know."
1965.387,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1010.84,1028.415,Is there any showing as to the reason for the delay of what you call 11 months -- I mean the decision of the Indiana Appellate Court in filing of federal action.
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,1035.814,1036.512,That's correct.
1965.387,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1036.512,1051.436,That was -- that four months before the Indiana Appellate Court decided the present case and then after the Indiana Appellate Court decided the present case.
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,1059.269,1060.677,"Yes, that is correct Mr. Justice Fortas."
1965.387,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1060.677,1073.857,"Now, is there anything in the -- before us to show why there was that delay in the circumstances of a claim that at the very least was getting well aged?"
1965.387,0,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,1073.857,1078.385,"Well, I don't know of any -- the reason for that delay."
1965.387,1,26889,harry_p_dees,,1233.645,1237.559,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.387,1,26889,harry_p_dees,,2281.094,2281.134,Sir?
1965.387,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2281.134,2293.351,"Suppose the Federal Government has created a cause of action, the state has none like it and there was no statute of limitation fixed, what would you say then?"
1965.387,1,26889,harry_p_dees,,2293.351,2295.03,The Federal Government created a cause --
1965.387,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2295.03,2297.789,"Created a cause of action, a civil cause of action?"
1965.387,1,26889,harry_p_dees,,2297.789,2298.295,"Yes, sir."
1965.387,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2298.295,2305.503,There is no action of that kind in a state so it had no statute of limitations for that kind of action?
1965.387,1,26889,harry_p_dees,,2305.503,2305.68,I think in that --
1965.387,2,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,3223.709,3225.434,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.387,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.332,3386.966,"Mr. Schlossberg, this is ultimately the matter of a congressional intention, isn't it?"
1965.387,2,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,3386.966,3388.619,"That is right, Mr. Justice White."
1965.387,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3388.619,3404.195,And has it more ordinarily than the rule or not that the -- when the federal statute doesn't have a limitations included in a -- that the courts have gone to state law --
1965.387,2,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,3404.195,3405.785,I would answer your question this way.
1965.387,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3423.573,3447.313,"Congress nowadays with the adoption statute, it doesn't put a limitations period in it, should you really assume that they intend the courts to make one up or do you think in somewhere you -- that Congress in view of the rule that spend normally applied there would be -- would intend state law to apply?"
1965.387,2,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,3447.313,3465.258,I think Mr. Justice White that Congress intended the statue to be substantive federal law and they must have intended that these contracts and this statute be interpreted the same all over whether in a state court or a federal court as this Court has thought.
1965.387,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3486.56,3496.089,"Well, that might be true if Congress had said expressly, this so many words that the courts were supposed to fashion federal law into 301."
1965.387,2,42010,stephen_i_schlossberg,,3498.042,3500.323,"No, you don't Your Honor."
1965.387,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3501.512,3505.5,Very well.
