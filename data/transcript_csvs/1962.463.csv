1962.463,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,43.434,"Number 463, Thomas I. Fitzgerald, Public Administrator of the County of New York, etcetera, Petitioner, versus United States Lines Company."
1962.463,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,46.371,50.301,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1962.463,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,241.149,243.957,"The issue of being whether you'd reached the point of maximum cure, is that it?"
1962.463,0,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,243.957,245.223,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,1433.992,1440.372,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1895.843,1899.55,"You don't question in any way the propriety jointer of the two claims, do you?"
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,1899.55,1901.336,"No, I do not, sir."
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1901.336,1902.378,That's customary.
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,1903.163,1904.429,Yes sir.
1962.463,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1919.325,1926.663,(Inaudible)
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,1926.663,1927.724,"Yes, sir."
1962.463,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1927.724,1941.853,(Inaudible)
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,1941.853,1961.486,"Your Honor, Mr. Justice Goldberg, I cannot quarrel with the policy considerations urged by my opponent.I must concede that from a practical standpoint of convenience that it probably would be better to try these two claims together."
1962.463,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1979.866,1988.309,"Well, is there any statute or rule that says they cannot do it?"
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,1988.309,2008.753,"Well, there's no -- no, Mr. Justice Black, there's no statute that says they cannot do it but, from the history of the development of the maritime law, as I just attempted to point out, from time immemorial in maritime cases, you have not had juries."
1962.463,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2008.753,2020.116,I agree that that's the Court's -- this case -- Courts has held that equity cases and maritime cases do not require to have a jury.
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2034.531,2037.452,"Well, you mean before this case?"
1962.463,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2037.452,2038.662,Yes.
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2057.437,2058.012,No.
1962.463,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2061.346,2065.871,That's the reason I was a little startled when you said the Court was without power.
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2073.303,2074.831,"Yes, sir."
1962.463,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2074.831,2079.085,That's what your case depends on?
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2079.085,2079.484,"Yes, sir."
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2089.641,2126.605,"Well, even -- it doesn't necessarily -- perhaps the only -- in your opinion, the only good argument you can make is that -- and the only one that will stand up, but Judge Smith and Judge Waterman apparently didn't feel there was a lack of power in the judges, the trial judges' discretion to submit the maintenance and cure case to the jury and that indeed, the district judge did have such discretion to submit it but they nevertheless concurred with the -- with Judge Friendly's judgment because they didn't think that there was any compulsion to do so, is that it?"
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2126.605,2128.121,"That's right, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2128.121,2136.759,"Now, that may or may not be valid but in other words, at least two circuit judges didn't go so far as you did and they nevertheless concurred in the judgment."
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2136.759,2140.77,That's correct.
1962.463,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2142.775,2159.123,"But as I understand, you agree that -- I thought you said that if there is power, that you agree with the other side as to the policy of the obedience and the wisdom of doing it --"
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2159.123,2159.139,Yes.
1962.463,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2159.139,2161.928,-- insofar as the Court procedure is concerned.
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2161.928,2163.682,"Yes, Mr. Justice Black."
1962.463,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2188.992,2193.81,"So, it would have to be expressly permitted by a rule or a statute."
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2193.81,2199.945,"Yes, sir."
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2377.989,2387.439,"But am I right in remembering that in order to recover maintenance and cure, you don't have to show any unseaworthiness or any fault or anything else in the part of the ship?"
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2392.483,2394.764,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1962.463,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2394.764,2428.606,(Inaudible)
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2428.606,2429.143,That's correct.
1962.463,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2429.143,2429.703,Is that right?
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2429.703,2430.445,That's correct.
1962.463,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2430.445,2455.621,(Inaudible)
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2455.621,2456.829,That's correct.
1962.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.388,2470.794,"How about the -- as the result of the decisions below, there was no unseaworthiness and there was no negligence, is that right?"
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2470.794,2475.481,There was a claim for unseaworthiness and negligence and that issue was submitted to the jury --
1962.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.481,2475.589,And --
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2475.589,2479.898,-- for determination and resulted in a verdict for the defendant.
1962.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2479.898,2485.25,"So, that there is no -- the Jones Act or unseaworthiness claim left here."
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2485.25,2486.52,"That's -- that is correct, Mr. Justice White."
1962.463,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2486.52,2488.928,Nothing to be intertwined with.
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2488.928,2491.178,"That is correct, Mr. Justice White."
1962.463,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2491.178,2502.043,(Inaudible)
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2502.043,2508.249,"Well, to answer your question, Mr. Justice Goldberg, it should be determined there."
1962.463,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2518.954,2522.068,(Inaudible)
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2522.068,2526.499,It was decided against the petitioner.
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2526.499,2536.67,"Well your -- your point, I gather, is that the question on which we granted certiorari and the present posture of the case simply isn't here."
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2536.67,2537.435,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2537.435,2542.5,What we have now is an isolated single claim for maintenance and cure.
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2542.5,2542.979,That's correct.
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2542.979,2544.484,Not joined to anything else.
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2544.484,2545.593,Correct.
1962.463,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2557.499,2605.851,(Inaudible)
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2605.851,2609.126,"That's the problem presented here, Your Honor."
1962.463,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2615.737,2617.137,(Inaudible)
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2617.137,2617.503,Yes.
1962.463,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2617.503,2638.155,(Inaudible)
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2638.155,2643.165,That's right sir.
1962.463,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2696.008,2698.321,"Well, may I get this through?"
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2719.883,2720.846,"No, just to one."
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2721.516,2721.831,Just to one.
1962.463,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2721.831,2722.951,Just to one.
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2722.951,2731.118,Does the seaman have a right to a jury trial on a claim for unpaid maintenance and cure when joined with a claim for Jones Act negligence?
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2732.367,2741.429,"So, it's not his fault if we severed this now so that's -- and make it a maintenance and cure claim, is it?"
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2742.358,2749.97,"It's not his fault, if Your Honor please, that this Court has seen fit to deny his -- the other questions that he presented."
1962.463,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2755.489,2778.287,(Inaudible)
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2778.287,2827.225,"Going back again to the history of the admiralty maritime jurisdiction prior to the Constitution, even in state courts, maritime matters were heard and determined and in those instances, jury trials were permitted and when the Constitution was enacted or rather when the Judiciary Act was passed and the Congress set up the inferior courts and invested them with jurisdiction in these admiralty maritime matters, they specifically reserved to suitors the right to pursue whatever remedies were existing at that time in the common law courts of the states and colonies."
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2841.402,2867.19,"So, you're -- in basic agreement, as I understand you with Mr. Friedman, aren't you, Mr. Danahar, on the outer limits of this thing?On the general framework, you say that you agree with him, as I understand it that perhaps you don't, that if this certainly -- if this were in a -- in a state court, an action exclusively for maintenance and cure, the plaintiff would be entitled upon request to a jury trial."
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2867.19,2867.969,"Yes, I do."
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2867.969,2876.77,And do you all -- further agree that in a federal court where jurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship there would also be such a right?
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2876.77,2878.2,"I do, sir."
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2878.2,2890.48,"And you -- and then he agrees with you on the other hand that if jurisdiction is based only on the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts and there's a single action for maintenance and cure, that he would have no right to a jury trial."
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2890.48,2890.95,Correct.
1962.463,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2890.95,2896.89,"And I think therefore, you -- at least on the outer limits, we've narrowed the controversy between you."
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2896.89,2897.538,That's correct.
1962.463,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2897.538,2924.144,"Mr. Danahar, I suggest that you both (Inaudible)"
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2924.144,2926.319,"I would be interested in that case, Your Honor."
1962.463,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2926.319,2952.45,(Inaudible)
1962.463,1,35701,matthew_l_danahar,,2952.45,2999.197,"In summary, I would just like to say that in the absence of diversity, it is the position of the respondent that maintenance and cure claim is not properly triable to a jury on the civil side of the federal court, that pendency of policy considerations notwithstanding the District Court, does not have the power to extend this right to a jury trial in his maritime claim for maintenance and cure."
1962.463,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2999.197,3001.016,Mr. Friedman.
1962.463,2,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,3001.016,3010.75,"With the Court's permission, I would like to respond to a couple of points and particularly to point out the following."
1962.463,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3169.83,3180.624,"Well, I think in a sense, suggested independently that 1331 point that probably a jury trial is required where joined with a Jones Act case, could it?"
1962.463,2,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,3180.624,3184.638,"Well, that's our position here, sir."
1962.463,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3185.801,3206.76,"But the fed -- but your -- accepting everything you say about his right of action in a state court and a right to a jury trial there, a federal court is a court of limited jurisdiction and the jurisdiction in this case was invoked, the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal court was invoked, was it not?"
1962.463,2,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,3206.84,3211.497,"With all respect, Your Honor, that is the basic point I want to make and the answer there is no."
1962.463,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3211.497,3211.567,Tell me why.
1962.463,2,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,3211.567,3213.582,That is the basic point I want to make.
1962.463,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3220.67,3221.472,"Right, right."
1962.463,2,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,3221.472,3228.647,"He claimed, just as a man with a copyright and an unfair competition case, the classic Hurn v. Oursler case."
1962.463,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3234.783,3235.381,Right.
1962.463,2,42663,theodore_h_friedman,,3235.381,3241.201,He claimed that he had a substantially related claim under maintenance and cure.
