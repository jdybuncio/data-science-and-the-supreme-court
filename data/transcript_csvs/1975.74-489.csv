1975.74-489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.837,We will hear arguments next in 74-489.
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,19.391,20.605,I think I would Mr. Chief Justice if it is convenient for the Court.
1975.74-489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,20.605,24.32,Then we will begin at 1 o’clock and open with your case?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,24.32,37.78,Thank you.[Lunch break]
1975.74-489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,37.78,42.635,Mr. Friedman you may proceed on 489.
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,42.635,46.109,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,119.715,143.386,"Mr. Friedman, in your view, does that term unwarranted invasion mean that there is a balancing process that is to balance the importance of the disclosure to the person asking for it against the potential for injury to the subject?"
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,143.386,145.5,I would think so Mr. Chief Justice --
1975.74-489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,145.5,147.383,And the legislative history shed any light?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,147.383,153.422,The legislative history does indicate that in that phrase Congress did intend there to be a balancing.
1975.74-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.352,201.094,Does unwarranted invasion of personal privacy modifies only the similar files?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,201.094,203.235,That is our submission Mr. Justice.
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,401.867,404.176,Are there proceedings that are transcribed?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,404.176,406.824,The proceedings are not transcribed Mr. Justice.
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,427.186,433.39,"At that stage Mr. Friedman, is there any file or some kind collected?"
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,433.39,437.203,Well only in the sense that the written statements are taken.
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,438.498,440.511,What goes into the file?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,440.511,443.766,"I do not know what goes into the file in that sense, Mr. Justice."
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,443.766,451.138,And is there a difference when the result is guilt as against either innocence or with discretion?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,451.138,457.791,The only difference Mr. Justice is this and if I may come just to that in a minute because I think I should explain what happens.
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,477.051,478.333,"Prepared by whom, the recorder?"
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,478.333,480.702,Prepared by the recorder of the Board.
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,587.715,592.146,How do I get 40 copies one for each of the 40 squadrons?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,592.146,592.857,One for each of the --
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,592.857,594.616,And does each have its own bulletin board?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,594.616,595.93,And each has its own bulletin board.
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,595.93,602.348,And so what then are distributed throughout the Academy are 40 copies?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,602.348,607.358,40 copies plus a few additional to various of the departments that should have these information.
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,607.358,611.368,And they are posted for how long?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,611.368,613.163,"Generally, until the end of the academic year."
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,613.163,614.117,And then what happens to them?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,614.117,615.627,Then they are destroyed.
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,629.954,633.257,And this suit was to gain access to the Master File?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,633.257,635.111,To gain access to the summaries.
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,635.111,637.782,But with the names included?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,637.782,639.061,With names deleted.
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,639.061,646.395,And I gather the Court of Appeals said the law should be in camera proceedings to see if there should be further reduction.
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,646.395,670.665,"Well, what the Court of Appeals in effect, as I will come to in a minute said was that if recognized that even with these names eliminated there was a great danger that this might be down to the cadet’s detriment because of dredging up all things but that went on and said but eliminate the names and maybe you can eliminate other identifying material and with those eliminations we hope --"
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,670.665,676.903,And eliminate other identifiable material in camera proceeding conducted by the District Judge?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,676.903,688.555,"By the District Judge, which it seems to us, it is basically inconsistent with the Court’s previous recognition at several points in its opinion that even elimination of these details will not be enough."
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,720.352,731.539,"May I get back to Justice, is there anything in the record which indicates that for sure all 40 copies at the end of the school year of each of these summaries is collected and destroyed?"
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,731.539,741.189,"No, there is nothing for sure but all I can say is this indications, they say that in the record and I was advised that that is in fact the general practice."
1975.74-489,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,741.189,754.999,Is there anything to prevent the cadet for example from taking it off the bulletin board in making 39 Xerox copies other than the Honor Code itself?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,754.999,767.268,"The Honor Code itself I would think Mr. Justice plus the fact that I assume the cadets, most of the cadets at least are aware of the importance of the Honor Code and the importance of the Honor Code and the importance of preserving its confidentiality."
1975.74-489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,771.941,780.501,Are the cadets not committed in some way to keep knowledge of these things to themselves or not?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,780.501,782.057,"Oh! Well, it is repeatedly."
1975.74-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,804.992,810.747,"Mr. Friedman, none of these are in the record? Are any of these summaries?"
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,810.747,811.945,"No, they are not Mr. Justice."
1975.74-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,811.945,820.823,"Well, I am basically trying to figure what could be in there, they took the name and connection and all what could beat him then been?"
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,820.823,823.85,"Well, it depends what you mean by his connection."
1975.74-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,830.214,844.778,"Well, I could say that a cadet was found smoking marijuana in the basement room in Barrack C, there is nothing identified in that would he?"
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,844.778,848.078,Well even that if there was a room around at the academy.
1975.74-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,872.104,875.844,Do you not think we should have something that we know what we are talking about?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,877.392,889.608,"Well, Mr. Justice the problem we are having something is that itself would breach the very confidentiality of the documents to have something because the whole purpose to which we are --"
1975.74-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,889.608,896.446,"Well, we have to take your word that there might be something which you do not know anything about."
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,896.446,898.912,It is more than my word Mr. Justice.
1975.74-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,902.172,905.864,What about the two officers in the Air Force Academy?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,905.864,910.719,And the Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force and the Court of Appeals.
1975.74-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,910.719,915.49,If they give me one example I might be able to understand what they are talking about.
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,915.49,916.76,And the Court of Appeals.
1975.74-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,965.646,973.654,"Now, whose testimony is that that says it does specifically mention the group that the man belongs to?"
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,974.085,975.369,There is nothing in that but --
1975.74-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,975.369,981.023,But suppose that they said an Air Force cadet did something?
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,984.708,987.713,But I do not think that that is what they are seeking Mr. Justice.
1975.74-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1018.002,1027.79,"Won't we have a better case if the District Judge looked at it in Camera, took out what he thought should be taken out and then we look at it."
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1027.79,1031.134,You might have a better case but we do not think that is what the statute requires.
1975.74-489,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1031.134,1035.327,"Well, we have a case that we know something about what we are talking about."
1975.74-489,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1035.327,1053.836,I think the Court does know Mr. Justice on the basis of these affidavits explaining how and why the release of this information would and could have a very serious consequence upon the future careers of these cadets.
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1897.423,1901.081,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1942.441,1947.505,"Case abstracts, Mr. Parker that is synonymously summaries as Mr. Friedman has used the word."
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1947.505,1949.43,"Yes sir, it is."
1975.74-489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1971.05,1975.897,"Mr. Parker, under auspices?"
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1975.897,1986.817,"Well, the plaintiff is a former member of the NYU Law Review."
1975.74-489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1992.11,1995.189,"Well, when you say auspices, I take it --"
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,1995.189,2006.255,"I mean in connection with there, I do not mean to suggest that the work was being done in connection with there work for the review."
1975.74-489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2006.255,2008.398,All right.
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2013.626,2016.264,"Unfamiliar with that disclaimer, yes sir."
1975.74-489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2016.264,2027.162,"It does state, the publication does not indicate adoption reviews expressed herein by NYU, the New York University School of Law, the New York University Law Review or its editors."
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2027.162,2028.397,"Yes Sir, I understand that."
1975.74-489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2028.397,2031.1,And just so we understand what the word auspices mean.
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2031.1,2031.994,Yes Sir.
1975.74-489,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2031.994,2035.224,The complainants are not officers of the law review presently are they?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2035.224,2040.029,"No Sir, they were at the time at various stages during administrative proceedings."
1975.74-489,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2040.029,2042.001,Is Mr. Pedowitz still a party?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2042.001,2042.803,Pardon me.
1975.74-489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2042.803,2044.279,Is Mr. Pedowitz still a party?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2044.279,2046.741,Yes Sir.
1975.74-489,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2064.02,2066.389,Is their any question of mootness in this case?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2071.78,2074.52,"No Sir, there is not."
1975.74-489,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2125.675,2128.994,"But the study has been published, has it not?"
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2128.994,2130.127,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1975.74-489,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2130.127,2134.596,"Without obviously, any reliance on these documents."
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2134.596,2150.794,"Well, there is discussion of, that was one of the major problems and in terms of the timing of the publication of the study they had to publish it before the adjudicative process had ended."
1975.74-489,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2156.907,2158.633,"No, I am not talking about the standing."
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2158.669,2161.154,-- are to be made available to any person.
1975.74-489,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2161.154,2163.672,Mootness not standing.
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2169.718,2188.954,"Well, the Second Circuit solicited views on that question and both our responses and the responses of the government are part of the record and neither of us believe that the controversy was moot."
1975.74-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.954,2197.088,So long as you continue to walk the information I take it that is sufficient to give you a stand to go into Court under the Freedom of Information Act?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2197.088,2198.272,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-489,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2198.272,2203.022,But is there an allegation anywhere that you continue to want it after the study was completed?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2203.022,2211.366,The record clearly indicates that there was a continuing interest on the part of the respondents in these documents.
1975.74-489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2211.366,2239.621,"In your view Mr. Parker, does the term unwarranted modifying either intrusion or some were to that effect require a balancing process as I inquired with Mr. Friedman so as to measure the reasons for which the information is sought or has been suggested."
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2248.995,2257.195,"Well, I believe Your Honor that the primary focus of the Act is public access to information."
1975.74-489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2285.252,2287.359,But then there is a term unwarranted.
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2294.061,2315.794,"I believe that the unwarranted language is designed to authorize the Court to look at the seriousness of the likelihood that somebody’s privacy will be invaded and as I will explain in a moment Your Honor, I think in connection with the disclosure of these abstracts, there is no reasonable probability that anybody’s privacy will be invaded."
1975.74-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2315.794,2329.667,"How about the balancing on the other side, under the unwarranted clause, do you look at the Court’s conception of the importance of the need that is asserted by the plaintiffs."
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2346.231,2347.208,I do not believe so.
1975.74-489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2361.037,2372.402,"Well, I wonder Mr. Parker might that 6(b) interpreted as implying that there is an invasion to personal property."
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2392.587,2393.959,"Well, I do not believe Mr. Justice."
1975.74-489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2408.13,2410.716,I am just wondering if the Congress did not make that conclusion.
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2410.716,2411.097,I do not believe they did.
1975.74-489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2411.097,2411.607,The way --
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2411.607,2418.095,I do not believe that that was there concern.
1975.74-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2495.272,2497.43,This is only for one year?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2497.43,2497.818,Pardon me.
1975.74-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2497.818,2499.901,"It is only for a year, is it not?"
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2499.901,2503.075,"That they opposed it? Yes sir, but they are --"
1975.74-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2503.075,2507.46,And they are not available to the general public after that?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2507.46,2508.239,They are not.
1975.74-489,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.352,2512.397,They are not available to any of the other cadets after that?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2512.397,2514.141,I do not believe that is the case.
1975.74-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2537.35,2540.375,Any cadet Or just those involved with the --
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2540.375,2545.387,Any cadet I believe who is interested in what and how the academy has functioned --
1975.74-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2545.387,2549.215,"Let us assume that is not so, does that change your case?"
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2555.498,2557.763,After one year?
1975.74-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2557.763,2558.929,Yes.
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2561.647,2564.603,I do not believe that changes the case at all.
1975.74-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.603,2568.498,"And they are not available to general public when they are posted either, are they?"
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2568.498,2569.793,Oh! That is correct.
1975.74-489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.793,2573.271,Or even the cadets generally?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2573.271,2578.087,They are available to cadets generally when they are posted that is why they are posted.
1975.74-489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2579.293,2584.906,Are they posted at areas where members of the general public visiting the academy could read them?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2584.906,2587.399,"Well, I do not know."
1975.74-489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2602.385,2605.824,"Well, does that not mean they are available in public?"
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2605.824,2610.081,I do not believe it means they are unavailable to the public period or at any time.
1975.74-489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2611.448,2611.956,"Well, is that not term --"
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2611.956,2615.041,I am just puzzled as to what that means.
1975.74-489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2615.041,2622.401,"I agree it was somewhat ambiguous, but is that not to be read as meaning, it is not available to the general public."
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2622.401,2627.856,I do not believe the record supports that and I did not so read that statement.
1975.74-489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2627.856,2634.816,Is there any indication on the record that anyone outside has ever had access to it?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2634.816,2640.773,No and by the same token there is no indication of the other way.
1975.74-489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2668.925,2690.018,"But looking to governmental practices in general Mr. Parker, in the Department of Interior and Department of Justice or anywhere else where you have a personnel file presumably on every employee, and there is limited access to that personnel file of course as we know."
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2711.382,2714.737,It could.
1975.74-489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2714.737,2719.93,"It is a personnel action, is it not whether he is cleared or whether he is not cleared?"
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2719.93,2721.74,Yes Sir.
1975.74-489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2745.075,2765.469,"Well, it is not uncommon for one agency whether say the Department of Interior, to ask for access to personnel file of an employee, a lawyer in the Department of Justice, I take it, you are familiar that that is a common governmental practice."
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2789.37,2794.169,Presumably.
1975.74-489,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2794.169,2806.205,"For me, it is pretty difficult to separate charges of this kind from personnel records and personnel files."
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2806.205,2838.97,"Well, I think that unless that separation is made, the texture of B(6) becomes completely open ended, because you are then talking about a situation where theoretically a relationship with personal matters can make any document such as the ones here which are widely disseminated for instructive and didactic purposes."
1975.74-489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2872.303,2893.062,"Tell me Mr. Parker do you take the position that the fact that these summaries, abstracts are posted on 40 bulletin boards to be seen by 4200 cadets in and of itself takes it necessarily outside the reach of six?"
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2893.062,2894.636,I do Your Honor.
1975.74-489,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2894.636,2898.459,Just the fact that is such a broad distribution.
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2898.459,2913.073,"When Congress enacted Exemption 6, it was concerned with protecting intimate information about an individual which could be correlated with that individual."
1975.74-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2926.69,2936.124,Would you read the unwarranted language as modifying personnel and medical files too as well as similar files?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2936.124,2936.909,Yes Sir.
1975.74-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2936.909,2939.319,You have to give the answer you did to Justice Brennan.
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2939.319,2940.356,Yes Sir.
1975.74-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2950.514,2960.113,"If you are wrong on that point, then it would seem to me that Congress has given a flat exemption to personnel files."
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,2969.795,2973.677,"Well, that is a hypothetical question and that would be correct Your Honor."
1975.74-489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3074.739,3076.066,Could I interrupt you Mr. Parker?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,3076.066,3076.686,Yes Sir.
1975.74-489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3076.686,3082.993,Where would you draw the line as to medical files putting personnel files aside?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,3088.271,3111.877,"Well, I would admit that much hard showing would be required to a medical file but by the same token, there could be valuable statistical or factional information in medical files which could and should be disclosed and that disclosure would involve no invasion of personal privacy and is certainly would not --"
1975.74-489,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3111.877,3113.022,For example?
1975.74-489,1,17953,barrington_d_parker_jr,,3113.022,3115.744,A clearly unwarranted one.
1975.74-489,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3773.931,3777.105,I expect my time might have expired Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.74-489,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3777.105,3778.34,We have extended both of your time.
1975.74-489,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3778.34,3778.985,Oh! Thank you.
1975.74-489,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3805.032,3806.724,"I am sorry Mr. Friedman, that is page?"

1975.74-489,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3841.861,3843.287,What is the mission element?
1975.74-489,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3843.287,3844.016,Mission?
1975.74-489,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3844.016,3845.354,Mission element.
1975.74-489,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3914.317,3918.233,Do you say the amendments change no rule of law at all?
1975.74-489,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3918.233,3918.747,That is the way things are.
1975.74-489,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3918.747,3920.808,As far as disclosability is concerned?
1975.74-489,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3920.808,3926.408,As far as segregating out disclosable and non-disclosable things.
1975.74-489,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3955.709,3974.015,"But Mr. Friedman, I do not see how the government could really object that if a District Court looked at the personnel file and said this is the kind of information has just been put in here to conceal it and that this is not the kind of information that was normally part of it."
1975.74-489,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3974.015,3976.408,"Well, we have no question Mr. Justice."
1975.74-489,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3985.232,3989.112,What if they look at these summaries and say they are not a personnel file?
1975.74-489,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3995.725,4002.239,I would think if the Court would have hold that these are not personnel files but is something else that would be one thing.
1975.74-489,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4003.504,4005.692,"Well, that is part of the argument."
1975.74-489,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4005.692,4022.556,"Well, the argument as I understand that Mr. Justice, the argument as I understand is not that the Court should examine it in camera to determine if it is a personnel file but to examine it in camera to see whether or not by excising certain material, it can now be safely disclosed."
1975.74-489,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4022.556,4030.425,"Well, I know they go that far but I would think, a fortiori, they would say they could examine it to determine whether it is a personnel file?"
1975.74-489,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4030.425,4038.391,"Yes, but I think if they find that it is a personnel file, I think that is the end of the inquiry because they would take it one step beyond and say it can be senate."
1975.74-489,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4038.391,4048.143,What if the Court found that it was not a personnel file and the judgment have a further step would he not determine whether it was a similar file?
1975.74-489,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4048.143,4055.091,"Yes, well, I do not think there is any question that these are if not personnel; similar files that Court of Appeals so treated."
1975.74-489,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4064.565,4066.112,This is a weighing process?
1975.74-489,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4066.112,4067.982,Yes.

1975.74-489,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4075.848,4077.159,I do not recall it.

1975.74-489,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4079.102,4080.238,In the red brief?
