2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.685,"We'll hear argument next in Case 15-458, Dietz v. Bouldin. Mr. Shanmugam."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,5.685,17.51,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a judge discharges a jury after it reaches a verdict, the jury's service is at an end and the jurors return to being ordinary members of the public."
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,49.2,74.755,"I thought you had a clear bright-line rule until I got to page 9 of your reply brief, where you say, ""A jury may remain effectively undischarged despite a judge's pronouncement of discharge."" There are cases where you agree that if the judge says you're discharged, they're not really discharged, and the judge can say, oh, come on back. I've got something else you've got to do."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,74.755,77.475,"Mr. Chief Justice, our rule is clear."
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,87.78,91.39,"Well, that's pretty lawyerly. (Laughter.)"
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,91.39,97.31,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. (Laughter.)"
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,97.31,100.11,"Saying anytime you're discharged, it's over."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,108.71,114.63,"And that is simply, Mr. Chief Justice, because we believe the discharge is an act; it's not just a pronouncement."
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,125.05,125.29,Okay.
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,129.85,133.52,"That is what lower courts have said, and we're certainly comfortable with that distinction."
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,133.7,138.35,"So if they're still -- if they're still in the courtroom, he can say, wait, hold up."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,139.72,140.53,"Yes, that is correct."
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,141.94,144.575,What if they're in the hall outside the courtroom?
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,144.575,144.89,The hall --
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,144.89,146.7,Nothing's happened. They're all still there.
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,146.7,149.39,The hall is outside a judge's presence and control.
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,182.44,198.905,"What they're worried about -- what they're worried about with the rule about discharge and then bringing them back is that the jurors may have talked to somebody about the case, heard something about it, had information that's going to be prejudicial to the defendant that they shouldn't have gotten."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,211.36,227.54,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the courts that have adopted that functional definition of discharge, that have looked at discharge as the point at which jurors have separated or dispersed, have focused on the potential for influence, not the fact of influence."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,293.765,303.63,"I was just going to say that once you take those cases away, Respondent really does not have very much by way of common law authority on which to rest."
2015.15-458,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,303.63,310.615,Am I -- are you confirming that you're not raising a constitutional barrier to the recall of jurors?
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,310.615,311.0,Yes.
2015.15-458,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,323.84,324.905,All right.
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,326.685,327.96,"Yes, that is correct."
2015.15-458,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,327.96,334.565,"In most fair trial analyses, we look to prejudice."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,361.645,368.6,"Justice Sotomayor, that is for the simple reason that we believe this is really a question about a district court's authority."
2015.15-458,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,370.63,372.49,"Well, there's no statutory bar."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,372.49,376.15,"Well, that is correct, and there is no explicit bar in the rules."
2015.15-458,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,420.61,428.989,"Well, we don't have a specific rule that permits district courts to rescind any order they've issued."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,442.025,457.57,"District courts have authority to be sure to rescind certain types of orders. In our reply brief, we point to various examples of orders that cannot be rescinded, such as a decision by a district court to transfer venue, a decision by a district judge to --"
2015.15-458,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,457.57,460.42,But those are statutorily barred from happening.
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,460.42,463.05,"Well, I don't -- I don't think that that's right."
2015.15-458,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,486.53,493.765,"But until -- until final judgment, is the -- the rule is everything is interlocutory."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,521.64,535.095,"And, Justice Ginsburg, all of the examples to which I just pointed are orders that, notwithstanding the fact that final judgment in the case has not yet been entered, are nevertheless orders that the entering judge cannot revoke."
2015.15-458,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,644.305,654.985,"In your -- in your view -- let's suppose the jury were truly discharged and they -- they were away for a day, could -- but the judgment hasn't been entered yet."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,663.835,685.58,"No, for the simple reason that I don't think you would know what a correctly instructed jury would have done in that circumstance. And indeed, in this case, the further complication was that the jury was required not only to award the $10,000 in stipulated damages for past medical expenses, but also to award some amount for future expenses."
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,692.45,699.72,"What if the jury is discharged and the judge is looking at the verdict and, I don't know, shows it to the lawyers and says, okay, it's 28,000."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,707.6,715.835,"The proper remedy in that circumstance, Mr. Chief Justice, would be the one that I've just suggested, namely a proceeding under Rule 60(a) of the Civil Rules."
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,762.71,770.27,"Well, but does, in a certain sense -- I don't know if I -- it's certainly not a clerical error, but it is a simple error."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,787.19,791.94,"So, Mr. Chief Justice, I think it's certainly fair to say that the error in this case was an obvious one."
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,840.38,845.205,"Well, you mean with respect to the amount they were -- they were obligated to award?"
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,845.205,850.03,"Well, that is correct. Well, with regard to the award, more generally."
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,857.06,863.745,"But the only sense -- the only sense in which it was contrary to the evidence was that they didn't award the $10,000."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,865.065,865.41,Yes.
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,865.41,866.085,If they had --
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,866.085,871.12,"Well, plus some amount for future medical expenses."
2015.15-458,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,898.62,927.935,"May I ask you about the basis for the legal rule you're asking us to adopt? And let's just assume, for the sake of argument, that there isn't any Federal rule that sheds very much light directly on this question. So then your argument seems to come down to two points: One is that there's nothing that gives the -- the -- expressly, or maybe even by implication, gives the trial judge the power to do this."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,972.885,980.18,"So Justice Alito, we're certainly not here arguing that there has to be an express grant of authority in the Federal Rules."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1035.16,1050.46,"Well, before you do that, what -- what rule should we adopt with respect to common law practices, common law trial practices where not -- or 19th century trial practices? Courts have to follow them unless there's something that says they don't?"
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1050.46,1051.25,"No, not at all."
2015.15-458,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1098.69,1100.6,But it has to be absolutely necessary.
2015.15-458,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1114.26,1118.45,What -- was that absolutely necessary? What -- what would be the thought process there?
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1118.45,1121.02,A -- a district court surely has the authority to permit the jury to eat.
2015.15-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1144.28,1149.81,"Why not? Why not? Why isn't it? I mean, it's very expensive to have new trials."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1185.625,1199.06,"So Justice Breyer, in analyzing questions of inherent authority, this Court has never engaged in policy balancing, and it's focused on the three considerations: It's focused on history, the rules and on necessity, and the availability --"
2015.15-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1199.06,1199.65,We never have.
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1201.42,1205.215,"Well, if this Court wishes to engage in policy balancing --"
2015.15-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1205.215,1208.86,"Well, we -- we don't need the words -- saves people a lot of money, this particular --"
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1208.86,1209.45,"Well, and I --"
2015.15-458,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1209.45,1213.33,"-- exercise, and there really isn't much reason in terms of fairness not to do it."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1213.33,1216.425,And I'm not sure that that is always going to be true.
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1385.8,1388.645,"The policy arguments, I think, ring a little hollow."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1398.785,1399.19,But I think --
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1399.19,1411.495,"And yet, when it does come up, we have this concern that Justice Breyer pointed out, that it's a big waste of money to have the jury have to start -- I guess a new jury, right -- have to be a new jury -- start all over again."
2015.15-458,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1411.495,1414.72,"But I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that that counts in our favor."
2015.15-458,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1558.47,1563.905,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal."
2015.15-458,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1563.905,1579.49,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the Chief Justice and Justice Breyer have indicated, under Petitioner's rule, a trial lasting a week, a month, a year would have to be entirely redone just because one juror took one step outside one courtroom one minute after a verdict."
2015.15-458,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1589.1,1596.19,"Mr. Katyal, my problem is I have problems with his rules; I have problems with yours. (Laughter.)"
2015.15-458,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1596.19,1626.935,"So you've got to -- and -- and I think it's some of what the government is saying. Putting aside the questioning here, which troubles me in its adequacy, okay, it's not uncommon -- it was perhaps uncommon in this case for families to be crying outside of courtrooms, for families to be talking to each other and visibly expressing either their pleasure or displeasure at what a jury did."
2015.15-458,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1684.575,1685.165,So --
2015.15-458,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1685.165,1708.67,"And the next day, they're reaching out to the court or they're reaching out to one of the party's attorneys and wanting to undo the verdict. But what's the rule that takes care of all of those things? Is -- is it the boundless ability to recall juries? What are the circumstances a court should look at? What's your rule? Give me a rule that --"
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1708.67,1721.64,"Justice Sotomayor, I'll give you our rule, and then, hopefully, I can explain why I think his rule is really problematic. So our rule is very simple and deals with all of those things, which is that power after discharge is parallel to the power before discharge."
2015.15-458,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1722.74,1724.255,"I know, but you're making that up."
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1724.255,1724.94,"No, no, no."
2015.15-458,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1724.94,1726.68,And it doesn't take care of the things I talked about.
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1726.68,1727.22,"Well, it does."
2015.15-458,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1746.9,1748.32,"Well, it depends on the courthouse."
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1757.23,1758.19,"Quite -- quite right, Your Honor."
2015.15-458,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1777.31,1777.59,Do you think --
2015.15-458,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1777.59,1778.34,Would your rules --
2015.15-458,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1778.34,1778.71,-- but you're not --
2015.15-458,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1778.71,1782.015,-- apply equally in a criminal case?
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1782.015,1787.38,"We think that -- that you don't have to get into it, but we do think that they generally do here."
2015.15-458,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1788.54,1804.15,"What about impaneling the jury? Suppose the judge impanels the jury and then decides that the impanelment was defective -- one juror wasn't there -- and three hours later, reimpanels the jury."
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1805.18,1810.03,"Well, I think in that circumstance, again, it's -- you know, the discharge has nothing to do with it."
2015.15-458,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1810.85,1812.135,I'm talking about impanelment.
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1812.135,1812.64,Right.
2015.15-458,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1817.31,1820.17,"Well, you said it applies in criminal and civil cases."
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1824.945,1825.51,Correct.
2015.15-458,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1825.51,1834.84,"Which is a sweeping statement when we talk about -- but in double jeopardy rules, double jeopardy applies the moment there's an impanelment."
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1834.84,1835.23,Absolutely.
2015.15-458,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1836.73,1841.46,And I'm not -- and I'm not sure how your rule would accommodate that principle.
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1841.46,1843.59,So we have a very limited undue principle.
2015.15-458,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1864.25,1869.565,"Well, but your -- your principle is whatever -- you say whatever the judge can do, he can undo."
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1874.98,1882.15,"That's -- but we do make very clear that's tempered by the inherent power limitations of this Court, which are very extreme."
2015.15-458,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1945.04,1949.665,So I'm not -- I'm not sure you're the one that should be complaining about a rule that's not very clear.
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1980.005,1992.975,"Mr. Chief Justice, our rule is consistent with the way Federal courts deal with jury issues, the rules in the inherent power cases generally, which is to leave this and the hundreds of decisions to district courts to handle in the first instance."
2015.15-458,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2021.925,2031.45,"Suppose we tell -- I mean, look at the totality of the circumstances is a great test, but it doesn't give much guidance to courts below."
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2054.16,2055.51,There -- there are strong limits.
2015.15-458,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2067.55,2069.0,How short is short?
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2069.0,2074.71,"Well, I think, again, that should be left to the district court's decision -- discretion for the following reason."
2015.15-458,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2096.64,2104.05,"And what about geographic -- you wouldn't draw a line at, say, the courthouse door? Once they leave the courthouse, that's it."
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2105.83,2109.29,"I think the Federal case law, and this is clear, actual prejudice is the inquiry."
2015.15-458,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2120.91,2122.92,They have to -- to question each juror.
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2127.525,2145.845,"I think -- I think that would be preferable, but I do think an en masse, you know, questioning, depending on the circumstances of the case, may be appropriate, or something like this in which it's just a couple of minutes and there's no allegation whatsoever of any actual prejudice that anyone talked to anyone besides the clerk of the court."
2015.15-458,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2151.53,2157.61,"Mr. Katyal, I wonder whether there's one difference between the postdischarge case and the predischarge case."
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2189.63,2197.6,"I can certainly see a Federal court, particularly if the length of discharge is lengthy, getting into that and saying, that's why we're not going to have a recall."
2015.15-458,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2221.01,2226.59,It's certainly not going to help courts if we adopt a Federal rule.
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2243.32,2243.675,Right.
2015.15-458,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2274.55,2278.73,"I guess in answer to my question, I was not looking so much for a historical answer."
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2313.465,2316.21,"Justice Kagan, I do think that you should take it seriously."
2015.15-458,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2360.1,2369.51,"When the jurors come back, do they get -- do they get resworn? I mean, the judge just said, thank you very much for your service. You are now discharged."
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2378.845,2381.25,I think that would be the preferable thing to do.
2015.15-458,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2404.44,2406.92,"Again, you would apply the same rule in a criminal case --"
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2406.92,2410.24,"Again, I think the Court shouldn't get into it."
2015.15-458,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2415.4,2421.39,"A defendant who thinks he's been acquitted, five minutes later, an hour later can find out that he's guilty?"
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2421.39,2428.635,"Well, as the government in this last footnote points out, that does happen in the double jeopardy context with respect to mistaken pronouncements."
2015.15-458,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2432.9,2435.49,But the jurors haven't been discharged in those cases.
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2435.49,2436.84,"In those cases, yes, that's right."
2015.15-458,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2464.77,2471.105,"The rules -- the Rules Committee is, I would say, unlikely to address this for the simple reason that it doesn't come up very often."
2015.15-458,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2479.89,2487.92,"The trial was two days. And, Mr. Chief Justice, the Rules Committee does handle a lot of issues that do, you know, involve small issues."
2015.15-458,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2512.01,2523.225,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bash."
2015.15-458,4,29118,john_f_bash,,2523.225,2559.935,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by stating very simply what we think the rule is, and in doing so, hopefully clarify something about this case that I think generates a little bit of confusion. The rule we would apply is that if this is a situation where before the discharge the judge could have sent it back to the jury with a clarifying instruction, then the mere formal pronouncement of discharge does not bar the judge from doing that in a situation where no actual prejudice would result. The reason I said I think that relates to an area of confusion in this case is that in his argument up here, Petitioner's counsel has characterized this as a weight of the evidence problem."
2015.15-458,4,29118,john_f_bash,,2684.085,2697.99,"But I -- I don't think that's -- and I think a district court could properly take that into consideration, but I don't think that's true a few minutes after the discharge. It's one thing to say when you get home and you go back to your spouse or your friends and you say, this is what we did, and they say, wow, I can't believe you did that."
2015.15-458,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2736.42,2741.24,So why can't we recall a jury six months later? Just this case.
2015.15-458,4,29118,john_f_bash,,2741.24,2742.12,"Well, I think that the --"
2015.15-458,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2742.12,2745.15,"I mean, they didn't talk about it afterwards."
2015.15-458,4,29118,john_f_bash,,2759.005,2761.78,"Well, Petitioner had -- we don't think that would be possible."
2015.15-458,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2761.78,2763.6,Why? Give me the limiting prejudice.
2015.15-458,4,29118,john_f_bash,,2763.6,2765.365,Because of the prejudice standard.
2015.15-458,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2765.365,2768.23,What prejudice? You haven't shown any prejudice.
2015.15-458,4,29118,john_f_bash,,2771.49,2777.29,I think it would be reasonable for -- so I guess we're in the situation where six months later some party says we'd like to call --
2015.15-458,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2777.29,2787.425,"I'm talking about one to infinity, because if -- presumably I'm interested in some limits to this."
2015.15-458,4,29118,john_f_bash,,2787.425,2798.25,"And we think it would be reasonable for a district court to say, and even for this Court to say, as a matter of giving guidance to lower courts, that once jurors have returned to their daily lives, they've probably spoken to friends and family about the case."
2015.15-458,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2918.21,2922.2,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Shanmugam."
2015.15-458,5,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2922.2,2928.24,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The rule that we are proposing to the Court is a simple one."
2015.15-458,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2986.75,2993.655,"What about -- what about clerical errors? I understand that's what the rule you pointed to deals with, clerical errors."
2015.15-458,5,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2996.46,3021.47,"Well, I think that the others are these cases like the ones I referred to in my opening argument where, you know, a jury returns two verdict forms and the question is which verdict form is the correct one. In other words, courts have the authority to deal with situations where what you're trying to do is to intuit the jury's intent at the time of the original verdict; to take evidence on historical facts concerning what the jury actually did."
2015.15-458,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3122.62,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
