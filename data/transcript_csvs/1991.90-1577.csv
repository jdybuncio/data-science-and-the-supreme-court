1991.90-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.154,"We'll hear argument now in 90-1577, United States v. R. L. C.."
1991.90-1577,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,9.772,10.689,Thank you.
1991.90-1577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,59.253,61.003,I knew we were in trouble when they said or.
1991.90-1577,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,63.955,64.37,Well--
1991.90-1577,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,64.37,65.822,You know it's poorly drafted.
1991.90-1577,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,69.874,80.082,"--If they poorly drafted it by putting in the or, they at least drafted what comes after the or with sufficient clarity, we believe, to make clear that the Eighth Circuit misread it in this case."
1991.90-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,107.249,120.291,"Another way to put it I suppose, Mr. Larkin, is whether the sentencing guidelines authorize a term of imprisonment any higher... or whether the judge is authorized to impose a sentence in excess of that permitted by the sentencing guidelines."
1991.90-1577,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,120.291,132.884,"Well, the judge is always authorized to impose a sentence if the statute allows a sentence of imprisonment to be imposed, but 5037, in our view, does not in any way incorporate the sentencing guidelines."
1991.90-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,132.884,134.451,"No, that isn't my question."
1991.90-1577,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,148.06,148.876,Yes.
1991.90-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,148.876,149.61,"Oh, he is?"
1991.90-1577,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,149.61,151.278,We clearly think the statute--
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1384.355,1388.224,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1484.554,1492.343,"Ms. Roe, you say that you're not arguing to have the guidelines fully applied to juveniles, but that's cold comfort to the district judge, isn't it?"
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1507.003,1513.407,"Yes, that's correct, justice, that he would have to compute what the maximum sentence would be, but that's different than applying the guidelines."
1991.90-1577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1523.196,1528.667,"I understand that, but as far as the amount of work that the district judge has to go through--"
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1528.667,1529.0,Your Honor--
1991.90-1577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1529.0,1530.719,"--it comes to the same, right?"
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1535.17,1544.842,"--Your Honor, in 1990 there were approximately 47,000 cases in the Federal courts; 170 of those cases were juvenile."
1991.90-1577,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1564.073,1568.058,Would the judge determine upward departures... the possibility of upward departures?
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1568.058,1579.765,"--Yes, there is a possibility of upward departures, but I think in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals decision and as well as the way we argue this, Your Honor, that is no different than if it had been an adult."
1991.90-1577,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1582.401,1584.169,I'm just asking to verify your position.
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1587.788,1588.305,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1577,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1599.096,1601.815,"Ms. Roe, who was the district judge in Minnesota?"
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1601.815,1609.652,"The judge was... Judge MacLaughlin, Your Honor."
1991.90-1577,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1609.652,1611.504,You mention there are only 170.
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1613.789,1614.856,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1991.90-1577,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1614.856,1622.478,--Do you have any idea how many within that 170 the maximum would have been fixed by the age of the juvenile as opposed to the maximum for an adult?
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1622.478,1622.878,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-1577,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1623.261,1626.346,"I would suppose this is a fairly rare case, the one we have here."
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1626.346,1632.417,"--Yes, we believe it is a fairly rare case, Your Honor, but we get our statistics from the administrative office of the court--"
1991.90-1577,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.417,1632.934,And they don't break them down.
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1632.934,1636.469,--And they don't break those down.
1991.90-1577,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1678.898,1700.979,"Before the sentencing guidelines were adopted, Ms. Roe, would it have been impossible for a district judge considering a juvenile's case to sentence the juvenile to some sort of confinement if faced with the argument well, you would have paroled... you would have given an adult probation here?"
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1700.979,1715.088,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe it would have been, because they would have still been subject to the same maximum term of imprisonment, because prior to the sentencing guidelines you determine what the maximum term of imprisonment would be for both an adult and a juvenile by looking at the statutory maximum for the offense."
1991.90-1577,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.088,1730.681,"So although the rule you speak for is that... and a juvenile could never have received a higher maximum sentence than an adult, you're not saying that a juvenile could never have received a harsher sentence than a similarly situated adult."
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1730.681,1731.7,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-1577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.709,1749.025,Is that changed under the guidelines?
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1756.981,1757.365,Your Honor--
1991.90-1577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.365,1761.469,"Even after you apply all the guidelines, does it leave you at least a couple of months to play with?"
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1761.469,1763.035,"--For an adult, it does, Your Honor."
1991.90-1577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.181,1786.767,"But my point is that the situation, if we agree with you, would still be what the situation was before this legislation was passed."
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1796.642,1797.425,"That's correct, your Honor."
1991.90-1577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1797.425,1808.866,"--Because they'd both be applying the guidelines but the judge in the juvenile case may take the upper limit of it and the judge in the adult case may take a lower limit of that particular guideline, right?"
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1808.866,1812.902,"I think that's true, but they would both be subjected to the same maximum."
1991.90-1577,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.924,1824.81,How do you find the maximum?
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1824.81,1830.446,You determine the maximum by essentially making a determination under the guidelines.
1991.90-1577,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.6,1853.895,"So you're really say that whatever the maximum might have been in a case like this, what would have a judge... what would a judge... what would have a judge been able to sentence this particular person for if he had been an adult."
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1853.895,1862.918,"--If he had been tried and convicted as an adult, you need to determine what the maximum would have been for that adult, and then that will be the maximum that you apply to the juvenile."
1991.90-1577,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.918,1872.69,And the maximum could have been... could it ever reach the maximum authorized by statute?
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1872.69,1872.856,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1577,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.081,1888.2,"But absent aggravating circumstances, it could never go up."
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1888.2,1900.023,"Only, Your Honor, if the person had... was probably a very significant criminal history, then the possibility exists that they could come very close to the statutory maximum, if not reach it."
1991.90-1577,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1900.023,1918.735,"Is there some reason why as a matter of policy Congress would not have wanted the juvenile to be subjected to this process of determining whether upward departures are required, because that's what... for instance, in this case there was a stolen automobile which was not included in the manslaughter offense."
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1930.193,1934.479,"First... I believe that's a two-part question, Justice Kennedy."
1991.90-1577,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1942.5,1945.702,Let's just assume that that would be a ground for an upward departure.
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1945.702,1946.152,--All right.
1991.90-1577,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1946.152,1949.954,I'm not sure that it would be.
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1949.954,1955.258,"Then your question I believe is, is there any reason why Congress would not want to subject a juvenile to this proceeding?"
1991.90-1577,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1955.258,1956.091,Yes.
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1956.091,1957.791,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe so."
1991.90-1577,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1981.741,1991.097,I suppose the district judge would have in front of him all of the history and all of the factors that would be taken into account in the guidelines anyway.
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,1991.097,2000.303,"That's correct, and Your Honor, when the case did go back for resentencing, the district judge did not find any aggravating circumstances or any grounds for departure."
1991.90-1577,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2000.303,2005.774,"Ms. Roe, the defendant here has served the shorter sentence, hasn't he?"
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2005.774,2006.591,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-1577,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2006.591,2008.892,"So if you lose here, what happens?"
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2010.575,2013.36,"He was released over 9 months ago, Your Honor."
1991.90-1577,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2028.537,2032.091,What's your guess as to what Judge MacLaughlin might do?
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2032.091,2047.35,"Well, Your Honor, it's hard to say, but certainly when he went back on remand for resentencing Judge MacLaughlin recognized that there were circumstances, and that the circumstances had changed, and sentenced R. L. C. to only 18 months."
1991.90-1577,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2047.35,2051.385,"Well, he's not the hardest nose of the Minnesota Federal judges by any means."
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2051.385,2053.92,"That's correct, Your Honor, he's not."
1991.90-1577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2053.92,2057.039,"Ms. Roe, I have one puzzlement."
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2084.623,2090.01,"Your Honor, I think that subsection (a) essentially addresses a different interest."
1991.90-1577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2118.364,2126.386,"Well, but, why wouldn't the guidelines as a whole be relevant to determining the sentence?"
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2137.841,2146.514,"It's possible, Your Honor, that they didn't actually address the guidelines because this was part of the comprehensive Crime Control Act."
1991.90-1577,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2191.662,2193.662,"Do you think... well, go ahead."
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2207.422,2207.822,I think that--
1991.90-1577,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2207.822,2214.408,They thought that maybe the Sentencing Commission would develop policy statements for juvenile offenders but they've never gotten around to doing it.
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2218.395,2219.929,"--It's a possible reading, Your Honor."
1991.90-1577,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2251.117,2257.187,"I was going to suggest something else, and that was to focus on the word ""pertinent""."
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2305.968,2309.387,"I think that's also a possible interpretation, Justice Souter."
1991.90-1577,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2492.723,2504.899,Could we apply the Rule of Lenity to authorize sentences as well as to these substantive elements of crimes?
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2504.899,2512.569,"Your Honor, I think the answer to that is no."
1991.90-1577,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2517.957,2522.944,That is a rephrasing.
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2522.944,2540.656,"I think this case, Your Honor, is not that inconsiscent with the Chapman case, because in the Chapman case where the Court did not apply the Rule of Lenity, the Court said that when Congress wants to say something, they know how to say it, and if they don't say it, then we can assume that they didn't mean it."
1991.90-1577,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2552.027,2557.831,Did we speak of the Rule of Lenity in so many words in the Chapman opinion?
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2557.831,2561.652,"Your discussion in the Chapman opinion, Your Honor, is very brief."
1991.90-1577,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2561.652,2568.656,"Well, but I think you can answer that question fairly specifically if you remember the Chapman opinion, which I don't."
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2571.925,2572.591,"Yes, Your Honor, you did."
1991.90-1577,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2572.591,2573.158,"We did, okay."
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2573.158,2575.074,"Yes, Your Honor, you did."
1991.90-1577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.523,2601.825,And Chapman was a sentencing case.
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2601.825,2605.795,"No, Your Honor, Chapman was not a... no, Your Honor, Chapman was not a sentencing case."
1991.90-1577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2605.795,2615.818,"Well, I think the Chief Justice was asking for the closest case you have that involved the application of the Rule of Lenity to sentencing, as opposed to whether an act is a crime."
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2616.801,2617.437,I'm sorry.
1991.90-1577,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2640.05,2641.052,--Is that in your brief?
1991.90-1577,1,33963,katherian_d_roe,,2642.318,2648.456,"Your Honor, that is cited in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, which is in the record."
1991.90-1577,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2650.491,2651.608,"Thank you, Ms. Roe."
1991.90-1577,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2653.36,2656.562,"No, Your Honor, not unless the Court has any further questions."
1991.90-1577,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2656.562,2656.928,Very well.
