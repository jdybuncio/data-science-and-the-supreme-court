1968.9_orig_2,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,77.195,87.12,Mr. Claiborne
1968.9_orig_2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,87.12,91.045,Mr. Justice Black and may it please the Court.
1968.9_orig_2,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,360.161,371.224,(Inaudible)
1968.9_orig_2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,371.224,378.04,"Mr. Justice Black, this problem cannot arise with respect to any other state except Florida."
1968.9_orig_2,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,519.51,528.745,Wouldn't -- you line could never move seaward could it?
1968.9_orig_2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,528.745,537.439,"Up to the line, will move seaward from where it is today if there is accretion where there presently erosion."
1968.9_orig_2,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,552.337,554.001,You would move both ways?
1968.9_orig_2,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,554.001,561.092,We would move both ways in some areas.
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,1958.869,1962.474,"Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court."
1968.9_orig_2,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2116.186,2118.079,(Inaudible)
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,2118.079,2121.049,"Yes sir, they certainly do."
1968.9_orig_2,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2192.741,2198.715,"(Inaudible), but it may have gotten any prompt --"
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,2198.715,2200.875,From this stipulated line.
1968.9_orig_2,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2200.875,2202.143,And what's the difference?
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,2202.143,2205.228,The one which the Government and we and the Government both worked out.
1968.9_orig_2,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2223.777,2229.012,"Well, specifically, it's that line marked 1845 shoreline in the map, isn't it?"
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,2229.012,2230.73,"Well, that's just the graphic illustration, yes."
1968.9_orig_2,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2230.73,2231.738,"I know, but that's what --"
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,2231.738,2232.12,Yes.
1968.9_orig_2,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2232.12,2232.901,-- that's what you say.
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,2232.901,2233.425,That's right.
1968.9_orig_2,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2233.425,2238.608,"And you say you measured nine miles from that, that gives you the straight line on the right."
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,2238.608,2239.043,Correct.
1968.9_orig_2,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2239.043,2239.845,That's right.
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,2241.049,2243.088,Right.
1968.9_orig_2,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2260.643,2261.418,Except --
1968.9_orig_2,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2261.418,2262.876,(Inaudible)
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,2262.876,2267.22,"We are stipulated on the line, on where the line is."
1968.9_orig_2,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2272.194,2278.972,"You said last time, the Court was not concerned at all, was it with the proviso of Section 2 (b)."
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,2278.972,2279.481,Well I think --
1968.9_orig_2,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2279.481,2280.817,Is that accurate or not?
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,2280.817,2281.907,"We didn't argue about it, no sir."
1968.9_orig_2,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2281.907,2283.001,You mean that wasn't an issue?
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,2283.001,2285.083,"No sir, it was not."
1968.9_orig_2,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2285.083,2294.061,"So really, you can't -- it's not quite accurate to say that we told you anything last time with respect to the proviso of 2 (b), isn't it?"
1968.9_orig_2,1,26513,houghton_brownlee_jr,,2294.061,2296.023,Maybe we weren't told enough.
1968.9_orig_2,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2849.04,2852.713,"In one sense, Mr. Justice Black that is true."
1968.9_orig_2,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2858.719,2867.232,(Inaudible)
1968.9_orig_2,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2867.232,2871.549,But we're dealing with two quite separate provisions.
1968.9_orig_2,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2918.733,2922.442,(Inaudible)
1968.9_orig_2,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2922.442,2923.902,As it -- as it --
1968.9_orig_2,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2923.902,2927.439,(Inaudible)
1968.9_orig_2,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2927.439,2947.097,"Well, Mr. Justice Black this three-league or nine-mile limitation only applies in the gulf but it applies to all the Gulf States and it simply says that you may take as much as you had when you came into the union but no more than nine miles from the coast."
1968.9_orig_2,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2976.214,2984.098,Do you agree with Mr. Brownlee that that proviso was a response to this 1943 Texas statute?
1968.9_orig_2,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2984.098,2991.841,This proviso was added as I understand on the floor rather as a -- without much explanation.
1968.9_orig_2,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3011.399,3019.522,"Well, if that is so, wouldn't that argue against your idea that the coastline means present coastline?"
1968.9_orig_2,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3019.522,3038.321,"No, for instance in the case of Louisiana, the claim was not a state in number of leagues from the coast or at least the definition of the coast began so far out that this practical matter, there were 20 miles or so out into the gulf."
1968.9_orig_2,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3053.318,3054.008,"Well, I'm just --"
1968.9_orig_2,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3054.008,3056.599,It was just nine miles (Voice Overlap).
1968.9_orig_2,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3056.599,3072.859,"If in the case of Texas what the Congress wanted to be sure that limitation gave them no more than what they had back in 1845, I suggest that might mean that coastline meant the coastline of 1845 and not --"
1968.9_orig_2,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3072.859,3099.818,"Had Texas been the only state against which this limitation was designed and since it happened that Texas had a nine-mile claim, one might have made the inference Your Honor suggest since however it is equally fair to read this limitation as Reed against Louisiana which showed a different sort of claim, I don't think the conclusion is warranted."
