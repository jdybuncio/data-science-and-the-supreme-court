2007.06-694,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.295,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-694, United States v. Williams."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,8.607,19.775,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has made clear that speech proposing an unlawful transaction is not protected by the First Amendment."
2007.06-694,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,54.869,59.695,But if I could start with one of the more compelling hypotheticals on the other side.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,80.358,84.014,"Mr. Chief Justice, we do not think that would be covered by the statute."
2007.06-694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,120.342,122.06,Suppose the distributor attaches the movie review.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,126.153,144.677,"--Again, Justice Kennedy, it might be conceptually possible for somebody to market, let's say a mainstream movie, on the basis of a... either their own statement or an attached review, that misrepresents the nature of the movie and makes a claim for the movie, that it's actual child pornography."
2007.06-694,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,184.457,195.671,"Supposing the underlying movie is a depiction of atrocities being committed in some foreign country, in a war zone or something, by soldiers who rape young kids."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,203.823,208.995,If the movie itself comes within the--
2007.06-694,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,208.995,213.648,The movie itself would be pictures of soldiers raping young kids.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,213.648,216.71,"--And if it were done in a sufficiently graphic way, that it was captured--"
2007.06-694,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,216.71,227.331,"If the news... I'm thinking of the news reel... somebody makes as exhibit at a war crimes trial, or something like that... sees this actually happening."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,235.843,242.652,"--Well, Justice Stevens, there's... I guess there's an anterior problem, which is if the depiction were sufficiently graphic--"
2007.06-694,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,242.652,243.136,They are.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,243.136,251.492,"--The person that would have that film would be in possession of child pornography, which itself would be a problem under the statute."
2007.06-694,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,252.586,255.101,Depiction of a war crime taking place?
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,257.833,269.016,"And that might be an example where, starting with the basic prohibition on the possession of child pornography, that might be a situation where there was a valid as-applied challenge."
2007.06-694,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,282.775,288.821,You do agree I guess that there are some... there would be some valid as-applied challenges to this statute.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,288.821,295.364,"I agree, and I think in theory, at least, there may be valid as-applied challenges to the underlying prohibition."
2007.06-694,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,304.36,312.639,"But Ferber confined the meaning of child pornography to, I think, the greater extent than this statute does."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,345.579,352.373,"It is, Justice Ginsburg but I think in context that would not be something that comes within the ambit of the statute."
2007.06-694,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,354.59,354.825,Why not?
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,366.289,369.102,"--I understand that, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,425.172,430.467,Well what if an individual received actual child pornography in the mail that had not been solicited.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,451.785,455.441,"Justice Souter, I would say that the better answer is no, that he has not."
2007.06-694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,456.097,459.58,"You say no, but you say no because we won't enforce it that way."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,465.578,472.465,"--Justice Souter, I would say no for a more fundamental reason, which is I think you have to read two provisions of the statute here in pari materia."
2007.06-694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,515.37,521.196,"That's... that's fine, but before you get to that point, you have... there's still an indictable offense."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,526.492,535.316,"--You're right, Justice Souter, but that is a problem both for the prohibition on possession and it is not a unique problem for the pandering solicitation provision."
2007.06-694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,548.137,563.772,"But the ban on possession is not the real problem because, under a normal possession statute, you would indeed have a problem not merely in terms of... that could be raised not merely by affirmative defense but as an element of the statute."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,610.346,613.064,"--Well, Justice Souter, let me try two responses."
2007.06-694,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,641.349,641.599,What if--
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,641.599,642.209,--by the statute.
2007.06-694,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,642.209,647.332,"--What if you call up your neighbor and say God, I got this disgusting child porn in the mail?"
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,647.332,662.967,"Well... and, again, I think if you did no more than that, I don't know that you would necessarily be covered by the statute, but if you said I got this disgusting child pornography in the mail, it's clearly unlawful, here take a look, I mean I suppose that is covered by the statute."
2007.06-694,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,664.731,675.305,"Indeed, it is covered by the statute because I read your brief as saying that the statute applies only in instances where either you're trying to sell it or trade it."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,690.688,704.075,"Justice Breyer, I think that we would take the position that even if you are presenting the material, making it available, but you're not charging for it, you're not exchanging it, you're just offering it for free, here's a quick free look, it's still covered by the statute."
2007.06-694,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,704.075,725.862,"If that's covered by the statute, what you're going to do then is suddenly criminalize what could be an awful lot of activity that goes on in schools all over the place and somebody has... they think it's funny, and maybe it isn't funny, but they think it is and it's kind of school-boy behavior, and they're showing this stuff around, not totally certain what it is."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,733.875,743.995,"Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, you know, I think you could certainly interpret the statute to write around that problem if you wanted to, but I do think the most natural reading of the terms"
2007.06-694,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,761.722,762.487,"Well, that's a very different thing."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,800.285,809.796,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, here... I mean I think my first cut at drawing the line would to be say it's not a problem to say, can you believe what I got in the mail, and talk to your neighbor about it, describe it."
2007.06-694,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,817.075,817.652,All right.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,818.744,819.462,If you think though--
2007.06-694,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,819.462,820.261,Take it as that.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,850.608,860.714,"--Well, Justice Breyer, if you think that's the difference between expanding this statute in some enormous way and not, then I would invite you to have a more restrictive view of ""presents""."
2007.06-694,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,875.209,875.661,But--
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,875.661,877.316,--is construed to be constitutional.
2007.06-694,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,879.361,886.438,"--I just wanted to clarify the footnote to which the Chief referred, that footnote 4 in your reply brief."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,916.332,920.081,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think there may be a distinction to be drawn."
2007.06-694,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,951.802,955.144,My understanding was not that it was limited to commercial speech.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,977.621,982.884,"--Well, in fairness, Mr. Chief Justice, I think we had a slightly broader conception of ""presents""."
2007.06-694,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,993.988,995.473,"Well, General Clement, is there--"
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,995.473,995.815,And--
2007.06-694,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,995.815,1013.122,"--Is there anything to suggest that some of these hypotheticals, where people get child pornography unsolicited in the mail or that kids at school are showing each other not just dirty pictures but actual child pornography, are situations that occur with any frequency in the real world?"
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1013.122,1018.402,"--Not at all, Justice Alito, and I think that's an important point with respect to Justice Breyer's hypothetical."
2007.06-694,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1034.768,1035.205,I'm sorry.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1043.406,1061.79,"--Infrequently occurs... especially in the real world, which is to say when pictures or magazines are being handed around from adolescent to adolescent, there is really no reason in the world to suspect that what's being handed from adolescent to adolescent is child pornography as opposed to adult pornography... Playboy and that sort of thing."
2007.06-694,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.548,1085.155,The universe of child pornography includes activities of 17-year olds.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1085.155,1089.606,"--It does, Justice Stevens, but so, too, for the basic prohibition."
2007.06-694,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1129.933,1137.775,"Even though... even though what you are, in fact, showing or presenting does not fit the definition?"
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1174.386,1176.292,"--That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1204.014,1217.695,"And is that your answer to the... all of the hypotheticals that are put forth in the Coalition for Free Speech, the Catholic Bishops, the advertisement in [amazonDOTcom] or Netflix, then?"
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1217.695,1223.553,"Well, Justice Kennedy, we think that all those hypotheticals are taken out with more than one reason."
2007.06-694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1224.943,1226.536,Let's... pardon me.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1226.536,1227.005,--Sure.
2007.06-694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1227.005,1234.737,"Let's assume for the moment that there are minors, so that the content aspect of it is film."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1234.737,1236.127,Oh--
2007.06-694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1236.127,1238.328,That there are real minors in some of these things.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1238.328,1241.732,--But are there real minors engaging in forbidden activity?
2007.06-694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1241.732,1242.014,Yes.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1242.014,1244.653,Actual child pornography?
2007.06-694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1244.653,1244.966,Yes.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1244.966,1250.792,"Well, if the underlying material is actually child pornography, then you may be in a different situation."
2007.06-694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1263.6,1263.835,Right.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1263.835,1267.863,"--and you're simply truthfully promoting it, you have nothing to worry about with this statute."
2007.06-694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1275.58,1278.001,If one had a hand held video at a school or something like that?
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1278.001,1290.761,"--Well, I mean, again... I mean, if you had a hand held video and the video itself was child pornography, and then you got that on the Internet or otherwise and decided you wanted to promote that, I mean would be covered by the statute."
2007.06-694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1291.431,1294.134,There are two things that you... that all of us have to work with here.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1345.597,1359.78,"--Here is how I would try to analyze it, Justice Kennedy, which is I would say that there would be an as-applied challenge there because the basic prohibition on child pornography that would apply to the underlying materials, there would be an as-applied exception to that."
2007.06-694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1366.526,1374.023,"So we want the public to see this to show them how bad it is, and that is permitted under the statute, because it is not ""presenting""?"
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1374.023,1377.866,--I mean there would be another way to try to get at that.
2007.06-694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1377.866,1379.911,I agree with you that we have different motives.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1379.911,1380.317,Right.
2007.06-694,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1380.317,1382.161,But I'm not sure that the statute covers that.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1382.161,1401.653,"Well, there might be a way in which the statute could cover it, and it would be, as follows, which basically is if I'm going to portray that as material that is... and I'm going to portray it only in a way that makes it clear that I have a valid as-applied challenge, then I'm not sure I would be satisfying the objective and the subjective scienter requirements for that statute."
2007.06-694,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.786,1423.3,"Of course, you have a problem not just with the presenting, not just with the pandering of it."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1434.265,1435.812,"--Well, Justice Scalia, that's exactly right."
2007.06-694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1455.912,1467.079,"But how would you do it in the case... you mentioned that if there is not actual child porn shown, and there is a truthful or honest statement about it, that there is nothing to worry about."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1513.31,1515.029,"No, that is not correct, Justice Souter."
2007.06-694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1547.264,1551.076,What if you are 17 years old and you haven't gone to law school and you haven't read these cases?
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1553.481,1558.323,"With respect, Justice Souter, that's why I think it is important to have both an objective and a subjective requirement."
2007.06-694,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1562.571,1565.414,Do we use a seven year old for the objective requirement?
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1565.414,1566.976,"--No, I wouldn't think so."
2007.06-694,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1566.976,1568.054,We would use a--
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1568.054,1569.757,I think we would use a reasonable person.
2007.06-694,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.382,1571.772,"--reasonable adult, I had thought."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1571.772,1573.256,"--Exactly, and that's why I--"
2007.06-694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1573.256,1577.067,Wouldn't we use... wouldn't we use a reasonable personal of the sort who goes to movies?
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1577.067,1580.035,"--That would be fine, Justice Souter, and if--"
2007.06-694,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1580.035,1586.533,"I would suppose my 17 year old, non-law-school graduate would be within the ambit of the reasonable class."
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1586.533,1593.638,"--And I would submit that even a 17 year old, non-law student would know that movies depict things that don't actually happen."
2007.06-694,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1601.933,1603.931,You could... just one question.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1617.113,1618.582,"""Traffic"" is not child pornography."
2007.06-694,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1633.357,1634.529,But the statute says simulated.
2007.06-694,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1634.529,1635.824,--It does.
2007.06-694,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.539,1646.944,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,1653.208,1669.312,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The pandering provision of the PROTECT Act carries a 5-year mandatory minimum prison term and a possible 20-year prison term, has no affirmative defense provision."
2007.06-694,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1723.304,1735.534,"Well, there's a difference, isn't there, between beliefs and thoughts about... what, the legality of a particular type of pornography or something like that, and a factual matter?"
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,1744.764,1746.249,"Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1766.975,1769.255,"But none of those... I mean, we've gone through this with the Solicitor General."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,1777.392,1781.876,--If--
2007.06-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1781.876,1782.796,"Photographers, for example."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,1802.32,1803.146,--Correct.
2007.06-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1840.335,1842.459,"Problem with Ferber, you said."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,1843.1,1843.819,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1843.819,1845.974,So what's your response to what he said?
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,1859.108,1861.421,I do not think it would be protected.
2007.06-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1861.421,1864.904,Then under Ferber he's going to go right to jail because he has them.
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,1881.443,1886.051,"If the material substantively violates the statute, then the mere possession of them is illegal."
2007.06-694,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1919.772,1921.817,"Or just good honest liars, right?"
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,1967.642,1980.684,One of the problems with the issue of social value and lying is that we don't put people in jail for 5 mandatory minimum years or 20 years in prison for simply lying.
2007.06-694,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.495,1984.917,But it depends on what they're lying about.
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,1991.087,2000.738,"--And I agree with Your Honor... Justice Scalia, that we have a slew of State statutes particularly in the area of consumer fraud."
2007.06-694,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.982,2026.135,"Tell me what social value are we protecting here, by protecting the lie about whether this thing that really isn't child pornography is?"
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2028.728,2031.133,We necessarily do not want to protect that.
2007.06-694,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.928,2038.895,Are you complaining about the degree of the penalty?
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2038.895,2040.426,It is not just the degree of the penalty.
2007.06-694,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2085.764,2098.339,"But that's an entirely different thing to say that this car is a great car and it turns out not to be a great car, and to say what you have is either... is not... is child pornography when, in fact, it's not."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2099.62,2109.287,"--I think it could be very... in the real world I think it is very easy for a person to puff about what materials contain that are lawful to possess, such as Titanic, Lolita or American Beauty."
2007.06-694,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2118.8,2120.924,The statute has an objective component.
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2140.775,2165.89,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that if a person listens to or hears somebody describe Titanic, Lolita, American Beauty or any of the films of the like as hot graphic teen sex, I think a reasonable ordinary person could believe that what is being portrayed is proscribed material, even if it doesn't exist, or even if it exists and is protected under Ferber."
2007.06-694,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.89,2170.091,You seem to think we are punishing the lying.
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2174.339,2175.901,"No, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-694,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2175.901,2178.916,You'd be punished even if it were true.
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2211.872,2220.556,"I don't think... I think the statute covers people who brag, people who puff, people who tell the truth, who--"
2007.06-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2220.556,2221.305,"What about ""present""?"
2007.06-694,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2237.705,2245.404,--All of those verbs only become pandering when they are attached to explicit sexual material.
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2259.882,2271.426,"--But the problem with the statute, while it does capture pandering and illegal conduct, it goes beyond that and captures a slew of innocent conduct which we discussed this morning in the examples--"
2007.06-694,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2271.426,2276.33,What would you say is the best realistic example that you can provide to show that this is overbroad?
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2276.33,2284.186,"--The best and realistic example would be any person, not necessarily [amazonDOTcom] or Netflix, it could be a private citizen."
2007.06-694,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2293.041,2293.729,Doing... doing what?
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2293.729,2307.708,"--Who look at the... the Nan Goldin pictures, who look at Lolita, Traffic and all of these other movies and harbor a belief that it is obscene, which is one of the two types of materials that's proscribed."
2007.06-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2307.708,2308.551,Suppose we did this?
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2359.0,2362.795,"My opinion, Justice Breyer, is that could be done."
2007.06-694,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2393.922,2402.279,"Well, I suppose if we were going to do that it would be simpler and maybe prudent for us to reexamine our overbreadth rule."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2441.857,2444.512,"The Court can certainly do that, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-694,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2469.719,2470.282,No.
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2514.42,2517.123,"That certainly could be done, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-694,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2550.547,2557.809,"Here we have... we have one statute that covers advertising, promoting, presenting, distributing, and soliciting."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2582.252,2591.092,"--I believe that that would more narrowly tailor the statute, but I don't believe, Justice Alito, that it would solve the problem of chilling speech."
2007.06-694,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2591.092,2597.106,"No, but isn't the problem the problem of your answer to Justice Breyer's hypothetical."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2648.461,2652.614,"That... it could be, and that would depend."
2007.06-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2665.999,2674.137,"And rewrite... and essentially rewriting the law, and that's my question about this technique that Justice Breyer has proposed."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2721.961,2729.989,"With respect, my initial response to Justice Breyer's suggestion, if you will, was the same as Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-694,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2739.704,2741.484,Why would it lessen?
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2793.542,2796.9,--In answer to Your Honor's question or comment...--
2007.06-694,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2821.328,2829.185,"Well, but it's the boundary between what is... what should be protected in relation to what's unprotected."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2847.521,2851.988,"The problem is we don't have an empirical answer, a mathematic answer to that question."
2007.06-694,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2871.839,2882.74,"Of course, the point of the... the point of the appendix, which unfortunately has the failing of many charming metaphors, is that it has acquired a life of its own."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,2970.081,2983.684,"My response, Justice Breyer, is that if you take the word ""present"" and you give it the meaning that it was given in Ferber, you make the statute narrower."
2007.06-694,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3007.192,3013.266,"But isn't the answer to that you may still have some overbreadth left, but it's not substantial?"
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3085.816,3098.154,"--I think it would, but concededly to a lesser degree, because once you make it clear as to what matters are not covered by the statute, it makes it easier for people to conform their conduct and their words accordingly."
2007.06-694,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3109.306,3127.065,"It can, but can you give me an example of a class of activities that would not be, in effect, insulated from indictment by these two steps in the opinion, that would be of substantial character?"
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3127.065,3151.773,"--Certainly, and I go back to the question of Justice Breyer which is adolescents, 17 year olds, 18 year olds, who like to look at these types of materials and one of them could simply say to another over the Internet, you know, do you think we can get some hardcore child porn?"
2007.06-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3169.188,3172.858,Do we see them getting prosecuted in any state?
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3172.858,3181.261,"If he's soliciting materials under sub (i) or sub (ii) of the statute, of the pandering provision of the statute, yes."
2007.06-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3184.508,3186.743,I asked you have there been such cases?
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3200.3,3211.28,"Your Honor, I cannot cite a specific example, but I can certainly tell Your Honor this... prosecutions from 1997 to 2004 have increased over 452 percent."
2007.06-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3212.39,3215.811,Maybe that's because the quantity of material has increased.
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3215.811,3216.855,--Exactly.
2007.06-694,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3220.713,3225.603,"And if one person says to another, can we get some child pornography, how is that solicitation?"
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3225.603,3226.523,"--""Can you get me""."
2007.06-694,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3226.523,3228.257,"Oh, ""can you get me""."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3228.257,3228.991,"""Can you get me""."
2007.06-694,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3228.991,3231.943,And you think that's protected by the First Amendment?
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3235.88,3244.955,"First of all, it may not be protected by the First Amendment, but it shouldn't be captured by this statute, which puts that 17 year old in jail for 5 to 20 years."
2007.06-694,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3244.955,3248.375,The only thing that limits the statute is the First Amendment.
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3259.4,3262.618,I don't think that it is necessarily not covered by the First Amendment.
2007.06-694,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3270.489,3271.146,But it's not thought at that point.
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3282.907,3291.497,"I think the First Amendment is implied, but I don't think it becomes criminal conduct until you get to either an attempt, solicitation, or a conspiracy."
2007.06-694,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3296.45,3305.913,To fall... to fall under the statute or to be protected by the First Amendment or not protected by the First Amendment?
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3305.913,3306.319,Right.
2007.06-694,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3306.319,3306.928,Which is it?
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3306.928,3310.662,To fall within the protection of the First Amendment.
2007.06-694,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3331.357,3336.276,I mean the model penal code has a general prohibition of soliciting illegal activities.
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3342.179,3359.923,"Solicitation is a crime in and of itself, and talking about or expressing a desire to obtain is not... doesn't quite go to the level of solicitation or intent, where there has to be a proximity in time, in immediacy, and a certain geographical proximity between the words and the comment that you intend."
2007.06-694,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3359.923,3361.547,"But I thought the word in the statute is ""solicit""."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3361.547,3364.42,"Well, there's ""solicit"" and there's also ""present""."
2007.06-694,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3366.405,3373.167,"If you're asking somebody for child pornography, you're not presenting child pornography."
2007.06-694,1,39037,richard_j_diaz,,3373.167,3373.448,Correct.
2007.06-694,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3381.68,3383.445,"Thank you, Mr. Diaz."
2007.06-694,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3386.194,3389.224,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-694,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3412.511,3420.181,Can we reject the overbreadth challenge here and still leave an overbreadth doctrine for some other cases?
2007.06-694,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3422.586,3424.147,"Well, I think you could, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-694,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3442.249,3457.634,How is it different it would be strange to trust out the document... the doctrine as I... as I understand it is what we relied on when we had the predecessor to this statute before.
2007.06-694,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3457.634,3464.147,Justice Ginsburg I'm not urging that you get rid of overbreadth doctrine once and for all... probably be in the government's interest.
2007.06-694,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3505.771,3510.831,How did that occur in... free speech coalition.
2007.06-694,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3510.831,3519.437,"I think, in the way I would explain that is I didn't think you get... you found there was such absolute overbreadth that you didn't even reach the proportionality inquiry."
2007.06-694,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3561.514,3563.06,"Thank you, general, the case is submitted."
