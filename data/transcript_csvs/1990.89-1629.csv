1990.89-1629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.396,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-1629, Salve Regina College v. Sharon Russell."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,10.508,13.6,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1629,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,62.731,70.407,"Well, did the court say what its view would have been absent deference?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,70.407,73.269,No.
1990.89-1629,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,73.269,78.443,"Did it say if we weren't, if we weren't giving deference, here's what we think the law means?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,78.443,83.175,"No, Your Honor, the court did not indicate which way they might rule absent deference."
1990.89-1629,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,133.628,138.403,Do you think there's any... would you be making the same argument if we had done the same thing?
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,138.403,150.799,"No, Your Honor, I think that clearly this Court, because of judicial economy, must defer to the lower courts when it comes to issues of local law."
1990.89-1629,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,150.799,159.835,"Do you think the court of appeals are bound independently to interpret State statutes in, in diversity cases?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,159.835,160.366,That's correct.
1990.89-1629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,417.795,426.62,"Mr. Snow, I think you can assume that the Court is familiar with the factual background of the case and the procedural background of the case."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,426.62,427.902,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.89-1629,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,461.614,463.235,"Does, does it apply in bankruptcy cases, do you know?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,463.235,472.231,--To some extent it would apply in a bankruptcy case where there's a question of property rights that's determined by State law.
1990.89-1629,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,476.854,485.35,Is there any authority where deference is given to bankruptcy judges who have practiced in the jurisdiction or are most of the reported cases just referring to district judges?
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,485.35,491.054,I don't recall seeing any particular case that relates to bankruptcy judges.
1990.89-1629,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,493.605,494.487,I take it the principle would be the same?
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,494.487,507.044,"--Well, I think you could make an... you could probably analogize a bankruptcy court somewhat more to an administrative agency which, which at least theoretically has a special expertise in that narrow area."
1990.89-1629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,541.727,563.33,"Well, as a practical matter don't you think most of the circuits have for years pretty much gone along with the interpretation of State law given by the district judge who is often from that State and perhaps familiar with the State law?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,564.742,570.545,"I would agree, Justice O'Connor, that it is true that the majority of courts of appeals have applied this rule of deference."
1990.89-1629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,570.545,570.806,--Uh-huh.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,570.806,579.011,"However, when they've done so... and... the rule of deference started shortly after the Erie case was decided in 1938."
1990.89-1629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,600.835,617.786,"Well, do you think it's just a common sense sort of a feeling that the district court judge may be more familiar with what the State law is than the circuit court judges generally, who may or may not come from that State?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,617.786,620.358,--I think that's correct.
1990.89-1629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.52,670.972,"Well, then you would suggest that because of this complexity of State law today, that a court of appeals, not just the First Circuit with four States in it, but a court of appeals like the Ninth Circuit with maybe 10 or 11 States in it should try to decide as an original matter questions from those 11 or 12 States."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,670.972,675.995,"Well, of course, I'm... we're not suggesting deciding it necessarily as an original matter."
1990.89-1629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,686.252,691.845,Ought it to be treated any differently than a district court's decision on a point of Federal law?
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,691.845,693.555,We believe not.
1990.89-1629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,694.927,695.956,"No, no deference at all then?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,695.956,698.29,No deference at all to a district court's decision.
1990.89-1629,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.29,699.419,"Well, what if it's a tie?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,699.419,705.584,"Well, if it's a tie, then I... it would be the same rule, I believe, if it was a question of Federal law."
1990.89-1629,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.584,710.606,"Well, does it go... what do you do, decide it yourself or do you flip a coin?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,712.408,722.684,"Well, I suppose if it's a tie, one, one possibility would be to certify the question to the highest court of the State, where you could get a definitive ruling of State law."
1990.89-1629,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,722.684,726.917,"Do you have a certification procedure in this State, in Rhode Island?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,726.917,727.839,"Yes, there is."
1990.89-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,727.839,748.992,"Mr. Snow, I sat on the court of appeals for a decade and I can remember in that court when we had a judge from outside the circuit sitting by designation and yet the court of appeals would defer to him on a matter of State law in the place where he was sitting by designation."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,750.494,755.436,The court of appeals would defer to the district court judge who was sitting on the court of appeals?
1990.89-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,755.436,761.83,"No, who was sitting by designation as a trial judge in a State where he did not come from."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,761.83,762.321,I agree.
1990.89-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,763.252,764.321,I should ask your opponents that.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,772.716,777.14,I would suggest that not only is--
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,777.14,779.151,"Of course, that's not exactly the typical case even."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,782.223,784.025,--Most district judges are.
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.025,784.276,Yeah.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,784.276,788.177,"Of course, not all of them necessarily practice law in that jurisdiction."
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,791.119,793.362,"Well, most of them practiced law... most of them practiced law in the jurisdiction where they sit."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,793.362,793.74,--Most of them did.
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,793.74,800.665,"There are very few judges on the Illinois district courts who didn't practice, in fact, there are none who didn't practice in Illinois, same in Indiana, same in Wisconsin."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,804.589,805.648,But the question is--
1990.89-1629,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,805.648,812.193,"But there are any number in the Ninth Circuit that practice exclusively in the criminal area and not in the civil area at all, isn't that true?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,812.193,814.294,"--That, that is also true."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,814.294,825.693,"Furthermore, the question is even if you practice law in that area... I practiced law in Rhode Island for 15 years and I feel that I have a certain amount of familiarity with some aspects of State law."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,877.466,882.197,We did not ask the district judge to certify the question at that time.
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,885.611,893.567,"If, if you had thought of it at that time, do you think it would have been prudent for him to interrupt the trial to take the time to certify to the Rhode Island supreme court?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,893.567,905.625,"I think it would not have been prudent in the context of a jury trial at that time; however, I think it might have been prudent for the court of appeals to have certified the question to the Rhode Island district court."
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,905.625,907.916,"So the district judge kind of axed it as peril, is what it amounts to I guess."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,907.916,915.18,"I think if the issue had come up pretrial, then it very well could have been certified to the court of appeals."
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.532,966.414,"But he did raise it the day before he made his ruling, didn't he?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,966.414,967.495,"Yes, he did."
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.495,968.945,He raised it and then he announced it the next day.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,968.945,969.506,That is correct.
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,969.506,969.887,Yes.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,969.887,986.977,"And we did... and we did present the district court with the findings of our research, which was to the effect that no... we could no court anywhere in the country, let alone Rhode Island, that applied the commercial contract doctrine of substantial performance to the academic relationship between the student and the college."
1990.89-1629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,986.977,1007.461,"Don't, don't you think it's reasonable, Mr. Snow, for, for a court of appeals to say that a judge who is sitting in Rhode Island and who has practiced in Rhode Island may well have a feel for what the Rhode Island supreme court would do, that you can't... that judges who have never practiced there can't get by just reading the decisions of that court?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1007.461,1009.982,"I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1051.739,1055.543,Even though those appellate judges were not from the State in question?
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1055.543,1058.284,"Even though those appellate judges were not from the State, but--"
1990.89-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1058.284,1059.544,"This is true in the panel you had, isn't it?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1059.544,1060.515,--That is true.
1990.89-1629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1063.357,1064.559,Judge Timbers is from New York.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1064.559,1066.379,--I believe Connecticut.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1066.379,1068.98,"No, he's on the Second Circuit."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1068.98,1069.281,He's on the Second Circuit.
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1103.442,1104.534,May I ask this question?
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1122.565,1125.437,"--Well, I'm not suggesting you pay no attention to the district court's opinion."
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1125.437,1125.868,Obviously you know what he did.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1125.868,1133.241,"But I think that there is a difference between, between paying attention to the district court's view and reviewing what the district court said."
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.241,1134.533,"Well, you review it and you--"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1134.533,1135.795,There's a difference between giving it deference--
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1135.795,1146.742,"--You read it as much... read everything you can find and you say, well, neither the Illinois supreme court, nor the appellate court, nor an Illinois trial judge that I can find has ruled on the precise issue; there is no law one way or the other."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1155.868,1167.035,"--I think you'd give that the weight that it would appear to deserve in the context of that particular case, but you do not decide in advance that you're going to give it any particular weight."
1990.89-1629,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.035,1176.412,Would you give it as much deference as you would in a law general article written by a professor of a law school in that State who has been studying the thing for 20 years?
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1176.412,1177.371,Certainly.
1990.89-1629,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.46,1198.284,"Well, say, say the courts... the intermediate courts of appeals in the State are split on the same subject... on the same matter."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1213.945,1219.498,--I would suggest that you do not give any special particular weight to that.
1990.89-1629,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.693,1253.362,"But what if you say... you read... the court of appeals reads law professors' articles, they read the opinions of the... of the courts of appeals on the split, then they read the district judge."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1261.727,1263.427,The court of appeals can certainly agree with him--
1990.89-1629,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1263.427,1269.982,"Yeah, but you don't agree... well, they say, we agree with him enough to say that it sounds reasonable, what he's saying sounds reasonable."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1269.982,1272.253,"--Well, I don't think the issue is whether or not it's reasonable."
1990.89-1629,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1277.588,1282.961,There's no rule required that the district judge be a member of that State court's bar.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1282.961,1287.203,"Well, we're suggesting that the rule ought to be a de novo review."
1990.89-1629,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1287.693,1301.802,"So that if the district judge was a practicing lawyer in the State and the district judge next to him practiced law in California, there would be a different rule?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1301.802,1303.745,--That would appear to be the case now.
1990.89-1629,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1308.227,1308.507,"Well, what do want?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1308.507,1312.41,We're suggesting that the court of appeals should review de novo.
1990.89-1629,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1312.41,1316.632,Should ignore where the man practiced law.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1316.632,1319.183,We believe that it's inappropriate--
1990.89-1629,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1319.183,1320.605,I use the word ignore.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1320.605,1322.896,"--Well, we... I would suggest, Justice Marshall--"
1990.89-1629,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1322.896,1323.137,Do you buy that?
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1324.708,1330.372,"--No, I don't think ignore is the, is the correct word."
1990.89-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.141,1348.712,To make sense is a big part of it.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1362.393,1362.763,That's right.
1990.89-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.763,1366.213,--and you evaluate what the author has to say on the basis of the reason he gives.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1366.213,1366.664,Yes.
1990.89-1629,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1372.888,1378.793,The Harvard Law Review doesn't say the supreme court is not clearly erroneous so that we should accept their judgment.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1396.103,1397.025,--I wouldn't treat it any--
1990.89-1629,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1397.025,1400.999,Wouldn't you assume that he knew a little bit more--
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1404.521,1422.23,"--I would assume that, that he probably does, but I think it's a dangerous practice for the courts of appeals to get into what is essentially judge rate; that we're going to defer to judge X because he has a great deal of experience in this area, but we're not going to defer to judge Y because he has less experience."
1990.89-1629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.802,1425.573,But that's gone on for centuries.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1444.156,1457.055,"Well, I would hope that our system of justice would at least strive for a certain degree of intellectual honesty and if... and I don't think the rule of deference... in fact it is only used--"
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.055,1457.335,"I have, I have to interrupt you."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1472.674,1476.126,"--Well, I don't think that's necessarily giving any deference."
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1479.118,1480.069,"Well, that's what happened here."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1481.809,1483.782,"Well, in this very opinion--"
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1483.782,1487.813,"Judge Selya said, I looked... I've looked at all the substantial performance cases I can find."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1500.422,1504.015,"--Well, that's just... but the court of appeals did not engage in that type of analysis at all."
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.015,1507.247,"They said in view of our rule of deference we'll, we'll follow what he had to say."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1512.09,1514.631,"Well, well, I hope that we did, but--"
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1514.631,1514.942,Oh.
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1514.942,1517.793,--but I would agree that you could not tell that from the opinion.
1990.89-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1534.744,1535.935,But he didn't--
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1535.935,1537.316,"He, he did not handle the trial."
1990.89-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1580.725,1585.067,"--Did you mention the fact that it might be a cop-out for courts of appeals, too?"
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1588.399,1593.494,"Well, I suppose that that may be true."
1990.89-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1593.663,1596.066,"Careful, counsel, cause several of us have done this, you know."
1990.89-1629,0,42136,steven_e_snow,,1596.464,1611.313,"--I know that respondent suggests that deference is simply a judicial shorthand when the court does not wish to write an opinion, but we would respectfully suggest that that's a degree of intellectual dishonesty."
1990.89-1629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1623.472,1625.115,"Thank you, Mr. Snow."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,1626.767,1631.38,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1674.829,1676.75,And sometimes write a long-winded opinion.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,1676.75,1678.911,And sometimes write a long-winded opinion.
1990.89-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1678.911,1691.729,"Why can't they... if that's all they're doing, why don't they say, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district judge rather than we affirm because the district judge thinks that's the right answer."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,1693.7,1696.114,"In many instances, they do that, Mr. Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.68,1792.135,"I suppose you could say the same thing in Federal questions, that the court of appeals... who knows... that they go through all of that labor and the very next day the Supreme Court of the United States may, may make it a dead letter, right?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,1792.135,1793.475,Only you can do that.
1990.89-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.475,1795.227,"Well, so is that the distinction?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,1795.748,1796.058,No.
1990.89-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.058,1797.598,--versus only the Texas supreme court?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,1797.598,1798.349,Totally different question.
1990.89-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.349,1799.111,I mean the point is the same.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,1803.302,1803.783,That--
1990.89-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.783,1804.604,I mean it's not worth doing.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,1804.604,1817.07,"--True to the extent that in the... if it was a Federal issue, then of course you have an opportunity to review it and overrule any circuit court of appeals' decision involved with a Federal question."
1990.89-1629,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1876.179,1878.991,Why did you bring this case in Federal court?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,1878.991,1880.934,Why the Federal court?
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1993.177,1994.106,"Well, why did this--"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,1994.106,1994.957,--upon those courts.
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1994.957,1997.779,"--Why if it's just 2 and 2 make 5, what do we do?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,1997.779,1999.061,"Well, that's a different problem."
1990.89-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2028.019,2034.664,"Well, why don't we just make up a rule that they don't have to write an opinion on matters of State law instead of making up a rule that they don't have to consider it."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2041.497,2044.061,"I'm not sure I understand your, your position."
1990.89-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2044.061,2055.768,"Well, my point is I assume an appellate court is supposed to review the, the issues of law that are, that are there in the case, but you're saying for this one issue of law, because it is so time-consuming, they don't have to review this issue of law."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2062.34,2070.206,"I don't subscribe to the concept that the circuit court can say because it's a tough case we'll duck it, if that's what you're saying to me in other words."
1990.89-1629,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2132.936,2137.18,"--So you're, so you're advocating to keep the deference rule because it doesn't really mean anything?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2137.18,2140.893,I... only as a method of shorthand.
1990.89-1629,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2154.511,2155.282,"What, what--"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2155.282,2158.164,--and the supreme court of the State thinks contrary within a matter of hours.
1990.89-1629,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2158.164,2162.028,"--What, what should be the rule if there is more than one district in a single State?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2172.664,2174.754,"You do, Mr. Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1629,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2176.406,2185.182,"So the Ninth Circuit affirms in one case, case, reverses in the other case even though the issue of law is identical just because the district judge has reached a different conclusion?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2185.182,2187.223,--That is a very possible situation.
1990.89-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2218.204,2219.844,"By the same court, by the same court, right?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2221.514,2222.175,By the same circuit court.
1990.89-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.175,2227.411,And yet they are only doing what you say and that is just saving themselves the problem of writing an opinion.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2227.411,2227.868,Precisely.
1990.89-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2228.85,2231.141,Even though they come out different ways in both cases.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2238.037,2238.668,--Well--
1990.89-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.668,2239.957,I mean you can't have it both ways.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2249.083,2261.131,"--Well, I could conceive that if the same issue comes up the second time around and they have, let's say, deferred to a district court judge the first time around in a given fashion as in this case, let's say, that the district judge is correct."
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2325.524,2340.242,I take it in your State the court of appeals in diversity cases must not defer so much to district judges that lawyers think there's no use appealing a district judge's ruling.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2340.242,2341.494,"--Well, of course--"
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.494,2353.201,"I mean if they... if, if there was, if there was too much deference to a district judge, you'd be wasting your money appealing a legal question."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2353.201,2353.872,"--Let me, let me--"
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.872,2356.344,I take it that's not the case in your circuit?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2356.344,2359.236,"--Let me answer in this fashion, Mr. Justice White."
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.988,2382.341,"Well, I know but, but you don't need to look at the universal district of the whole circuit."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2391.626,2393.157,"No, I don't, I don't feel that way."
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.383,2426.909,"But you think that despite this maybe weak, weak or strong presumption, you think you could justify spending your client's money appealing a, a question of law to the circuit court?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2426.909,2429.031,I'm in the process of doing one now to be heard next Tuesday--
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2429.031,2429.241,Exactly.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2429.241,2429.952,--and I hope to succeed.
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2429.952,2430.403,Yes.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2430.403,2432.704,I don't know whether I will or not.
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2466.715,2477.503,Is that an appeal in your sense of the word when you use the word appeal but you give absolute deference to the crowd to it?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2477.503,2483.046,"--Well, the deference rule doesn't require absolute deference."
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2483.046,2485.678,"Well, some people say it does."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2485.678,2491.672,"I, I don't know of a case that I've come upon that says the deferential rule, as I refer to it here--"
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2491.672,2495.146,Haven't you been arguing that you've been standing up there?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2495.146,2495.907,"--What's that, sir?"
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2495.907,2499.736,Haven't you been arguing in this case that it means that there's no way to win?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2499.736,2500.687,"No, sir."
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2500.687,2502.889,I thought that's what you were saying.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2502.889,2503.25,No.
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2503.25,2506.372,"You said, why write an opinion."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2506.372,2509.363,"No, that isn't... I think you misunderstand my position."
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.363,2510.415,I sure do.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2510.415,2517.468,My position is not that I... the court should not write an opinion just for the sake of not writing opinions.
1990.89-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2539.093,2539.814,"Well, which is it?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2548.189,2552.281,"--Either, either, Mr.... either I think is appropriate."
1990.89-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2554.163,2556.834,"Well, why, why don't you return to Justice Marshall's question?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2556.834,2558.145,--I will.
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2608.02,2632.433,"Well, what about, what about, what if a, what if the court of appeals' panel sits there and they all agree that, that if, if we were deciding this in the first instance, we would think the laws... the State statute should be construed in this manner, but the construction the district judge has given it is also a reasonable construction."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2648.084,2668.096,"--Mr. Justice White, until the Ninth Circuit came down with its opinion in the matter of McLinn back in 1984, I think it's fair to say that every circuit court of appeals throughout the country, if they were of that position would have said, well, why we think if it were a matter of first impression with us we would rule differently than the district judge."
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.942,2681.086,So that's... is that sort of like deferring... a Federal court deferring to an administrative agency's view of a statute?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2681.086,2695.906,"Well, not, not quite, because in the area of Federal jurisdiction, the issues are a little bit different and what can happen to the Federal case is a little different than what happens in the diversity case where the State law issues are involved."
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.085,2740.345,"Well,--"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2740.345,2742.166,"There's nobody to overrule, I mean except the circuit court."
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2742.166,2755.924,"--You say until a certain point if the, if the... even if the court of appeals thought that they had the better view of the statute, if the district judge's view was within the realm of reasonableness, they would defer to him?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2755.924,2757.396,On a diversity case in the--
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2757.396,2757.967,On a diversity case.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2762.107,2780.31,"--Yes, and then when the Ninth Circuit came down with the McLinn case back in 1984... a sharply divided court, I think it was 6 to 5... they held there for the first time that I could I any case that said flatly that henceforth in this circuit all issues of State law will be decided de novo and on a plenary basis by this Court."
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2788.214,2789.556,--What is that citation you have there?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2789.556,2790.527,It's the Mc... McLinn.
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.527,2791.609,"I'll look, I'll look in your brief."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2791.609,2796.992,"It's 739 Fed. 2nd 1395, I can tell you that."
1990.89-1629,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2862.554,2865.276,Let me ask you the question I asked Mr. Snow.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2888.431,2889.453,I most certainly do.
1990.89-1629,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2889.453,2889.973,Why?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2889.973,2902.803,"Because he's just... he's in as good a position frankly in my opinion to make a guess as to what the Rhode Island supreme court will do as are three judges in the circuit court in Boston, one of whom comes from Puerto Rico, one from New Hampshire, and one from Maine."
1990.89-1629,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2902.803,2903.665,"Well, what if there are--"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2909.148,2914.32,"If five judges were out on the supreme court tomorrow, say those three are wrong."
1990.89-1629,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2936.735,2940.087,"Yes, but it would have been nice had you been in State court and got a definitive ruling right away."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2940.087,2941.048,Well--
1990.89-1629,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2941.048,2945.111,"On the other hand, your answer was a good one if the calendars were clogged up."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,2945.111,2946.582,"--We'd, we'd still be waiting for trial."
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3010.572,3014.025,Do we have to give deference to the trial court?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3014.025,3015.457,"--Do you, sir?"
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3015.457,3016.586,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3016.586,3019.19,I don't think you have to give deference.
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3020.41,3026.063,"I said, do we have to give deference to the trial court?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3026.063,3028.745,I don't think you're required to give deference.
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3048.819,3051.829,Did that say we have to?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3051.829,3053.411,"--I, I answered your question I think--"
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3053.411,3054.833,Do we have to?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3056.544,3059.816,"--I, I do, I do not say you have to give deference."
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3059.816,3065.329,"Would it be all right if we say in due deference to the trial court, we think that we're wrong?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3067.26,3072.973,"Well, well, it wouldn't make me happy in this particular case, if that's what you're asking me."
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3083.461,3098.53,"Mr. Hogan, why should there, why should there be just one rule among the circuits other than a rule that a circuit court shouldn't just automatically rubber stamp what the district judge says?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3108.348,3111.378,"Well, applying it to myself and to this case, I have no problem with that."
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3114.36,3114.85,Uh--
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3114.85,3125.699,"--but as a litigator and an advocate the result would please me greatly if you were to simply say, let there be diversity of opinion between the circuits so we don't care."
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3130.312,3131.003,--The First Circuit--
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3131.003,3132.682,"--as a example of the administration of justice, I leave to Your Honors."
1990.89-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.682,3135.965,--The First Circuit may know about its district judges.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3138.426,3141.678,I won't dispute that either.
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3156.348,3159.911,Judges are from another circuit.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3159.911,3161.283,"--What's that, sir?"
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3161.283,3163.714,Judge Timbers is from the First Circuit?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3163.714,3163.934,Yes.
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3163.934,3167.638,"So you'd say that that applies to him, too?"
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3167.638,3171.789,"Well, he applied, he applied, he applied the rule of deference."
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3171.789,3172.309,Deference.
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3172.309,3174.07,"Yes, he applied the rule of deference."
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3178.253,3180.303,To the First Circuit?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3180.303,3183.666,"Well, he sat on the First Circuit by designation."
1990.89-1629,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3183.666,3186.468,"He not only sat, he wrote the opinion."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3186.468,3187.189,He wrote the opinion.
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3187.189,3193.584,"And in the Ninth Circuit, he would be charged with knowing the law of Hawaii as law."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3193.584,3193.934,And he probably dissented.
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3193.934,3194.893,Huh?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3195.895,3201.769,Just as any other circuit court judge will be charged with knowing within the First Circuit--
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3201.769,3201.949,"No, no."
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3201.949,3204.42,--the law of Rhode Island because he's from Maine.
1990.89-1629,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3204.42,3210.965,Is he charged with knowing all of the local law that the local circuit judges know?
1990.89-1629,1,22506,edward_t_hogan,,3210.965,3213.677,"If he's going to sit in that circuit, I, I would think he'd have to."
1990.89-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3265.12,3266.941,"Very well, Mr. Hogan."
1990.89-1629,2,42136,steven_e_snow,,3268.424,3271.573,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1629,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3356.51,3358.253,"Thank you, Mr. Snow."
