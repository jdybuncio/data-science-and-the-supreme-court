1984.83-1035,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.004,We will hear arguments first this morning in Tennessee against Garner and the consolidated case.
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,10.439,17.443,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are two issues in this case."
1984.83-1035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.797,384.897,Mr. Klein--
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,384.897,385.264,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,385.264,395.372,"--did the Court of Appeals say that the statute was unconstitutional across the board or on its face, or did it just say it couldn't constitute a defense in this action?"
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,395.372,398.724,It said it is unconstitutional across the board.
1984.83-1035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,398.724,401.926,Did it intimate that there was some First Amendment problem involved here?
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,401.926,402.976,"No, sir, there was no indication."
1984.83-1035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,558.811,560.747,"Mr. Klein, may I ask you a question?"
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,560.747,561.18,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,561.18,571.953,"Supposing there had been another officer on the other side of the fence unbeknownst to the man who felt it necessary to shoot the fleeing felon, and he had later been... say he had missed and he had actually been apprehended."
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,578.291,579.441,Not submitting to the arrest?
1984.83-1035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,579.441,580.208,"Yes, fleeing."
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,582.01,585.378,"Your Honor, I might add factually there was another officer on the scene."
1984.83-1035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,585.378,587.314,But you understand my hypothetical.
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,599.205,603.34,"Well, of course, he is still in the process of perpetrating burglary in the first degree."
1984.83-1035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.34,603.79,I understand.
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,607.728,610.68,In refusing to obey the officer's command to halt.
1984.83-1035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,610.68,611.03,Yes.
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,611.03,622.487,"If Your Honor please, that is... there is a city ordinance which covers that, but it is a very minor offense, and it really would be a city violation."
1984.83-1035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,623.42,624.253,It is not a state violation?
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,624.253,625.855,"No, sir, it is not a state violation."
1984.83-1035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,626.339,631.676,So the only deterrent that the state imposes for that offense really is to shoot the man at the time.
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,631.676,635.545,"--Well, if they cannot apprehend him by any other means."
1984.83-1035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,635.545,635.978,That's right.
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,644.417,646.869,"That's correct, sir."
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,646.869,652.173,What is the penalty for first degree burglary?
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,652.173,654.873,Not less than five nor more than 15 years.
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,661.112,662.628,No more than 40?
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,662.628,664.23,"Fifteen, sir."
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,664.23,665.43,When a weapon is involved?
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,665.43,676.622,"Where a weapon is involved, not less than ten nor more than 15 years, if a weapon is involved, so the Tennessee statute makes it even a more serious crime if a weapon is involved."
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,845.315,848.45,"Mr. Klein, may I ask you a question?"
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,864.726,865.593,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,865.593,867.328,Does the Memphis... you call it a policy.
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,870.029,877.033,"Your Honor, what has happened is, the city has implemented what is known as a general order."
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,877.033,878.635,A general order by the city council?
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,878.635,880.385,"No, sir, it is by the city police department."
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,880.385,881.321,The police department.
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,881.321,881.921,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,881.921,889.591,Does the police department have authority to limit the full scope of state law?
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,889.591,890.61,"No, it does not."
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,890.61,896.514,Do you consider this ordinance consistence with state law?
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,896.514,898.364,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,898.364,904.851,Is state law limited only to serious violent crimes?
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,904.851,905.953,"Well, that's--"
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,905.953,906.536,"It doesn't say so, does it?"
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,906.536,934.62,"--It doesn't say so, but I might add the courts in interpreting the state law, and again, the state law is really the common law, and the courts in interpreting the state law have said even as far back as 1879 in the case of Reneau versus State that the statute only intended that the use of deadly force be against what I categorize as serious crimes, and that even--"
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,934.62,935.805,Serious or violent?
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,935.805,939.357,"--Well, serious... they didn't use the word ""serious""."
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,966.574,969.46,Do you draw a distinction between serious and violent?
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,969.46,977.966,"Well, my distinction of serious is that it is serious, as I indicated, because the legislature said it is serious."
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1002.949,1012.639,"Suppose this house or building, instead of being a private residence, had been a deserted building in a field somewhere."
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,1021.495,1027.915,I can't say that a dwelling in a deserted field would be burglary under the Tennessee statute.
1984.83-1035,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1032.303,1034.719,"Of course, your Memphis policy would cover burglary in the third degree."
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,1034.719,1055.482,"Memphis policy would cover burglary in the third degree, but again, the point of this is that burglary in and of itself, and again, that is what we had in this case that is before us today, burglary is a serious offense with a great potentiality for violence."
1984.83-1035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1088.722,1093.341,"Mr. Klein, may I ask you a question about what we mean by the term ""deadly force""?"
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,1097.578,1106.101,"Well, deadly force means using that force, whether it be... usually in the context we think of it it would be a pistol, a firearm."
1984.83-1035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.101,1110.136,"And it also means, I take it, that he may deliberately shoot to kill."
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,1110.136,1112.338,"Well, when you say deliberately, Your Honor, yes."
1984.83-1035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1112.338,1112.988,Or doesn't it mean that?
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,1113.788,1118.325,"Yes, when he pulls his weapon, that is what he is intending to do."
1984.83-1035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.325,1120.341,So it is really more than apprehending him then.
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,1120.341,1121.776,"No, it is apprehending him."
1984.83-1035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1138.655,1141.707,"Mr. Klein, let me ask you one question if I may."
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,1175.411,1183.017,"Well, that is true, but to be candid with Your Honor, the police policy has been to shoot for the mast."
1984.83-1035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1183.917,1184.817,Shoot for the what?
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,1184.817,1203.93,"--The mast, which is... and the reason for that is that it is obvious that one who uses a pistol cannot be as accurate as, say, a marksman with a rifle because of the circumstances, the fact that he may be running or he stops, and the fact that a pistol is just not an accurate weapon."
1984.83-1035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1203.93,1209.418,What you are talking about really is a shot that has a potential for killing.
1984.83-1035,0,27382,henry_i_klein,,1211.084,1212.051,"That's correct, sir."
1984.83-1035,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1235.098,1237.383,Mr. Attorney General.
1984.83-1035,1,44210,wj_michael_cody,,1237.383,1250.392,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in considering the constitutionality of the statute here, I believe that there are two overriding questions for the Court."
1984.83-1035,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1556.758,1569.783,"Mr. Cody, I guess some states have adopted a more restrictive provision than Tennessee has, and something more along the lines of the Penal Code, Model Penal Code."
1984.83-1035,1,44210,wj_michael_cody,,1569.783,1570.9,--That is true.
1984.83-1035,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1570.9,1577.137,"Has that proved to be workable in most states, do you know?"
1984.83-1035,1,44210,wj_michael_cody,,1577.137,1586.093,I suspect that would depend upon that legislature's analysis of how it has worked.
1984.83-1035,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1613.479,1622.152,"Well, I understand, but I thought you were arguing that any more restrictive standard would be unworkable, and so I was curious."
1984.83-1035,1,44210,wj_michael_cody,,1622.152,1638.145,"--Well, I have no information, but I believe that it would be unworkable if the officer is put to the task of trying to make this probable cause analysis when he arrives at an arrest scene."
1984.83-1035,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1638.145,1643.916,Certainly the fact that other states have a different rule would indicate that it works.
1984.83-1035,1,44210,wj_michael_cody,,1643.916,1659.241,"That it has worked for those states, or that they have chosen to let some fleeing felons escape rather than jeopardize their life, but we contend that that is a policy decision for the legislature to make."
1984.83-1035,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1659.241,1666.079,Would you take the same position with respect to a fleeing felon whose felony is an antitrust violation?
1984.83-1035,1,44210,wj_michael_cody,,1668.964,1694.698,"If the Court please, that makes a difficult question, but I think that I would have to answer that if there was a state antitrust statute that provided a sufficient enough penalty to indicate that the state's substantial interest felt that that was a serious crime, then they could authorize deadly force."
1984.83-1035,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1704.806,1711.126,"May I ask one other question, just briefly?"
1984.83-1035,1,44210,wj_michael_cody,,1721.266,1723.884,I think that is correct.
1984.83-1035,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1723.884,1728.421,"General, I was going to ask you a question somewhat similar to Justice Blackmun's."
1984.83-1035,1,44210,wj_michael_cody,,1758.791,1784.239,"If the Court please, the Tennessee Supreme Court in the only case that directly seemed to refer to this had a property crime, the stealing of a small amount of merchandise, and the court in that case said that we would not extend the privilege to that case."
1984.83-1035,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1805.355,1810.373,You do not draw the line with respect to violent and nonviolent crimes?
1984.83-1035,1,44210,wj_michael_cody,,1810.373,1811.258,"No, I do not."
1984.83-1035,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1816.277,1818.529,Mr. Winter?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,1818.529,1824.999,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to start by trying to address some of the questions."
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1901.399,1923.582,What if after the event it developed there were two dead bodies in the house and a third person who was seriously wounded but alive who later identified the fleeing felon as the person who had done the killing and the wounding?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,1924.865,1929.752,I think the Chief Justice's question points out one of the problems with my opponent's position.
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1940.458,1946.195,"Before you get to the eye witness, you have to apprehend the individual, don't you?"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,1946.195,1947.964,"--If the officer can, certainly."
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1947.964,1951.549,"If he isn't apprehended, the eye witness is not much help."
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,1951.549,1956.703,"Well, if the eye witness can identify him, then the witness is of a lot of assistance."
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1967.611,1973.045,"Well, do you think the officer was able to know whether there were or were not some dead bodies in the house?"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,1973.045,1991.743,"No, but the officer had no reason to believe that there were any dead bodies in the house, and I think that is a critical point, because one of the major differences between our position and the position of the city and the state is that they would premise the right to kill of a police officer on what the officer does not know."
1984.83-1035,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2113.305,2116.207,"Mr. Winter, how old was this victim?"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2116.207,2132.835,"The victim was 15 years old, Your Honor, and the District Court found at two places, and I refer to A10 in the Appendix and the petition for certiorari at A5, Footnote 3, that the officer reasonably believed that Garner was a juvenile."
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2172.177,2179.464,"If in fact there were two dead bodies, and he was identified as the killer, what would have been the maximum penalty?"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2179.464,2203.765,"If he had committed murder, then he could have been treated as an adult at that time, but the Tennessee statute, which is 37-234, specifically provides that juveniles less than 16 at that time could only be bound over for violent crimes, and it specifically excluded burglary as one of those crimes for which a 15-year-old could be bound over to the adult courts."
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2209.769,2212.452,"Mr. Winter, this was an action for damages, was it not?"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2212.452,2212.62,Correct.
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2212.62,2215.489,And the state asserted the statute as a defense.
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2223.076,2225.178,"I am not quite certain, Your Honor."
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2244.64,2247.409,That doesn't strike me as a very happy phrasing of any question.
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2252.029,2269.14,"There are problems with the court's formulation, I would agree, but I think the essential import of what the court was saying is clear, and that is that as applied to these facts, certainly, where the officer testified that he knew the juvenile to be unarmed, that the shooting under these circumstances is unconstitutional."
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2269.14,2279.63,"You would agree, then, that if the Court of Appeals opinion goes any further than to say that on these facts, the Tennessee defense statute can't be applied, the Court of Appeals is wrong."
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2279.63,2285.934,I would say that this Court need go no further than to affirm the judgment below on these facts.
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.934,2290.738,"So we are talking about an as applied basis, not an on its face basis."
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2290.738,2302.711,The other aspect I wanted... the Court should also be clear about the facts that my opponents neglected to mention.
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2409.648,2419.255,"When you say the Memphis policy, I had read the Court of Appeals opinion to deal only with the Tennessee statute."
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2419.255,2420.322,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2429.911,2431.58,But the Court of Appeals didn't pass on it.
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2431.58,2435.048,"The Court of Appeals did not, but the factual basis was before the Court of Appeals."
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.146,2515.967,How do you think the Court of Appeals formulated the standard as to when you can shoot to kill?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2515.967,2519.319,The Court of Appeals--
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.319,2519.638,Or did it?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2520.788,2523.94,"--It formulated more than one standard, I am afraid."
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2523.94,2525.106,"Yes, I thought so."
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2532.212,2539.499,"Well, the one that we would urge on this Court is, I think, best stated at Page A51 of the Appendix."
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.273,2553.641,"Did you say ""or"" or ""and""?"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2553.641,2556.827,--Or a danger to the community if left at large.
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.787,2578.341,How would you ever know that alternative or?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2578.341,2597.57,"I take it that the police officer would make this decision... we would apply this... we would suggest that the standard to be applied is the standard enunciated by the Chief Justice for the Court in United States versus Cortez, that what a reasonably prudent officer exercising his professional judgment based on his training would conclude under all circumstances."
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.337,2612.08,"In this particular case, I suppose you would just have to conclude that that other, that alternative could just never have been satisfied."
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2612.08,2613.68,--In this case... I think this case--
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.68,2615.399,Or in most cases.
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2623.402,2623.804,--That's right.
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2626.839,2631.091,Would being armed be enough to satisfy the alternative?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2631.091,2639.147,"--Certainly if the suspect, when told to halt, the officer was... police officer refused to throw down his weapon--"
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2639.147,2641.181,How would you know whether he was armed?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2641.181,2643.416,--If the officer knows that he is armed--
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2643.416,2650.372,"So the officer has to know that the person... if he is armed but the officer doesn't know it, the officer can't shoot."
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2650.372,2657.759,"--If in fact the person is armed but he never reaches for his weapon, I don't see where the state interest in shooting to apprehend--"
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2657.759,2662.596,"A person can be armed and can be not reaching for his weapon one minute, and 15 seconds later he can be reaching for his weapon."
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2662.596,2665.931,"--When he reaches, I think the officer is obviously entitled to and should shoot."
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2665.931,2666.931,And not until then?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2666.931,2667.581,Not until then.
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2667.581,2678.689,"I suppose if you have a warrant to arrest someone who is known to be dangerous, and you encounter him, and he runs, what about that?"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2678.689,2681.241,I think that may well be a case.
1984.83-1035,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2713.362,2723.818,Would you think that a burglar who enters the homes or residences of people at nighttime is a danger to the community?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2723.818,2731.991,"It seems so intuitively, Your Honor, but I think that it is not borne out, as this Court has recognized in Solon and as other courts have recognized."
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2755.706,2758.491,"These statistics based upon people who are apprehended, aren't they?"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2758.491,2760.943,These statistics are based... I believe that is correct.
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2760.943,2761.426,Of necessity.
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2767.697,2770.132,"Well, there were several studies that were done."
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2795.616,2799.251,Are you familiar with the statistics in New York City?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2799.251,2800.268,"--No, I am not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2800.268,2806.255,"As to what percentage of all crimes, including burglary, are ever apprehended?"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2806.255,2807.591,"No, I do not know those."
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2807.591,2811.059,It is something less than 15 percent.
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2811.059,2819.149,"I would point out, Your Honor, that the statistics for rates of murders in residences and rates of rapes in residences are extraordinarily low."
1984.83-1035,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2836.86,2844.047,What do you suppose the homeowners feel about whether someone who burglarizes homes is a danger to the community?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2844.047,2848.484,There is no doubt that burglary is both a serious crime and a frightening crime.
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2900.801,2911.158,"So you would say violent crimes then, would you say automatically this test that you propose is satisfied?"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2911.158,2911.758,"Yes, I would--"
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.758,2915.962,If there is a probable cause to believe that he has just committed a violent crime?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2915.962,2917.345,"--In most instances, I would say yes."
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.345,2923.599,"And that violent means violent... a danger to a person, is that it, or--"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2923.599,2924.566,Correct.
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.018,2930.722,--It doesn't mean that he just happens to use violence to break into a house.
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2930.722,2931.088,No.
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2939.661,2945.565,What about someone thought to be guilty of espionage or treason?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2949.317,2953.785,I must confess to having not thought about that.
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2984.79,2990.444,Yours would not make an exception because treason and espionage are not crimes of violence?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2990.444,2991.444,Correct.
1984.83-1035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2993.762,2994.862,Yes.
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,2994.862,3006.169,"No, under the Model Penal Code rule, I take it that the distinction drawn, and we think it is a less satisfactory rule, the distinction drawn is one based on the gravity of crime."
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3061.123,3072.498,"That brings me back to some of your responses, and I will repeat again the question, what if in fact there were two or three dead bodies in there who had been stabbed to death?"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,3075.45,3079.718,"We would have certainly a more difficult case, but I think the case has to turn on what the officer knows."
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3079.718,3081.954,Do you just think it would be more difficult?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,3081.954,3084.103,I think it has to turn on what the officer knows.
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3086.538,3094.761,How can the officer conceivably know one way or the other whether there are or whether there are not some dead bodies inside the house?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,3094.761,3095.344,He might well.
1984.83-1035,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3130.667,3138.99,"But you think you would just have a more difficult case if there were some dead bodies, people stabbed to death in the house?"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,3138.99,3148.279,"If the officer... the officer's action has to be based on what he knows or has probable cause to believe, and not on what is found out after the fact."
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3161.239,3182.235,"Have you thought about... I suppose in carrying the case you must have thought about it... suppose the police want to stop a car, and they walk along side of it and flash a red light, and he takes off at high speed, and they chase him."
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,3182.235,3184.837,Can they shoot the tires?
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3184.837,3186.504,Certainly armed with a car.
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,3186.504,3186.787,Yes.
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3186.787,3189.923,Can they shoot?
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,3189.923,3192.241,"No, but for a different reason, Your Honor."
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.031,3201.647,That may be--
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,3201.647,3203.933,"And there is a good reason, because the people who get hit are almost--"
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3203.933,3207.3,"--That may be so, but would it be unconstitutional under your rule?"
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,3207.3,3211.152,"--If the people in the car were armed and dangerous, I think no."
1984.83-1035,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.152,3217.242,"Well, they are being quite a danger to the community by driving up and down the street at 90 miles an hour."
1984.83-1035,2,42262,steven_l_winter,,3217.242,3222.41,It seems to me that the better alternative would be to get on the radio and call other cars and head them off.
1984.83-1035,3,27382,henry_i_klein,,3603.555,3635.427,"In response to Justice O'Connor's question earlier about whether or not any states have adopted the Model Penal Code and whether it proved satisfactory, it is our understanding that both Idaho and New York had adopted the Model Penal Code, but later Idaho has reverted back to the common law, which is the same as what Tennessee has, and that New York now has something in between which is referred to as a forcible felony statute."
1984.83-1035,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3666.13,3668.548,"Yes, but of course he wouldn't be shot just for the burglary."
1984.83-1035,3,27382,henry_i_klein,,3670.3,3674.669,"That is correct, but he is escaping from a serious crime, which is burglary."
1984.83-1035,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3674.669,3680.372,"I understand, but it still puzzles me that the legislature didn't make that a serious crime as well, because I think that is a serious matter."
1984.83-1035,3,27382,henry_i_klein,,3680.372,3695.632,"Well, of course, the point of all of this, and this gets back to what states adopt what, really what may be good in Idaho may not be good in California, or vice versa, and that is our argument about these policy questions."
1984.83-1035,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3711.461,3718.898,"Yes, but I would suppose you would agree that the state could not adopt a statute making it a capital offense to flee in these circumstances."
1984.83-1035,3,27382,henry_i_klein,,3718.898,3719.799,That is correct.
1984.83-1035,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3720.232,3722.418,So there are some limits on the state's power.
1984.83-1035,3,27382,henry_i_klein,,3722.418,3722.734,--Right.
1984.83-1035,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3740.594,3740.961,"Thank you, gentlemen."
