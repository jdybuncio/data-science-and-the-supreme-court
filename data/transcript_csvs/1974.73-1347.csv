1974.73-1347,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.1,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1347, the School Board against Jacobs."
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,43.957,47.038,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,97.809,101.664,"At what point was the approval not given, after the (Voice Overlap) first issue --"
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,101.664,104.934,"There have been -- yes, no it was not the first issue."
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,118.893,121.349,And there five issues involved then?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,121.349,124.727,There were five issues over a period of the little over four months.
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,124.727,129.711,And it was after the publication of the fifth issue that approval was not given?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,129.711,133.183,"By the superintendent, that's correct."
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,133.183,134.577,In what form was it?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,135.308,162.705,"Well, there had been some discussion with the administrators and they got -- the high school administrators, they got together with the superintendent and at that time he asked for copies and said that it contained obscene language and he could not give approval to distribution on this in a -- of this in the school because he felt it was the duty of the school officials to discourage and prevent the use of this language by children in school."
1974.73-1347,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,162.705,165.41,Is this publication still being published?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,165.41,166.502,"No, it is not."
1974.73-1347,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,166.502,167.797,When was that discontinued?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,167.797,170.283,Shortly after the decision in this case.
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,183.881,185.775,Absolutely none.
1974.73-1347,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,185.775,189.225,"What interest remains, what (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,189.225,189.554,"Well, the interest --"
1974.73-1347,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,189.554,191.135,What's alive in this case today?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,191.135,193.059,There's a quite a bit alive in this case.
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,266.007,272.146,And haven't the -- do I remember correctly that the publishers of the paper have graduated now from the school system?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,272.146,276.773,I think virtually all of them have of this particular paper.
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,276.773,278.144,And so the --
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,278.144,282.32,There are basically five issues presented to this Court today.
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,465.126,468.072,I had an impression that this just involved high schools --
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,468.072,472.234,"No, it definitely involves elementary schools."
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,516.111,518.366,Do your colleagues in the other side agree with you? (Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,518.366,535.262,"At no time did they deny that these rules in the case involved only high schools until we got up to the Seventh Circuit and there in response to a question by one of the justices they stated, “These rules apply only to high schools.”"
1974.73-1347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,546.939,558.319,"One of the basis of Judge Christensen's dissent in the Seventh Circuit wasn't it, was that the majority failed to distinguish in its opinion between application to high schools and application to elementary schools?"
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,558.319,560.085,That's correct.
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,585.03,594.716,"Well, is there anything in these papers that could have led a reasonably careful reader to get the impression that only high schools were involved?"
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,594.716,596.981,I doubt that because if you look even in that --
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,596.981,600.217,That's not the claim of your adversary?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,600.217,610.025,They claimed that for the first time at the oral argument but they never claimed it and they never denied the fact that elementary students were involved when we were down in the Lower Courts.
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,610.025,610.69,How about here?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,611.541,613.635,I'm certain they will probably claim it here.
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,613.635,615.619,"Well then -- and in their briefs, in their (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,615.619,616.19,Right.
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,617.18,623.181,"Well then maybe a reasonably careful, a prudent reader might have gotten that impression."
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,623.181,628.666,"I would disagree with that because they have many references to elementary schools, their very complaint."
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,628.666,632.151,I mean the impression that their claim has made.
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,632.151,632.971,The impression that the claim --
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,632.971,637.67,That the claim is made by your adversaries that these rules applied to high schools only.
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,641.286,656.304,"Well, I don't believe that they claimed that the injunction -- I don't think that they claiming that the injunction or the rules apply only to or govern only high schools."
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,676.832,678.975,Who were the plaintiffs or the class of plaintiffs?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,678.975,682.246,They are -- who are remaining plaintiffs?
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,682.246,684.022,"Well, in the complaint."
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,685.545,685.825,Right.
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,692.438,694.486,And now those two had graduated?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,694.486,698.056,I'm not completely sure but I think that's probably true.
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,698.056,702.545,Were there -- was there a declaration of a certification of a class action?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,702.545,703.787,Yes.
1974.73-1347,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,703.787,704.976,What was the class?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,704.976,716.468,"The class was the high schools students in the Indianapolis public schools, but the relief sought governed more than the high schools students."
1974.73-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.344,868.81,What would -- could you -- I suppose you're going to get to what are -- what the minimum safeguards are that you think the board is entitled to impose in order to achieve what you think they should be able to achieve?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,868.81,872.525,"Well, I think there are two ways of approaching this."
1974.73-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.498,891.506,"That -- would that -- whether each publication or would they say, “We want to put out and apply to you” and say, “We want to put out a paper and please give us permission.”"
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,891.506,895.755,The procedures are set out in our rule of prior review.
1974.73-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,905.678,909.533,Will that -- that would be an issue then?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,909.533,931.62,"That's -- that would be correct, each issue, and if filth and four letter words were used in the publication then the school officials would say that they do not think this is proper language to use and they would not allow the distribution unless that language would be removed, that's the issue of prior restraint and --"
1974.73-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,931.62,940.967,"Well, how was the -- suppose the authorities just didn't agree with what was said."
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,940.967,941.779,There would be no regulation.
1974.73-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.779,947.82,Besides the -- beside the -- what if there was criticism the way the school was run?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,947.82,954.81,"The rule specifically provides for allowing responsible criticism, it's stated right in the rules."
1974.73-1347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,954.81,956.585,So what's responsible?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,957.03,963.365,"Well, responsible criticism would be --"
1974.73-1347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,963.365,964.399,Who decides it?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,964.399,965.773,Who decides it?
1974.73-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,966.353,967.425,Fellow who criticized?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,967.425,970.159,The --a board or review that would be setup to look at this --
1974.73-1347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,970.159,972.474,Who might be himself criticized?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,972.474,974.768,"Who might be criticized himself, that's correct."
1974.73-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,987.086,1018.539,"Now, do you think that -- do you think it would just be unmanageable or just not effective if the school had the rules as to what could be in matter -- in materials that are distributed and -- but didn't have a license, didn't have a pre-approval system that you would just -- if someone broke the rules and distributed those language in a newspaper suspend him or punish him or do something?"
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,1018.539,1024.644,That is called for in our rules of subsequent restraint which allow only subsequent punishment after the fact.
1974.73-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.644,1030.383,I understand but you apparently insist on wanting prior approval?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,1030.383,1031.857,"Right, we have two set of rules."
1974.73-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1033.219,1039.258,"I know you'd prefer, I'm trying to find out what your position is here as to what you're constitutionally entitled to do."
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,1039.258,1044.385,I think we are entitled to both sets of rules as they have been written.
1974.73-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1044.385,1054.853,And the reason that you insist on the prior review is because the subsequent approach is ineffective or what?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,1054.853,1057.977,"I don't think it is ineffective, I think it is less effective."
1974.73-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1116.825,1127.994,But you -- I take it that either way you go that one thing you would insist on and that is that the publishers can't be anonymous?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,1127.994,1132.467,I think this is more important for the rules of subsequent restraint.
1974.73-1347,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.727,1176.249,But the -- even on the licensing approach you would insist that only students or faculty members be allowed to publish on this -- in the school system?
1974.73-1347,0,35301,lila_j_young,,1176.249,1182.029,I don't believe in our rule of prior restraint that we limit it.
1974.73-1347,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1252.62,1263.569,Very well Mrs. Young.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1264.944,1268.371,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1304.719,1309.377,"Well, except the colloquy I have noticed the closing language of the Court of Appeals opinion --"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1309.377,1311.132,Precisely Justice Stewart.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.132,1319.423,"-- which says should the defendants apply to the District Court to limit the injunction to high schools, nothing in this decision forecloses the consideration of the application as a matter --"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1319.423,1322.72,Which is exactly what we think they ought to have done.
1974.73-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1322.72,1332.597,Why shouldn't the petitioners -- why shouldn't they be entitled to a reversal from the Seventh Circuit on that point rather than simply telling them to go back and move the District Court to modify?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1332.597,1336.645,Well we didn't argue that they were not entitled to reversal.
1974.73-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1336.645,1342.786,Well then you concede that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was wrong insofar that it is -- it affirmed that portion of the District Court's injunction?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1342.786,1353.426,"Well, we take the position that we've never represented the elementary students, they've never been in our class, they've never been involved in the evidentiary proceedings."
1974.73-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1371.539,1374.949,Judge Stackler really gave you a broader injunction than you asked for then in the Seventh --
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1374.949,1396.436,"Indeed he did Your Honor and I'd like to point to page 110 of the transcript, this is not in the appendix but there in a colloquy with Judge Stackler I said the following to him, “And we have prepared now in our prayer, I would agree with the Court, it is undoubtedly framed in language which would be overly broad."
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.774,1430.659,(Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1430.659,1432.495,As I understand -- excuse me.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.365,1437.008,What difference does it make whether it applies to elementary schools and (Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1437.008,1437.333,Right.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1437.333,1441.328,"Well, we think that there is some emotional difference Justice White."
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1441.328,1442.423,Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1442.423,1442.731,No.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.515,1447.853,The First Amendment would apply exactly the same way to elementary.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1447.853,1450.215,I'm not clear if it would or not.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1450.215,1453.215,Would it or not?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1453.215,1466.36,I would say that I can imagine under the Ginsburg Concept that a careful delineation of age groups would be constitutional under the First Amendment.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1476.544,1485.015,"You don't accept it down the age 13, I mean anything from 13 up is -- you say is out of that (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1485.015,1485.88,No sir.
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1495.607,1496.957,"That was a criminal statute, wasn't it?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1496.957,1498.571,Agreed but it did contain some --
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1498.571,1501.688,"You don't mean that then, do you, that you could be sent to prison for --"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1501.688,1501.961,No.
1974.73-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1505.587,1513.457,"Wasn't the age in Ginsburg was (Inaudible), wasn't the age around 17?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1513.457,1515.225,"Seventeen Your Honor, yes."
1974.73-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1515.225,1517.872,"Well, what do you mean you'd be willing to live with the --"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1517.872,1524.759,It contains definitions of what obscenity is that have some specificity.
1974.73-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1534.693,1536.716,"But you're not going to the age limitation, that (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1536.716,1537.315,No sir.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1541.542,1559.046,"Let's assume that, the board eliminated all -- well, didn't eliminate up the prohibition of obscenity but it added something it says “in these papers you will not use the following words and listed them and no others of the same kind”."
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1570.099,1571.075,Yes sir.
1974.73-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1584.187,1595.231,(Voice Overlap) Mr. Pinkus that as far as they can go constitutionally is to prohibit only that which by constitutional definition is obscene?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1595.231,1609.813,"I think that they can fashion an obscenity rule with respect to the age group involved that is more restrictive than the rules that would apply to adults, but they've not done it."
1974.73-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1609.813,1613.984,(Inaudible) not go so far as to prohibit the use of specific words.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1613.984,1617.092,"Regardless of context, the important point --"
1974.73-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1617.092,1621.763,Where do we go then in between specific words and what kind of rule would be fashioned?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1621.763,1631.907,We believe sir that there must to be covered in any way by the obscenity concept there must be something erotic in the material involved.
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1632.766,1638.283,"That's probably true about obscenity but this isn't an obscenity case, is it?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1639.365,1642.722,"Well sir, it was framed as an obscenity case."
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1667.892,1669.454,What about rules?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1672.345,1680.541,Yes sir and 1.1.1 says that distributable literature excludes that which is obscene.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.074,1685.027,Why would a rule like that be unconstitutional on its face?
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1685.027,1687.012,Right.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1687.012,1688.671,Well I think sir for several reasons.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1689.738,1697.507,"In the first place, I -- the Court of Appeals didn't hold it obscene on its face neither did the court -- District Court."
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1697.507,1701.081,I think that they did find it over broad as I understand the opinion Your Honor.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.081,1703.062,Is that -- that's the particular provision.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1703.062,1703.665,Yes.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.665,1705.655,You mean this in its application.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1705.655,1709.036,"Because -- well, there is imprecision here, I grant."
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1720.368,1727.885,You wouldn't say that just a rule that forbade the newspaper to publish obscenity would be unconstitutional on its face?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1727.885,1729.657,No sir I would not.
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1733.437,1735.839,We're talking about the rules --
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1735.839,1740.79,"Well, yes except that the board is contending that the earthy words violate these rules."
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1740.79,1742.931,There's some place here where all the rules are set out (Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1742.931,1743.83,Yes sir.
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1744.973,1745.899,(Voice Overlap)
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1745.899,1747.39,They're in two locations.
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1747.39,1748.251,Right.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1748.251,1753.596,One is in the beige bound volume and the --
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1753.596,1754.791,(Voice Overlap) by the appendix?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1754.791,1755.663,That's the appendix.
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.32,1762.917,"But what you're saying, --"
1974.73-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1762.917,1763.207,Where the --
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1763.207,1783.684,"I think it is that the students in the high schools may say, express anything, say, express or depict with pictures, anything unless it violates the Miller, Adult Paris Theater line of cases of a year ago."
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1783.684,1784.877,No Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1794.235,1798.634,(Voice Overlap) I think you were thinking this entirely on obscenity.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1798.634,1801.282,I didn't understand that sir.
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1801.282,1807.805,A few minutes ago you were responding to Mr. Justice White that this was an obscenity case.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1807.805,1817.379,"Well, we do not believe that the words in their context have anything to do with obscenity or lewdness and the Court has agreed with us."
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1817.379,1819.524,"(Voice Overlap) agree with you, but that doesn't end the case, does it?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1819.524,1819.984,No sir.
1974.73-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1850.326,1870.11,"But you go further and say that since there is nothing obscene even variably obscene under Ginsburg, the school board can't prohibit the use of particulars, specified words that are just regarded as being in very bad taste in public conversations around the dinner table?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1870.11,1872.708,That is correct Justice Rehnquist.
1974.73-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.177,1874.871,What's your basis?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1876.525,1893.504,"Well, we think that in a sense the question on this issue is whether a public high school is more like a jail or the United States Army with Parker and Aderley in mind which has been relied upon the board, or it's more like a university in Papish."
1974.73-1347,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1907.695,1909.747,Why did you presume we haven't?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1909.747,1911.697,"Yes, but --"
1974.73-1347,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1911.697,1917.261,"What is your answer to Mrs. Young's hypothetical and if she hadn't raised it, I would have?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1926.251,1927.441,I do and I heard some --
1974.73-1347,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1927.441,1936.162,"If so then, do you contend that a court has greater control over the speech of mature lawyers than a school does over those of -- speech of teenagers?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1936.162,1951.672,I think they're much different environments and I think that I heard language here from Mr. Clancy yesterday in the pursue of limited course that undoubtedly would have been equally as objectionable if it had been contained in the Corn Cub Curtain which had -- was not.
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1955.393,1963.132,But the difference is that he was using it because he was repeating it out of a record in a case before the Court.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,1973.84,1994.855,"Well sir, I'm arguing that context is extremely vital and that -- to simply pick out a word and say this word is always inappropriate in a student publication goes very, very far beyond what the First Amendment should be permitted to tolerate and I would like to stress that we have quite a double standard."
1974.73-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.394,2031.229,Yet you wouldn't carry it over to elementary schools.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2031.229,2044.211,"Well, I really don't know the position on that Justice Rehnquist because quite frankly I've never dealt with the elementary school context in this litigation and I've -- I incidentally --"
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2044.211,2048.242,(Inaudible)
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2048.242,2048.678,Yes.
1974.73-1347,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2116.388,2118.517,What was the issue of dividing line?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2125.468,2126.58,No sir.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.446,2155.26,"Well that is the scope of your submission, 13 to 20."
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2155.26,2158.431,Yes sir.
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2158.431,2162.053,"That was -- so let's put another way, its from the 9th through the 12th grade."
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2162.053,2163.324,Yes sir.
1974.73-1347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2163.524,2164.325,Whatever age.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2164.325,2178.314,"-- to the extent that I indicated that 14 was the cut off, the -- I would grant that there may be one confused year in there but we are talking about the elementary versus the high school setting."
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.314,2193.793,Did you take the position before the Court of Appeals that the Ginsburg approach to obscenity for younger people survived Miller?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2193.793,2195.359,Yes.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2195.359,2201.169,"The Court of Appeals didn't seem to think so, did it?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2201.169,2202.966,"Well, I must --"
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.966,2215.425,They find -- seem to distinct that because the -- because it wasn't any -- that the rules were bad because they didn't specify the conduct stated in Miller.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2219.304,2223.878,"Well, Justice White I'm inclined to think you maybe correct."
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.421,2233.196,You made that (Inaudible)
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2233.196,2235.984,Yes sir.
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2235.984,2247.857,Going back to this age group in your response to Mr. Justice White -- Mr. Justice Stewart that it is essentially from the 9th grade through the 12th.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2262.591,2263.248,Yes Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.248,2292.567,"Of course you've got a 13 year olds, 14 and 13 and 14 in grade school and they publish some of this kind of material for a grade school publication, then you would say they're protected then under your 13 to 20 range, their freedom, their First Amendment right can't be interfered with?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2292.567,2296.211,"Mr. Chief Justice that's really not quite our position, we're talking about --"
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2296.211,2298.247,"Well, it is if its 13, (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2298.247,2302.501,"13 year olds in high school sir, to be as accurate as I can be."
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2302.945,2306.04,"Is that what the injunction says, 13 year olds in high school?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2306.04,2322.679,"No, it does not and it should be narrowed and we agreed before the Seventh Circuit it should be narrowed and I agreed before the trial court that the complaint was broad in the statement of the relief prayed for and I still take that position sir."
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2327.598,2329.309,Regardless of age.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2329.309,2330.864,"Well, that was the environment --"
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2330.864,2332.013,Is that it?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2332.013,2333.354,"Yes, regardless of age."
1974.73-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2402.771,2418.384,"But there is an implicit in that paragraph of the Seventh Circuit's opinion certainly is the notion that Miller covered all aspects of obscenity and that if you can't tie Ginsburg into the language of Miller as written, Ginsburg didn't survive, don't you think?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2418.384,2422.049,I think that that's quite possible Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.049,2424.215,"Meaning you think they are wrong, don't you?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2424.215,2425.102,Yes.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2547.287,2549.973,Could I ask you a question?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2569.878,2570.523,Precisely.
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2570.523,2582.062,"And that he board may not say, “I want to check on this distribution here before it goes out to make sure that this bannable material is not on the paper."
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2582.062,2584.431,"Precisely, precisely and one --"
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.431,2593.929,And what's your -- you think that is even -- that rule against prior restraint would apply right across the board in high schools?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2593.929,2595.385,"Yes, that is our position."
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2595.385,2599.314,And you would -- and you also insist on anonymity?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2599.314,2602.568,"No, we think that the -- I'd like to make two points on that."
1974.73-1347,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2623.015,2639.215,"Well I don't know, there a lot of people wouldn't it -- might like to criticize the school authorities without knowing that they known who they are and like to tell some teachers are very bad and they wouldn't like to know -- especially if it's a member of that class, wouldn't like to know who's talking."
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2639.215,2661.259,"We think that that's a valuable right which should be protected and that high school journalism is not so different from grown-up journalism, if you will, that the New York Times is to be treated differently to the extent that prior restraints against its publications bear an extremely heavy constitutional burden whereas they don't here."
1974.73-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2676.508,2677.951,53A of a -- of what?

1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2815.286,2817.129,He is a high school student?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2817.129,2819.361,"Yes, the evidence, the --"
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2819.361,2832.691,Do you suppose these general activities that are been under in discussion here for now an hour have any relationship to the fact that he misspells three very elementary words in there in one paragraph?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2832.691,2837.955,"With all due respect, there is testimony about the printing and reproduction processes here."
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2844.098,2845.88,What does it have to do with the spelling?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2845.88,2849.069,"Well, I don't think that it was necessarily his spelling sir."
1974.73-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2853.24,2859.932,I take this -- was this criticism the subject of any complaint from school or faculty or board or anybody?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2859.932,2861.445,"No, not until this --"

1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2862.442,2864.04,Not until this whole matter began.
1974.73-1347,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2889.487,2892.02,"(Voice Overlap) say, he was the superintendent, superintendent to what?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2894.766,2894.996,No.
1974.73-1347,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2894.996,2895.193,Superintendent of (Voice Overlap)
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2895.193,2895.451,No.
1974.73-1347,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2905.193,2908.367,"But you called him superintendent, I'm merely trying to focus on what he was."
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2910.563,2911.78,No sir.
1974.73-1347,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2918.413,2925.617,"Well, why shouldn't an assistant principal of a whole system know whether a paper is being published in a particular school?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2925.617,2937.114,"Well, the record describes that it was his job to keep track of these things and he submitted numerous exhibits that showed various publications that he prohibited."
1974.73-1347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2960.303,2965.946,You've used a couple of words kind of interchangeably it seems to me or perhaps I'm just misunderstood.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2976.13,2977.84,That's correct.
1974.73-1347,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2977.84,2981.498,Mr. Pinkus have used them so interchangeably that's why it's confusing.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,2981.498,2985.249,"I appreciate that, I trust it is now clear."
1974.73-1347,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2985.249,2996.665,I take it from what you've been saying that you would agree that it would be appropriate for a school boy to have some rules covering this area.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,3038.077,3059.901,"I would recommend an adoption of rules on the prohibition of obscenities and I think I would be inclined to draw heavily on the definitions used in the Ginsburg case that involved descriptions of various conditions of nudity, descriptions of sexual acts in a degree of detail none of which we have here."
1974.73-1347,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3084.603,3090.064,"You have no prior restraint, no prior consultation."
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,3100.05,3101.14,I think that's correct.
1974.73-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3126.395,3132.697,"Well, would you apply the New York Times - Sullivan libel limitations?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,3132.697,3133.621,I would indeed Justice Brennan.
1974.73-1347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3133.621,3134.354,You would?
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,3134.354,3136.212,Yes.
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3136.212,3137.543,You would reject.
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,3153.319,3155.607,"Yes, regardless of that context --"
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3155.607,3159.031,"(Voice Overlap) and all other prior restraints, you would reject?"
1974.73-1347,1,19804,craig_eldon_pinkus,,3159.031,3162.23,Yes we would.
1974.73-1347,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3162.23,3165.774,"Very well, thank you Mr. Pinkus."
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3168.715,3172.176,"I have ten minutes, I believe."
1974.73-1347,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3172.399,3175.64,"Well, they haven't informed me correctly here."
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3177.507,3179.414,Thank you.
1974.73-1347,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3249.416,3252.02,(Voice Overlap) There must be some people once who have skipped a grade (Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3252.02,3258.989,That's right and this is we may have one 13 and we may have a few who fail who reached 20.
1974.73-1347,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3314.975,3316.87,That was the case (Voice Overlap) I think.
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3316.87,3318.49,What?
1974.73-1347,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3318.49,3322.966,That would be a different and more difficult case if that's brought here if you keep books out of your library.
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3322.966,3327.471,Well we don't -- it's not a matter of keeping them out but we don't have required reading.
1974.73-1347,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3331.844,3334.785,"This isn't essential for your submission, aren't they?"
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3334.785,3352.404,All I'm saying though is that no double standard exists in our schools which they were saying and I don't think it's hypocritical to shield children from exposure to this language in school simply because other people use it.
1974.73-1347,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3571.967,3576.713,"These rules apply only inside the school, don't they?"
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3579.947,3581.413,Basically --
1974.73-1347,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3581.413,3582.125,One of them does say --
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3582.125,3583.974,Yes.
1974.73-1347,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3583.974,3585.556,-- in the school or on the campus.
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3585.556,3590.716,That's right and many of them of course would apply on the campus which in the city school amounts to very little.
1974.73-1347,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3590.716,3592.173,"Yeah, right."
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3592.173,3598.282,"But I want to mention too about sales and solicitations, that's a very important issue in this case."
1974.73-1347,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3626.837,3631.84,But you would avoid sale of copies of the constitution of the United States?
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3631.84,3632.752,I would what?
1974.73-1347,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3632.752,3641.074,You would proscribe or do proscribe the sale of copies of the constitution of the United States?
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3641.074,3641.581,That's right.
1974.73-1347,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3642.343,3643.709,And the bible.
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3643.709,3643.993,Right.
1974.73-1347,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3659.006,3668.935,What do you suppose the students should do to raise their money to publish a paper of the kind that even your school would think was a good idea?
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3668.935,3682.719,"Well, we have an exception in our sales rule that if anything is for a school purpose like the band or a student newspaper, we do allow that type of sales, but that's the only exception that we've made."
1974.73-1347,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3682.719,3690.403,You don't -- you wouldn't permit solicitation or contributions to support the school?
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3690.403,3693.537,"Not inside the school, they can do it beyond the school house gate."
1974.73-1347,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3693.537,3696.15,But you would permit sale of the paper?
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3696.15,3700.565,We would permit no sales of any products including papers.
1974.73-1347,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3700.565,3705.815,"Well then, how do you raise the money for the student paper?"
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3705.815,3708.381,"For our -- you mean, the school student paper?"
1974.73-1347,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3708.381,3709.009,Yes.
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3709.009,3712.587,"Well, we have home room periods and it depends on the various schools."
1974.73-1347,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3713.317,3719.596,But -- how about -- how are they supposed to pay for the -- pay the cost of producing a student newspaper?
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3719.596,3723.268,The school would pay the student -- the school student newspaper.
1974.73-1347,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3733.019,3734.972,But they couldn't sell them on the school?
1974.73-1347,2,35301,lila_j_young,,3734.972,3735.584,That's correct.
1974.73-1347,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3784.106,3787.11,Thank you Mrs. Young.
