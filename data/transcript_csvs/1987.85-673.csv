1987.85-673,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case Number 85-673, Neil F. Hartigan v. David Zbaraz."
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,12.891,17.926,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.85-673,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,200.743,210.199,"Mr. Hayes, didn't the 7th Circuit reserve judgment as to a part of the matter pending in the promulgation of rules by the Supreme Court of Illinois?"
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,210.199,229.429,"--Your Honor, it could appear that way, but a practical look at the opinion and a close reading of it clearly indicates that the statute that the legislature passed with its by-pass procedures coupled with the rules that exist in Illinois under our Supreme Court rules for appellate practice were held to be constitutionally insufficient as they exist."
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,247.891,255.247,"May I ask, what is the status of the rule-making procedure proceeding before the Illinois Supreme Court?"
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,256.23,261.4,"The rule-making procedure, as far as I know, Justice Stevens, has not been underway."
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,261.4,266.102,Has anybody initiated that or taken any action to get that work done?
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,266.102,266.554,Excuse me?
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,266.554,267.554,Has it been initiated?
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,268.737,269.589,Not to my knowledge.
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,271.873,274.125,"Who is responsible for initiating it, do you suppose?"
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,274.125,282.897,"Well, initially, the Supreme Court, of course, would have authority to initiate on their own through a committee to draft rules and to review the rules."
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,286.949,288.051,How about the Attorney General of the state?
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,289.001,293.789,"The Attorney General of the state has not petitioned the Supreme Court to implement rules, to add additional rules."
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,304.227,314.868,What about his position as to whether the statute itself is operative if those rules are never promulgated?
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,326.593,328.043,"They have not, Justice Scalia."
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.695,357.529,"That's a question of legislative intent, though, isn't it?"
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,357.529,358.564,As to whether the Supreme Court--
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.564,370.789,"As to whether the Illinois legislature intended this statute to be implemented if the rules provision never went into effect, if the Illinois Supreme Court never adopted the emergency rules that it anticipated."
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,370.789,374.074,"--No, I disagree, Justice Scalia."
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.381,387.264,I don't think you're disagreeing.
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,392.702,393.987,--That's correct.
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,393.987,402.343,"And the Attorney General asserts the legislature intended one thing, but, ultimately, that's a question to be answered by the Illinois courts, I take it, isn't it?"
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,402.343,402.776,That's correct.
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,403.26,405.795,The same courts that have refused to promulgate the rules thus far.
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,405.795,412.282,"--Well, Justice Scalia, they have not had an opportunity to have a viable statute in front of them to promulgate rules."
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.43,549.237,"Mr. Hayes, do you think, moving from the question of whether we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal, is it clear that the District Court had proper jurisdiction to entertain this suit in the first place?"
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,581.209,604.491,"Justice Scalia, I would agree with you that... I think that's the problem with the Appellees' suggestion that this case isn't ripe because if it's not ripe for review under 1254.2 because the Supreme Court didn't pass some rules and those rules have never existed, that same argument means that it wasn't ripe at the District Court level, and that the injunctions that were entered were improperly entered."
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,630.558,639.997,"Does that mean, Mr. Hayes, that there need not have even be a lawsuit filed, the statute would not have had any legal effect until the rules were promulgated?"
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,640.747,642.699,"Oh, on the contrary, Justice Stevens."
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,642.699,644.484,"Then, why wasn't it ripe for adjudication?"
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,648.77,649.97,I agree it's ripe for adjudication.
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,649.97,652.138,"I mean, at the time of the District Court's decision."
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,652.138,665.731,"I agree then and I agree now, and I don't believe, first of all, that the statute's operation, as I'll discuss later when I get to the by-pass procedure, requires in Illinois, as a constitutional basis, the passage of additional rules."
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.273,715.997,Did either the District Court or the Court of Appeals here make a finding that this statute could be implemented whether or not the Supreme Court of Illinois ever issues those rules?
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,717.08,717.914,They did not.
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.782,721.484,But you're telling us that that's essential to the jurisdiction here.
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,721.484,723.584,--Pardon me.
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.436,734.459,"As I understand your position, it is an essential element of the jurisdiction that this statute is operative without the Illinois Supreme Court rules."
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,734.459,735.659,That's correct.
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,735.659,744.332,"And, yet, neither of the Courts below has made a finding that that's how the statute should be interpreted, which is a question of Illinois law, but nobody has made any finding to that effect yet."
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,744.332,766.847,"They have found that it was the intention and the Plaintiffs allege that it was the intention of the Illinois officials, namely the Attorney General of the state, to enforce the statute upon its becoming effective as it existed, and that because there was not what they believed to be necessary additional specificity in the rules of the Supreme Court, the Court enjoined it from going ahead."
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1036.472,1039.774,Can I ask you a question about how this statute would work without the Supreme Court rules?
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1047.362,1047.812,That's correct.
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1047.812,1050.398,Who pays the guardian ad litem's fee?
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1050.398,1052.7,There are no costs to the minor.
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.639,1065.241,Is that set out in the statute or is that... what's the source of that?
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1065.241,1068.11,"Yes, it is set out."
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1070.562,1072.078,At state expense?
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1072.078,1072.68,That's correct.
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.68,1073.197,I see.
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1073.697,1086.737,"In drafting and passing the Parental Notice of Abortion Act, the Illinois legislature elected to include a judicial alternative to notice."
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.164,1179.533,May I just be sure?
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1185.77,1186.953,Yes.
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1188.422,1192.007,And what is the source of the statement no attorneys fees?
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1192.007,1202.399,--It's the... our belief that the legislature intended in this Act when they provide that a guardian ad litem will be appointed and that the Court--
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.399,1207.6,"So, that's your instruction of the general legislative intent rather than any specific finding in the Act?"
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1207.6,1208.05,--That's correct.
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.05,1208.718,I hadn't found it.
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1208.718,1209.885,Correct.
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1288.504,1291.289,"Mr. Hayes, can I ask you one other question about the statute?"
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1291.289,1292.422,--Certainly.
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1292.422,1294.574,What is the reason for notice to both parents?
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1296.943,1309.918,"Illinois has decided that by choosing a two-parent notification statute that, as we know from our cases, both parents have a right to raise and nurture and guide their child."
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.642,1330.497,Does that shed light on the state's interest in being sure that the child is having the benefit of sympathetic advice and so forth?
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1330.497,1340.687,"--It certainly does because if you view the statute only looking from the benefits to the child, there's another purpose that this Court has recognized and our statute provides, and that's the right of parents."
1987.85-673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1343.472,1347.126,You have to rely on that right to justify notice to both parents.
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1352.261,1352.911,--No.
1987.85-673,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1547.857,1548.574,"Mr. Hayes,--"
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1548.574,1549.657,--with its exceptions.
1987.85-673,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1549.657,1550.726,--excuse me.
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1558.046,1560.915,There is no other medical procedure.
1987.85-673,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1576.174,1577.959,That's what I was questioning about.
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1580.328,1581.161,That's correct.
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1583.363,1584.83,I don't understand what that means.
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1597.171,1598.54,--I would require parental consent.
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1598.54,1599.607,It would.
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1600.14,1599.607,Consent.
1987.85-673,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1600.773,1601.409,Consent.
1987.85-673,0,35992,michael_j_hayes,,1602.442,1605.027,I believe one would be sufficient.
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,1617.251,1624.238,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.85-673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1766.347,1775.619,"But what if the Illinois Supreme Court thinks the present structure of Illinois rules in the appellate courts is adequate to accomplish that and, so, nothing more is necessary?"
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,1777.321,1783.059,"Your Honor, the existing Illinois rules are not adequate."
1987.85-673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1783.059,1784.409,"Well, you tell us they're not."
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,1794.367,1798.402,"Your Honor, there's been no indication that that is what the Illinois Supreme Court thinks."
1987.85-673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1800.27,1801.036,"Well, it certainly has."
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,1813.078,1813.578,--No.
1987.85-673,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.902,1878.021,That is a question for the Illinois Supreme Court under the statute.
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,1886.642,1888.176,"Well, Your Honor, it has always troubled us."
1987.85-673,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1905.004,1910.206,You have gotten then... you have been successful below.
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,1923.632,1933.337,"Your Honor, the injunction prevents the enforcement of the statute, but it does not, as required by Section 1254, declare the statute unconstitutional."
1987.85-673,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.01,1945.129,If that opportunity is ever accepted by the Illinois Supreme Court.
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,1945.129,1945.629,If that opportunity--
1987.85-673,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.629,1963.424,"It's entirely possible that the Illinois Supreme Court never adopts its rules and forever, nonetheless, should it adopt that course, this Attorney General is restrained from doing what he wants to do on the ground that to do that under the statute, as he interprets it, is unconstitutional."
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,1964.709,1967.427,"--Your Honor, if the Illinois General... excuse me."
1987.85-673,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1993.526,1995.245,He asserts it doesn't require rules.
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,2008.904,2023.764,"Your Honor, it is not a ruling below that satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of this Court because even though it may be a final decision with respect to whether the statute is incomplete."
1987.85-673,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2039.341,2050.064,"Ms. Connell, don't you think that we would at least have jurisdiction if we granted certiorari to review whether the injunction was properly issued below?"
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,2050.064,2064.408,"--Justice O'Connor, I think that the same constraint that caution against the exercise of obligatory jurisdiction also counsel against the exercise of discretionary--"
1987.85-673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2064.408,2069.86,"The question... Ms. Connell, the question is whether we have jurisdiction to grant certiorari, not whether we ought to grant it."
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,2072.028,2100.747,"--Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that with respect to the questions that Mr. Hartigan now raises, if this Court were to decide to grant certiorari jurisdiction, there would be a substantial risk perhaps of issuing an advisory opinion because the issues that Mr. Hartigan asks review on of whether this statute requires rules, when, in fact, the... excuse me."
1987.85-673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2107.251,2123.161,"That would be a reason why the Court should not grant certiorari, but I think all we require jurisdictionally to follow up on Justice O'Connor's question is that a case be in the Court of Appeals, and there's no question this case was in the Court of Appeals, is it?"
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,2123.161,2123.613,"That's right, Your Honor."
1987.85-673,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2164.857,2171.76,How much time did you give the Supreme Court to adopt those rules before you filed suit?
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,2171.76,2172.76,"Your Honor,--"
1987.85-673,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2172.76,2176.212,That's a very simple question.
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,2176.212,2179.533,"--Your Honor, approximately eighty-eight days, my recollection."
1987.85-673,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2179.533,2185.937,And about how long does it take a state to adopt... your state to adopt its rules?
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,2185.937,2187.237,"Your Honor, the--"
1987.85-673,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2187.237,2188.555,How many years?
1987.85-673,1,18581,colleen_k_connell,,2188.555,2190.589,--answer is that it varies because--
1987.85-673,2,35992,michael_j_hayes,,3419.604,3423.424,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.85-673,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3447.04,3448.89,"Mr. Hayes, let me just interrupt."
1987.85-673,2,35992,michael_j_hayes,,3454.777,3455.395,--That is correct.
1987.85-673,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3455.395,3463.966,And is it not also true that the 7th Circuit upheld that the statute without the rules as a matter of Illinois law does not provide for either of those things?
1987.85-673,2,35992,michael_j_hayes,,3463.966,3465.385,"No, I don't believe that it did."
1987.85-673,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3515.934,3533.229,"I read their opinion, maybe not on the expedition, but I read their opinion as saying that the present Illinois statutory scheme and rules do not provide the kind of confidentiality that is necessary, either to meet the word in the statute or to meet what they regard as the constitutional requirements."
1987.85-673,2,35992,michael_j_hayes,,3533.229,3547.405,"--Justice Stevens, the difference between the confidentiality provided in Illinois and that which was recognized and provided in Missouri and Ashcroft is that the statute said a minor can use their initials."
1987.85-673,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3563.182,3564.784,"You may be right, and the Court of Appeals may be wrong."
