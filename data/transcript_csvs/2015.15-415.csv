2015.15-415,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.33,"We'll hear argument next in Case 15-415, Encino Motorcars v. Navarro. Mr. Clement."
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,7.33,16.725,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Service advisors are salespeople principally engaged in the servicing of automobiles."
2015.15-415,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,105.46,121.425,"Mr. Clement, may I ask you, what is the significance of the position you are taking? Does it have any real consequences, given the separate exemption for people who are working on commission?"
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,121.425,133.085,"It -- it does -- it does have real-world consequences, Justice Ginsburg, principally for those service advisors who right now are not compensated on a commission basis."
2015.15-415,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,133.085,145.385,"And what -- in -- in this field, what percentage of service advisors are not commissioned rather than salaried employees?"
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,145.385,151.13,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't have a specific statistical breakdown, but I'm reliably informed that it's a significant number."
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,196.24,197.605,That's every employee.
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,197.605,198.18,What's that?
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,198.18,200.515,That's every employee who's salaried.
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,210.01,211.86,"Well, I understand that, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,212.14,221.575,"I don't know how I can take from the fact that service advisors accept what's given to them because they have no choice, why they prefer not to have overtime."
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,221.575,230.35,I don't know that I was making that strong claim; I was just trying to be responsive that this case does have real-world implications notwithstanding the 7(i) exemption.
2015.15-415,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,230.35,269.305,"So what example -- what -- if we're only talking about those of the -- the people who sell service who are not on commission, what basis is there for giving them an exception? Do they work regular hours? I take it if they work regular hours and if they aren't paid on commission, why wouldn't they be treated like secretaries or others? I mean, apparently Congress thought that the mechanics themselves were special because they go out into agricultural areas or something in the middle of the night and fix a tractor."
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,280.175,281.28,I get your question.
2015.15-415,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,292.175,307.335,"Well, the answer would be because the partsmen and mechanics, so Congress thought, in agricultural areas, would have to go at 3:00 in the morning to fix the tractor, and that's why they get within this special treatment."
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,316.755,317.8,"Here, Justice Breyer --"
2015.15-415,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,317.8,318.605,"Now, what about that?"
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,318.605,326.425,"Yeah, no, I do want to be very responsive to that because I do think whatever, you know, Senator Bayh was thinking about farm implements back in the day."
2015.15-415,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,326.425,326.82,Right.
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,326.82,335.34,I think today there's a very good reason to treat the service advisors the same way as the partsmen and mechanics for purposes of the overtime exception.
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,464.185,468.54,"But, Mr. Clement, those courts were before Chevron."
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,468.54,470.28,"Oh, they were, Justice Sotomayor, but --"
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,470.28,477.67,"So you know, I take less value in what the courts said because every one of them said the provision was ambiguous."
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,477.67,478.06,Well --
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,478.06,484.795,They just thought that the better argument -- this was before Chevron -- favored your interpretation.
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,493.88,499.875,"So Justice Sotomayor, I think it's fair to take the older cases with one grain of salt, but I wouldn't take it with two or three."
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,524.25,526.295,I have a very practical question.
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,536.06,541.87,"I -- I'm -- so I'm going a little bit out of the record here, and I haven't read anything that's directly on point."
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,557.26,565.895,"Because, to be candid with you, it scares me to think that every time I take my car to a dealer, that a non-mechanic is telling me what's wrong with it."
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,565.895,573.93,"Well -- and I understand that, but I think that's actually why these people may be nonmechanics, but they're not outside the servicing lane."
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,573.93,574.35,Well --
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,574.35,576.3,"And there are costs for -- you know, for the dealers."
2015.15-415,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,599.24,603.76,But now the Labor Department had a chance to rethink.
2015.15-415,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,623.15,634.52,"They said now we're going to rethink this, and our decision is that we were right the first time, that these people are not exempt."
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,647.425,653.945,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't think what the agency did in 2011 merits Chevron deference."
2015.15-415,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,727.33,728.65,I guess I don't understand that.
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,743.91,748.38,"Well, two things, Your Honor, and then I want to remind you that if this statute is clear, you don't get to Chevron."
2015.15-415,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,748.38,748.57,Of course.
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,748.57,779.26,"But two things cause Chevron. Here is the first, which is, I would agree with you if what they did is at the end of the notice-and-comment rulemaking, they came up with, say, a new definition of ""servicing,"" and that informed why they came up with the decision that they did, but that's not what they did. They came up with a decision that took out the provision that specifically addressed service advisors, and then a single paragraph of the preamble to the notice -- to the rules, because there's nothing in the rules that really addresses it anymore. So the only thing you can look to is the preamble."
2015.15-415,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,799.35,799.55,Yeah.
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,825.21,828.35,"Well, I don't -- I don't want to quibble too long with you on that."
2015.15-415,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,839.91,841.31,This is not parroting the statute.
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,845.555,848.27,And so I want to get to my second one.
2015.15-415,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,901.35,909.005,"So, I mean, the question is on the reliance interests, if you think people have been relying and will be punished for that reliance."
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,933.29,935.25,"So two points on that, Your Honor."
2015.15-415,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1020.24,1027.605,"Well, I suspect, Mr. Clement, you would say to your clients, you know, you are taking a risk because now the agency has changed their minds."
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1047.325,1049.96,"Well, Justice Kagan, I try to be a careful lawyer."
2015.15-415,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1165.72,1202.33,"If I may, given the grammar for a moment, just on a fact question: You said there weren't -- the parts and the partsmen and the mechanics, they -- they were -- they all work no more than a 40-hour work week, and you mentioned 46. There was something in the submissions here that said the service advisors are working a 6:00-a.m.-to-7:00-p.m. shift, and so it would come, on average, to 15 hours more."
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1202.33,1203.11,Yeah.
2015.15-415,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1203.39,1204.375,Is that incorrect?
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1204.375,1215.06,"Well, I think what I recall from the complaint is it was -- is that it was 7:00 to 6:00, and so that would still get you -- if you don't rotate them around, that might get you a 55-hour workday."
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1223.04,1232.35,"Were -- in 1966, were there service advisors in existence?"
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1232.35,1233.145,"Yes, there were."
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1233.145,1237.745,"And were they paid the same way as now? Were they salaried, or commissioned?"
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1237.745,1241.49,"I think there was a mix back then, as there is now."
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1241.49,1257.65,"I went to the Dictionary of Occupations, which was in existence in 1966, and it appears to have different entries for salesmen, service advisors, partsmen, mechanic."
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1293.475,1317.93,"Well, here's what I would say that you should read into that, Justice Sotomayor, which is you should read into the fact that Congress used the term ""any"" and ""any salesmen,"" and then modified it not just by selling vehicles, but also by servicing vehicles, to think that Congress didn't need to separately add the service advisors in, because they were already covered by the language of the statute. I would also --"
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1317.93,1319.41,But they thought it important.
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1345.14,1353.95,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, I don't think if they had omitted the partsmen, I think it would be an awfully hard argument to say that the partsmen are mechanics."
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1362.845,1374.314,Except the dictionary doesn't use the words -- the functions as functions of selling a car.
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1390.495,1391.93,"Which doesn't, the --"
2015.15-415,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1391.93,1393.6,The occupational handbook.
2015.15-415,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1393.6,1432.93,"Well, I mean, I guess I would still say, though, the question -- I'd make two points, one I've already made, which is I do think, since they used any salesman, I think they thought that they already had it covered. The second thing I would say is I think if they were going to include service advisors into the statute, I think what the statute would say is exactly what it says now, which is it would say ""any salesman, service advisor, partsman, or mechanic engaged"" -- ""primarily engaged in"" -- ""in selling or servicing automobiles,"" trucks, or farm implements. And what I think that shows is that there's nothing at all unnatural to say that the service advisors are primarily engaged in servicing automobiles. That is what they do."
2015.15-415,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1525.745,1542.905,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bibas."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1542.905,1551.295,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The FLSA exempts salesmen who sell cars and partsmen and mechanics who service cars."
2015.15-415,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1577.98,1585.93,Could you pick up where Mr. Clement left off? What would be the -- what is the basis for covering partsmen?
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1585.93,1588.22,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-415,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1618.33,1632.585,"Well, as to those who are not, as to those who obtain parts, don't change the parts, supply the correct part to the mechanic, they would still be engaged in servicing automobiles, you would say?"
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1632.585,1640.28,"If they are physically dispensing the parts, handing them over, and doing so in sync with the mechanic's work."
2015.15-415,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1665.84,1666.0,Yes.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1695.01,1707.015,"I have a couple of responses. The first one is if there's a line to be drawn, that of course is for the agency. Secondly, I would say that they are engaged in the dictionary definition, repairing or maintaining automobiles."
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1783.98,1784.17,I'm sorry.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1786.78,1786.88,Okay.
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1791.48,1792.12,Thank you.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1792.12,1794.76,But the -- they don't quote the section of full.
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1850.22,1871.895,"Well, is it just -- I suspect it differs from place to place and how many people they have and all that, but why is it -- I mean, are these the people that when you go in, and you know, you go and say the car's making a funny noise or something, do they go out and look at the car, listen to the noise? What's it -- I mean, that seems to me to be more like a process."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1877.03,1878.22,So my understanding is --
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1878.22,1878.29,No.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1886.21,1886.61,Right.
2015.15-415,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1922.93,1923.36,"No, no."
2015.15-415,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1924.26,1924.4,If --
2015.15-415,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1924.4,1931.51,You've missed a process. And some of us up here are experts in having to go to auto agencies and coming back. (Laughter.)
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1931.51,1931.67,Yes.
2015.15-415,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1931.67,1934.025,The first thing he does is give you an estimate.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1934.025,1934.47,Yes.
2015.15-415,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1934.47,1947.16,"And -- both in cost and in time, and make recommendations for, well, maybe you should replace it, and it would cost you X dollars. So -- so just to say that he puts something and then it's up to the mechanic, that's incorrect."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1947.16,1954.985,"You are correct, Your Honor. The -- he's giving a preliminary estimate based on we think the squealing noise means you need a new timing belt."
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1966.38,1973.95,"I don't mean to be too particular, but if there's a squealing sound and it might be the fan belt, you're saying he's not going to open the hood and look at the fan belt?"
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1973.95,1979.98,"Well, he's not -- he's not going to be measuring the tension on the fan belt, touching the fan belt, doing any of that."
2015.15-415,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1988.68,1989.485,What --
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,1989.485,1989.99,The question --
2015.15-415,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1989.99,2004.32,But how would you describe what this employee is engaged in? You say he's not engaged in selling cars and he's not engaged in servicing cars.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2009.76,2015.5,There are people in auto dealership who do lots of things that might be part of a general process.
2015.15-415,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2041.87,2046.095,"Suppose you say -- you phone them up and you say, I'd like the servicing Department, please."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2046.095,2046.6,Yes.
2015.15-415,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2046.6,2048.46,"Someone answers the phone, hello."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2053.75,2054.38,Service advisor.
2015.15-415,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2054.38,2055.6,"Yeah, service advisor."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2073.0,2076.67,"I would say if -- if you don't think it's clear, of course Chevron deference --"
2015.15-415,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2076.67,2078.355,"Yeah, well, that's the question."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2171.275,2178.56,"Your Honor, there are about four questions in there, if I might take them in turn. You asked about your own writing and your own position on reliance."
2015.15-415,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2192.565,2201.975,"I -- that's a good point, and I don't know how absolute we ought to be there. And -- and the reason this is now facing me with that problem."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2230.66,2231.06,Okay.
2015.15-415,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2231.06,2238.35,"And the fact that I said it that way that time at most is going to show I'm not always perfectly consistent, which is -- I'll admit."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2238.35,2268.69,"I think Your Honor was also correct in saying in Long Island Care that the notice-and-comment rulemaking process makes any -- the potential for any unfair surprise unlikely. It's also quite noteworthy in the reliance area that, as the professor's brief pointed out, in the several days after the April 2011 rule was promulgated, even before its effective date, counsel below for Petitioners and a number of other law firms and Petitioners' amicus in that were all publicizing to the members: This new rule came out."
2015.15-415,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2289.64,2291.68,Could you give me the pages where it's in your brief?
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2291.68,2293.13,The back of the red brief.
2015.15-415,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2327.43,2339.93,"Why did they change? As the commentators point out, then they go on to say what it is in that sentence that the commentators point out. So I agree, other people agreed with them, sure, that's true."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2359.685,2360.03,There's --
2015.15-415,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2360.03,2363.28,"We didn't think it then, but we think it now."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2363.28,2363.75,There's more --
2015.15-415,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2363.75,2366.24,And that's -- is there anything else?
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2366.24,2367.375,"There's more, Your Honor."
2015.15-415,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2409.445,2415.69,If I might: Mr. Clement suggested that you might be seeking damages for pre-2011 conduct.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2416.76,2420.02,Our complaint was filed in September 2012.
2015.15-415,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2444.05,2446.185,Is that the good-faith reliance provision?
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2446.185,2448.98,"Yes, that's 29 U.S.C. 259."
2015.15-415,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2448.98,2455.38,And is that applicable -- is that an open issue on remand?
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2455.38,2458.675,That's an issue -- it hasn't been pled; it's an open issue on remand.
2015.15-415,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2458.675,2465.48,And that's both as to pre-2011 and post -- post-2011 damages?
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2465.48,2473.08,"It's not -- not as to post May 5, 2011, because the opinion letter has no force past the effective date of the new regulation."
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2473.08,2474.37,I'm sorry.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2477.02,2482.665,About applying a 2011 regulation to post-2011 conduct.
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2494.58,2497.355,What about the damages you're seeking before 2011?
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2497.355,2503.255,The Portal-to-Portal Act may well be a defense in that situation if they can plead and prove reliance.
2015.15-415,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2503.255,2503.89,May I ask --
2015.15-415,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2503.89,2505.475,But you are seeking damages?
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2505.475,2508.575,"We have a damages claim, but they have a defense."
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2508.575,2515.43,"Well, but even though the regulation took -- the regulation had changed the interpretation that took effect 2011?"
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2515.43,2519.1,"The notice-and-comment regulation took effect May 5th, 2011."
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2519.1,2523.41,And that changed the Department understanding of the statute.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2523.41,2529.725,It maintained the former regulation; it rescinded the enforcement materials that said they would not enforce during that period of time.
2015.15-415,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2529.725,2529.985,You --
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2529.985,2536.29,So the Department said -- I just want to get -- the Department said they would not enforce prior to 2011?
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2536.29,2536.795,Yes.
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2536.795,2539.05,And yet you still think they should be liable for damages?
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2539.05,2540.59,"No, there's the Portal-to-Portal Act --"
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2540.59,2542.1,"Well, putting aside -- that's a defense."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2545.13,2545.555,Right.
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2545.555,2554.51,But you still think they should be liable for damages when the Department said they were not going to enforce the position that you're articulating.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2554.51,2557.57,Our position is that the defense may indeed preclude that.
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2557.57,2569.705,"Well, I know, but I'm asking -- so in other words, they may not succeed in their Portal-to-Portal Act defense, but you nonetheless think when the Department says, we're not going to enforce the view, that they're liable for damages because they didn't take the opposite view."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2569.705,2572.895,We are willing to concede the pre-2011 damages.
2015.15-415,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2572.895,2579.09,Is that at this point or is that clear from your -- has that been your position all along?
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2579.09,2581.19,It's never been pleaded or proved.
2015.15-415,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2581.19,2582.36,This hasn't been litigated at all.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2582.36,2583.525,It hasn't been litigated.
2015.15-415,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2583.525,2586.6,We're dealing with the threshold issue of how do we categorize these people.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2586.6,2586.98,Yes.
2015.15-415,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2586.98,2601.62,"And on that, do you know -- I had asked Mr. Clement -- what is the universe of employees we're talking about? How many of these people would not come out under the -- what is it, 701(i) because they are commissioned employees?"
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2601.62,2610.27,"Well, there's a wide range of compensation methods; however, the -- most of the -- the range of salaries we're talking about is a broad dispersion."
2015.15-415,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2681.535,2691.98,I'd feel more comfortable about this if I understood the criteria that Congress applied in choosing the employees who are covered by this provision.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2710.3,2716.08,"The understanding of Congress, as discussed in our brief, was that salesmen are selling anywhere they go."
2015.15-415,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2735.13,2735.86,The salesman --
2015.15-415,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2735.86,2737.575,All of that was true --
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2737.575,2738.75,I'm sorry.
2015.15-415,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2740.41,2742.25,All of that was true in 1966.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2752.76,2753.77,May I answer?
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2753.77,2755.82,"Yes, and then Justice Sotomayor has a question."
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2755.82,2766.815,"Yes. If the universe of employees who meet the exemption now has shrunk so it's narrower than the original purposes, that is a reason for Congress to repeal or restrict it."
2015.15-415,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2770.83,2773.67,It was more of Justice Alito's.
2015.15-415,1,41097,stephanos_bibas,,2784.545,2788.22,"Congress, the Senate discussed that expressly in the '60s."
2015.15-415,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2790.0,2802.935,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang."
2015.15-415,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2802.935,2808.89,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address three points, as well as answer some additional questions."
2015.15-415,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3138.01,3147.169,"Mr. Yang, why was it -- I mean, for the most part this explanation seems like not the world's best explanation to me but perfectly adequate."
2015.15-415,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3165.345,3173.535,"Well, we don't have this in the record, but I have been informed that there was an inadvertent mistake in drafting."
2015.15-415,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3176.63,3176.86,Wow.
2015.15-415,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3180.755,3190.3,"It was inadvertent, but it doesn't make a difference, and I'll explain why. The prior (c)4 -- they -- they redid (c)1, 2, and 3, and they just didn't reprint 4 because it hadn't changed at all."
2015.15-415,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3194.5,3197.73,Not an A-plus explanation. (Laughter.)
2015.15-415,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3197.73,3207.47,"It's a passing grade. But what I would say is in (c)4, before -- this is reproduced on page 6a of the appendix to our brief."
2015.15-415,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3265.67,3273.43,"Now, that's -- maybe this problem in my mind will go away, but I -- I'm with you up to a large point."
2015.15-415,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3299.69,3300.26,Right.
2015.15-415,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3300.26,3306.57,And so the real question is don't they have to address this?
2015.15-415,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3306.57,3307.22,"Well, they do have --"
2015.15-415,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3307.22,3324.63,"Well, do they? I mean, you know, I guess I could -- I'll read that again and -- and try to see do they really address it, and -- but that's where I'm having a problem. And it isn't just -- he's quite right, your colleague, where he says this isn't just a simple reversal of a regulation."
2015.15-415,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3339.555,3340.82,"Well, not --"
2015.15-415,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3340.82,3345.505,"This is the problem, because after all, different administrations have different policies."
2015.15-415,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3357.41,3362.85,"I think what's necessary is for the agency to recognize that it had a prior position, which it did here."
2015.15-415,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3378.18,3378.73,No.
2015.15-415,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3378.86,3379.25,I don't think --
2015.15-415,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3379.25,3381.15,Because I don't think either would be wrong.
2015.15-415,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3387.05,3387.14,Right.
2015.15-415,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3387.14,3392.395,"-- going long with the other, why now do we think that was a mistake?"
2015.15-415,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3392.395,3406.38,"I think you can -- you can -- if that were a requirement, we don't think it's necessary. But if it were, you could easily see the answer by reading the -- the 1978 opinion letter in conjunction -- if I can follow -- finish."
2015.15-415,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.79,3425.275,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.15-415,2,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3425.275,3426.34,Thank you.
2015.15-415,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3426.34,3429.625,"Mr. Clement, four minutes."
2015.15-415,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3429.625,3438.755,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Just a few points in rebuttal, starting right where Justice Breyer and my friend from the SG's office left off."
2015.15-415,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3545.79,3548.2,So is it okay if we just send it back?
2015.15-415,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3548.2,3549.08,Sure.
2015.15-415,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3552.42,3554.685,They've already conceded there's not.
2015.15-415,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3556.59,3557.07,"No, no."
2015.15-415,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3666.5,3672.795,"Because they would be exempt to the extent they paid on commission which, as I understand it, most of them --"
2015.15-415,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3672.795,3674.09,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.15-415,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3719.88,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
