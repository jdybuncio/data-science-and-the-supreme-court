1966.87,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,14.901,"Julian Bond et al., Appellants, versus James Floyd et al."
1966.87,0,27565,howard_moore_jr,,18.193,22.473,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.87,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,141.434,142.711,"A worker, what?"
1966.87,0,27565,howard_moore_jr,,142.711,149.544,A worker sir with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee known variously and popularly as SNCC.
1966.87,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,220.981,222.0,137?
1966.87,0,27565,howard_moore_jr,,222.0,225.215,Yes sir.
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,707.303,711.294,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,841.87,847.037,"There's no question as a matter of fact that the statement was contrary to national policy, (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,847.037,852.919,I supposed the statement can be said to be contrary to what the Government position is in the particular matter.
1966.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,852.919,853.914,Contemporary national policy.
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,853.914,854.515,Yes.
1966.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,858.386,859.41,Is of course another question.
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,859.41,861.768,-- is quite right.
1966.87,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1025.338,1060.471,"Mr. Boudin, supposed a person were elected to the Board -- to the legislature though -- and he had publicly advocated of the overthrow of the Government of Georgia and its replacement by a communist government or by a military dictatorship or whatever, extreme example or alternatively occurs to your mind, where were that leave the problem as a matter of principle?"
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1060.471,1078.112,"We would say that as a matter of principle, subject to of course prosecution for a crime with the usual elements of due process in criminal cases that the Georgia legislature could not exclude Mr. Bond or any other person."
1966.87,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1083.207,1083.716,"Yes, I understand."
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1083.716,1110.221,"-- despite the -- its not necessary but our position here which -- is that there is an absolute right on the part of the legislator elect to say anything he wishes and not to be disqualified, subject of course to criminal prosecution and as -- and if they're appropriate to a libel suit assuming that the Court were -- were to hold that libel suit did not violate the First Amendment as it has."
1966.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1151.479,1153.891,Under what amendment is the freedom of the franchise or (Voice Overlap)?
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1153.891,1160.19,"Well, the freedom of the franchise so far as this Court is concerned has so far having developed only into the Equal Protection Clause."
1966.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1160.19,1163.072,I'm about -- I'm talking about the constitution.
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1163.072,1163.441,Of the constitution --
1966.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1163.441,1165.077,Under what part of the constitution?
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1165.077,1167.966,Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1212.923,1215.191,I don't quite get your idea.
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1219.29,1227.171,"No, I think that there is a sufficient standard in what this Court has said under the Equal Protection Clause in the Reynolds against Sims case and in the other cases."
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1227.171,1228.491,So why isn't that enough?
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1228.491,1230.229,I think it is enough.
1966.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1230.229,1232.236,But that's an equal protection --
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1232.236,1233.232,That is quite right and in this --
1966.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1233.232,1241.325,"-- criterion, that has nothing to do with the freedom of the franchise in any way equivalent to the freedom of speech guaranteed expressly by the First Amendment, is it?"
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1241.325,1251.428,Except that the Equal Protection Clause has been used by this Court specifically and repeatedly in recent days as the means of guaranteeing freedom of the franchise.
1966.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1251.428,1258.108,"Well, equality but not freedom of the franchise in any way equivalent to free speech or for -- or free press, is it --"
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1258.108,1258.46,"Oh, I can't --"
1966.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1258.46,1260.637,-- which is guaranteed by the constitution.
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1260.637,1264.694,It is true that there is an explicit statement in the constitution with respect to freedom of speech.
1966.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1264.694,1268.74,"Well, that's rather -- an important difference because there isn't one about freedom of the franchise."
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1268.74,1275.027,"It is a difference but I think the Equal Protection Clause also guarantee although it doesn't say so, freedom of the franchise and to eliminate --"
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1275.027,1278.381,You mean as to freedom to vote?
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1278.381,1278.501,The free --
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1278.501,1285.654,You mean that the federal constitution provides that they -- every state in the union must have elections to elect people and perhaps to vote.
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1285.654,1286.494,No.
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1298.509,1299.288,When they vote?
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1299.288,1300.287,"When they vote, right."
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1300.526,1302.112,Is that equal protection?
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1302.112,1305.638,That is equal protection and that's what we are relying upon here.
1966.87,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1480.436,1484.053,"So, if the constitution that's done that, the Courts have been the instrument?"
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1484.053,1485.389,"Yes, of course."
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1515.811,1517.757,Why do you say that?
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1517.757,1531.834,"Because this Court has said that in the area of the regulation of property, the standard -- to protect the standard for the individual will not be as great as where the First Amendment right is involved?"
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1531.834,1534.089,Why did -- you put your case to the --
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1534.089,1539.216,West Virginia against Barnette.
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1539.216,1549.612,"You mean that the constitutional acquired property is protected by the constitution, that protection of the property which is accorded there would be less than in the event that First --"
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1549.612,1551.85,"No, I guess I have misstated it."
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1569.248,1571.924,"(Voice Overlap) it would be after the constitution, wouldn't it?"
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1573.147,1575.908,"Yes, because the constitution as an explicit First Amendment provision --"
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1575.908,1581.339,As certain principles with relevance to property and certain principles with reference to the First.
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1581.339,1583.181,"That is correct, that's what I meant."
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1583.181,1586.33,And it happens to be more to the reference first.
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1586.33,1587.166,It has to be more --
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1587.166,1587.294,(Inaudible)
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1587.294,1587.972,-- in the sense that there is a First Amendment --
1966.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1587.972,1589.781,(Inaudible)
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1589.781,1590.925,-- which explicitly.
1966.87,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1769.504,1782.506,"Mr. Boudin, you are (Voice Overlap), don't rely at all on Section 4, Article 4 of the Constitution, the obligation of the United States to guarantee to the states a republican form of Government."
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1782.506,1782.627,We have them --
1966.87,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1782.627,1784.236,"That's not in your brief, is it?"
1966.87,1,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,1784.236,1795.489,"We have not argued that in our brief Your Honor, in view of the frequent statements by the Court on that subject, and because we don't think it necessary to press the issue."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3443.73,3450.714,"Mr. Chief Justice, Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States."
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3617.458,3619.219,That is the newly elected assembly?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3619.219,3619.981,Yes sir.
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3621.746,3628.329,Does that mean this recent one go to the newly elected assembly that was -- he was elected last year?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3628.329,3633.255,"No sir, there has been no contest to his election on --"
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3633.255,3635.646,The second action you said was a committee recommendation.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3635.646,3636.758,Yes Your Honor.
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3636.758,3641.99,And this -- is that recommendation was to be acted upon by the legislator elected last Tuesday?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3641.99,3643.106,Yes sir.
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3643.106,3645.077,This may or may not include Mr. Bond?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3645.077,3648.437,"Yes sir, that's right."
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3648.437,3652.694,"Well, has he been exuded for two of his terms or (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3652.694,3656.779,He was excluded for the term upon which this suit is predicated.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3657.192,3658.313,Was this the first one?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3658.313,3659.002,Yes.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3663.515,3663.877,Yes.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3663.877,3668.532,Mr. Bond ran and was overwhelmingly reelected.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3668.532,3669.357,When was that?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3669.357,3675.01,"That was this year March, the legislature was in recess, a special (Voice Overlap)"
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3675.01,3676.364,March of what year?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3676.364,3677.226,Sir?
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3677.226,3677.898,March of what year?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3677.898,3679.482,March of 1966.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3679.482,3680.483,1966?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3680.483,3681.197,Yes sir.
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3692.17,3695.593,"Well Mr. Attorney General, I'm a little confused about this."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3700.332,3700.69,It will be --
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3700.69,3701.716,Or will be on January --
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3701.716,3702.52,Yes sir.
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3702.52,3713.737,"Well, what action can the legislature -- the newly elected legislature take in respect of his being seated in the legislature that no longer exists."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3713.737,3726.571,"Whatever it determines Your Honor, if I understand the reason that he ran was to be able to serve on committees during the recess of the legislature."
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3734.326,3742.8,Well I can't even see what the newly convened legislature can now do about his being seated in the legislature which no longer exists.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3742.8,3744.656,They cannot.
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3744.656,3751.868,"Well then, is this recommendation then to -- have any relation to his election last Tuesday?"
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3751.868,3755.142,"You mean the recommendation of the legislature this year, this committee?"
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3757.815,3769.817,Well I must say then I don't understand what possible action the newly elected legislature can take in this recommendation.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3769.817,3777.605,"The newly elected legislature, if the time -- if his qualification to our challenge they may or may not be challenged."
1966.87,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3781.356,3789.441,Did Mr. Bond show up after the special election and offered to take the oath of office?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3789.441,3792.25,I would presume yes sir that he did present himself.
1966.87,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3792.25,3795.251,And permission was refused?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3795.251,3796.396,Yes sir.
1966.87,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3796.396,3796.871,So that that is --
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3796.871,3797.392,I think that --
1966.87,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3797.392,3799.311,-- official state action?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3799.311,3800.31,That is correct.
1966.87,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3800.31,3809.279,"So that as of now, with respect to Mr. Bond's second election, that is the special election, we have a closed book."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3823.223,3829.712,"I think you are correct Your Honor, yes sir."
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3841.288,3849.553,What do you understand the word qualification to mean in your constitution?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3849.553,3871.028,"I understand the word qualifications, may it please the Court, to mean the qualifications imposed in the Georgia constitution and also the qualification imposed by Article VI, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution."
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3871.028,3877.035,Does either one of those includes a disqualification on account of views?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3877.035,3881.908,No sir.
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3910.23,3915.219,And as if it would require a trial in order to determine the constitution?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3915.219,3916.805,Any in the Georgia constitution?
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3916.805,3920.374,"Yes, any qualification as it requires a trial."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3920.374,3930.572,Nothing except the qualification as contained in the Georgia constitution Your Honor that he'd be bound to support the constitution of the United States.
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3930.572,3931.549,So that's all?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3931.549,3932.058,Yes sir.
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3932.058,3934.055,Anything about good character?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3934.055,3936.271,No sir.
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3936.271,3938.321,So that you really have --
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3938.321,3938.951,We have --
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3938.951,3942.989,-- very nominal qualification.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3942.989,3951.316,"I would think that with the qualification of Article VI, Clause 3 of the Federal Constitution, we do have nominal qualifications."
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3954.853,3956.043,Did they say that?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3956.043,3957.324,Yes sir.
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3957.324,3958.75,He can't owe money to the State.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3958.75,3959.899,"That's right, cannot be indebted to the --"
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3959.899,3961.042,Well that -- that's not involved here?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3961.042,3962.766,"That is not involved here, no sir."
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3962.766,3967.068,Is there anyone that is involved here?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,3967.068,3997.277,"The Court please, the qualifications contained in the Federal Constitution, Article VI, Clause 3 which requires that a state legislator be bound to support the constitution of the United States because of a -- the supremacy clause of the U.S. constitution, we think to be a paramount qualifications."
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3997.277,4010.601,You don't think do you that that was a -- to be construed as meaning or the man swears he will never express any views hostiles to Government policy.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4010.601,4018.783,"No sir, I think that it'd be construction of course, it's up to this Court to construe that provision of the constitution."
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4043.912,4054.782,"But of course the number of the judiciary are they -- not the judiciary, the legislative body, do express their views, they have vigorously against policies of the Government?"
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4054.782,4055.716,Yes sir.
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4055.716,4059.853,"So that you can't be taken to -- forbid that, can they?"
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4059.853,4065.017,"No sir, I don't think it can be taken to forbid the expression of views."
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4073.344,4074.472,Legislature can what?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4074.472,4080.29,Can hear evidence for the purpose of determining qualifications.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4080.29,4085.484,As to mean whether the legislature agrees with the views --
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4085.484,4085.829,Well I don't --
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4085.829,4087.046,-- expressed.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4087.046,4098.733,The Court knows I can't state that nearly because the legislature merely disagreed with the views of a member who was being seated that he could not be seated.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4125.45,4130.919,"Yes, but there's a question Mr. Attorney General as to what being bound to support means."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4130.919,4131.426,Yes sir and --
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4131.426,4146.216,"Would you say for a moment that a legislature -- a legislator is being unfaithful to his oath if he says, ""I think the First Amendment should be amended."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4148.283,4149.124,No sir.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4149.124,4150.174,Do you think he is -- did you think (Voice Overlap) --
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4150.174,4150.859,Because his advocating that --
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4150.859,4151.703,That because I think (Voice Overlap) --
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4151.703,4155.055,He is advocating an amendment of the law within the framework of the constitution.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4155.055,4156.545,So you could disagree.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4161.625,4162.6,Yes sir.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4164.755,4179.868,"So that -- if we are really we're saying then that the -- that Mr. Bond could state his views in opposition to policy, to the policy of the constitution or the policy of the law of the United States?"
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4181.004,4183.023,Yes I think Mr. Bond can state his views.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4183.023,4191.484,"But you would say I suppose that if he said, ""I will not obey the constitution"", that is a wholly different matter?"
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4191.484,4192.011,Yes sir.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4192.24,4196.796,Do you suggest that that what's he said?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4196.796,4198.23,I am not trying --
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4198.23,4199.853,"Well, not (Inaudible) --"
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4199.853,4200.184,Excuse me.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4200.184,4204.276,Do you suggest that that is what he said that he will not obey the constitution?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4204.276,4208.795,"Yes sir, I think he advocated violation of the laws."
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4208.795,4211.51,Although he himself denies that that's what he said.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4211.51,4227.066,What language do you point to in this -- in what he said to arrive at that opinion?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4227.066,4259.057,Mr. Bond stated as set out in the opinion that he would advocate it that those who violate -- anyone violate the Selective Service Act for any reason which they saw fit.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4259.057,4263.176,But let's see where it -- just what he said that's rather important.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4263.176,4264.471,Alright sir.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4264.471,4267.062,You know just what he said.

1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4374.969,4378.147,Is that all you rely on?

1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4378.926,4391.196,Is that all that you rely on to say that he advocated violation of the law and disobedience to the constitution?
1966.87,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4391.196,4392.184,How about the statements --
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4392.184,4393.487,That --
1966.87,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4393.487,4395.956,-- the SNCC statement on 137?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4408.393,4410.85,The -- let me explain to the Court.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4419.949,4422.511,"He didn't write that, did he?"
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4422.511,4439.636,"No sir, he didn't write it but he was -- publicity and I don't think he is -- I think if the evidence is uncontradicted that he was a Student -- I mean he was the publicity direct for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee."
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4439.636,4441.211,Well he said specifically that he endorsed it.
1966.87,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4441.211,4442.189,A what?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4442.189,4442.351,Yes.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4442.351,4443.007,Agreed with it.

1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4444.373,4444.457,Yes.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4444.457,4445.585,-- it was read to him --
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4445.585,4449.28,There's no issue that -- what he -- under -- that he endorsed (Voice Overlap) --
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4449.28,4452.846,He endorsed it and said he reaffirmed his endorsement of it at the hearing.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4452.846,4455.157,"Yes, he stated his reasons why he endorsed it."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4455.157,4456.804,Yes.
1966.87,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4457.543,4476.408,Would it be constitutional if Georgia or any other state put it in its constitution a provision that no one should be qualified to seat in the state legislature if they were opposed to the national foreign policy?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4476.408,4480.5,They were opposed to the national foreign policy.
1966.87,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4484.999,4492.805,What are the constitutional for the state put in this constitutional provision that nobody should be seated who is a pacifist?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4492.805,4495.94,"Obviously sir, I think the same reason therewith."
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4495.94,4496.693,To think what?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4496.693,4499.009,I think the same reasoning would apply there.
1966.87,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4499.009,4499.74,There was not?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4499.74,4500.148,Yes sir.
1966.87,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4501.689,4506.095,Or a socialist?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4506.095,4510.921,"The same reason, yes sir."
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4551.989,4552.492,Before this?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4552.492,4553.368,-- why?
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4553.368,4554.762,(Inaudible)
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4554.762,4564.386,The qualification that an elected representative be bound to support the constitution of the United States.
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4564.386,4566.663,Be bound to say it?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4566.663,4567.735,"I think, --"
1966.87,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4567.735,4567.805,Bound to say (Voice Overlap) --
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4567.805,4576.953,"-- he would be bound to say it and he would be, if he -- please the Court, that that would be a qualification that he possessed at that time that he said."
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4652.276,4669.477,"Mr. Attorney General, a while ago you said that the different with government policy and the policy of the constitution, with purpose is permissible that a man shouldn't be excluded from the legislature for that reason, just for disagreement."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4669.477,4670.374,That's right sir.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4670.374,4674.816,"But that you have thought there was advocacy, a violation of the law (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4674.816,4675.859,Yes sir.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4675.859,4677.764,-- or of the constitution.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4706.661,4708.258,No sir.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4719.072,4731.914,"Well, do you think that -- do you think the legislature excluded him because they thought he advocated the breaking of the law and that they didn't believe his disavowal?"
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4747.287,4750.834,One of the reasons Your Honor.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4751.945,4759.256,Well then -- you have to then say the legislature found that he -- didn't believe him on his disavowal?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4759.256,4770.98,I would have to say that the legislature in hearing the evidence in judging his qualifications found that he would not qualify to be bound to support the constitution.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4770.98,4771.752,"Well, he did say in so many words."
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4771.752,4775.565,"Well, I know but -- I do not advocate that people should break laws."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4775.565,4776.845,"Yes sir, he did say that."
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4778.179,4781.458,So then why isn't Justice White's question pertinent?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4785.571,4786.826,Well --
1966.87,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4786.826,4793.815,You've already said that that support to constitution doesn't mean that I will not disagree.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4793.815,4793.859,You've already --
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4793.859,4794.455,Of course.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4794.455,4803.725,"I mean the -- the gloss you put on that is that -- what it means is that the man will not abide by the constitution, would disobey it."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4803.725,4806.079,That's right.
1966.87,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4806.079,4807.302,"Now he says, I don't mean that."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4810.374,4814.919,I think that was for evidence for the House to consider.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4814.919,4828.91,"General, you have told us that you're relying on the section of the constitution which requires every state legislator to take the oath to support the constitution of the United States."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4843.393,4844.771,No sir.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4886.957,4887.749,My question --
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4887.749,4887.788,Yes.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4887.788,4915.395,"-- to you is that do you -- that section, if an elected officer is willing to and offers to take that oath, is there anything in the constitution of the United States that authorizes anyone under any circumstances, to pass upon his sincerity in taking that oath?"
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4915.395,4919.527,"Not in the United States Constitution sir, except in that (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4919.527,4933.395,And then I would like to know why -- how you jump from that to the fact that the legislature of Georgia has a right to test the sincerity of this man in taking that oath?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4933.395,4935.39,"Well, may it please the Court."
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4937.488,4937.703,Certainly.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4937.703,4948.569,"But we -- of course this -- he was -- one of the allegation, one of the challenge unopposed stated that he was not qualified under this provision of the U.S. Constitution and --"
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4948.569,4949.885,Who said that?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4949.885,4953.766,One of the challenges to Mr. Bond's being seated.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4955.236,4967.501,"You mean, he judged that the -- he passed judgment on Mr. Bond to the effect that Mr. Bond would not -- was not sincere in taking that oath."
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4967.501,4968.895,"I think that would be a fair statement, yes sir."
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4968.895,4970.099,Alright.
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4970.099,4970.983,I think it would be.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4984.969,4998.456,"But now what -- you told us that there is nothing in the Georgia Constitution that directly confers with his taking the oath, have you not?"
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,4998.456,5017.989,The provision of the Georgia Constitution itself which the oath proscribes in the constitution requires to a person to be bound to support the constitution of the State of Georgia and of the United States.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5017.989,5035.892,"Well, I will -- I asked you the same question then about the Georgia Constitution, is there anything in it that which authorizes anyone to pass upon the sincerity of a person who takes the oath as prescribed by the constitution?"
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,5035.892,5037.819,Not in those words Your Honor.
1966.87,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5037.819,5055.269,Well then where -- what do you refer to in the Georgia Constitution that authorizes -- the legislature to pass upon the sincerity of this man in his willingness to take the oath?
1966.87,2,15481,arthur_k_bolton,,5055.269,5060.468,"So the only thing that I can assume -- I hope we understand, the legislature acts independently."
1966.87,3,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,6334.542,6334.866,Thank you.
1966.87,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6336.67,6337.985,Very well.
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6337.985,6338.673,If it please the Court.
1966.87,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6346.39,6347.511,116?
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6347.511,6348.121,Yes sir.
1966.87,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6386.425,6390.993,"Or then he went on to say that I cannot personally participate in the war, no more."
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6390.993,6395.708,"Yes sir, he reiterate it, his pacifist beliefs at that point."
1966.87,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6395.708,6396.767,He reiterated what?
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6396.767,6400.71,"His pacifist beliefs, his own objections to war."
1966.87,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6415.273,6419.374,(Inaudible)
1966.87,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6419.374,6421.25,There are bills proposed or there any (Voice Overlap) --
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6421.25,6422.245,"The -- and their right, our (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.87,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6422.245,6430.65,"Our Selective Service law, a person doesn't have a right to say, ""Well, I'd rather in the Peace Corps if the Selective Service Act (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6430.65,6434.192,"There is alternative service, the Peace Corps is one I think that this statement (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.87,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6434.192,6436.046,"Not under present law, is there?"
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6436.046,6437.695,Yes sir.
1966.87,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6437.695,6442.128,That what it seems to me.
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6442.128,6443.871,Under the conscientious objective statute (Voice Overlap) --
1966.87,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6443.871,6445.674,Oh yes.
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6445.674,6446.377,The other point --
1966.87,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6446.377,6453.795,"Well, what basis would Mr. Bond can -- if he were drafted then saying, ""I will not go""?"
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6453.795,6457.993,His own beliefs would be the only basis.
1966.87,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6466.055,6469.768,Could you think he could refuse to go to war and still not break the law?
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6469.768,6473.006,Well he'd had to be convicted and that would be a different thing.
1966.87,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6473.202,6474.708,"Well, what I mean --"
1966.87,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6474.708,6477.003,(Inaudible)
1966.87,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6477.003,6482.116,He could be -- he could not go off to war and still be obeying the law?
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6482.116,6486.316,But he could select one of the alternative services.
1966.87,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6497.866,6505.73,"Well Mr. Justice Clark just suggested, is a pacifist, he could claim this (Inaudible), wouldn't he?"
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6505.73,6506.57,Yes sir.
1966.87,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6506.57,6510.282,"And that would solve that problem, wouldn't it?"
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6510.282,6512.302,"That would be adequate, yes sir."
1966.87,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6512.572,6514.691,Did he indicate (Inaudible)?
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6514.691,6517.064,He did indicate that he was a pacifist.
1966.87,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6517.064,6521.738,"No, but did he indicate anywhere that he would serve or thought he should say --"
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6521.738,6523.394,That's not indicated by the record.
1966.87,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6523.394,6524.553,And he in effect --
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6524.553,6524.804,No sir.
1966.87,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6537.98,6542.37,"Well, he pretty much indicated that he would not participate in the war."
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6544.888,6546.971,There's no question about that.
1966.87,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6548.698,6559.004,"Well, then wouldn't he -- in order not to -- he wouldn't participate in the war, he would have to have some other recognized excuses for not going."
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6562.411,6567.78,"Not necessarily, not under the decision of this Court in the Siegel (ph) case but -- perhaps it have --"
1966.87,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6567.78,6569.61,Perhaps it has anything to do with religion?
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6569.61,6575.039,It would have to have some religious training and belief but not necessarily a belief in the Supreme Being.
1966.87,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6575.85,6578.295,Still has to be on a religious basis?
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6578.295,6580.081,Some religious influence on the decision.
1966.87,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6584.561,6584.963,More than --
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6584.963,6586.394,"-- well, as to religious belief."
1966.87,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6586.394,6589.017,More than conscience?
1966.87,4,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6589.017,6599.764,"But that does -- didn't the draft clause permit a registrant to say, ""Well, I will serve in the public health service or the forestry service"", or these others?"
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6599.764,6602.728,That's my understanding of the law sir.
1966.87,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6602.728,6618.135,"But as I understand his statement, it seems to me like the firm authorize a statement, he is against that law, he didn't want to have anything to do with it."
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6636.05,6639.645,I don't quite understand the question but I'm not defending on that ground.
1966.87,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6646.443,6650.865,I rather thought his statement sounded like he is proud of his views.
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6650.865,6651.872,Yes sir.
1966.87,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6651.872,6653.407,(Inaudible)
1966.87,4,27565,howard_moore_jr,,6653.407,6672.286,"If I may move on to the note which we'd like to conclude, is that the State, the respondents construe Article VI provision with respect to the oath to be synonymous with support of the Government or support of a particular administration."
