1983.83-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.983,We will hear arguments next in United States against Karo.
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,76.953,84.638,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit."
1983.83-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,213.821,216.085,"Let me back you up a moment, Mr. Frey."
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,228.423,238.654,"It was placed with the consent of the owner at that time, although of course it was known that it was going to be delivered to other persons in the future, but at the time there was consent."
1983.83-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,255.601,261.1,"Mr. Frey, supposing you carried that to a more extreme situation."
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,284.981,288.26,"No, I don't think the logic would be much different."
1983.83-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,316.874,317.156,Not the installation.
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,317.156,326.387,I don't see how without the monitoring you have either a search or a seizure that is regulated by the Fourth Amendment.
1983.83-850,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,375.117,385.3,"Does that mean, Mr. Frey, that it would also be precisely the same issue if after he purchased the tie the government installed the beeper?"
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,385.3,392.813,"Well, it might be necessary at that point for them to seize his property or search his property."
1983.83-850,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,392.813,398.81,"Well, he checked his coat in a cloakroom somewhere, and they stuck the beeper in the coat while it was in the cloakroom."
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,402.278,404.575,I think that would be essentially the same issue.
1983.83-850,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.494,449.569,I am just trying to isolate the issue.
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,456.365,468.0,"Well, I don't see how the... unless the installation is itself a search or seizure that might violate the Fourth Amendment rights of the individual, then I fail to understand--"
1983.83-850,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,468.0,470.625,--Supposing they put a microphone on the tie.
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,473.795,474.435,--Not until they listened to it.
1983.83-850,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,815.782,819.249,"Mr. Frey, was the beeper actually put in evidence in the case?"
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,819.249,823.058,"I'm not sure that it was, and I don't rely on any conclusions."
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.821,938.531,"In this respect, Mr. Frey, when you say it is really just a substitute for the human eye, could this can be taken out of a house and put in a car in a manner that could not have been visually detected from the sky or from--"
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,938.531,947.917,"Well, I suspect it could, and I do plan to get to that when I talk about the question of whether this case is like or unlike Knotts, but I think--"
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,947.917,956.851,--So that you would say that we should judge the case as though this beeper had been put in... a little tiny beeper had been put into something that could go into somebody's pocket.
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,956.851,969.221,"--Well, I am not sure that you should do that, although I think at the end of the conceptual analysis I probably would say that, but here we are dealing with a five-gallon container of ether that--"
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,969.221,973.892,"But it is something that somebody could put in or take out of a house without your knowing it, without your being able to see it."
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,973.892,976.125,--It would be possible for them to do that.
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.03,982.699,But you wouldn't know whether the can was in the car or not.
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,982.699,984.355,"--Well, I will--"
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.355,986.042,All right.
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,987.307,988.745,--Yes.
1983.83-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,988.745,996.335,"Mr. Frey, on this particular point, I assume that considerable time was made in preparing for this whole thing by the government."
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,996.335,997.632,Yes.
1983.83-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,997.632,998.21,Right?
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1003.895,1008.893,"Well, they could have, and they did, and the warrant happened to be no good in this case."
1983.83-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1040.396,1041.567,You mean they couldn't trust a federal judge?
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1041.567,1067.993,"Well, I think their concern, and I think this is a concern which this Court has not visited, and maybe one day a case will arise about what the appropriate procedures are for protecting the identity of a confidential informant where at some point down the road there is likely to be disclosure to defendants in the event a criminal case comes, for instance, of the contents of an affidavit for a search warrant."
1983.83-850,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1136.856,1140.058,"Mr. Frey, I am still a little confused about the argument."
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1156.756,1157.973,"No, of course it does."
1983.83-850,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1157.973,1158.895,--of need for a warrant?
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1158.895,1164.157,"No, of course it does, and that was... I thought... I tried to make that point in response to Justice Stevens."
1983.83-850,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1174.341,1179.355,"And there was an entry in someone's property here, but you had consent at the time?"
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1179.355,1181.855,"Well, that's correct, yes."
1983.83-850,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1181.855,1182.386,That is your position?
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1182.386,1186.259,It was not any of the respondents' property at the time it was entered.
1983.83-850,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1186.259,1206.892,"But you would think that someone could... that you could install with consent of the storekeeper a beeper in clothing that is to be sold to someone else, and that that initial consent would suffice thereafter?"
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1206.892,1232.991,"I don't think the action would be a search or a seizure that is regulated by the Fourth Amendment, and I don't think it would have any evidentiary fruits unless the beeper were listened to, but I certainly agree that if we have to go into somebody's private property for purposes of installing a beeper, as in the Dalia case where an entry had to be made for purposes of installing the bug, that, of course, is a search, and unless there is a warrant that authorizes it, it would be invalid."
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1354.489,1360.378,"Well, Knotts might get you into the first... might warrant your tracking the--"
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1360.378,1361.408,--We track it to the first house.
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.408,1363.408,"--to the first house, but from there on--"
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1363.408,1366.282,And then if we don't have a beeper we station an agent outside the first house.
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.282,1366.905,--Yes.
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1366.905,1375.932,"And the agent, incidentally, knows as much as the beeper tells us about the presence of the containers on or in the property."
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.932,1376.917,He knows that the can is in that house.
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1376.917,1378.18,Or in the vicinity.
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.274,1385.585,He knows validly or he is entitled to know that it is either in the house or close by.
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1385.585,1389.146,"--He is entitled to know that, and he is entitled to watch the house."
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1397.877,1399.595,"Yes, but he doesn't know that--"
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1399.595,1400.767,"Well, that is all right."
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1400.767,1404.094,"--Any automobile that leaves, he doesn't know whether the can is in it or not."
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1404.094,1426.068,"He may not know without the beeper, but he can follow or agents can follow every one of them until finally one of them arrives at the laboratory site where by other observations they are able to determine that there is probable cause to conduct a conventional search and to secure a warrant."
1983.83-850,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1450.278,1452.87,"Well, Mr. Frey, let me cut you off there if I may."
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1457.977,1459.055,"--Oh, absolutely, and I--"
1983.83-850,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1459.055,1464.397,"That if you didn't have a beeper, they would drive a lot of cars in and out, and you wouldn't know which one the can is in."
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1464.397,1469.114,"--No, but you see, the argument that is being made to which I am responding is not quite a conceptual argument."
1983.83-850,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.84,1494.853,And there may be 35 trucks that pull in and out before you know which one you want to follow.
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1494.853,1495.056,There may be.
1983.83-850,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1506.833,1509.128,"But you know which one to follow, which you wouldn't know visually."
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1512.128,1536.258,"--Oh, of course we are doing something... we are doing something terribly useful, but the point that I am making here is that what Knotts said was the fact that we are more efficient, even a great deal more efficient in doing what we could otherwise do through surveillance of the public streets and highways does not affect the Fourth Amendment inquiry as to whether you have a search."
1983.83-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1536.258,1553.267,"There was a reference a few minutes ago, Mr. Frey, to the fact that if you put hundreds of agents on it, if you had hundreds of agents, which in theory and probably in practice you could do if it was a big enough drug operation, you could follow every one of the 35 cars 24 hours a day."
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1553.267,1554.844,In theory we could do that.
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1554.844,1557.827,"That doesn't get you into the second house, Mr. Frey."
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1557.827,1559.108,But what... but we are not--
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.108,1565.215,Suppose you follow six trucks and they go to different houses.
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1588.971,1593.141,"--Well, it is possible that that is true."
1983.83-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.55,1668.627,If you have probable cause.
1983.83-850,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1668.627,1671.439,If we have probable cause.
1983.83-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1772.24,1778.956,Very well.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,1783.299,1806.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at the oral argument in this Court's prior beeper case of United States versus Knotts, Justice O'Connor asked Alexander Frey of the Solicitor General's office whether a beeper which pinpointed an object in a barrel inside the premises was a search."
1983.83-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.237,1870.888,"Well, but don't you agree that under Knotts, under the theory of Knotts, you could legally know that the... at least that the object you were tracking had arrived at a particular house, the first house?"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,1882.898,1885.397,--Unless the installation was unlawful.
1983.83-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.397,1886.053,"Yes, I understand."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,1886.053,1889.443,"If the installation was lawful, you could see it."
1983.83-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1889.443,1890.115,Yes.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,1890.115,1894.597,I don't believe that that is the case in this particular instance.
1983.83-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.312,1906.342,"No, but could they have?"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,1906.342,1917.963,"It is perhaps possible, perhaps possible not, because they seem to be following a car which they find out later did not have the cans in it, and then later discover--"
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1917.963,1919.322,"That is just human error, though, isn't it?"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,1920.994,1922.696,--Yes.
1983.83-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.538,1943.499,"Yes, but if you could have... you possibly could have seen, if you had been following the right car visually, you possibly could have seen the can arrive at the first house, but from there on it is another question."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,1943.499,1951.106,"Yes, but I think that even as... like I said, the record here, we are not... it is not clear whether they saw it arrive at the first house."
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1959.556,1962.352,"Let me try a hypothetical on you, Mr. Roberts."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2024.201,2025.014,Yes.
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2025.014,2027.825,What do you say about that invasion?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2030.152,2031.387,"Yes, and in fact--"
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2031.387,2033.339,Put a man right in your operation.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2033.339,2051.894,"--That is true, but as Mr. Frey said in the oral argument in Knotts, one can suspect a disloyal agent or a disloyal friend, and one is held to suspect that, but one does not suspect a disloyal can or a disloyal wristwatch or whatever."
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2059.703,2084.287,"That potential for suspicion is certainly there, but that is a human judgment to be made by the people in this enterprise, but now the undercover man is in the operation part-time in and out, and by walkie-talkie and other means he is communicating with the agents all the time, and he is not suspected."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2092.018,2093.626,"--No, Your Honor."
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2101.468,2105.418,Even though he in effect is a concealed beeper himself?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2105.418,2120.131,"Yes, Your Honor, but it is just the fact that there is no... that there just really isn't a reasonable expectation of privacy, and I think the government will admit this, or did it in Knotts, that one would think that every object that one has is working for the government."
1983.83-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2126.691,2136.454,"If I were you, I wouldn't operate on the theory that there is not an electronic device that can tell when a beeper is around."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2136.454,2143.529,There perhaps could be those devices one day and whatever.
1983.83-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2143.529,2145.949,"No, it is in existence now."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2145.949,2151.338,But in briefly stating the position of the respondents--
1983.83-850,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2151.338,2167.753,"Mr. Roberts, I gather that the information that this type of beeper gave was only a general signal that described the general vicinity of the beeper, maybe inside, maybe outside the house."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2180.03,2183.747,"--Justice O'Connor, that is not in the record."
1983.83-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.21,2206.034,"Well, didn't they use it at the final house to identify where the beeper... that the beeper was actually in that house?"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2206.034,2211.158,"They, at that particular moment when they want the search warrant, they get very specific."
1983.83-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.501,2213.36,Because of the beeper.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2213.36,2214.686,Because of the beeper.
1983.83-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.686,2215.827,They were close enough.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2215.827,2231.383,The government in this case went under the policy of United States Attorney's Office in the district of New Mexico to obtain a judicial warrant.
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2319.88,2323.799,"Do you think it is the same as Irving against California in that sense, do you?"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2323.799,2328.532,"I am not that familiar with Irving, Your Honor."
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2328.532,2336.324,That is where police actually placed the electronic equipment in the home.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2336.324,2339.058,By surreptitious methods?
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2339.058,2339.354,Yes.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2339.354,2340.026,Yes.
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2342.714,2348.087,They didn't send it in by an inanimate object like the can here.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2352.835,2352.976,--Yes.
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2352.976,2355.101,So you think it is the same either way.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2355.101,2363.097,"Yes, and I don't think that anything has turned... any search has turned on the limited information gathered."
1983.83-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2398.755,2408.86,"Was the Tenth Circuit specific in that regard, Mr. Roberts, as to what information they would have found through the beeper that they couldn't have found through the hypothetical agents?"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2408.86,2421.276,--I don't believe that they were specific and except the fact that they said that several times that the beeper was lost and would never have been found again save for the beeper.
1983.83-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2421.276,2422.761,You mean the can was lost?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2422.761,2439.191,"The can was lost four or five times, and when the can is lost and they are going all over the city of Albuquerque, and as this Court must realize, this invades five or six homes, depending on how someone looks at it, for over five months."
1983.83-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2439.191,2446.235,"Of course, the can was lost in Knotts, too, for a period of time during the trip from St. Paul over to Wisconsin."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2446.235,2453.387,"I think that was a momentary loss, and there were attempts to make visual surveillance at the same time."
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2456.543,2463.619,"What's the difference between a loss of six hours and a loss of six days, as a matter of constitutional law?"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2463.619,2471.131,"I think constitutionally that when you get into that large of loss, you are absolutely relying on the beeper."
1983.83-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2548.428,2554.785,I don't think the government is arguing that just that kind of surveillance would form probable cause.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2708.879,2712.018,--It is only a five-gallon drum of ether--
1983.83-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2712.018,2714.923,"I am sorry, five-gallon rather than ten."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2714.923,2717.094,"--Justice Stevens, and this can be--"
1983.83-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2717.094,2718.062,It was part of a 50-gallon shipment.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2718.062,2723.498,--carried in a truck of a car or put in a locker or put in the garage or whatever.
1983.83-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2723.498,2748.52,"There were ten of those cans, and they could see them in the cars when they went to the first house, and they could see them on some of the later movements until they finally put them in boxes, and they couldn't tell, they couldn't tell whether there was a can, except by the beeper, they didn't know that that automobile had that particular can in it."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2748.52,2758.077,"Yes, and also we presented evidence at the suppression hearing that ether is a very common chemical."
1983.83-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.989,2782.833,But those are all industrial uses.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2785.3,2788.159,"--It is used in photography, Your Honor."
1983.83-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2788.159,2788.83,--Pardon me?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2788.83,2791.236,"It is used in photography, Your Honor."
1983.83-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.236,2792.282,I see.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2799.749,2802.123,I think not very often.
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2802.123,2802.888,How long would that supply last him?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2804.09,2807.745,"I don't think it would be very often, Your Honor, but--"
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2807.745,2814.476,Did your record show the total amount of ether coming into Albuquerque or the area in a year or in a month?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2814.476,2826.3,"--No, but the professor in question said just simply for his classes and the various things they did at school they often ordered it by the tank car, which is a substantial amount more than 50 gallons."
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2839.077,2843.855,"It has to be labeled in transport, though, does it not, because of its volatility?"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2843.855,2845.308,"Because of its flammability, Your Honor."
1983.83-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2850.931,2853.803,What do you mean by precursor chemical?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2857.177,2865.643,"--Yes, it is... a precursor chemical is something out of which a contraband substance can be made, like methamphetamines or whatever."
1983.83-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2872.202,2879.638,It is not something out of which you make illegal drugs?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2879.638,2880.965,No.
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2977.037,2986.111,Does this record show what kind of fabric the ether was applied to to extract the drug?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2986.111,2988.859,It was--
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2988.859,2989.578,You said clothing.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2989.578,2992.233,"--clothing, is all that appears."
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2992.233,2993.311,"Men's suits, or--"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2993.311,2995.373,"In other words, I think that--"
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2995.373,2997.027,"--hosiery, or what?"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,2997.027,2999.666,"--No, I think that this was heavier clothing."
1983.83-850,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3015.583,3033.622,"Mr. Roberts, there are several respondents in this case, and at least one of the briefs indicated that Mr. Muehlenweg was acting as the agent for respondents Karo, Horton, and Harley."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3047.93,3062.251,I believe that one could make the point that he could consent to the installation but he cannot consent to the beeper remaining inside the drum when he hands it over to other people.
1983.83-850,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3062.251,3071.17,"Well, if he was their agent, at least for purposes of Mr. Karo, Horton, and Harley, why aren't they bound by their agent's consent?"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3071.17,3082.291,"I would just have to answer, Justice O'Connor, that if one bought a house from somebody else, somebody could not leave a bug in it, even if that person was one's real estate agent."
1983.83-850,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3095.597,3100.813,"Well, the brief made a blanket assertion that he was their agent, so I just wondered why that isn't that binding."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3108.748,3116.714,"At that time, until the beeper intruded upon their private areas."
1983.83-850,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3121.103,3133.02,"Well, does the record show what property Roth, Steele, and Rhodes had that would have been involved?"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3133.02,3135.049,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-850,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3172.816,3173.564,Someone else's home?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3173.564,3175.799,"Yes, but he was a guest."
1983.83-850,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3175.799,3183.061,"Well, I'm not sure that qualifies for protection, those descriptions."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3183.061,3194.51,"Well, an overnight guest I believe does have some protection, but Horton and Harley have probably... they have an interest in the drum itself."
1983.83-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3219.469,3221.248,These were college students?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3221.248,3222.748,A few of them were.
1983.83-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3225.154,3226.934,And they all lived up at Taos for three months?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3226.934,3228.605,--Three of them did.
1983.83-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3233.495,3235.742,A hundred miles to the north.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3235.742,3236.148,Yes.
1983.83-850,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3236.148,3237.774,That is a good way up there.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3241.538,3245.522,"Yes, there was an alias on that rental."
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3245.522,3253.471,Does the record show the dollar figure on these ten cans of ether?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3253.471,3257.299,"It cost $3,000 to buy them."
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3257.299,3260.687,"So that is not a college prank operation, is it?"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3260.687,3266.732,"I wasn't mentioning... It is a serious offense, Chief Justice Burger."
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3268.324,3272.574,I didn't intend to reflect on your argument in the slightest.
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3276.165,3279.366,"--It took $3,000."
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3279.366,3288.317,"Just one component used over a short period of time is $3,000, with all the expensive precautions taken to cover it."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3292.628,3296.064,I believe it was organized.
1983.83-850,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3368.581,3370.159,Is that any worse than using an alias?
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3370.159,3385.246,"--Your Honor, they were probably no worse than what the defendants did, that is for sure, but there are sanctions to be applied against defendants and there are, of course, sanctions to be applied against these individuals."
1983.83-850,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3396.648,3402.271,"Well, one adverse result was the fact that the warrant that was obtained is void."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3402.271,3406.644,That is one adverse result.
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3512.959,3520.722,"Now, counsel, I take it you are at the point that we should explore some other areas carefully."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3533.936,3534.858,Yes.
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3534.858,3547.133,"Do you think when the person engages in terrorist activities, plainly illegal activities on which no one would disagree, that he has given up his right not to be shot at by the police?"
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3553.631,3582.839,"He may have given up some rights, Chief Justice, but I think this Court in Mincey said that even a homicide doesn't forfeit the reasonable expectation of privacy in the very home where the policeman was shot in a heroine deal, and that is the finding of that Court, that you cannot already assume that the man is guilty before you have even gathered the evidence, and that was a specific holding of this Court in Mincey, and I believe that should be the holding."
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3582.839,3603.158,"But some of these terrorist things that we read about, individual cases, there is only one person in the house, and he goes from window to window shooting people and killing them, a number of them, one in the morning paper, no problem about identifying the wrongdoer there, nor is the nature of his... the gravity of his wrongdoing."
1983.83-850,1,19901,charles_louis_roberts,,3607.499,3612.623,"Because of exigent circumstances, Your Honor, I think a lesser standard would follow."
1983.83-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3612.623,3613.95,Very well.
1983.83-850,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3616.762,3617.403,"A couple of things, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.83-850,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3617.403,3618.7,You have three minutes remaining.
1983.83-850,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3618.7,3620.042,Thank you.
1983.83-850,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3655.169,3659.948,Why wasn't it used to get the search warrant in the final house?
1983.83-850,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3659.948,3669.32,"Well, it was not material to the search warrant, because they knew... they had information from Muehlenweg that there was a cocaine manufacturing operation going on in Taos."
1983.83-850,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3714.926,3717.13,"Mr. Frey, in your view, what difference does it make whether it went in the house or not?"
1983.83-850,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3717.13,3733.778,"We don't think it makes a difference legally in this case, but the whole lynchpin of their argument is that we are searching their house, that what is happening in this case is exactly the same as if we sent a police officer inside to walk around the house trying to find the ether."
1983.83-850,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3733.778,3736.714,"And the lynchpin of your argument is, there is no search no matter where it goes."
1983.83-850,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3736.714,3738.869,"Well, I have two separate arguments."
1983.83-850,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3738.869,3739.869,"I mean, one of your arguments."
1983.83-850,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3739.869,3759.876,"The second argument, which is also quite important to us, is that even if there is a search, it is a limited intrusion in its nature, revealing only the single fact which ordinarily at least would be visible by observation, and therefore that a reasonable suspicion standard is sufficient."
1983.83-850,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3798.659,3803.201,I thought it was perfectly plain that there was evidence in the record.
1983.83-850,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3806.263,3808.965,I was looking for that.
1983.83-850,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3822.523,3841.204,"Well, I think you will find that somewhere, 56, 57, 58, you will find that a truck departed with some boxes, and they didn't see any cans, but the beeper told them that the boxes had the cans in them."
1983.83-850,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3841.204,3848.014,"Well, I found... when this came up before I was looking for it and I couldn't--"
1983.83-850,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3848.014,3848.858,"Well, the record will speak for itself."
1983.83-850,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3848.858,3849.655,--find the reference.
1983.83-850,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3849.655,3851.325,We will resume at 1:00 o'clock with the next case.
