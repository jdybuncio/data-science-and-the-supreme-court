2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,3.618,We'll hear argument next in Nken v. Filip.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,4.602,18.878,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1996, Congress provided in 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(3)(B) that courts may stay an alien's order of removal pending appeal."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,83.467,90.038,"Counsel, I'm -- I'm not sure this matters very much, but do you know, are stays usually granted in this type of case?"
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,96.459,105.398,"In -- in a removal case, stays are granted in eight circuits only if the individual meets the traditional--"
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,105.398,106.166,"No, no, I understand it."
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,111.57,114.353,--I've seen no empirical study.
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,114.353,114.938,Okay.
2008.08-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,114.938,115.572,How long is it--
2008.08-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,115.572,117.122,Did -- did the government cite -- I can ask you.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,123.461,124.328,That--
2008.08-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,124.328,128.113,And my understanding is that stays are granted in a very high percentage of those cases.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,137.052,147.241,"--The data that I believe Your Honor is referencing was the rate at which petitions for review are filed, and not the rate at which stays are granted or filed."
2008.08-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,147.241,153.495,"Well, is it true that there are more petitions filed in the -- in the courts with the more generous standard?"
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,153.495,156.514,"Again, I've not seen a comprehensive study."
2008.08-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,187.984,190.603,--How many years ago was the automatic stay eliminated?
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,196.84,198.69,At the same time in 1996.
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,231.061,235.613,Is it possible in this case to kind of split the -- split the baby?
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,270.769,276.59,"I think that the way to do that, Your Honor, is to apply (f)(2) where the alien is seeking permanent relief."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,286.078,289.863,"Well, but that's just really saying the way to avoid that is to say you win across the board."
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,302.504,312.36,"--And if you then apply the (f)(2) standard across the board to stay requests, then what that would mean is that the court of appeals is deciding the merits twice."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,326.036,330.671,"No, I think I understand that point when they're seeking to have the order -- the removal order vacated."
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,341.129,356.555,"--Technically, the order of removal is the order denying the motion to reopen, so they're one and the same in this case and in any case where the petition for review is of an order of removal, which is what the statute provides for."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,359.321,359.923,Is that right?
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,367.476,378.718,"--Well, the -- the statute provides that an order denying a motion to reopen is itself an order of removal, and that it's consolidated with the original order of removal on appeal."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,384.288,385.288,Where does it say that?
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,385.288,391.776,"I do not believe that it is in 1252 itself, and I don't have the citation for you."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,392.411,393.078,Okay.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,393.078,404.266,"Back to the point that it's important to recognize that the (f)(2) standard contains no predictive language, it doesn't allow a court to say is this individual likely to succeed on the merits."
2008.08-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.953,434.019,They wouldn't be deciding it the same way twice.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,456.001,464.34,"--Well, Your Honor, the government has stated in its brief that it -- it believes these two standards to be virtually identical."
2008.08-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.065,476.882,That's true.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,476.882,480.75,"And so, in that situation, (b)(3)(B) would be superfluous."
2008.08-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.75,487.753,"What do you claim that -- that (f)(2) covers, if it doesn't cover these stays?"
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,487.753,494.141,"It covers any time an alien seeks an injunction, now, both in the courts of appeals and in a district court case."
2008.08-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,494.141,495.509,When would that be?
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,495.509,507.751,"Well, the Catholic Social Services case is one example where individuals were challenging the procedures whereby their legalization applications were adjudicated under the Immigration Reform and Control Act."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,521.327,528.647,"Well, that's -- that's kind of a systemic challenge, but you wouldn't have a situation where you get an injunction in far more typical individual cases."
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,529.114,536.086,"Well, if an individual in that case, Your Honor, attempted to enjoin his or her removal, then the (f)(2) standard would certainly apply to that individual."
2008.08-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.157,549.661,Why would he seek to enjoin his removal when he -- he's subject to a much lesser standard if he just seeks to stay the removal?
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,552.93,560.952,"Well, in that case, it would be in a district court, which doesn't have supervisory authority over the court of appeals -- I'm sorry -- over the BIA's order."
2008.08-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,565.088,567.856,"Why wouldn't he go to the court of appeals, is the next question."
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,567.856,573.843,"Well, he perhaps might, but if there was a delay in the -- in the procedure or if there was some reason why--"
2008.08-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.843,574.878,That's a fluke.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,582.299,589.219,"--Well, it would be in any case, even in the court of appeals, where an individual sought an injunction as opposed to a stay."
2008.08-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,609.531,610.732,Also a fluke.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,617.036,618.519,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.08-681,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,619.321,628.344,"I think it's a fluke, too, but you gave -- in my recollection -- I forget where it was -- I think you gave citations to three or four cases in which that actually happened, didn't you?"
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,628.344,630.944,"--The Singh case, Your Honor, is -- is one of those cases."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,725.989,735.345,"Maybe I'm missing something but -- and, again, I don't know which way this cuts, but the dispute strikes me as very academic as a practical matter."
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,755.156,758.341,"Well, the -- the key I believe, Your Honor, is the -- the equities."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,766.83,767.399,It doesn't?
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,770.684,772.251,"--Both -- both, Your Honor."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,772.251,772.701,Same.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,772.701,773.22,Yes.
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,773.22,773.603,Same thing.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,788.895,802.619,"Well -- well, Your Honor, under the (f)(2) standard -- take, for example, someone who had applied for asylum, and it was denied on a procedural technicality, and the question is, was the entry of the execution -- entry or execution of the removal order prohibited by law?"
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,819.915,822.367,Because the -- because the objection is on this procedural matter?
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,822.367,823.183,Correct.
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,823.183,833.424,"But if the objection is that I'm going to be tortured and so you shouldn't order my removal, he would be able to -- a court under (f)(2) would be able to consider that, wouldn't it?"
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,833.424,845.148,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, unless the very question that was being decided is whether the individual had met the -- met the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,863.858,867.562,Don't they get -- don't they get to pursue that even after they're sent back?
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,873.715,875.081,"--That is true, Your Honor."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,892.777,899.866,"Well, I guess that's why -- I guess that goes back to my earlier question is -- I see that if they're killed the case is probably not in very good shape."
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,910.972,923.029,"Well, Your Honor, that would -- the court of appeals would only be allowed to consider that if the question presented was whether they had proven that they were likely to be killed if they were returned to the country."
2008.08-681,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,951.947,952.631,Maybe I'm just not following it.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,970.241,981.799,"--Well, not always, Your Honor, if the question that the court was considering wasn't whether in fact the individual was going to be killed if returned."
2008.08-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1024.311,1036.618,"When you say equities, is the fact that he has applied or his wife has applied for adjustment of his status -- is that an equity?"
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,1036.618,1041.07,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe that that itself would be an equity."
2008.08-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1059.901,1061.184,It was changing conditions.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,1061.184,1062.269,"That's right, Your Honor."
2008.08-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1062.269,1063.903,Alleged changing conditions.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,1063.903,1064.686,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1152.76,1160.932,So you think references to equitable relief and restrain are clear enough to cover the court's authority to grant a stay?
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,1160.932,1172.073,"I don't believe that restrain is, Your Honor, because I think restrain -- it's unclear whether Congress is talking about a -- a stay versus a temporary injunction or a restraining order."
2008.08-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1183.262,1193.134,"Just to refresh my recollection, what -- what's the major difference between the standard that -- or the findings that the judge must make, A, to grant a preliminary injunction and, B, to grant a stay?"
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,1193.134,1205.107,"That test is the same, Your Honor, in the usual situation because both arise at the same stage in the proceedings where it makes sense that a court would want to consider what is the likelihood that this person is going to succeed down the road."
2008.08-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1218.749,1227.205,My -- my concern is that I sense in this statute a congressional concern that stays are too frequently granted.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,1255.874,1264.48,"Well, Your Honor, the -- the standard that Congress intended, the traditional one, is not a standard under which stays are -- are routinely granted."
2008.08-681,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1296.349,1298.332,And this case -- this case could come out the same.
2008.08-681,0,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,1313.977,1314.777,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2008.08-681,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1383.638,1384.657,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1392.894,1409.522,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statutory text, context, and background of section 1252(f)(2) all demonstrate that that section applies to orders granting a stay of removal pending a court of appeals decision on a petition for review."
2008.08-681,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1468.311,1476.25,"Were the examples that she gives, the two or three cases, properly examples under this section, in your--"
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1476.25,1481.302,"Well, I -- I think there were two different types of examples that she gave, if I may."
2008.08-681,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1494.711,1496.311,--May I -- may I interrupt you just a second?
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1500.465,1504.834,"The -- the cited cases, we don't think, are examples of -- of this."
2008.08-681,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1607.735,1704.298,"On that particular point, just specifically -- this is awfully complicated and you've had to go into it pretty quickly, and so have I."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1785.666,1786.633,"Yes, if I could."
2008.08-681,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1822.541,1826.243,What it says here specifically is it says habeas proceedings.
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1826.243,1826.743,Yes.
2008.08-681,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1889.584,1890.27,That's good.
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1915.735,1916.251,--But--
2008.08-681,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1916.251,1922.055,"If you were that district habeas judge and you get a thing saying removal, you don't really vacate it."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1928.645,1935.714,--I think the habeas court would have the authority and -- would have the authority to vacate just as -- just as a court of appeals would have the authority to vacate.
2008.08-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1983.812,1996.353,"Do you -- do you agree with your friend that the basic difference between your two positions is that, under the stay factors, you are allowed to consider irreparable harm but are not allowed to consider that under (f)(2)?"
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1996.353,2003.609,"--No, I think (f)(2) -- (f)(2) is -- is a necessary condition for granting relief."
2008.08-681,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2013.465,2015.167,What difference would it make?
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2028.391,2030.51,--And that -- and that -- and that may -- that may well be.
2008.08-681,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2033.745,2045.186,"But -- but -- but that's -- no, well, in any case, if he's got to show by clear and convincing evidence that he's going to have success on the merits, I don't see any point in any case to going into irreparable harm."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2058.16,2066.683,"--Well, as we understand the reference to clear and convincing evidence -- and admittedly it's not entirely clear how Congress intended that standard to apply in this context."
2008.08-681,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2076.741,2079.074,But it's more than a -- it's certainly more than a preponderance?
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2079.074,2079.526,--Yes.
2008.08-681,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2107.909,2113.43,But the ultimate -- the ultimate standard to which they look is a preponderance standard.
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2146.784,2156.39,That -- that is -- the court -- you're -- you're correct in the sense that the court is reviewing to see whether substantial evidence supports the IJ's determination by a preponderance of the evidence.
2008.08-681,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2187.825,2194.348,Are there other cases in which clear and convincing -- the clear and convincing standard applies to appellate courts?
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2201.185,2203.371,It -- it -- it ordinarily is.
2008.08-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2247.131,2250.767,"So I take it, at least in the Seventh Circuit, these things are usually granted stays."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2250.767,2257.004,They're -- we do not have empirical data -- and -- and I wish we did -- on the percentage.
2008.08-681,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2265.61,2270.896,"But the standard is probable success on the merits, and that's not an easy standard."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2274.966,2292.927,"Well, if the -- if the courts actually applied that standard, there would at least be some improvement in the stay standards, but the -- but the courts sometimes apply a sliding scale where they say if there's -- you know, a serious question and a showing -- a showing of substantial harm would be sufficient."
2008.08-681,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2297.629,2298.331,--What are we supposed to do?
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2346.612,2348.896,--And the Eleventh.
2008.08-681,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2348.896,2357.802,"And -- and it seems to me it would make it impossible for the district judge to do, because the district judge cannot honestly say that it's clear and convincing that this man is going to win."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2367.943,2370.561,"Well, it would be the court of appeals, not the district judge."
2008.08-681,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2370.561,2371.161,Right.
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2371.161,2381.6,But it -- we -- we believe that the -- that 1252(f)(2) allows a court to take the time necessary to rule meaningfully on the stay application.
2008.08-681,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2449.93,2464.087,"And I -- and I applaud the fact that you don't, but I don't know how you can do it consistently with your view that (b)(3)(B) means the same thing as (f) when (f) is restricted as much as it is."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2464.087,2464.689,"Well, I--"
2008.08-681,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2464.689,2470.474,"God -- God bless you, but I don't -- I don't know how under the statute, on your reading of the statute, you -- you can do it."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2470.474,2471.593,--There are two responses.
2008.08-681,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2507.182,2507.816,All right.
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2517.907,2537.885,"Well, it may -- that may well be the right answer, is to read (b)(3)(B) -- (b)(3)(B)'s opening that -- which says a petition for review does not in itself stay the order -- is -- is very similar to the language in the opening of 2349(b) which is the interlocutory injunction language of the Hobbs Judicial Review Act."
2008.08-681,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.27,2701.407,And you would expect the standard to be in the (b)(3)(B) provision.
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2759.594,2768.533,"Well, (f)(1) is directed at -- in large part at programmatic challenges."
2008.08-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2851.619,2865.346,"So in this -- in this case involving a denial of a motion to reopen, what the court of appeals is supposed to do is to look ahead and see if this person has shown by clear and convincing evidence that they shouldn't be removed."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2874.785,2876.837,"--No, no."
2008.08-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2977.202,2980.32,"This provision applies to us as well, I take it."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2980.887,2982.087,"Yes, we -- we believe it would."
2008.08-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2982.087,2995.164,"So if there is a cert petition filed on behalf of an alien subject to removal, and he asks for a stay of -- of removal, we have to decide whether he meets the clear and convincing evidence standard."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2995.164,2998.115,"For -- for purposes of granting a stay, yes."
2008.08-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2998.115,3005.102,"We should have -- we should have done this in this case, but I assume you suspended removal of the Petitioner on your own?"
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3005.102,3013.125,"Well, you -- you -- the Court granted a stay in connection with the -- with the granting of -- of certiorari in the case."
2008.08-681,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3013.125,3018.343,May I ask just a technical point?
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3018.343,3018.995,Yes.
2008.08-681,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3018.995,3024.197,One of the -- the motion to reopen was based on changed circumstances in Cameroon.
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3037.457,3038.073,Yes.
2008.08-681,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3038.073,3048.514,"As I understand it, the status adjustment could not have been asked for earlier because his wife didn't come become a citizen until after."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3048.514,3049.814,If -- yes.
2008.08-681,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3069.826,3074.896,"Yes, but now -- now he would qualify, except that it's a successive motion."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3080.634,3082.534,But -- but Congress was quite explicit.
2008.08-681,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3096.393,3097.109,May I just ask a question?
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3097.109,3097.595,--Yes.
2008.08-681,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3097.595,3104.832,"This person is married to a citizen, has an American-citizen child."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3117.057,3121.294,He could -- he could apply for an immigrant visa from abroad.
2008.08-681,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3141.521,3146.223,"Mr. Kneedler, when we entered the stay, did we violate (f)(2)?"
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3146.223,3159.133,"I -- I think it would be analogous to what I was saying before, that the -- this Court, like a court of appeals, has the authority to -- to freeze the status quo while it can decide the -- the pertinent legal issue, and the pertinent legal issue before this--"
2008.08-681,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3159.133,3162.669,But where do we get that authority if (f)(2) means what you say?
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3162.669,3172.357,"--Well, as -- as I explained, we do not -- we do not challenge the ability of -- of a court to decide to freeze the status quo while it is ruling on the motion for a stay."
2008.08-681,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3172.357,3173.642,"Well, what court would ever do anything else?"
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3179.88,3183.582,"Well, but there -- but there's -- it's not two stages; it's three."
2008.08-681,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3203.162,3206.697,But this is a longer temporary stay than you conceded a few moments ago.
2008.08-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3219.271,3220.79,"It's pretty close to it, though."
2008.08-681,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3221.64,3222.89,"It feels like it, yes."
2008.08-681,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3222.89,3226.259,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2008.08-681,2,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,3230.163,3233.515,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-681,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3287.9,3289.517,"Yes, but you still have a differential."
2008.08-681,2,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,3300.825,3303.794,"--Well, Your Honor, the (f)(2)--"
2008.08-681,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3303.794,3308.729,Because you have the same problem under your standard as the government does under its.
2008.08-681,2,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,3308.729,3311.115,"--Well, that's true, Your Honor."
2008.08-681,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3350.473,3357.293,"You think that if you do not prevail, and we say clear and convincing evidence is the standard, that courts are not entitled to consider equities?"
2008.08-681,2,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,3357.293,3375.004,"Well, Your Honor, I heard my brother as indicating that if you meet the (f)(2) standard, then -- then the court can consider the equities so as to deprive the individual of a stay, but that if you cannot meet the (f)(2) standard, then the question is closed and there is no consideration."
2008.08-681,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3375.004,3376.288,Let me ask you about your position.
2008.08-681,2,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,3385.396,3389.681,"Yes, Your Honor, in the event that the individual does not meet (f)(2)."
2008.08-681,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3437.06,3446.534,"I guess -- I guess General Kneedler's point is that clear and convincing shifts a little, depending on how long you've got to -- to look at it."
2008.08-681,2,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,3468.198,3481.839,"Well, Your Honor, if the Court were to interpret clear and convincing as a more flexible standard, then -- then I don't think -- you know, I don't disagree with -- with Your Honor's characterization of it."
2008.08-681,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3541.294,3542.227,With 1225?
2008.08-681,2,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,3542.227,3543.394,"--Yes, sir."
2008.08-681,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3543.394,3544.412,Was I right or wrong?
2008.08-681,2,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,3544.412,3546.714,"I believe you're right, Your Honor, and I believe that--"
2008.08-681,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3546.714,3547.248,Are you sure?
2008.08-681,2,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,3551.15,3554.702,"--I did not mention it in my opening, Your Honor, and that was my error."
2008.08-681,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3618.977,3629.685,But -- but the standard that you say should apply under (b)(3)(B) is a standard that is described as applicable to temporary injunctions.
2008.08-681,2,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,3648.73,3649.597,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-681,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3663.756,3665.025,May I just ask this one very quick?
2008.08-681,2,34561,lindsay_c_harrison,,3673.262,3674.381,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-681,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3674.381,3676.666,"Thank you, Ms. Harrison."
