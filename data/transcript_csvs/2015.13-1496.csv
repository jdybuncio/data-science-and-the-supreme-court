2015.13-1496,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.28,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-1496, Dollar General Corporation v. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. Mr. Goldstein."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,10.28,36.585,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: Our narrowest argument assumes that, in circumstances like this case, Indian tribes do have the legislative jurisdiction to subject nonmembers to tribal tort law duties. Respondents argue that the same facts also give Indian tribes the mandatory adjudicatory jurisdiction to decide private tort lawsuits against non-Indians."
2015.13-1496,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,55.47,66.24,Could you -- could you please explain your opening statement? You -- you say there is legislative authority but not judicial authority.
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,86.06,87.95,"I can give you several, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.13-1496,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,87.95,88.04,Yes.
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,88.04,94.28,"The first is removal. Remember, our point is not that the Tribes lack any adjudicatory jurisdiction."
2015.13-1496,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,110.03,118.42,"It has the authority, but -- but an out-of-State defendant can be moved to Federal court, but it has the adjudicatory authority."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,118.42,125.4,"Justice Ginsburg, everyone agrees that the Tribes have a form of adjudicatory authority upon consent."
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,174.08,194.955,"Well, I -- I don't -- this is an important part of the dialogue, but let me just go back to the first part of -- of -- of your response. Is -- is it black-letter law given the Tribes have complete legislative authority over non-Tribe members on -- for -- for regulatory purposes? I -- I -- I take it that as a black-letter law given?"
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,194.955,222.36,"Justice Kennedy, if we say it -- in those terms, regulatory authority without getting into the question of all forms of legislation, for example, tort law, then the first exception to Montana says that, although there is a presumption against jurisdiction, the Tribes do have their regulatory authority. We have the argument that tort law, because it is so broad and would swallow the rule, that the Tribes lack legislative authority over nonmembers."
2015.13-1496,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,227.69,235.335,"But doesn't that clash with what the Court said in Strate? I mean, Strate -- I'll read you the sentence."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,252.655,252.98,Okay.
2015.13-1496,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,268.56,270.74,If this is a tort case. It was a --
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,270.74,276.51,So then I don't understand why you opened your -- your -- are -- I -- I thought you said --
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,276.51,277.43,We assumed.
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,277.43,279.17,-- I -- I -- you assumed --
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,279.17,279.62,Yes.
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.68,280.94,"-- that this could be -- well, I --"
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,280.94,281.65,"Well, Justice --"
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,281.65,282.89,-- I don't know why you make that assumption.
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,282.89,283.06,Okay.
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,283.06,284.23,I -- I -- I just --
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,284.23,284.77,I apologize.
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,284.77,285.69,-- can't get off square one.
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,285.69,290.815,"Sure. I do not intend, Justice Kennedy, to give up a good argument in our favor."
2015.13-1496,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,317.27,319.3,But will you then go back to my question --
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,319.3,319.39,Yes.
2015.13-1496,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,319.39,329.64,"-- about Strate? Because if what you're arguing now is correct, Strate would have been a one-line decision: No tort jurisdiction over a non-Indian."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,329.64,334.67,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's true that this Court's decisions can often be resolved in different ways."
2015.13-1496,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,364.43,369.95,But are -- are you saying then this sentence that I just read to you from the opinion of the Court was just wrong?
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,369.95,385.96,"Justice Ginsburg, what the Court has said in Nevada v. Hicks, addressing the various times that there is dictum in the Court's opinions that has assumed the parallel between legislative and adjudicatory jurisdiction is that that question had not been fully considered by the Court and it remained open."
2015.13-1496,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,411.35,415.455,Can I address that for a moment? States appoint judges.
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,435.72,453.35,"Oh, Justice Sotomayor, I think actually that your hypothetical is a good one for us. In Article III of the Constitution, we contemplate the availability of a neutral forum when a noncitizen is a defendant in the case, including when we, you know, ordinarily respect the neutrality of State court judges."
2015.13-1496,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,459.21,463.69,But that's out of comity or our sense of comity between the States.
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,467.74,469.73,"Oh, I -- I just simply disagree, Your Honor."
2015.13-1496,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,481.7,483.48,What's wrong with the tribal courts?
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,483.48,492.155,"What's wrong with the tribal courts? It depends. First of all, let me say that there are modern tribal judiciaries like this one that deserve genuine respect."
2015.13-1496,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,508.67,508.92,All right.
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,519.19,519.63,Right.
2015.13-1496,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,519.63,523.355,"So what -- what you do is you go and complain, we didn't get due process of law."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,523.355,523.95,Two things --
2015.13-1496,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,523.95,531.91,"If you're in one of the ones that has some unusual thing about it. But if you're in a normal thing, you say, it's normal. So what's wrong with saying just that?"
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,531.91,532.0,Right.
2015.13-1496,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,532.0,537.525,"Like a State court which has terrible procedures, terribly unfair, or a foreign court."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,541.82,542.05,All right.
2015.13-1496,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,542.505,543.21,Or little.
2015.13-1496,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.21,545.43,"You -- you can remove from State court, can't you?"
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,545.43,545.71,Yes.
2015.13-1496,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,545.98,552.0,"And when -- and -- and when removal is asked for, we don't ask the question, what's the matter with State courts? Do we?"
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,552.0,552.37,That's right.
2015.13-1496,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.04,559.85,We -- we just say that the Constitution says you have a -- a choice of having your case adjudicated in a Federal court.
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,559.85,567.76,"Justice Breyer, I'm -- I'm not going to lose sight of your question, but just on this point, our Constitution says we anticipate a neutral forum that this Court will -- the Supreme Court --"
2015.13-1496,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,567.76,571.12,"Well, the Constitution says the removal of statute is a statute."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,572.45,573.77,"Justice Ginsburg, I understand that."
2015.13-1496,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,711.74,720.515,"But doesn't the Indian Civil Rights Act -- I mean, it's not the Bill of Rights, but Indian Civil Rights Act is pretty close."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,720.515,729.305,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, the rule of the Constitution is not ""close is good enough,"" but I will say that I think the Indian Civil Rights Act is a point in our favor."
2015.13-1496,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,792.29,820.14,"You can do it both ways. And there are books, some of which I have at least looked through, and certainly articles that suggest that the tribal courts function perfectly well, certainly in many places. Now, I take it your argument is that there are some places they don't function well, and in respect to matters that are not matters of Federal law, there won't be review from those courts unless you collaterally attack them."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,821.155,825.735,"Justice Breyer, as I mentioned, we have real concerns, even with respect to a system like this one."
2015.13-1496,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,826.89,828.72,"I just want to know, have I got your point right?"
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,828.72,830.07,"No, I -- our point is broader."
2015.13-1496,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,872.24,896.03,"The nontribal member goes to the tribal land and signs an agreement that says tribal law would apply, and then commits a tort on the tribal lands, and even under those circumstances, and even if the court is functioning well, the tribal court cannot take jurisdiction over his claim."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,901.52,901.985,Okay.
2015.13-1496,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,964.565,966.73,"Well, Mr. Goldstein, you could have done that, too."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,971.995,979.815,"Actually, it wouldn't work the other way, Justice Kagan, with all due respect. Remember, this is a private tort suit by a member of the Tribe."
2015.13-1496,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,979.815,984.295,"No, but remember, this is -- there's -- this is an exception for consent."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1005.08,1010.13,"Well, Justice Kagan, I just don't understand how it is the case -- I disagree, let me just explain why."
2015.13-1496,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1024.84,1029.94,"Well, it does when the Montana exception relies upon a consensual relationship."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1029.94,1051.46,"But for the other side to win, what they have -- their premise is that the consensual relationship exists in simply the activity with the individual tribal member, not the contract. Remember, their point is that a contract is irrelevant. So the consent would exist simply by operating the business. But in all events, it is the case that we could insist on a contract; they can insist on a contract."
2015.13-1496,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1072.38,1089.695,"All of these arguments, your arguments -- let me figure out whether this is right. Your arguments about it's -- it's a nonneutral forum, it's an unfair forum, we don't know whether they have the same procedures that -- that are commonly -- that commonly exist in Federal and State courts."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1094.325,1097.59,They do have a lot to do with the fact that it's a private claim.
2015.13-1496,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1138.53,1147.585,"So if the Tribe brought this suit, instead of the parents of the boy who was molested, if -- if it -- then it would be okay?"
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1147.585,1149.78,"Well, we think that's an impossibility."
2015.13-1496,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1199.36,1208.23,"It's a bit of an odd argument, isn't it, Mr. Goldstein, that there's less of a sovereign interest in protecting your own citizens than in enforcing your licensing laws?"
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1208.23,1211.06,"If that were our argument, it would be an odd one."
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1264.37,1270.81,"Your -- your -- your brief consistently, let me say, suggests --"
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1270.81,1271.42,Yes.
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1271.42,1274.74,-- that Congress could authorize this jurisdiction.
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1274.74,1275.025,Yes.
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1275.025,1287.71,"Could Congress pass a law saying that all 500-plus Indian Tribes in the United States have unlimited criminal authority, could impose life sentences on nontribal members, American citizens?"
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1287.71,1291.205,"We think not, and let me explain the reason."
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1302.95,1317.59,"Well, why can they do -- if -- if there's a limit on that, why isn't is there a limit on what Congress could do with reference to tort law? Because you get unlimited power -- 500 tribes have unlimited power to impose punitive damages for civil torts if it happens within the boundaries of the Reservation."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1317.59,1321.01,"Justice Kennedy, if I have suggested that Congress could do that, I apologize."
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1321.76,1323.19,My question is: What are the limits?
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1323.19,1344.45,"The limits are due process, and that is that if you -- and the reason that due process applies here is that the tribe of judgment -- we've switched to the civil context now in your newest hypothetical. If the Tribe's judgment would presumably be enforceable in the courts of the United States or of a State, there would be State action then, and it would violate the principle of due process. It also --"
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1344.45,1358.77,"My -- my hypothetical is that the Congress gives Indian powers -- Indian tribes complete powers, both civil and criminal, over all persons on tribal Reservations."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1360.54,1363.56,That's unconstitutional because Congress is subject to the Constitution.
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1368.21,1374.69,Then why -- why doesn't -- why don't you make that argument here? How -- how can they -- how can they allow a tort suit?
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1374.69,1378.51,"Justice Kennedy, we agree with you that there's --"
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1378.51,1378.87,We could say --
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1378.87,1379.19,I'm sorry.
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1379.19,1380.93,-- the Montana First exception.
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1384.68,1385.57,We do -- okay.
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1420.29,1424.72,"Well, if the -- Congress of the United States give the UN authority --"
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1424.72,1425.06,I agree.
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1425.06,1427.79,-- over our -- our citizens --
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1427.79,1429.48,Or Triple A.
2015.13-1496,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1429.48,1433.465,"-- just so long as it says there has to be due process, they're not a constitutional entity?"
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1433.465,1435.5,"That's the second point I made, Justice Kennedy."
2015.13-1496,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1456.15,1474.19,"Well, what civil -- what civil cases can be brought? What -- let's assume that the incident occurs the Reservation, and the wrongdoer is not a member of the Tribe."
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1479.645,1480.515,The following.
2015.13-1496,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1507.11,1509.85,For example? What would fit into that category?
2015.13-1496,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1509.85,1516.07,"The examples that I gave before are that enforcing a taxation rule, enforcing a licensing rule."
2015.13-1496,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1523.585,1530.05,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal."
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1530.05,1548.365,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The facts of this tragic case place it squarely in the heartland of the sovereign tribal jurisdiction that this Court has recognized for decades. Dollar General set up shop on tribally-owned land with a lease and license from a tribe and agreed to participate in a tribal internship program."
2015.13-1496,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1562.9,1569.955,"You say this is in the heartland? We have never before recognized Indian court -- court jurisdiction over a nonmember, have we?"
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1569.955,1573.14,"Well, I think that you haven't applied the rule."
2015.13-1496,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1582.66,1583.04,Right.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1595.705,1598.96,"Well, I think that there have been many cases, Your Honor."
2015.13-1496,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1605.8,1607.67,And held -- held liable in tort?
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1607.67,1611.5,So this Court decided those questions on antecedent grounds --
2015.13-1496,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1611.5,1617.62,I guess I don't know that we need to -- there has never been a case where a nonmember has been held liable in tort in an Indian -- Indian court.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1617.62,1620.33,"Mr. Chief Justice, that's exactly right in terms of describing --"
2015.13-1496,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1620.33,1623.51,I think it's a little odd to say this is in the heartland of Indian jurisdiction.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1623.51,1626.8,I don't think it's odd at all. That's the rule that this Court laid down.
2015.13-1496,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1633.03,1633.76,That's dictum.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1636.465,1637.8,"Well, I think that --"
2015.13-1496,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.8,1639.06,Cases make it.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1640.21,1649.32,"Well, Justice -- Justice Scalia, I think everything about this Court's precedents in this area, which are all tort cases, lead to that conclusion. Mr. Goldstein's best argument is Hicks."
2015.13-1496,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1711.2,1718.725,Does your argument apply whenever a nonmember enters into a commercial transaction with a member?
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1718.725,1719.88,"No, it doesn't apply --"
2015.13-1496,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1719.88,1721.81,On tribal land?
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1721.81,1735.81,"Well, on tribal land we do think -- we don't think you have to go as far as the Solicitor General to say it's absolutely 100 percent dispositive, but we do think this Court has recognized in Merrion and El Paso that when you're on tribal lands, the tribe's powers are at their zenith."
2015.13-1496,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1735.81,1756.785,"Well, I'm trying to understand the limits of your -- of your argument. So what would happen in this situation? A tribe -- a member of the Tribe purchases a product online from a nonmember company, and the product is delivered to the Tribal member on tribal land."
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1793.49,1795.51,It depends a little bit more on the facts.
2015.13-1496,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1844.35,1844.52,All right.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1846.6,1859.0,"So again, if -- if a business is sending -- intentionally, knowingly sending goods onto tribal land, and those turn out to be defective, then they're liable for that, for that tort."
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1861.89,1864.57,"And that could be for punitive damages, millions of dollars?"
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1864.57,1866.92,If -- if that's what they have consented to.
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1867.53,1868.045,No.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1875.135,1876.06,If -- if there's --
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1876.06,1877.0,-- and all of the tribes.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1877.0,1884.81,"If -- if they do so knowingly, and there is that kind of long-term relationship, then yes, unless they themselves disclaim that -- and of course it's very easy --"
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1884.81,1887.325,"Well, number one, that's not explicit consent."
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1888.78,1889.82,"Well -- well, I --"
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1889.82,1890.0,But the --
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1890.0,1890.42,-- I certainly --
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1890.42,1892.96,"There's no -- so punitive damages, millions of dollars?"
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1892.96,1896.09,"Right, as long as they haven't affirmatively disclaimed it."
2015.13-1496,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1898.29,1899.07,I don't know what authority --
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1899.07,1900.23,"Again, what about limiting --"
2015.13-1496,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1900.23,1901.01,"I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy."
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1901.01,1908.76,I don't know what authority Congress has to subject citizens of the United States to that nonconstitutional forum.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1908.76,1934.69,"It's exactly what this Court -- and Justice Kennedy joined this in Plains Commerce Bank -- because what this Court said is that, yes, there are these constitutional concerns that -- or that tribes are -- you know, tribes are outside the constitutional system and so on. But when someone consents through their words or their actions, not express consent, then that takes it out of that circumstance. And so Dollar General had a remedy available to it right away."
2015.13-1496,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1954.29,1967.32,"Well, let me give you another -- another hypothetical: Somebody goes to an Indian casino and loses a lot of money, and then when the person goes home, the person goes online and says that, they -- they cheated me."
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1980.375,1987.3,"Well, I think -- I -- I think that that that's not something that would be permissible under this Court's Atkinson Trading nexus test."
2015.13-1496,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2009.31,2018.25,"And so how do you deal with -- I think it is a stronger point on the other side, is the absence of removal, and --"
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2018.25,2018.8,Yes.
2015.13-1496,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2097.08,2097.19,Do --
2015.13-1496,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2097.19,2111.0,"Why was the contractual provision acquiescence in the application of tribal law limited in the way that it was if they were, in fact, subjecting themselves to tribal jurisdiction across the board?"
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2111.0,2112.51,I -- I -- I don't think it was limited at all.
2015.13-1496,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2134.37,2146.23,"Is there any reason that the issue that we're arguing about couldn't be dealt with through contractual provisions, as they are in some cases where you either suggest yourselves to the jurisdiction of the tribal court or not?"
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2146.23,2146.65,Sure.
2015.13-1496,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.84,2218.095,"So what -- what would -- do we have to reach in this case the question of products, liability for products sent into the tribal area? I would have thought you could say this does not involve that, if you're willing to read -- and I don't know if you are -- nonmembers who enter into this kind of explicit consensual relationship growing out of -- in relation to a contract to which relationship the tort is directly related."
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2218.095,2218.935,Exactly.
2015.13-1496,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2218.935,2223.07,"Now, is there any -- and -- and what is the word in Cherokee? I forget."
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2227.23,2228.01,Domestic dependent --
2015.13-1496,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2228.01,2228.1,What?
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2228.1,2229.18,Domestic dependent nation?
2015.13-1496,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.18,2244.005,"Domestic? All right. So if, in fact, Tasmania had this kind of situation, and an American went to Tasmania and got a reasonable judgment, I take it our courts would enforce that."
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2244.005,2245.105,Correct.
2015.13-1496,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2245.105,2273.93,"And, of course you're going to agree with this, but if I -- but if I -- if I want -- if I wanted -- I wanted the limitation, and I wanted to know if you wanted me to read one thing that you have cited in respect to what is only impressionistic, that the vast number of tribal courts are indistinguishable in terms of fairness, et cetera, from the courts of -- other courts in the United States, what would I read?"
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2273.93,2278.14,"Well, I -- I -- I think, you know, we've cited to, you know, some large --"
2015.13-1496,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2278.14,2279.76,Which of those do you want me to read?
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2279.76,2291.33,"Well, I -- I think that maybe Justice O'Connor's article is a good place to start. And so I -- I think what I would say there, Justice Breyer, is that fairness concerns have never been relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry."
2015.13-1496,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2325.035,2338.71,"If we're -- if we're going to evaluate the due process concerns on a case-by-case basis, as a general matter, it -- does it violate due process for a nonmember to be subjected to a jury verdict where the jury consists solely of tribal members?"
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2338.71,2342.32,"Well -- well, first of all, you know, that's not necessarily what's going on here. There's no jury trial in this case."
2015.13-1496,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2342.41,2344.74,I understand that. But it's kind of a yes-or-no question.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2353.54,2355.25,I -- I could see it violating ICRA.
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2363.04,2365.64,That's because tribes are not governed by the Due Process Clause.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2365.64,2365.96,Yes.
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2366.63,2368.25,They're nonconstitutional entities.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2368.25,2368.7,Correct.
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2382.07,2382.52,I guess they could --
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2382.52,2386.28,They could ban those juries. They have plenary jurisdiction in this area.
2015.13-1496,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2390.94,2408.745,"I -- is it right? I'm thinking that there are $50,000 at stake in many cases. And many citizens of New York who want to feel -- sue citizens of Massachusetts, do have to go before juries to obtain the $50,000 in a Massachusetts court."
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2412.64,2414.57,That's -- that's absolutely right.
2015.13-1496,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2417.81,2428.86,Kind of think that -- you think the concerns are on the same level: Forcing somebody in a State court to be subjected -- a New Yorker to be subject to jurisdiction where everyone's from Massachusetts because it's Massachusetts court.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2438.13,2442.585,"I don't think it's the same, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think there are two things which make them similar."
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2481.03,2482.77,The Constitution runs to the people.
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2487.95,2490.44,"I completely agree with that, Justice Kennedy."
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2499.46,2505.26,"This -- this gets into implied consent, express consent, you know, all the hypotheticals."
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2524.055,2529.82,"Well, Justice Kennedy, we do think -- the argument doesn't depend on it, but we do think that they did put it in the contract."
2015.13-1496,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2574.25,2582.03,"If there were a forum selection clause in this contract selecting State court, would that bind Tribe member -- members?"
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2582.03,2582.71,I do think it would.
2015.13-1496,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2582.71,2583.655,"If so, on what theory?"
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2583.655,2593.16,"I think that the Tribe itself has the ability to, just as they can decide to use the American Arbitration Association or whatever, they can buy into some other area of law."
2015.13-1496,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2623.26,2641.535,"Mr. Katyal, so why would these plaintiffs want to bring the case in tribal court where they can get, in your argument, they can get Dollar General but they can't get Townsend? If they sued in State court, they could sue both defendants."
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2641.535,2642.255,Mm-hmm.
2015.13-1496,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2700.774,2720.16,"Just so you know, it seemed to me a reading of the first Montana exception, which is what we're talking about here, talking about taxation, licensing, then it talks about consensual relationships and we have this whole question: Is it explicit or is it implied? And then it talks about commercial dealing contracts, leases, or other arrangements."
2015.13-1496,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2727.54,2727.9,Sure.
2015.13-1496,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2743.15,2760.3,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler."
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2760.3,2784.535,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like at the outset to respond to the argument that tribal court jurisdiction over tort claims is somehow inconsistent with the superior sovereignty of the United States. That argument was flatly rejected, I think, in both National Farmers Union and Iowa Mutual where this Court was asked to apply the rule of Oliphant to civil jurisdiction."
2015.13-1496,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2835.055,2836.715,Nobody denies that here.
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2836.715,2838.265,"Well, no, but if I could --"
2015.13-1496,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2838.265,2841.67,It is essential for -- for disputes between tribal members.
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2841.67,2874.03,"If I could finish, what Congress's -- Congress's judgment, the next finding, Congress and Federal courts have repeatedly recognized tribal justice systems as the appropriate forums for the adjudication of disputes affecting personal and property rights. The committee reports on that statute made clear that they -- that those provisions were enacted in light of Iowa Mutual and National Farmers Union, and in fact, one of the -- one of the committee reports says that that second provision was added in recognition of the jurisdiction that tribal courts have over non-Indian --"
2015.13-1496,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2874.03,2879.299,If it said personal and property rights of non-Tribal members.
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2879.299,2880.1,Well --
2015.13-1496,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.1,2881.74,Or against non-Tribal members.
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2883.31,2883.64,No.

2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2906.005,2906.97,There were --
2015.13-1496,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2906.97,2909.14,"They were aware of those cases, I'm sure."
2015.13-1496,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2911.34,2916.91,-- were aware that it -- it stemmed from those cases because that's what the committee report says.
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2916.91,2953.61,"This -- this was a statute against the backdrop of two decisions of this Court saying that the rule of Oliphant does not apply to civil jurisdiction over non-Indians in tort cases specifically. And importantly also, in Iowa Mutual the argument was made about, specifically in connection with the diversity point, which Mr. Katyal has responded to, but the argument that the policies of the deferred city statute, such as concerns about perhaps competence of tribal courts or bias, that they should at least inform the analysis."
2015.13-1496,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2998.79,3006.48,"Mr. Kneedler, I don't know that you've answered -- I'm going to assume everything you said and accept it."

2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3029.055,3029.815,Sometimes.
2015.13-1496,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3029.815,3030.61,Sometimes.
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3030.61,3031.33,It does not.
2015.13-1496,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3031.33,3043.275,"It does not, not normally. If they vote on the committee report in any instance where there is a reconciliation between the two houses because it comes back in the form a vote, do you accept the report of the joint committee?"
2015.13-1496,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3043.275,3044.3,Which was not here.
2015.13-1496,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3044.3,3046.865,"Yeah, did they vote on the bill -- on the committee reports here?"
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3046.865,3049.63,My -- my point is that this was a --
2015.13-1496,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3049.63,3052.1,I'm sorry about your point. Did they vote on the committee reports --
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3052.1,3052.55,"No, they did not vote."
2015.13-1496,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.55,3071.94,"If we're getting into this, I'm sort of interested because I bet it could be true that the president of IBM, for example, does not himself read everything that the entire million-man staff or million-person staff at the -- at IBM in fact prepares for the public."
2015.13-1496,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3076.05,3076.25,So --

2015.13-1496,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.06,3090.755,"-- what this Court alleges, but it cannot do that, can it?"
2015.13-1496,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3090.755,3094.465,I -- I think Justice Sotomayor had a question on the floor.
2015.13-1496,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3094.465,3136.75,"We've gotten off on a side trip. Mr. Kneedler, some of my colleagues have been expressing a question that I am sure you haven't answered, which is how can, or how does the Constitution, particularly Article III, which gives every citizen the right to have their claims adjudicated before an Article III Court, how does Congress have the power to let -- to place adjudicatory powers over a nonmember, non-Tribe member in a tribal court?"
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3136.75,3170.8,"Congress -- the answer is Congress has not placed it as part of the inherent sovereignty of a -- of a tribe that -- that predates the Constitution as -- and was not displaced, as this Court made quite clear in the National Farmers Union decision, unlike in criminal cases where, from the start, from 1790 -- and this was an important part of the Court's analysis -- in -- in Oliphant. From the very beginning, Congress placed criminal jurisdiction over crimes by non-Indians against Indians in Federal courts in order to assure that they would have the full protection of the Due Process Clause in courts."
2015.13-1496,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3174.315,3178.545,And it's not right that everybody has the -- the right to an Article III tribunal.
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3178.545,3178.73,No.
2015.13-1496,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.28,3198.52,"No, but out-of-Staters do, at least where there's an adequate amount in controversy, right?"
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3198.52,3198.68,Right.
2015.13-1496,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3214.75,3222.8,"Is it consistent with your concept of due process, as a general matter, to have a nonmember tried by a jury consisting solely of tribal members?"
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3222.8,3232.005,I -- I think there's a very strong argument that it is because the -- the tribal members are the citizens of the jurisdiction that proves courts are being held.
2015.13-1496,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3265.94,3268.77,Do the same thing with the American Arbitration Association?
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3268.77,3269.54,"No, it could not."
2015.13-1496,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3276.5,3289.92,"But -- but I do think, on your earlier point, there -- there was not a general practice before, say, 1900 at least, of trying nontribal members before Indian civil tribal courts."
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3289.92,3290.44,The courts --
2015.13-1496,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3290.44,3291.81,Or -- or is that incorrect?
2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3291.81,3292.39,But -- but -- no.

2015.13-1496,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3382.945,3395.75,"May I answer? This Court has often said that tort law is a form of regulation, and again, that Iowa Mutual and those cases are premised on the idea that tribal tort law governs."

2015.13-1496,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3653.29,3653.77,Okay.

2015.13-1496,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3682.32,3699.685,"Because if they're sovereign, the United States can have treaties with people that basically say in your land, you do what you want; I'm not going to enforce your judgment if I don't think it's consistent with due process here."
