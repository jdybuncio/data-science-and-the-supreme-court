1975.75-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,61.11,64.143,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-491,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,253.27,257.776,(Inaudible) found that she had no knowledge of --
1975.75-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,257.776,262.492,"Yes, he so stated in his affidavit in this case."
1975.75-491,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,352.224,357.572,"Mr. Frey, was the case before the Court of Appeals on direct appeal from the conviction?"
1975.75-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,357.572,360.417,"Well, yes it was before the Court of Appeals on direct appeal."
1975.75-491,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,388.752,398.596,"Well, but nothing turns on the nature of the newly discovered evidence for purposes of amending or denying a motion for a mistrial or for a new trial?"
1975.75-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,398.596,400.107,"I am not sure, I understand your question."
1975.75-491,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,400.107,414.622,"I mean, is the case before the Court of Appeals in the posture of an attack on the judgment of conviction or a claim that the trial judge erred in denying the motion for a new trial on a basis of newly discovered evidence?"
1975.75-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,414.622,419.932,"The later, yes."
1975.75-491,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.619,556.707,"Well, can you -- forget it."
1975.75-491,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,556.707,572.14,"(Inaudible) ineffective assistance of counsel, but I had notice that in his brief, the respondent who presents that question, I gather in defense, even that if you are right on the first point, in defense of the judgment below, are you going to address the ineffectiveness?"
1975.75-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,572.14,575.645,"Well, I will if the Court wishes at the conclusion of my argument."
1975.75-491,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,576.33,583.505,Am I right that the respondent is lying and then the (Voice Overlap) to support an affirmance of the judgment (Voice Overlap)
1975.75-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,583.505,584.857,She relies on it.
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1723.194,1727.286,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-491,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1755.483,1761.835,"The grant of new trial you should get after judgment of conviction is reversed, is it not?"
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1767.052,1771.028,Yes.
1975.75-491,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1798.502,1811.457,"Mr. Bradley, before you get too deeply into this case, I am still little troubled by the procedure because I did not think your client -- I know do not know you were then the counsel or not, discovered this evidence until almost four months after the trial was over."
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1816.251,1869.418,"As I understand it, counsel at that time had saved the appeal of rights and when substitute counsel did take over the appeal and made the Brady point a subject of the appeal, by that time, there was the delay -- the time begin the run from the judgment of conviction that that was sometime after the trial and by that time I am frankly, I am surprised that there is a question about this because I simply assumed that we are all agreed that we are on the Court of Appeals on direct appeal on the Brady point and on the in effectiveness point with regard to the motion after trial than based on in effectiveness of counsel, but the Brady point as I understand it was definitely before the Court of Appeals on direct appeal."
1975.75-491,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1869.418,1874.612,Counsel -- in light of the claim of effective assistance of counsel?
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1874.612,1877.35,"No, we were not trial counsel."
1975.75-491,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1932.482,1936.332,How come that breached up to this point?
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1936.332,1938.511,And then I will proceed -- yes?
1975.75-491,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1938.511,1940.538,And you said it should not be kept from it?
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1940.538,1942.053,"Yes, and I will then --"
1975.75-491,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1942.053,1943.056,"(Voice Overlap), was it?"
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1943.056,1943.768,I am sorry?
1975.75-491,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1943.768,1945.418,It was not kept from it?
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1945.418,1946.388,Yes there -- the --
1975.75-491,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1946.388,1947.458,He never asked for it.
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1949.29,1950.677,It (Voice Overlap) kept --
1975.75-491,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1950.677,1951.355,(Voice Overlap)
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1951.355,1955.329,"Yes, in this way."
1975.75-491,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1980.887,1987.218,"Where did the prosecutor get this from, this information?"
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1987.218,1988.768,I do not know that as a matter of fact.
1975.75-491,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1988.768,1989.078,Well --
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1989.078,1990.651,Yes.
1975.75-491,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1990.651,1993.996,And the same -- the defense counsel had got it the same way?
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1993.996,1995.253,"Yes, yes Your Honor."
1975.75-491,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1995.253,1998.303,So how was the prosecutor preventing him from getting it?
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,1998.303,2003.468,"The prosecutor did not prevent, but the prosecutor withheld and that the withholding --"
1975.75-491,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2003.468,2007.019,"When he asked for it, did he give it to him?"
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,2007.019,2007.904,No.
1975.75-491,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2007.904,2009.662,But where the defense counsel get it?
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,2009.662,2013.608,"Found in the prosecutorâ€™s file, by looking in that file himself some four months --"
1975.75-491,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2013.608,2016.424,The prosecutor would have let him have it.
1975.75-491,1,21921,edwin_j_bradley,,2020.697,2028.344,No or there is nothing in the record indicate that this prosecutor behaving the way he had with respect to this evidence would have disclosed it.
1975.75-491,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3435.57,3438.546,Just one or two things Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.75-491,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3527.812,3531.389,That was Burks -- that was a case and when was that decided chronologically?
1975.75-491,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3531.389,3536.551,Four months after - it was decided three months after in October 1971.
1975.75-491,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3536.551,3537.219,After conviction?
1975.75-491,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3537.219,3543.847,"After the trial and conviction in this case and even in Burks, it was Burks who was victim and I believed it was clearly wrong as a matter of --"
1975.75-491,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3543.847,3546.937,This case someone added -- anti dated to this trial?
1975.75-491,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3546.937,3553.144,"The Evan case was 10 years earlier, but in Hayes which is the Tenth Circuit case which we cite, they approved Evans."
1975.75-491,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3566.39,3568.581,"(Voice Overlap) is that used to be the rule of evidence, is that right?"
1975.75-491,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3568.581,3569.848,That is right.
1975.75-491,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3596.293,3596.943,Thank you gentlemen.
