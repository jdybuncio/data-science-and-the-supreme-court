1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.092,"We'll hear arguments next in 71-1639, Broadrick against Oklahoma."
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,50.623,56.314,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.71-1639,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,210.434,213.799,Which would you regard as the more lenient to the two acts?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,213.799,219.531,I would suggest the Hatch Act is more lenient.
1972.71-1639,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,219.531,223.697,Let me ask you another question while I have you interrupted is the reverse.
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,228.463,230.925,"There were, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,230.925,234.923,Could one man say that the Federal Court should have abstained?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,234.923,235.519,"No, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,278.494,283.495,"Well, but then Younger against Harris involved a claim of over facial, over-breadth too, didn't it?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,289.908,290.264,"No, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,321.81,327.931,"You may not take but the disciplinary proceedings that were pending, whether they are administrative proceedings?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,327.931,329.246,"No, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,345.581,350.793,"Well, what I am not clear about is, what proceedings were pending when this action was brought?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,350.793,361.331,The proceedings that were pending were an action by the State Personnel Board and in effect have the Corporation Commission show cause why these employees and these employees should not be dismissed from their jobs.
1972.71-1639,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,361.331,362.643,Brought where?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,362.643,365.617,"By State Personnel Board, before the State Personnel Board."
1972.71-1639,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,365.617,366.288,That is what I say.
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,367.934,368.29,That is right.
1972.71-1639,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,368.29,369.655,There was no court proceeding pending?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,369.655,370.296,"That is correct, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,370.296,381.817,"So I gather that if this is 1983 suit, your thought would be that there is no requirement in actions under that Section, to exhaust administrative remedies?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,381.817,383.764,"That is correct, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,383.764,386.452,What is the basis for this?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,386.452,386.813,Sir because --
1972.71-1639,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,386.813,390.848,I thought it was normally adapted and exhausted at administrative level?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,390.848,391.171,"Well, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,399.075,401.459,Is that jurisdictional matter?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,401.459,401.844,No sir.
1972.71-1639,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.216,411.048,So you do not think --- you think if it had a defect to disregard or it's somehow there -- it just isn't here --
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,411.048,413.875,"It is not before the Court in this case, yes sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,428.113,429.674,"Now, this came from the Federal Court, didn't it?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,429.674,430.129,"Yes, sir, it did."
1972.71-1639,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,430.129,433.657,And we could notice that it was plainary?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,433.657,435.071,I would assume --
1972.71-1639,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,435.071,437.663,"But you brought it under 1983, didn't you?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,437.663,438.204,Pardon.
1972.71-1639,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,438.204,440.782,Was that your jurisdictional ground in 1983?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,440.782,441.828,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,442.378,449.828,"Well, haven't we in many cases held that in actions under 1983, there is no requirement to exhaust the administrative remedies?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,449.828,450.061,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,450.811,452.811,"Alright, isn't that your answer?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,452.811,455.115,"Yes, sir, it is."
1972.71-1639,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,455.115,461.163,Do you know of any case that the administrative proceeding like this was disregarded?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,462.646,463.034,"No, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,482.226,485.314,You never had an authoritative decision from your State Court?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,485.314,496.553,"Sir, we have had two decisions involving Oklahoma Merit Act and these simply were questions raised as of the validity of Merit Act and essentially whether or not they could delegate certain rule making functions to the State Personnel Board."
1972.71-1639,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,505.614,510.164,"Mr. Buckingham, are you challenging the Oklahoma statute on the ground of vagueness?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,510.164,511.781,"And over-breadth, both sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,511.781,523.018,"I read your questions presented both in the jurisdictional statement and in your brief, and I do not find any mention of the word vagueness anywhere."
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,529.296,530.604,"No, sir, we have not, Your Honor."
1972.71-1639,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,623.898,633.34,"That maybe, but I agree with your questions presented, and I find nothing like that in your brief?"
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,633.34,636.879,Which of your questions presented perhaps can we can get at more specifically?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,644.637,646.959,"Well, I can very honestly state to the Court."
1972.71-1639,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,671.298,679.479,"But, the third question on page 5 on the jurisdictional statement says, “take part of the management and affairs by the political party.”"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,679.479,681.151,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,681.151,683.427,"But, in any of that, you are not conceding that?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,683.427,687.507,"No, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,700.908,712.695,"Your number three is almost precisely the language of the Hatch Act, is it not or at least its thrust is precisely the same, management or affairs?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,712.695,713.01,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,715.437,721.994,"So in that sense, you do not think it is either more broad or less broad than preceding case?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,721.994,728.852,"Well, I would have to agree Your Honor that if it is about same language, it could not be one way or the other."
1972.71-1639,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,728.852,733.034,This language is taken directly from the unnumbered Paragraph seven?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,733.034,733.32,"Yes, sir"
1972.71-1639,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,733.32,734.566,It is an exact --
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,734.566,734.732,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,734.732,736.018,-- the same language --
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,736.018,738.175,Yes sir.
1972.71-1639,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,738.175,747.175,"Well I suppose your state courts might give those words a different reach than where the Federal Court gives the reach of the Federal statute, does it not?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,747.175,747.939,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,748.896,751.472,So the identity or work something that might do this?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,751.472,752.176,"No, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,752.176,767.198,Did the three-judge District Court before whom your case went in Oklahoma have to construe the statute in order to reach the determination that it did? It is hard to tell from their opinion I think?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,767.198,772.251,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,890.389,901.151,"Well, doesn't that mean that the impact of this is as reading the statute as that the people on the very top and the people on the very bottom are not covered for totally different reasons?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,901.151,905.144,"No sir, I have read it a little different insofar as unclassified --"
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,905.144,911.361,But you wouldn't exclude the part-time farm laborer for policy reasons which is kind of --
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,911.361,912.247,I would have to agree.
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,914.604,922.147,"But, you might want to cover the man who is head of the Agriculture Department as a policy maker?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,922.147,922.738,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,922.738,926.44,The question is whether they have done that as precisely as they should?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,926.44,938.054,"Well, under the act, there are certain designated agencies which are designated as classified, certain employees are classified, then the governor may select certain classified employees."
1972.71-1639,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,975.267,980.769,Does the term classified in your statute connote job tenure of some sort?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,980.769,990.868,"Well, I would assume sir that classified would connote some kind of tenure insofar as connection with the Oklahoma Merit Act, some kind of a repugnance in that regard, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,990.868,1003.199,"And so what the legislature has basically done it is saying that employees who have that kind of tenure are barred from this type of political activities and employees who do not have that kind of tenure, aren't barred."
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1003.199,1007.053,That would be a rationale.
1972.71-1639,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1007.053,1011.669,Incidentally your named plaintiffs were employees of the Corporation Commission?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1011.669,1012.722,"That is correct, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1012.722,1015.839,Is this a partisan office in Oklahoma?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1015.839,1016.253,"No, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1039.743,1041.955,Then it is a partisan?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1041.955,1045.598,"Yes, it is a part of the Commissioner's -- yes."
1972.71-1639,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1057.118,1059.174,They run on their party labels?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1059.174,1060.585,"Well, it is an open race, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1065.101,1067.213,"Say, what a four-year term or six-year term?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1067.213,1068.103,"Six-year term, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1068.103,1069.517,Six-year term.
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1071.854,1072.763,"$19,500"
1972.71-1639,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1072.763,1074.095,"$19,500?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1074.095,1076.19,"Yes sir, Chairman."
1972.71-1639,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1076.19,1084.312,"For the chairman, $19,000, for the members it's -- and what are the functions of the Commission?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1084.312,1101.541,"The Corporation races off as rather broad and extensive functions, generally regulating public utilities as such and next regulating versatile companies and what we refer to as the area of oil and gas conservation and related matters, transportation."
1972.71-1639,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1101.541,1104.657,So it has some of the same functions as the Railroad Commission does?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1104.657,1105.118,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1110.369,1111.523,Mr. Buckingham?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1111.523,1112.925,Yes sir.
1972.71-1639,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1112.925,1119.229,I think I understood you to say that you would consider the Oklahoma Act more restrictive than the Federal Act?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1119.229,1120.989,Yes sir.
1972.71-1639,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1120.989,1125.728,Did you say to the court the word privately is in the Oklahoma Act and --?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1125.728,1126.974,"No, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1129.149,1131.034,"Well, I am not sure."
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1131.034,1140.959,The Hatch Act does recognize certain political activity which they recognize that employees could engage in.
1972.71-1639,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1172.115,1199.038,"(Inaudible) Judge of court in paragraph nine, conclusions of law, there is an interpretation of your act to the effect that it does not restrict public and private expressions on public affairs and personalities, so long as employee does not channel his activity to a party's success."
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1209.079,1209.859,No sir.
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1330.682,1350.048,Will isn't that other factors a legislature takes into account that is that they do not want to put a premium on having a man enlarge his staff for any particular departments in order to have that many more people to work on political activities?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1350.048,1351.384,"Well, I have to agree --"
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1351.384,1352.913,"I mean, that is a legitimate factor?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1352.913,1353.265,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1426.416,1435.649,And you do seem to place some emphasis and I am not sure in what respect on people wearing a button and saying I am for this man or that man.
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1441.795,1445.385,I think the putting on a button is an expression of political opinion.
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1467.227,1477.115,"Then, let us just take that in the office now, wearing a button, “I am for Governor Jones' reelection or what not” or, “I am for the other man.”"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1501.46,1507.639,"Sir, if they can show that there is a compelling need to do that, if there is some legitimate --"
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1507.639,1515.45,"Now I have stated all the need, now do you say that need as I have outlined it, is not a legitimate state interest?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1515.45,1527.63,"Well, I think it possibly could be under your hypothetical where you said during office hours, but you see the prohibition is included in the Oklahoma statute are not restricted to during office hours."
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1527.63,1532.07,"Well, they might be construed that way by the state courts in a particular case, might they not?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1532.07,1541.689,"Well, they haven't been construed by the only other -- which is the State Personnel Board and which is adapted rules, they have not put such a restriction in there."
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1541.689,1560.13,"But you concede that it would be a valid exercise of judicial power for the courts of Oklahoma to say that's valid as a limitation during office hours and in the building where you work, but it is invalid outside of office hours and outside of the building?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1560.13,1564.787,"If they determine that there was actually something that pervasive about it, Your Honor --"
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1564.787,1569.339,"But I thought you conceded that during office hours, this would be divisive?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1569.339,1575.533,I assumed Your Honor correctly or incorrectly that taking your presumption with that determination that it was divisive.
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1577.871,1589.629,"Well then -- but do you think, independent of your view of it, do you think a legislature is constitutionally barred from thinking that it is divisive and legislating on that assumption?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1589.629,1596.358,"My personal opinion insofar as the position of our case is sir that, that is going too far."
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1596.734,1597.965,Even during office hours?
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1597.965,1614.601,"Even during office hours, I think the fact that you have a car sitting out in your parking lot with a bumper sticker on it that “I am for x” and you will say well that car is sticking out in that parking lot with that bumper sticker on it, that is so divisive that we're going to prohibit that."
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1620.741,1630.061,"Do you think the Federal Court has the power, has the duty constitutionally to say that the legislature of Oklahoma cannot think otherwise?"
1972.71-1639,0,29136,john_c_buckingham,,1630.061,1665.527,"No sir, I think the Federal Court has a duty of looking what the state legislatures are trying to accomplish and at the same time, weighing those rights against the First Amendment rights which this Court has so zealously protected and saying there are going to be times, and there are going to be situations where we should establish guidelines of what should be permissible and should not be permissible insofar as the impairment of those rights, and that is where I think we are here at this time."
1972.71-1639,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1682.12,1684.523,Very well.
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1686.031,1689.908,"Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1639,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1846.869,1851.762,I have great difficulty with this private expression.
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1856.14,1880.899,"Well, Your Honor, I might first state that this prohibition is related only to an employee who is taking part in the management or affairs of a political party or political campaign, but it is not restricted to his voicing his opinion on matters of public personalities or affairs."
1972.71-1639,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1880.899,1890.835,"The only explanation I am asking for is my private expression of my opinion, what does that mean?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1890.835,1893.162,This is not defined in the Act.
1972.71-1639,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1894.903,1896.39,What do you think it means?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1896.39,1902.025,What do I think it means?
1972.71-1639,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1904.528,1912.645,"Doesn't it mean that if he is at a party with his friends at home, he can express it and if he is out on a platform, he can't."
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1914.062,1916.188,"Well, I think it is a matter of degree, because you can --"
1972.71-1639,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1916.188,1917.703,"Well, isn't that a matter of degree?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1917.703,1920.389,"Yes, that is Your Honor, but I do not believe that --"
1972.71-1639,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1920.389,1923.345,"Well, it depends on the size of the party, wouldn't it?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1923.345,1925.748,This is true Mr. Justice.
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1938.912,1941.946,"This legislation was enacted in 1959, was it?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1941.946,1943.28,Yes.
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1943.28,1948.63,"And before that time, was there any similar legislation in your state?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1948.63,1950.206,"No, there was none."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1950.206,1957.0,And this legislation came along at the same time as the creation of a classified service came along?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1957.0,1957.655,"Yes, it did."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1957.655,1967.14,"Prior to that time, had there been any category of public employment in your state that was equivalent to Federal Civil Service?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1967.14,1967.563,No.
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1967.563,1968.51,Non-political?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1968.51,1970.085,"No, there was none."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1970.085,1972.348,"So, it all came along together in 1959?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1972.348,1973.45,"Yes, it did."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1973.45,1985.012,"And none of it really has been, that is the meaning of these two paragraphs we have before us here, it has never been the subject of construction and interpretation by the courts of the state, have they?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1985.012,1995.048,"No, the only authority of interpretation that has been made, has been made in regard to Attorney General’s opinion that has been issued over the years and there have been a number of those."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1995.048,1999.628,Has he ever purported to explain what was meant by private expression of opinion?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,1999.628,2002.558,"No, that question has not been asked."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2018.098,2020.853,Who can request for Attorney General’s opinion?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2020.853,2032.509,"Attorney General’s opinion can be requested by statute, can be requested by state legislature, an agency head, it cannot be requested by a private citizen, no."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2032.509,2035.921,The agency had the legislature as a whole or any legislature?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2035.921,2039.125,"Member, any member of legislature."
1972.71-1639,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.125,2051.699,"Is there any practice in your state as there was in Arizona where I came from, where a private citizen wanted an Attorney General’s opinion, he would ask his legislator who would in turn ask the Attorney General?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2051.699,2057.688,This is done quite often.
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.742,2063.893,"Can you tell what that -- really cares what that means, at least nobody has, is that it?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2063.893,2064.754,No one has asked.
1972.71-1639,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2074.467,2077.985,"I gather what you said earlier, you are not unhappy it hasn't been asked?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2077.985,2081.23,"Well, I would hate to have to write it, Your Honor.[Laughter]"
1972.71-1639,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2081.23,2088.565,But you are -- you don't object to the (Inaudible)
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2088.565,2089.356,"No, I do not object."
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2089.356,2097.704,You think (Inaudible) that's a reasonable construction of the act?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2097.704,2101.459,"Yes, I do."
1972.71-1639,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2101.459,2104.143,Has the Oklahoma Court ever decided it?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2104.143,2112.941,"No, the Oklahoma Court has never construed either these two paragraphs."
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.99,2166.006,Is the record clear as to what (Inaudible)
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2166.006,2169.395,"Yes, it is, Justice."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2211.003,2214.862,"That was for the reelection of an incumbent Commissioner, (Inaudible) Jones?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2214.862,2215.892,"Yes, it was, Justice."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2215.892,2216.93,Was he elected?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2216.93,2221.202,"Yes, he was."
1972.71-1639,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2239.401,2244.319,Could there be a state court proceeding under that stay?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2244.319,2249.036,"Well, the state was issued after a complaint had been filed in Federal Court."
1972.71-1639,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2249.036,2251.521,Does Oklahoma have declaratory judgment proceeding?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2251.521,2252.396,"Yes, they did Your Honor."
1972.71-1639,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2252.396,2261.91,"Well, would there be anyway any of these effected people could go to the Oklahoma Courts without having first to go through all of the administrative proceedings?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2261.91,2266.873,I believe it is possible that they could have gone into Federal Court.
1972.71-1639,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2266.873,2267.713,"No, the state courts?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2267.713,2271.883,"State court, and challenge the validity of the statute."
1972.71-1639,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2271.883,2274.815,Without waiting the outcome of the administrative proceedings?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2274.815,2279.82,I think the Personnel Board would have issued a stay in that situation also --
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.82,2292.15,"Well, was there -- in the administrative proceedings that were pending, was there a provision for an answer from the party where the issue is made up?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2292.15,2293.487,At the time the --
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2293.487,2300.133,Were there questions of coverage or violation that were going to be involved or --?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2300.133,2302.426,"Well, there were specific charges that were made."
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.712,2332.143,"The disposition by the Commission, is that then immediately subject to judicial reviews or some administrative appeal?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2332.143,2345.456,"In regard to the administrative hearing, there is a 10 day provision for a request for rehearing and the party found has 30 days in which to appeal to state court on the record."
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.456,2352.097,Has something that he is suspended or does the Court have power to stay a suspension or does the law say nothing of what happened until it completed the --
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2352.097,2357.037,Also board and the Court has the power to stay any order of the agency.
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2357.037,2362.161,"And what does he do, going to an Oklahoma trial court and to an Oklahoma appellate court?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2362.161,2363.993,He goes into an Oklahoma trial court.
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2363.993,2368.341,"And then what, as an intermediate to appellate court before he get to the Supreme Court?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2368.341,2369.199,"Yes, sir it is."
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.199,2372.189,Is it de novo in the trial court or is it on the record?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2372.189,2374.242,It is on the record.
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.242,2376.123,What is the standard of it?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2376.123,2378.957,Substantial evidence.
1972.71-1639,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2378.957,2389.067,Could this Commissioner who benefited by the work presumably of these people have asked the Attorney General for an opinion about these matters?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2391.508,2397.251,"Yes, he could have asked for an opinion."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2599.847,2601.364,"Well, what does that mean?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2621.677,2622.986,"Well, I do not really --"
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2622.986,2624.709,It would be on behalf of the party?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2624.709,2627.569,I do not believe we have had an independent run.
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2629.593,2630.633,We were told that some has.
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2630.633,2632.582,"Yes, in last race."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2650.287,2651.309,At least his candidacy.
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2651.309,2663.971,"Yes, someone working for that organization would be very similar to working for a party and as they are attempting to espouse to others, the beliefs of that individual through his organization and his platform."
1972.71-1639,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2663.971,2673.827,Suppose it is reasonable to assume that the Democratic candidate and a Republican candidate would consider that partisan political activity since it is aimed against them.
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,2673.827,2706.754,"Yes, I would think so, and I would think that the definition of party politics is broadly that which is aimed at instigating a state government a particular belief or espousing a particular platform, which currently has a two-party system but there are independents, and other parties, actually American party which -- are parties because they espouse a particular belief or attempt to set forth particular policies in state government which are unique onto themselves."

1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3022.383,3031.461,Does the governor has unrestrictive power at anytime to place any or all categories of state employees under the system?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3031.461,3046.348,"He has given authority by the Personnel Act to place agencies under the Merit System, and that authority does not exceed the exemptions that are already placed in the statute itself."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3054.914,3056.296,To do so or not to do so.
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3056.296,3059.74,Yes.
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.74,3071.022,Would you say that the reason for banning political activities by the classified employees is to insulate the employee from political pressure.
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3072.734,3075.244,I think that is one of the reasons.
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3085.159,3087.923,Why apply it to anybody?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3092.07,3118.306,"Well, the state unlike the Federal government did not till 1959 make prohibitions against political activity, and during this long period of years since 1907 since we have become a state, it has been apparent to the legislature that the political activity control of state employees was something which was not good for the state."
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3118.306,3121.901,So it was to insulate the employees from political pressure?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3121.901,3135.967,It was to insulate the employees and to prohibit a party from controlling the state and making its desires and wishes of the state instead of having a neutral state government which was not controlled by a party.
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3135.967,3139.755,What if an employee becomes a classified employee?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3141.554,3142.567,"Yes, it is."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3142.567,3144.835,And what are they?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3144.835,3151.836,"In a retirement system, he is not subject to dismissal except for cause that is under a statute."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3172.974,3182.9,"So again to be basically tenure, and can be discharged only for cause if he has to participate in a retirement system that is on the other employees who are employees at will I guess."
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3182.9,3191.144,"Well, the employees will -- non-classified employees also had access to retirement system, but they have no tenure in terms of their dismissal."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3191.144,3192.48,Or job security.
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3192.48,3194.667,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3194.667,3201.489,"Kicking an employee, say I am sorry, I do not want to be a classified employee."
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3203.705,3206.301,He has a choice in terms of where he applies to work.
1972.71-1639,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3206.301,3208.007,"Yes, but only that."
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3208.007,3211.502,Yes.
1972.71-1639,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3211.502,3219.497,"Mr. Martin, I understand it is agreed that the Personnel Board has the authority to promulgate regulations."
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3219.497,3220.176,"Yes, I do."
1972.71-1639,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3220.176,3233.379,"In the Appendix, you have as I read it only one regulation, that 1641 that deals with the substance of the issue here today."
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3240.562,3243.278,"No, I do not believe so, Justice."
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3268.672,3271.859,Are they published and available generally?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3271.859,3272.664,"Yes, they are."
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3282.204,3285.153,What if rules have evidence to what they actually mean?
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3285.153,3287.382,"Yes, they are."
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3287.382,3297.922,"How can you deal very sensibly with constitutionality without knowing what the act means and they are looking at what, that the evidence of that would be --"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3297.922,3310.353,"Well, the Personnel Board even though they had the authority to enact rules and regulations to further defining the prohibitions in the Section 818, they have not extensively done so."
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3313.414,3322.021,Well did they -- [Inaudible]
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3322.021,3326.089,We can make those available to the Court if they desire to look at it.
1972.71-1639,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3326.089,3327.696,"That might be useful, will you do that?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3327.696,3328.726,"Yes, I will."
1972.71-1639,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3328.726,3333.65,"Well, the three-judge court did not have access to that?"
1972.71-1639,1,36337,mike_d_martin,,3333.65,3353.032,"They had access to the one that was in the record, but they did not have access to all of them since the plaintiffs, appellants here particularly noted that they were not contesting those rules or regulations, just the statute."
1972.71-1639,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3409.637,3415.694,"Mr. Buckingham, I have a question or two if you have the moment on."
1972.71-1639,2,29136,john_c_buckingham,,3437.003,3439.241,"Yes sir, it is."
1972.71-1639,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3439.241,3453.422,Is it reasonable assumption for the legislature to think that they want to protect employees from being urged by the Commissioner to engage in political activity?
1972.71-1639,2,29136,john_c_buckingham,,3453.422,3456.982,"Very reasonable, Your Honor."
1972.71-1639,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3456.982,3468.006,Perhaps those who are requested and declined might not be so favorite if the Commissioner got reelected?
1972.71-1639,2,29136,john_c_buckingham,,3474.9,3475.313,Yes sir.
1972.71-1639,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3477.883,3491.678,So that would tend to sustain the Attorney General’s view that the purposes were prophylactic or to take Mr. Justice White’s term to insulate them from this kind of an influence.
1972.71-1639,2,29136,john_c_buckingham,,3491.678,3496.848,We do not contest the purpose and the aim and the object.
1972.71-1639,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3504.922,3513.191,"Well, are you challenging as applied here, the people who solicited money, received campaign contributions, and transported campaign materials?"
1972.71-1639,2,29136,john_c_buckingham,,3513.191,3526.365,What I am saying sir with regard to the statute that is involved is that the jurisdiction of the Court was aimed that the statute itself and so far as it is over-breadth and vague where these are concerned.
1972.71-1639,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3526.365,3537.17,Should anybody who is able to read had any doubt that this statute prohibited the kind of activity involved in this particular case?
1972.71-1639,2,29136,john_c_buckingham,,3537.17,3546.559,"Well, if we are to assume that we are talking about subscriptions and receipt of money there, I would say that you have to agree."
1972.71-1639,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3546.559,3548.564,That is what is involved in this case.
1972.71-1639,2,29136,john_c_buckingham,,3548.564,3562.167,"Yes, and so far as the charges if the court please now, these are charges where we are a long way or insofar as having action on those charges, these are the allegations that they made against the employees."
1972.71-1639,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3569.244,3583.605,"No, no we are merely talking about allegation, but you concede that these are proper grounds for a state to establish prohibitions, and that if they were found guilty of them, they could properly be disciplined."
1972.71-1639,2,29136,john_c_buckingham,,3583.605,3584.753,Yes sir.
1972.71-1639,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3620.346,3620.945,Thank you gentlemen.
