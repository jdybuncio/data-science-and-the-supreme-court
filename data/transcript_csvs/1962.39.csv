1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,724.818,729.912,"No, it's our view that the Court of Appeals established the law of the case for this particular case."

1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,851.99,855.744,I would submit that that I think is the proper issue before this Court.

1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,869.312,870.821,I'm sorry.

1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,887.61,894.344,I would -- certainly clear that this Court does not have to follow the erroneous reasoning from the Court of Appeals.
1962.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,979.145,982.257,That was [Inaudible]
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,982.257,986.007,But I don't know that anybody disagreed with the Court in that.

1962.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1299.693,1302.074,How big was the club?
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1302.074,1310.548,"He said it varied in size from about 30 members, I think, and then it was broken up later into about 15 or 16 members."

1962.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1393.548,1398.528,But he said that it could've been 15 times or could be more that he recalled seeing him.
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1398.528,1400.743,He couldn't recall.
1962.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1400.743,1404.163,"Well, he said, it could be 15, it could be more."
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1404.163,1407.288,But you have no present recollection in regard to the number of times.

1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1413.218,1413.748,What?
1962.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1413.748,1414.949,IN could've been every week?

1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1522.91,1535.095,"Well, the record shows exactly what I have read that there was a convention which Mr. Scarletto attended as an official delegate and was there and participated in the discussions."
1962.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1608.465,1611.412,Where are these findings that you referred?
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1611.412,1612.467,The BIA findings?
1962.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1612.467,1615.029,Yes.
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1615.029,1617.941,"Well, there were several opinions of the BIA."
1962.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1617.941,1621.36,"Did they make separate findings, that's what I was asking?"
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1621.36,1629.084,"Well, I have quoted from the transcript on page 6."
1962.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1629.084,1630.12,Six?
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1630.12,1639.582,"Yes in which the BIA made the following statement, and this was referring to a previous decision in which it had."

1962.39,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1675.784,1695.537,But the evidence [Inaudible]
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1695.537,1712.542,"Well, it recites, for example, at page 2 at great length what Elorriaga testified to but then at page 4 of that opinion, it points out that Elorriaga contradicted himself and that he was not going to make any findings on the basis of his testimony."
1962.39,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1712.542,1729.533,[Inaudible]
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1729.533,1755.501,"Yes, but I say that you would come to no different conclusion because if you eliminate their account of what Elorriaga testified to which you must on the basis of what they said at page 4 of that same opinion, you find merely Scarletto's testimony and that's all that Scarletto testified to was that he attended meetings with the respondent and that the respondent pay -- with the petitioner and that the petitioner paid dues."
1962.39,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1768.855,1793.033,[Inaudible]

1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1798.199,1801.011,"Well, that comes from Elo -- Elorriaga's testimony."
1962.39,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1801.011,1812.763,[Inaudible]
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1812.763,1813.953,That's correct.

1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1817.302,1825.892,"Yes, but I say they're no different from what I said, with the exception of that other matter which I say was Elorriaga's testimony and was discounted."
1962.39,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1826.376,1860.237,[Inaudible]

1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,1895.141,1901.898,"Well, I think that's the heart of the case as to who has to prove deportability."
1962.39,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2005.325,2017.451,How'd make some [Inaudible]
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2017.451,2017.93,Well --
1962.39,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2017.93,2019.314,Is that a possible distinction?
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2019.314,2021.869,"I submit no, it's not a possible distinction."
1962.39,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2033.145,2049.668,[Inaudible]
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2049.668,2052.032,I don't have to argue that case here.
1962.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2086.687,2091.05,"Mr. Rein, I -- don't we have to begin with the statute?"
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2122.39,2123.917,"No, I'm not --"
1962.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2123.917,2124.683,-- isn't that correct?
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2124.683,2125.852,That's correct.
1962.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2125.852,2164.111,"And Rowoldt, as I understand the Government's argument at least says that the terms of the -- that the -- to be sure the statute says that, but if it can be shown affirmatively by the petitioner, that he wasn't -- that his membership was not a political kind of a membership, that it was not as you say a meaningful membership as the -- the court said in that case, then he doesn't come within the statute, but isn't it enough beginning with the statute which is where it normally begins for the Government to prove his membership and certainly that was proven here, was it not?"
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2164.111,2166.124,The answer to that clearly is no.
1962.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2166.124,2166.909,"Well, now why?"
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2166.909,2177.669,"Because Rowoldt says that being a member of the Communist Party, as a matter of fact, Galvan, despite the language of the statute is not enough to be deportable, that you must show more."
1962.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2177.669,2182.852,"Well, you must under Galvan show knowing membership and didn't the Government show that here?"
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2182.852,2186.407,You must show membership which is meaningful according to Rowoldt --
1962.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2186.407,2186.848,I'm talking about Galvan.
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2186.848,2190.42,-- which contains necessary political implications.
1962.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2210.547,2215.691,"Mr. Scales didn't involve the statute which had -- which talked about membership in the Communist Party, did it?"
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2215.691,2216.529,It said member.
1962.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2216.994,2218.832,Of the Communist Party?
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2218.832,2222.587,Member in an organization that advocates the overthrow of Government by force and violence.
1962.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2222.587,2225.321,"Well, it might have been a question under the criminal statute."
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2225.321,2239.099,"Well, may I say that this Court thought it was the same question because it argued on the basis of Rowoldt and Galvan that you should have a similar construction in Scales as the Court had previously given to the Rowoldt case."
1962.39,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2242.291,2245.365,[Inaudible]
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2245.365,2261.721,"Well, I think I have but let's -- leaving that aside, there is no question that Rowoldt held that it is not enough to prove just membership in the Communist Party that you have to prove something more."
1962.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2261.721,2264.006,Did Rowoldt say anything about the burden of proof?
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2264.006,2265.362,No.
1962.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2265.362,2269.474,"So Rowoldt didn't hold that it was not enough for the Government just to prove membership, did it?"
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2269.474,2273.076,"Well yes, it held what was necessary for the deportability --"
1962.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2273.076,2273.256,(Voice Overlap) --
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2273.256,2278.791,"-- and I would assume -- I would assume from the decision, I think there's no reason."

1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2445.752,2446.455,That's correct.
1962.39,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2448.434,2457.784,[Inaudible]
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2457.784,2474.284,"That is exactly my position, that there just is not enough evidence and that it cannot be bolstered by saying that even though there is not enough evidence to support the order, he's deportable because he didn't come forward to show that he was not deportable."
1962.39,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2475.675,2485.183,[Inaudible]
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2485.183,2505.147,I think it would be much preferable for the Court to decide the case on the basis made out here rather than on the -- I agree that the aberrations of the Court of Appeals is probably no part of the issue before the Court here and need not be -- and it would not be appropriate and necessarily for the Court to consider it.
1962.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.147,2524.175,"So, I gather you would indicate that fair membership in the Communist Party is unless shown otherwise meaningless membership and -- if all you show is a membership and haven't shown anything meaningful, you must show something besides membership."
1962.39,0,21463,david_rein,,2524.175,2525.396,That's correct.
1962.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.396,2548.33,"And that it -- and your contention is that, that there's no ground for saying that membership in an organization like the Communist Party is meaningful and that all go into a certain case, a person might be able to show that it isn't meaningful doesn't have the burden to do it."

1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3731.592,3732.239,It had?
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3732.239,3734.352,It said -- it says more than just membership.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3734.352,3735.402,What did it say?
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3735.402,3759.24,"It is -- it -- the Court in -- in Galvan said at page 528 of 347 United States v.

1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3759.584,3763.709,"Now, isn't every bit of that proven in Rowoldt?"
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3767.08,3777.642,This Court found that it wasn't for the reason that Rowoldt's un-contradicted statement was that he joined the Party for other than political reasons.

1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3787.319,3792.124,And it said the reason he joined the Communist Party was because he was fighting for something to eat and he was looking for the necessities of life.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3792.124,3795.399,"Well, do you mean it has to be precise -- just precisely that."
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3795.399,3798.998,"Well, I'm assuming that there's more content than just the con -- just the conclusion."
1962.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3832.239,3845.26,"Mr. Terris, you truly lose me along the way when you say that Rowoldt having more than membership and that you must have more than membership and the Government must show meaningful membership."
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3848.629,3850.063,That's right.

1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3888.273,3893.128,What the Court said was it meant -- may well have been devoid of any political implications.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3909.854,3914.909,"Your Honor, the only -- the only lack of the solidity of proof is -- is this lack."
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3928.166,3929.415,"Well, he didn't say that --"
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3929.415,3931.46,-- that that was the crucial thing.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3931.46,3939.733,"He didn't say that the evidence showed it was devoid of political implications in the opinion here, as I read it."
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3940.023,3940.607,That's right.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3940.607,3958.649,"I can agree readily on it that the test is a very loose one of what is meaningful, but I have found a difficulty of this term, up to this time, why -- that was not as much or more have justified deportation in Rowoldt as in this case?"
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3958.649,3977.121,"Your Honor, he -- the majority went on also to say and I gather that -- that this also a part of what it thought was lacking, presumably, he, Rowoldt had to live on something and further inquiry might have elicited that he was getting the necessities of life where he's worked in the bookshop nor was there a hint in the record that this was not a bona fide bookshop."
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3988.258,3989.488,He's been a member a year.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4005.715,4013.933,"Well, Your Honor, if you -- if you compare the facts in Niukkanen and in Rowoldt, they're not tremendously differently."
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4074.909,4076.479,"Well, Mr. Terris, let me ask you this question."
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4108.161,4120.545,There is evidence in this case that is different and it seems to me in at least three important respects why this case is stronger.
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4140.109,4141.754,Two years instead of one.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4141.754,4146.279,That -- that difference but also more important is the time.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4170.301,4173.988,Do you suppose anybody doubted it in 1935?

1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4174.991,4178.638,They had -- they were running candidates to various places there.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4179.966,4181.621,"Well, Mr. Rowoldt apparently --"
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4181.621,4184.89,-- a reason to believe that that was a political organization then.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4184.89,4192.346,"Well, Mr. Rowoldt apparently doubted because he -- he apparently joined it to get something to eat and --"
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4192.346,4200.457,"But I thought he told them when he -- when they asked him that, but he also paid dues and went to meetings, attended meetings regularly for a year."

1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4212.073,4221.361,"I'm -- the only evidence was a statement and that was the equivalent of testimony because under the Board's rules, if -- it allows the admission of statements."

1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4223.892,4224.603,That's right.
1962.39,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4226.4,4228.19,But did he -- petitioner testified?
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4228.19,4228.923,Pardon me.
1962.39,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4228.923,4232.414,"That if petitioner testified, he would never have to choose."

1962.39,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4232.992,4233.582,In --
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4233.582,4235.552,"In Rowoldt, but he didn't testify, Your Honor."

1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4240.178,4244.716,Well now let's -- let's get back to my question if we can.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4260.058,4260.486,That's right.
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4261.497,4263.02,Was there any -- is there any --
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4263.02,4277.047,The other -- the other important thing is that there is testimony in this record that he was a member -- that he attended at least a few executive meetings and that he was apparently an officer of his local unit.
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4278.449,4282.023,Is there a finding to that effect that he was an officer?
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4282.023,4297.293,"I -- there isn't an explicit finding, Your Honor, but that's how I read this on page 2 of the record which Mr. Justice Goldberg was -- is alluding to, that for several months, an attempt was made to make the respondent a leading figure in the unit of the Communist Party."
1962.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4300.605,4308.036,"Well, was there any evidence to support that other than nowhere here on page 72 of the record?"
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4310.739,4311.886,I think -- let's see.
1962.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4311.886,4317.934,Well it's at 69.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4323.085,4323.539,That's right.
1962.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4324.811,4325.499,That's all there was to it.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4325.499,4326.983,That's right.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4326.983,4327.681,Which one was that (Voice Overlap) --
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4327.681,4341.499,"The record in this case, the actual record which you don't have here is some 300 -- 250 pages long, but almost all of it is on cross-examination in the light which doesn't go directly to the issues."
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4341.499,4343.257,Which one of the two witnesses testified (Voice Overlap) --
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4343.257,4344.782,Elorriaga.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4371.902,4377.607,"Now, what was read from awhile ago as to the effect that they were -- they didn't have to resolve that difference?"
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4377.607,4383.106,There -- there was one discrepancy in the testimony which was not brought up before the special inquiry officer.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4425.657,4429.472,Did the Board decide that he was an official?
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4429.472,4429.826,"Your Honor, the only --"
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4429.826,4430.968,I don't see it here.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4430.968,4443.375,The only -- the only -- the only actual reference to that point which is in any of its opinions is the sentence that I've pointed out to you on page 2.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4448.119,4453.182,It seems to me that this is very unsatisfactory set of findings.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4467.027,4467.206,"Well, I don't --"
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4467.206,4469.546,I can see that they said that he was a voluntary member.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4471.713,4478.033,"Well then later on, Your Honor, I didn't come back to the -- this part of your earlier suggestion to me."
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4498.746,4502.436,Now what -- where are the findings on which they based that?
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4505.919,4508.927,"Well, I think the findings that -- the findings are the same."
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4508.927,4510.063,They did not make any (Voice Overlap) --
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4510.063,4510.671,New findings --
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4510.671,4511.021,-- findings of fact.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4511.021,4512.486,There was no new testimony.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4512.486,4515.343,So we have to look back at page 2.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4515.343,4516.494,That's right Your Honor.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4516.494,4519.835,"And that's the part, it seems to me to be very unsatisfactory, the findings of fact."
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4519.835,4523.155,I think -- I think there is another point and I can't find it at the moment.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4529.846,4531.198,"Well, there's no doubt about that."
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4531.198,4531.6,That's right.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4532.246,4534.334,But that's what Rowoldt is?
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4534.334,4534.744,That's right.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4539.969,4540.788,That's right.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4542.143,4544.837,That -- that is the most important difference in --
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4544.837,4548.665,That's -- those are the only differences you know of.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4548.665,4549.833,And the ones that I've --Yes.
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4550.527,4550.652,Yes.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4577.67,4580.06,"I would think -- I would think that's correct, Your Honor."
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4580.06,4584.67,Don't you think that's -- do you think that's a meaningful distinction?
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4594.181,4605.473,"Well, I'm not so sure in the next case to figure -- I'm not so sure in the next case that the Government is going to let them -- those kinds of statements go un-contradicted."
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4605.473,4607.762,"Well, there might be no way the Government couldn't -- might be no way the Government can (Voice Overlap)."
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4607.762,4612.149,"Well, it's possible that more evidence could have been gotten even in this case."
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4612.45,4613.214,It could say that a man --
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4613.214,4613.393,Scar --
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4613.393,4615.325,-- 10 years ago wasn't hungry for some reason --
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4615.325,4615.482,Well --
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4615.482,4623.548,-- or other and joined the Party that promised him some food and some better condition in life.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4623.548,4627.716,Well -- you can't -- you may not be able to contradict that directly.
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4632.309,4633.707,I beg your pardon?
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4633.707,4638.617,"Scarletto and Elorriaga were at meetings in which petitioner was present, Communist Party meetings."
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4662.202,4684.896,"Well, isn't that a little strange that in a proceeding of this kind where they bring two witnesses to testify how many times a man has attended inside meetings, that they wouldn't ask him one word about whether the man had talked to -- whether he discussed any problems, whether he'd advocated anything, whether he'd taken any action at all?"
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4702.986,4703.953,That's right Your Honor.
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4703.953,4710.368,And still there's nothing in this record to indicate that he did anything meaningful at any of those meetings.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4710.44,4710.7,That's right.
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4711.123,4711.934,Why is that --
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4711.934,4712.279,I may say that --
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4712.279,4715.075,-- a proceeding comes to us in that manner?
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4715.075,4724.025,"I think the reason it did, Your Honor, because at that time, both sides believe that just being a member of the Communist Party."
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4736.526,4740.738,"Well then, why shouldn't that go back from now and be heard in the light of Rowoldt?"
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4740.738,4742.935,"It did, Your Honor."
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4750.843,4750.985,It didn't allow reopening.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4750.985,4753.811,"-- to the Board the first time in -- yes, it did."
1962.39,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4761.252,4762.497,Did he have a lawyer?

1962.39,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4764.726,4769.67,Did his lawyer ask him anything about whether they talked or go to the meeting?

1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4794.126,4803.793,"That -- well, he -- what happened when it went back, he said, he said that the Board -- all he was arguing was that under Rowoldt, the evidence was insufficient."
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4824.877,4828.572,But they're having no additional findings of facts.

1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4837.768,4838.933,43 years.
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4838.933,4841.17,At the moment he's been here 43 years.
1962.39,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4843.805,4847.177,"How old is he now, Mr. Terris?"
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4847.177,4849.59,He's 53.
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4878.296,4884.746,Is there any indication in the record that he's ever done anything unlawful unless he was joining the Communist Party --
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4884.746,4885.185,"No, Your Honor."
1962.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4885.185,4886.225,-- within that 43 years?
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4886.225,4893.22,"But of course, that isn't the test under this provision of the statute."
1962.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4959.594,4961.693,What were dues by way?
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4961.693,4969.509,"I -- the dues themselves, the actual assessments I think were a dollar a month but then they gave special assessments for -- for drives and things like that."
1962.39,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4986.278,4989.841,What period was it that he was a member for 3 years?
1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,4989.841,4998.535,"He was from -- he was 48 -- the Board said 1948 or 1949 to the end of 1950, at least to the end of 1950."

1962.39,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,5032.367,5035.995,But Galvan said the test was whether he joined the Communist Party --
