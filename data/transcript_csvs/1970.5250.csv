1970.5250,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,122.021,124.858,Was this while he was a fugitive?
1970.5250,0,42469,thomas_c_binkley,,124.858,128.005,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1970.5250,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,1262.564,1266.026,May it please the Court.

1970.5250,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,1285.087,1287.707,I’ve gone the wrong way.
1970.5250,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1287.707,1289.168,Very well.
1970.5250,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,1289.168,1290.044,It is going down.
1970.5250,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1290.044,1294.603,We have some very tall men here today.
1970.5250,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,1297.525,1311.359,This quotation on page 12 to 13 in our brief is in volume 22 of the record which got lost at that time.
1970.5250,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1394.596,1398.813,"Then I was mistaken when I said it was opening statement, it was the argument of the jury."
1970.5250,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,1398.813,1423.072,"It was the argument of the jury, it was the opening argument at the close of the case, but that appeared earlier the trial too and I call your attention to voir dire of the jury when they’re being picked and that took a lot of time because of the murder, there were 20 challenges, but I think its four times as they were groups called up."

1970.5250,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2545.219,2559.155,"Yes, but didn’t it help you quite a bit to have him cut loose from this, at least very much premeditated murder, motivated murder?"
1970.5250,2,42469,thomas_c_binkley,,2560.525,2560.843,Yes sir.
1970.5250,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2790.998,2792.804,"Thank you, Mr. Binkley, thank you Ms. Rosenberg."
