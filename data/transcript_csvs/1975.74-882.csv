1975.74-882,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,18.722,We will hear arguments first this morning in De Canas against Bica and Silver.
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,23.276,25.573,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-882,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,263.961,268.693,(Inaudible) is whether is this field has been preempted by Federal Legislations?
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,268.693,271.275,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-882,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,271.275,284.245,"Was it clear from the decision of the California Court of Appeals that your clients would have been entitled to relief under the California statute, had it -- the Court of Appeals not found it to be preempted?"
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,284.245,298.362,"I think that if you look at the appendix, Your Honor, in the Superior Court's opinion, he expresses the view that he had no doubt that we could have established the facts of the case."
1975.74-882,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,298.362,300.881,You are talking about the Superior Court rather than the Court of Appeals?
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,300.881,301.754,That is Correct.
1975.74-882,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,301.754,303.25,How about the Court of Appeals?
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,303.25,313.08,"I do not think the Court of Appeals really addressed that because the case went up on a demur, it was just considering the statutes, the validity of the statute itself."
1975.74-882,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,440.481,445.73,"Mr. Catz, the statute is conditional."
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,459.69,460.703,"Yes, there has Your Honor."
1975.74-882,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,468.683,470.074,Where is it now?
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,470.074,472.553,"That is at page 3A, petitioners' reply brief."
1975.74-882,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,472.553,473.664,"Of your reply brief, page 3A?"
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,473.664,474.974,Yes.
1975.74-882,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,716.506,725.035,"Is that the Federal Statute to impose a penalty for knowingly employ an alien, (Inaudible) could that ever pass?"
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,725.035,725.725,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-882,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,730.612,733.062,And where does it stand now?
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,733.062,734.836,It is -- we have heard testimony.
1975.74-882,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,748.355,750.098,"So it is still a live effort, is it?"
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,750.098,751.406,It very much is.
1975.74-882,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,751.955,756.191,"If that would have passed, would that make a difference?"
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,756.191,760.2,It might.
1975.74-882,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,782.437,796.965,"Mr. Catz I presume your case is stronger by virtue of the fact that Californiaâ€™s regulation is limited just to illegal aliens rather than if it had been addressed to all aliens, legally or illegal?"
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,796.965,801.177,"Well, it goes a little bit beyond the illegal aliens."
1975.74-882,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,846.685,851.717,If you deal with lawful aliens you have got problems with the cases like Truax against Raich?
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,851.717,860.856,"That is correct, but when I use the term lawful residence that is the definition that does not come from the Federal scheme."
1975.74-882,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,890.316,897.662,"I gather that (Inaudible) Appellate Courts has held as this one did, this is the second is it not?"
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,897.662,898.904,"That is correct, Your Honor"
1975.74-882,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,898.904,901.371,It has held that 2805 unconstitutional?
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,901.371,902.069,That is correct.
1975.74-882,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,916.409,918.88,And the California Supreme Court refused to review this one?
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,918.88,920.304,That is correct.
1975.74-882,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,920.304,924.185,Mr. Catz (Inaudible) my brother Rehnquist a moment ago.
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,947.006,948.174,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-882,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,948.827,951.446,"As determined by the Federal Authorities, by the (Inaudible)"
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,951.446,951.959,That is correct.
1975.74-882,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,951.959,961.019,And to that extent you say this precisely is congruent with the Federal Classification and no more than effectuates the Federal Policy?
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,961.019,962.889,"That would be our position, Your Honor."
1975.74-882,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,992.78,1003.013,"And what is the sanction if any in the Federal Scheme, it is simply deportation of the alien, is it not?"
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,1003.013,1003.582,That is correct.
1975.74-882,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1058.456,1070.263,(Inaudible) response to my brother Stewart that this is congruent in its application with the Federal statute?
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,1070.263,1082.555,"Well, I am just saying that the Section 2805 merely adopts the standards that the United States Department of Labor utilizes in determining who can work."
1975.74-882,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1082.555,1087.601,"You mean that is the Schedule A, is it in the 29 CFR?"
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,1087.601,1088.803,That is correct.
1975.74-882,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1101.45,1105.319,Specifically then it is congruent with the Labor Department Regulations?
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,1105.319,1106.74,That is correct.
1975.74-882,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1106.74,1109.263,That was-- no particular Federal Statute?
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,1109.263,1123.603,"Well, that code of regulation of course is promulgated pursuant to the references in the Immigration Nationality Act inviting the Department of Labor to determine those occupations in which there is a shortage or surplus of labor."
1975.74-882,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.603,1130.644,"Well, there is a Federal Provision with respect to the employment of illegal aliens?"
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,1130.644,1131.455,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-882,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.891,1143.535,Yes.
1975.74-882,0,38992,robert_s_catz,,1159.729,1172.753,"Well, I would draw to the Court's attention for purposes of our preemption discussion, Section 15 of the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act Amendments of 1974 provide that --"
1975.74-882,1,45591,william_s_marrs,,1853.389,1856.788,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-882,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1895.259,1900.95,(Inaudible) State of California may do so?Mr.
1975.74-882,1,45591,william_s_marrs,,1900.95,1901.271,Yes.
1975.74-882,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.646,1916.435,You think the state laws are (Inaudible) separable or invalid the -- in part it might be not?
1975.74-882,1,45591,william_s_marrs,,1916.435,1917.79,I am not sure I understand the question.
1975.74-882,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.918,1926.699,"Well, the California Law at issue here -- it covers farms as well as industrial labor?"
1975.74-882,1,45591,william_s_marrs,,1926.699,1928.085,Yes.
1975.74-882,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.085,1933.928,What if it were in so -- if it -- let us assume that if it were just a Farm Labor Law it would be valid?
1975.74-882,1,45591,william_s_marrs,,1933.928,1935.235,I would disagree with that because --
1975.74-882,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.235,1945.686,"Well, let us assume that it was, could this law be upheld insofar as it applied to farm labor?"
1975.74-882,1,45591,william_s_marrs,,1945.686,1961.722,"If 2805 applied only to farm labor, I would say that it could not be upheld because the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act took into account the state scheme, but that was as far as the Safety and the Health Standards."
1975.74-882,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.684,2037.012,"When would see other alien, you mean the green card people that come across on a daily basis --"
1975.74-882,1,45591,william_s_marrs,,2037.012,2037.726,I will get to those.
