1966.78,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,29.407,"No. 78, Department of Employment, et. al., appellants versus United States, et al."
1966.78,0,31793,james_d_mckevitt,,30.863,33.595,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?"
1966.78,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,581.182,595.818,"What are the particular respects which to your mind most clearly differentiate the Red Cross and National Banks for purposes of this question, the legal issue here?"
1966.78,0,31793,james_d_mckevitt,,595.818,609.413,"Mr. Justice Fortas, my answer to that is Title X or, excuse me, Title XXII and that is this: that Congress has set forth a great number or many more controls over the instrument of National Banks."
1966.78,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,628.129,629.941,You have this in your Brief?
1966.78,0,31793,james_d_mckevitt,,629.941,631.125,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1966.78,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,973.957,999.701,"Before you get to that, do you have any comment to make on the colloquy between Congressman Ikard and Congressman Mills, the chairmen of the Committee that reported the Bill out in which Mr. Mills said, “the gentlemen have very clearly stated when I say the understanding that I have of the Bill in this respect.”"
1966.78,0,31793,james_d_mckevitt,,1012.961,1017.069,"Mr. Chief Justice, I was going to answer that question, my third argument but I'll answer briefly now."
1966.78,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1065.741,1068.03,"Well, it states your position."
1966.78,0,31793,james_d_mckevitt,,1068.03,1070.559,"Alright, sir."
1966.78,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1137.655,1143.88,"Well, the United States (Inaudible) to one side was made a party to this case, wasn't it?"
1966.78,0,31793,james_d_mckevitt,,1144.383,1146.158,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, they were."
1966.78,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1146.158,1156.811,"And according to the counsel for the United States, that statute has been held many times not to be applicable to the United States."
1966.78,0,31793,james_d_mckevitt,,1158.899,1160.239,My answer to that is this.
1966.78,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1661.262,1670.322,"Are you satisfied that this is a proper case for a three-judge court? You have not briefed that point, have you?"
1966.78,0,31793,james_d_mckevitt,,1670.322,1676.218,I addressed my matters to the Court in the beginning of my Brief and I appreciate you bringing that point up.
1966.78,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1712.766,1728.005,"Well, if it works the other way around though and we think that the Red Cross is an instrumentality of the United States then what would your position based as to whether three-judge -- this is a proper case for three-judge court?"
1966.78,0,31793,james_d_mckevitt,,1728.005,1749.728,"Well, my position, it was in all candor I think it's hard though as an officer of this Court to openly advocate to say that the Livingstone case and the Arlington case don't resolve it because in effect, by dictum they probably do and in this Court would have jurisdiction and so would the US District Court, but there is a fine distinguishing factor there."
1966.78,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1756.399,1759.797,Mr. Levin?
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1759.797,1763.435,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.78,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1845.782,1850.475,"Fact that it was created by the Federal Government is of course not dispositive, is it?"
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,1850.475,1852.315,"No, it is not dispositive."
1966.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.815,2317.896,Do you say that the exempts to the Red Cross as the instrumentality rests on this Congressional assertion over the exemption or is this or just a judicial idea that federal instrumentalities should be exempt?
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2317.896,2365.388,"Well, Mr. Justice White, I submit first of all that it is an implied exemption from the Constitution that when Congress creates an organization, gives that important Federal functions to perform, arranges for to do so in close coordination with the United States Executive Agencies including the Military, State Department and when it provides some financial support for it and takes all the steps, which it has done with regard the American National Red Cross, that the Constitution grants it an immunity just as this Court held in McCulloch versus Maryland with regard to the original bank of the United States which, of course, was 80% owned by private shareholders and the 20% by the United States –"
1966.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.388,2376.585,But you don't think that the statute that we're dealing with here attempts to grant any more of an exception for federal instrumentality that would be true under the case law?
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2376.585,2384.398,"Well, I think that the Constitution is sufficient to achieve the purpose which we are here discussing."
1966.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.296,2412.83,You think any entity which performs to any extent as the federal instrumentality if the Federal instrumentality right across the board is short?
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2439.744,2452.192,I shouldn't think that if an organization did 5% of its work in close coordination with the government and 95% of its work privately that it would become an instrumentality of the United States.
1966.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.719,2478.219,But what (voice overlap) -- shouldn't take your time that you're going to cover but I would have – you might address yourself to why it has to be one way or the other.
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2482.523,2486.752,"For what might you said that it is partially tax exempt, the salaries –"
1966.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2486.752,2499.841,"Like a lot of charitable -- in fact laws of the United States, for example, might tax some operations of charitable Foundation than others?"
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2499.841,2504.181,I certainly think that would be conceivable solution that Congress could enact.
1966.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.681,2510.08,And so you do rely on this statute?
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2510.08,2511.561,No.
1966.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.06,2543.941,"So you think the constitutional immunity that you're talking, you're relying on that has no room in it for saying that “well, entity was performing for the United States in part and in part it isn't and to the extent it is exempt from paying taxes?"
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2543.941,2549.458,All I can say is that there had been no of such cases that I know of reaching that conclusion.
1966.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2567.896,2580.499,"Your assertion is that we should not reach the constitutional exemption of instrumentalities, any such construction either are or they aren't?"
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2581.733,2597.506,My position is that you need not reach that question in this case because the Red Cross' activities as I will demonstrate are 99% or 95% directed towards achieving its federal duties and that many of the things which –
1966.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.506,2601.273,Would you speak with that in Colorado?
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2601.273,2602.753,"Well, I'm talking about worldwide."
1966.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.753,2609.279,The record of that performance of the Red Cross in the State of Colorado --
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2609.279,2614.019,The record has very little in it about any specific activities within Colorado.
1966.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2625.446,2645.783,"Let us assume that in that State, the Red Cross does a very large amount of work and none of that, however, in that category about this [Inaudible] and all of that activity in the State are wholly private, unconnected, disconnected with the United States Government."
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2656.582,2658.357,I would try to answer your question this way.
1966.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.2,2713.893,And how come then that we don't need to record evidence about what the situation really is?
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2713.893,2716.054,"Well, I think we do have record of evidence."
1966.78,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2755.379,2756.082,May I ask?
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2767.811,2768.794,That is correct.
1966.78,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2768.794,2780.028,"Well, what difference does it make whether everything that it does in Colorado may be outside the -- may be the kind of thing which doesn't have a particular governmental phrase."
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2784.98,2785.868,Yes.
1966.78,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2785.868,2791.269,(Voice overlap) one way or another?
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2791.269,2794.987,"I would take the position that it's either one way or another, yes."
1966.78,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2805.536,2818.397,"Suppose that when an institution that the government selected, a waiver congressionally thought of coverage [Inaudible] by the Government under the same provision?"
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2818.397,2825.368,"I think that in that case, it could become an instrumentality of the United States and it would depend on the facts, such as the facts I'm here discussing."
1966.78,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2826.22,2831.454,"Well, that indicates doesn't that it's not at all one way or the other?"
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2837.572,2839.472,No.
1966.78,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2839.472,2843.913,-- used in collaboration with the government and it becomes immune from Federal taxation --
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2843.913,2845.162,"No, of course, not."
1966.78,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2895.115,2905.985,[Inaudible] institution which the Congress accepts to give tax exemptions [Inaudible]
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2905.985,2919.968,"Because I think this Court has traditionally held over the years that in the absence of a waiver where the organization is, as I've described it, it has by force of the Constitution itself a portion of the United States' immunity."
1966.78,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2919.968,2923.664,By force of the Constitution or acquiesce?
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2923.664,2926.577,By force of the Constitution.
1966.78,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2946.223,2948.824,[Inaudible]
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2948.824,2952.625,I think that that would be one factor to be taken into consideration.
1966.78,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2953.565,2965.283,"(Voice overlap) consideration as to whether to constitutionally exempt or whether it's impliedly exempt by Congress, a difference between constitutionally exempt?"
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2965.283,2967.981,"No, I've been using those two terms as meaning the same thing."
1966.78,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2992.792,2997.311,While it being a non-profit and a profit corporation?
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,2997.311,2998.209,It could be.
1966.78,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3017.033,3021.006,"But why, on the constitutional basis or on the non-constitutional?"
1966.78,1,31590,jack_s_levin,,3021.006,3023.922,On the constitutional basis.
