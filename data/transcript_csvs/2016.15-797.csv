2016.15-797,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.475,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case No. 15-797, Moore v. Texas. Mr. Sloan."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,6.475,18.91,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Atkins v. Virginia, this Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits executing people who are intellectually disabled."
2016.15-797,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,75.78,76.16,Those are --
2016.15-797,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,76.16,77.74,"I -- I -- excuse me, Chief Justice."
2016.15-797,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,77.74,81.29,That's a long laundry list of objections you have.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,118.98,120.96,It -- it did.
2016.15-797,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,170.68,171.41,"Well, Mr. Sloan, can I --"
2016.15-797,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,171.41,173.865,I have the same question as -- as the Chief Justice.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,199.35,200.31,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-797,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,209.32,218.8,"We wouldn't need that, would we, Mr. Sloan? We could say that the Briseno standards are in conflict with the old Atkins standards, as well as the new ones."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,223.79,225.02,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2016.15-797,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,225.02,235.72,"But you got in the door by a question presented that is a little more eye-catching, which is that they prohibit the current standards and rely on the outdated one."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,250.795,259.49,"Two points on that, Your Honor. First, again as I was saying, it is woven into the court of criminal appeals' decision."
2016.15-797,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,267.48,280.34,"Could I just make -- I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Sloan, but could I just make sure I understand that? Because what you're essentially saying is that the court of appeals said, you are barred from using new standards; you must use the Briseno standards."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,303.91,305.67,"That's -- that's exactly right, Your Honor."
2016.15-797,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,305.67,316.95,"Well, then why didn't you say that? I mean, really, the question presented talks about a comparison between current and outdated, and it seems -- it's pretty dramatic to say you can't use current standards; you're only using outdated."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,326.415,327.25,"No, that's correct."
2016.15-797,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,327.25,327.36,Okay.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,327.36,337.83,"But I think, Your Honor, first of all, the question presented, we absolutely stand by it, because they have prohibited the use of current medical standards and, instead, they have required the use of the 1992 standard --"
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,337.83,345.53,"Well, let me ask you -- let me ask you the same question in -- in different terms, and you can tell me that -- whether this is not a fair paraphrase of your question."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,360.11,362.8,"No, with that wording, Your Honor."
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,362.8,364.74,Then I don't know --
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,364.74,365.32,It's because --
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,365.32,369.725,-- how you can recover on the question -- you can prevail on the question that you presented to us.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,369.725,373.84,"Because, Your Honor, the question presented talks about prohibiting."
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,376.88,396.27,"Well, I don't understand what you mean by ""prohibit."" You mean prohibit the -- the lower courts from using a standard different from the one that the court of criminal appeals has said is the standard that has to be used everywhere in Texas? So each -- each trial level judge would apply a different standard, whatever that judge thinks is the right one?"
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,396.27,406.51,And that the Court said prospectively the law of Texas is you -- is that you're prohibited from using the current medical standards.
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,406.51,420.71,And you think that this is a question of trial court discretion? A trial court has the discretion to use the newer standards as opposed to the -- as opposed to the standards that the court of criminal appeals says are the appropriate ones?
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,420.71,422.34,"No, I don't think it's discretion."
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,430.73,435.655,As opposed to the ones that the court of criminal appeals had itself adopted.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,435.655,443.64,"From -- from 1992, and so it -- it's helpful to consider if the court of criminal appeals' decision stands, how --"
2016.15-797,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,443.64,447.9,"Mr. Sloan, cut to the chase of the underlying question."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,455.29,456.59,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-797,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,456.59,457.74,It was making up --
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,457.74,458.19,They -- they --
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,458.19,462.745,"Mr. Sloan, I don't think you finished answering my question."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,502.365,518.685,"Well, I respectfully disagree, Your Honor, in this respect, because what the Court said in Briseno was, after talking about following the 1992 standard, it said we view the medical standards as exceedingly subjective."
2016.15-797,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,583.09,588.535,There is no doubt about what the Texas court said.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,619.61,622.22,"Yes, exactly, Your Honor. And --"
2016.15-797,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,622.22,623.815,It's on page 6a in these?
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,623.815,624.5,That's right.
2016.15-797,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,678.99,680.97,"Mr. Sloan, I think it's more than that."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,695.62,702.32,"That -- that's exactly right, Your Honor, and it's also part of a broader problem in the framework interwoven with Briseno itself."
2016.15-797,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,728.84,741.395,"I tried to ask myself if the Court could say, use the Briseno factors first, and after that, if you find no intellectual disability, then turn to the clinical standards."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,744.94,758.83,"There absolutely is, and it's all rooted by the conflict of clinical standards generally and the prohibition on the use of current medical standards and the hostility to current medical standards --"
2016.15-797,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,758.83,763.435,But it is true that Atkins left some discretion to the States.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,773.345,794.615,"I think it's the rule that the Court notes and -- and explained in Hall, which is that the State must be informed by the medical community's diagnostic framework, and so what I understand that to mean is that -- and -- and, of course, as the Court said in Atkins and in Hall and Brumfield, the clinical definitions are very, very important that you have to inform it."
2016.15-797,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,856.75,858.445,"Mr. Sloan, can we go --"
2016.15-797,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,858.445,860.445,Justice Sotomayor?
2016.15-797,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,860.445,887.225,"Can we go to the practical application of what you're saying for a moment? Let's take the decision of the CCA here. All right? They found two prongs that Mr. Moore had not met: That he couldn't prove that he was clinically intellectually disabled, that his IQ was higher than what was generally recognized clinically."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,907.425,909.32,"I will, Your Honor."
2016.15-797,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,990.03,992.03,There is no medical rule to that.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,992.03,992.36,That's --
2016.15-797,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,992.36,993.4,No medical support.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,993.4,996.53,There's no medical support. There's no clinical basis for that.
2016.15-797,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1004.23,1030.835,"Well, I thought the most significant part of this alleged error by you in your briefs were that it assumed that things like poverty, poor nutrition, poor performance in school were not attributable to intellectual functioning, but to his lack of a good home, essentially."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1034.16,1048.42,"Because, Your Honor -- so in terms of the causation requirement, which is, I think, what Your Honor is referring to -- and there are -- there are three major problems with the way the court dealt with causation from --"
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1048.42,1056.84,"Well, I think the court's -- would you say something about the adaptive behavior? Because I think that may be a stronger leg."
2016.15-797,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1056.84,1062.94,Why don't you deal with Justice Sotomayor's question first and then Justice Alito's.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1062.94,1078.755,"Thank you, Your Honor. So in terms of the causation, first the court says at page 10a of the petition appendix, they emphasize that intellectual deficits caused it rather than some other cause like the causes Your Honor is talking about."
2016.15-797,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1142.1,1144.78,Now -- now maybe you can respond to Justice Alito.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1144.78,1153.63,"Yes, Your Honor. In terms of the adaptive deficits, Your Honor -- and it's important at the outset to recognize certain points that are undisputed in the record."
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1171.82,1175.235,But what was the -- what is the problem with their analysis of that point?
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1175.235,1188.905,"So there are four problems, Your Honor. So one of them is that the court focuses on what it perceives as some strengths, which it says outweighs the deficits and --"
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1188.905,1189.28,Okay.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1193.7,1197.12,"Yes, Your Honor. And, in fact --"
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1197.12,1210.96,"Well, here is an article written by a number of experts, recent article from the Journal of American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, Assessing Adaptive Functioning in Death Penalty Cases after Hall and DSM-5."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1233.31,1234.23,Um --
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1234.23,1239.925,"This is Dr. Hagan, Drogin, and Guilmette."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1239.925,1270.73,"Well, Your Honor, the clinical guidance from both the AAIDD and the American Psychiatric Association in their definitive clinical guidance, which comes out about once every 10 years, is -- is very explicit that the adaptive-deficit inquiry focuses on deficits and not on strengths, and for two very, very important reasons. And the first is that -- is the clinical inquiry is about the degree to which somebody is impaired in their everyday life, and so it's focusing on the impairments."
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1284.55,1298.045,"If the professional organizations by, I suppose, a majority vote or something like that conclude one thing, and but there are respected experts who disagree, you're saying the State is obligated --"
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1298.045,1298.43,"Well, I --"
2016.15-797,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1298.43,1301.36,-- as a matter of constitutional law to follow the organizations?
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1301.36,1309.68,"I'm not saying that, Your Honor. As I said to Justice Kennedy, I think Hall identifies considerations if the court is going to disagree."
2016.15-797,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1312.37,1322.71,"And can I ask whether you might be talking about two different things? And I might be wrong about this, but as I understand adaptive functioning, there are these particular areas of functioning that have been set out."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1340.33,1340.44,Sure.
2016.15-797,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1340.44,1342.365,-- to determine whether you have a deficit.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1352.4,1353.96,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2016.15-797,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1363.94,1367.975,"I have one question, which I don't think you can answer orally."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1452.935,1454.25,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-797,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1454.25,1458.805,"My suspicion is that there is no such thing, but that's why I asked the question. I want to be sure."
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1459.46,1473.71,"Well, let me make two points, which is that, first of all, Your Honor says what -- what do courts do? And I do think it's important that the general principle this Court was clear about in Hall, which is being informed by the medical community about diagnostic --"
2016.15-797,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1473.71,1474.08,I understand.
2016.15-797,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1509.185,1522.865,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I think actually the best places to look on this would be the AAIDD current manual, the 11th edition, as well as the pages in the DSM-5 that -- that address it."
2016.15-797,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1622.19,1627.86,"Thank you, counsel. General Keller."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1627.86,1639.01,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner conceded that we could have used the DSM-IV instead of the current DSM-5 that answers the question presented."
2016.15-797,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1682.815,1696.405,"You describe these as coming from some source, but Briseno itself listed this -- these -- seven, was it? -- bullet points, did not give a single citation of where any one came from."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1696.405,1716.69,"It did, however, and this Court -- in -- in pages 53 to 55 of our brief, we go factor by factor and quote this Court's precedence to show how they're congruent with factors that this Court itself has considered. And also, at Petition Appendix 162a, the trial court adopted Petitioner's proposed conclusions of law."
2016.15-797,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1745.57,1769.235,"General, would you agree with this: That the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in Briseno and other places, has made clear its view that -- that Texas can choose to execute people whom a -- a complete consensus, a 100 percent consensus of clinicians, would find to be intellectually disabled? Would you agree with that?"
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1769.235,1771.91,I -- I don't believe that's what the Briseno opinion said.
2016.15-797,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1775.54,1807.42,"I'm -- I'm asking about Briseno and other court of appeals' decisions. And I thought that you said this in your brief, that the -- that your view of the point of State discretion is that a person who everybody -- every clinician would find to be intellectually disabled, the State does not have to find to be intellectually disabled because a consensus of Texas citizens would not find that person to be intellectually disabled. Isn't that the premise of the court of appeals' decisions?"
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1807.42,1808.29,No.
2016.15-797,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1833.79,1835.23,"Well, I guess I just don't understand this."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1870.73,1876.9,Briseno very clearly adopted the three-prong established test in cases since then that we've cited throughout our brief.
2016.15-797,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1877.68,1878.93,I know that they applied the three-prong test.
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1910.93,1918.83,"Justice Kagan, it's true this Court has recognized there is a different between a legal determination regarding Eighth Amendment culpability and a medical diagnosis."
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1922.42,1923.67,I'm sorry.
2016.15-797,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1926.56,1930.1,"Well, he was talking about my question. So go on. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1930.1,1957.23,"Thank you, Justice Kagan. Also, even the DSM-5 itself, the current framework the Petitioner points to, says there is an imperfect fit between those two concepts, and this Court has cited that exact language in previous DSM versions for that same proposition. And so, no, it is not the case that States have to categorically wholesale adopt the positions of current medical organizations, but what Briseno itself actually did was, in fact, adopt the AAMR 9th, the precursor to the AAIDD 11th."
2016.15-797,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1968.3,1971.255,"I have a follow-up unless you want to go, Justice Sotomayor."
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1971.255,1973.81,"Go ahead, and then I'll --"
2016.15-797,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1973.81,1974.98,"Well, maybe I could ask a follow-up."
2016.15-797,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1974.98,1976.57,"Justice Kagan, please."
2016.15-797,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1976.57,1991.77,"Let me just take one of the Briseno factors, right? And it's the idea that what lay people think about the person growing up is relevant to an assessment of adaptive function. Now, no clinician would ever say that."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2027.2,2031.56,This Court in Hall looked at what siblings and teachers from the developmental period also did.
2016.15-797,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2052.32,2067.87,"Because Briseno says essentially that this can trump everything, and it says that this can trump everything because of the underlying view of Briseno and other Texas Court of Appeals cases that we don't have to look at the clinical standards and that we can execute people whom clinicians would find to be disabled."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2067.87,2075.21,"No, Briseno did not say that the seven evidentiary factors can trump the established three-pronged definition that Texas has consistently applied."
2016.15-797,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2075.21,2085.755,"I'm sorry, Mr. General Keller, because you keep on saying the three-prong definition, but the three-prong definition just tells you, you have to look to IQ, you have to look to adaptive functioning, you have to look to youth."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2098.06,2099.36,"Well, even in Briseno --"
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2099.36,2120.215,"May I note that, as a footnote only, you can continue, that in Ex parte Sosa, the CCA sent back a case directing the lower court to apply the Briseno factors, even though that court had analyzed the case under the clinical standards."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2132.14,2134.36,There are not stereotypes built into them.
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2134.92,2148.715,"Well, the DMA and all the other clinicians recognized that some mentally disabled people can have some adaptive functioning. Idiot savants, for example."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2157.045,2158.61,"No, the point of the Briseno --"
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2158.61,2178.51,How about if that same person has a job in NASA calculating the air space shuttle launches? Is that person not intellectually disabled simply because they can use that particular skill in a way that gains them employment?
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2178.51,2179.11,No.
2016.15-797,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2199.555,2201.37,"Well, General, we are not reviewing Sosa."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2237.83,2238.75,"No, they did not."
2016.15-797,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2268.335,2279.429,Are you saying that the Briseno factors capture all individuals with intellectual disability?
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2279.429,2281.04,No.
2016.15-797,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2293.7,2320.595,"Isn't making it discretionary a huge problem in this area, because if you let one trial court judge apply it and another one does -- doesn't have to apply them, then you're opening the door to inconsistent results depending upon who is sitting on the trial court bench, something that we try to prevent from happening in capital cases."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2320.595,2324.11,"No, Justice Ginsburg, we're -- it's discretionary."
2016.15-797,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2354.78,2373.45,"But the theme is -- of -- of the -- the Petitioner's brief, that the Briseno factors are intended to really limit the classification of those persons with intellectual disability as defined by an almost uniform medical consensus."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2373.45,2378.47,And the CCA has never said that the purpose of these factors is to screen out individuals and deny them relief.
2016.15-797,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2378.47,2379.715,But isn't that the effect?
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2379.715,2380.435,No.
2016.15-797,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2386.32,2399.125,"Well, of course, General, there are going to be cases in which the Briseno factors will show disabled, but that's not the question. The question is can they be an exhaustive list."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2399.125,2403.52,"The Briseno factors are not an exhaustive list, and the CCA has never treated them like that."
2016.15-797,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2403.52,2416.13,"But the -- but the genesis of these factors was that the court said the clinical standards are just too subjective and they don't reflect what Texas citizens think, both of those things."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2430.455,2432.64,The court did mention subjectivity.
2016.15-797,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2448.1,2453.53,"Basically, there are two things wrong, possibly, with the factors which we've heard."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2587.78,2608.075,"Justice Breyer, I -- I believe that's mistaken, because there are two points after that discussion in Texas consensus where the Court says, and this is page 6 of Briseno, as a Court dealing with individual cases and litigants, we decline to answer that normative question about the Texas consensus without the significant greater assistance from the citizenry acting through its legislature."
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2622.65,2645.65,"Mr. General, going -- just -- is it your view that what Texas is trying to do is determine who is truly on the clinical borderline as opposed to trying to determine the type of mentally disabled people that it thinks should be executed --"
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2645.65,2646.39,Correct.
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2646.39,2648.43,-- on the latter?
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2648.43,2648.75,Yes.
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2651.44,2651.99,All right.
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2666.78,2667.45,No.
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2672.76,2690.1,"But you -- according to one of the cases that you've cited to me where someone was clinically diagnosed as mildly disabled, and the CCA said under the Briseno factors that they should not be executed."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2709.715,2717.975,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, the Van Alstyne case is the case that I can point to where the CCA looked at the Briseno factors and granted her leave. If I can pull back up the question --"
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2717.975,2720.37,Did they find him mildly disabled?
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2720.37,2722.96,The testimony there was on adaptive deficits.
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2743.96,2753.055,"So why did it go through so much trouble in saying that it wasn't going to use current standards, that it was only going to use the older standards and the Briseno factors?"
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2753.055,2759.15,Because the current standard used by AAIDD 11th does not have the relatedness inquiry.
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2768.11,2781.305,"Well, if we believe that its definition of relatedness has no support anywhere, would that have been a valid reason for discounting the current clinical standards?"
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2781.305,2782.89,"Well, that was a second alternative holding."
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2814.935,2850.92,"Well, I'm not sure how I can accept your characterization of the CCA decision when basically it's saying his poor intellectual functioning on IQ tests, which happened when he was younger, were not related to his intellectual abilities; they were related to his poverty, his -- his morbidity factors. If they are saying that, how are you saying they weren't finding that he wasn't intellectually disabled because of those other factors?"
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2850.92,2851.86,"Well, it wasn't just --"
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2851.86,2853.31,That's how I read their decision.
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2853.31,2855.1,"Well, it wasn't just the CCA saying that."
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2857.59,2865.085,"Well, wait a minute. The testimony of Compton was, having looked at all of the IQ tests, was: I'm not sure."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2883.13,2900.335,"The State's expert said that it would have been borderline on intellectual functioning. But the CCA on relatedness -- and, again, this is a second alternative holding that the Court doesn't have to reach -- it looked at testimony from Petitioner's retrial in 2001 when Petitioner affirmatively argued that he was not intellectually disabled."
2016.15-797,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2903.55,2910.245,It was a strategic advantage to doing that back in those days; right?
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2910.245,2921.38,"Well, actually, at the time, Penry would have been decided, and there would have been a valid basis to say, Petitioner, I'm intellectually disabled; therefore, use it as mitigation evidence."
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2942.47,2945.78,"Well, that happened in Atkins, too."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2964.205,2967.88,"Of course, Penry would have been on the books, and so there would have been an advantage to argue that."
2016.15-797,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3014.369,3047.35,"Can you explain why Texas applies a different test to determine whether a school child is intellectually disabled, or a juvenile offender, to determine what to do with that offender, Texas applies a different test when compatible with current medical standards in both of those categories? Why does it have a different standard for capital cases only?"
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,3047.35,3056.785,"So first of all, the juvenile offender discharge rule that Petitioner cites at page 7 of the reply brief, that actually adopts the three-prong test that Briseno adopted."
2016.15-797,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3088.76,3092.04,"Well, that's the point. That's exactly the point."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,3161.71,3165.39,And what Atkins and Hall said was there's a critical role for the States.
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3210.68,3229.8,"Well, the problem is that, as I read the CCA opinion, it's looking at adaptive strengths only and not at adaptive deficits and looking at the depth of them or how they form the intellectual disability component."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,3288.23,3288.77,No.
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3315.59,3322.155,"The problem with Lennie, who the Briseno factors were -- were fashioned after -- Lennie was working on a farm."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,3359.46,3362.65,"Lennie, and the character from Of Mice and Men, was never part of the test."
2016.15-797,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3370.12,3378.97,But it informed its view of how to judge the lack or strength of adaptive functions.
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,3380.79,3382.545,"No, it absolutely did not."
2016.15-797,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3408.68,3427.54,"General, can I ask -- I'm sort of trying to reconcile the various statements you made here, and in your briefs, and here's what I come up with, and tell me if it's right. I think what you're saying is the Texas Court of Appeals is complying with Atkins because it used a three-pronged test, focusing on IQ and adaptive function and age."
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,3447.385,3448.98,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I answer?"
2016.15-797,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3448.98,3449.42,Sure.
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,3449.82,3455.07,"I don't believe so, Justice Kagan, because what the Court has done is it has adopted the clinical prongs."
2016.15-797,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3456.72,3456.96,Right.
2016.15-797,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,3468.3,3471.73,"But on intellectual functioning, Texas has never had an IQ cutoff."
2016.15-797,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3483.52,3487.8,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Sloan."
2016.15-797,2,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3487.8,3490.05,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2016.15-797,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3611.65,3633.825,"Could you just clarify what you said about DSM-IV and DSM-5, because I had a different impression from your initial argument. So if we were to say today every State must adopt DSM-5, and then at some point in the future DSM-6 comes out, would it be your position that those States would all have to go back and reconsider what they're doing?"
2016.15-797,2,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3633.825,3640.65,"They -- they would have to consider them as part of the diagnostic framework. And, again, these new editions come out about once every 10 years."
2016.15-797,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3653.06,3656.03,Is it your view that Briseno factors are all consistent with DSM-IV?
2016.15-797,2,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3656.03,3657.68,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-797,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3678.87,3678.96,Sure.
2016.15-797,2,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3678.96,3686.12,"-- based on Briseno about whether, in fact, there is a bright line exemption for the intellectually disabled."
2016.15-797,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3721.02,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
