2010.10-98,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.404,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-98, Ashcroft v. Al-Kidd."
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,8.604,11.039,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,114.506,136.122,Can I ask whether your second reason doesn't boil down to saying that it makes very little difference whether -- whether Ashcroft is -- is held immune by absolute immunity or by qualified immunity?
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,136.122,136.722,"Oh, no, it--"
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.722,155.35,"Once -- once you say that -- that motive is not introducible with regard to the qualified immunity question, and once you say that he's using a witness subpoena, and you can't look behind it as to whether he was abusing it for some other purpose, is there any difference between absolute and qualified immunity?"
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,155.35,156.933,"--Well, I take it there may be a difference."
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,196.456,225.726,"Well, I thought the -- I thought the argument, rather, was that this is not as close to the core of the prosecutorial function as some of the other functions to which we have given absolute immunity, and since it's so dangerous, since there is such potential for abuse, we shouldn't confer absolute immunity on this particular conduct."
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,233.597,240.918,"Justice Scalia, to be sure, they are now making that argument in this Court, that this doesn't fall -- this isn't intimately associated--"
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,240.918,241.353,Right.
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,241.353,242.003,--with the judicial process.
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.514,286.299,Was the prosecution already pending when this -- when this warrant was issued?
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,286.299,286.516,"Yes, it was."
2010.10-98,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.033,327.174,"Was Mr. Al-Kidd -- was he released after -- I understand he didn't testify at the trial, and there was an acquittal, and then other charges were dropped."
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,338.665,345.735,"--Justice Ginsburg, he was in -- he was detained for only a period of 16 days total in 2003."
2010.10-98,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,347.269,349.187,But he was restrained much longer -- for 15 months.
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,349.187,382.592,"--He had travel restrictions placed upon him until the trial was over and until the government -- because after the resolution of Mr. Al-Hussayen's case, which was acquittal on some charges and a hung conviction -- a hung -- a hung decision on others, the government thought about retrying Mr. Al-Hussayen, took it very seriously, and 20 days after al-Hussayen's verdict by the jury, we reached an agreement with them in writing that Mr. Al-Hussayen would leave the country and -- and not come back, and in exchange we weren't going to prosecute him any further."
2010.10-98,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,451.088,457.325,"Well, in light of these restrictions, I would like to come back to the question that I understood Justice Scalia to be asking."
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,478.405,479.239,For two reasons.
2010.10-98,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,556.005,562.309,But that's after there is probable cause to suspect that criminal activity has occurred.
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,585.59,601.116,"--Justice Ginsburg, it's certainly different in -- in that respect, but I do think that difference doesn't matter, because I think what Whren and Edmond and the cases were getting at is, is there some objective, individualized determination by a neutral judge?"
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.268,655.768,I don't see--
2010.10-98,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,655.768,656.118,How does that--
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.118,660.653,--I don't see how that would make any difference to the -- at least to the absolute immunity question.
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,679.698,680.081,"--Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.252,683.585,Okay.
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,683.585,693.957,"I imagine one point about the statute might be that the statutes, going all the way back to 1789, do reflect that this is a prosecutorial function to the extent there is any doubt."
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,703.813,718.675,"So for us to agree with you on absolute immunity, we -- we would have to believe that even if there were no such statute and if a prosecutor simply detained somebody as a material witness without any check of a -- of an independent magistrate, he would be immune?"
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,718.675,726.329,"I think that is correct, that that is quintessentially what prosecutors do in the exercise of trying to get a trial -- a trial going."
2010.10-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,726.729,736.719,"Suppose -- suppose that a prosecutor reads the statute, there must be an affidavit that says this witness is material."
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,753.412,757.966,"--Well, if the -- if the -- I'm not sure I totally follow--"
2010.10-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,757.966,758.316,I'm not saying it's this case.
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,760.668,766.656,"--If the evidence shows that the evidence is not material, then the statute is violated."
2010.10-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,766.656,775.444,And the reason it is not material is because the prosecutor has no intention whatsoever of ever bringing this person as a witness in any trial.
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,775.444,778.879,I do think that that would generally mean that materiality would be violated.
2010.10-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,779.496,780.129,All right.
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,780.129,780.748,--some theoretical construct--
2010.10-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,780.748,795.758,"If materiality is violated, does not then that -- that prosecutor -- since he had no intention of bringing him to trial or of having him as a witness at a trial, that prosecutor would not be immune?"
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,795.758,797.475,"--Justice Breyer, let me -- let me--"
2010.10-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,797.475,798.075,--yes.
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,798.075,801.143,--just make sure that I understand the contours of your hypothetical.
2010.10-98,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,807.649,809.849,"Well, how does -- how does it--"
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,809.849,819.623,"--Here's how I think it works: So I think that Congress set up the objective two-part test to decide whether or not an arrest warrant would take place, which is materiality and impracticability."
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,870.156,872.339,"And you can't look behind that, right?"
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,879.262,886.332,"Well, I think that the -- the defense can litigate that and appeal that set of issues, but I don't think--"
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,886.332,890.82,Can appeal the -- the judge's determination that -- that it's material?
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,890.82,891.385,--Absolutely.
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.385,893.02,"Well, then how can you have absolute immunity?"
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,893.02,894.687,"Well, they did, because we're talking about--"
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,894.687,895.687,"Oh, you mean at the time it's issued?"
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,895.687,896.153,--Exactly.
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,896.153,896.753,I see.
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,896.753,897.37,At the time itself.
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,908.011,913.165,"Well, what if you didn't have -- again, what if you didn't have this prescribed judicial process?"
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,913.165,917.783,I take it that the logic of this Court's precedence is that absolute immunity would still apply.
2010.10-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,945.101,956.659,There is a difference between calling a witness at trial and arresting a person.
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,972.668,975.636,"No, I do think it goes quite a bit further than that."
2010.10-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1033.575,1055.572,"You don't -- you don't think there's a reason to make prosecutors flinch against willy-nilly -- that's not what I'm -- I'm claiming happened here, but if you take the point that you're raising, then prosecutors can out of spite, out of pure investigative reasoning, out of whatever motive they have, just lock people up."
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1055.572,1057.024,Justice Sotomayor--
2010.10-98,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1057.024,1058.84,And you're -- you're basically saying--
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1058.84,1062.428,--making prosecutors flinch is -- is always a bad thing.
2010.10-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1089.078,1099.367,"Well, there are procedures set forth in the statute, I'd say you would add, which you think are not necessary, but are there in order to make them flinch in a different -- in a different--"
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1099.367,1100.367,That is precisely correct.
2010.10-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1104.669,1115.543,"What's your best authority that at -- at common law or the common law tradition, there is absolute immunity for witness -- for the issuance of witness warrants?"
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1115.543,1146.079,"I don't think it's come up with respect to public prosecutors, and so our argument here, to the extent the Court reaches that question -- and, again, it wasn't -- it wasn't raised below in the brief in opposition, but if the Court wanted to reach that question, I think it would be that the argument would derive the same way as the arguments in this Court's post-Imbler cases, which is, as long as it is intimately associated with the judicial function that the prosecutor is doing, then absolute immunity should extend to that context."
2010.10-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1146.079,1167.427,"Then a second question, quite apart from immunity, just addressing the substantive constitutional issues under the statute, suppose that the prosecutor has probable cause to indict and try the person for the crime."
2010.10-98,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1184.871,1209.421,"I do think that the government -- I'm not sure if we have any policy with respect to that, but I think that -- that we -- that at least for Fourth Amendment purposes, there wouldn't be a violation if the government held the person for essentially a dual motive, and that is what I understand they have now conceded at page 31 of their brief, which is in dual motive cases, the government's action is permissible."
2010.10-98,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1215.992,1216.325,"Thank you, General."
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1223.848,1226.633,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.345,1274.214,Do you acknowledge that it is then constitutional?
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1279.518,1281.551,"Justice Scalia, we are not pressing that argument."
2010.10-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1383.999,1387.217,Is this a -- is this a realistic hypothetical that you've posed?
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1421.354,1426.258,"Well, Justice Alito, I -- I think a few points, one is just as an initial matter."
2010.10-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1468.082,1483.278,"The problem, and it's, I think, the problem that I think Whren highlighted is that the -- the allegation can so readily be made in every case under the material witness statute is that this is one of those bad intent cases, and the case has to proceed so that we can prove that."
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1492.799,1516.415,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but let me -- let me say that I think I -- as I understand Whren, I obviously don't want to tell the Court about its own cases, but is that it was drawing a conceptual line, that the first point about Whren, and I think the fundamental point, was the conceptual point that as the Whren court put it, only an undiscerning reader would conflate cases in which there was probable cause of a violation of the law with cases in which there wasn't."
2010.10-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1591.608,1602.583,"So every time the prosecutor elects not to call one of these witnesses for a variety of reasons, you would have a claim that this wasn't designed to elicit testimony?"
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1602.583,1604.435,"--No, no, we don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.10-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1659.152,1660.271,Just a point of detail.
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1670.793,1674.345,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, and I apologize if I wasn't clear."
2010.10-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1696.778,1705.3,"Do we -- do we -- do we have statistics for the States, how many States hold -- how many people are held under State material witness statutes?"
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1705.3,1708.085,"We have -- we have looked for those, Justice Kennedy."
2010.10-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1782.346,1797.089,"Your argument is that the Constitution does not allow a material witness to be detained, so long as the witness says in court that he or she will show up for trial, no matter how much evidence there is that this person poses a great risk of flight?"
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1801.207,1804.945,Do I think the Constitution requires that?
2010.10-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1804.945,1805.428,Yes.
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1805.428,1809.73,"I think it probably does, but we are not taking a position on that."
2010.10-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1869.885,1870.518,You might turn out--
2010.10-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1870.518,1874.372,"If you were writing a law review article, you might have done that."
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1881.275,1897.119,"--Well, I think what he would have found, Your Honor, is that the Court has not specifically -- I grant that it has not specifically ruled on the Fourth Amendment, but what he would have found in Barry and the other cases, is that the Court repeatedly, repeatedly referred to statute as a means of securing testimony."
2010.10-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1910.878,1919.15,"But, again, you're talking about the officer, he reads the statute and then doesn't say, well, but maybe the statute's unconstitutional, so I need to do more research?"
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1919.15,1920.217,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2010.10-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1960.477,1966.464,So the eight -- eight judges taking the opposite position in the hearing en banc below were just being unreasonable?
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1973.635,1981.639,"I think, Your Honor, the -- Mr. Chief Justice, the only way I can answer that is to say this Court has -- has never made determinant of whether there are dissents."
2010.10-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1991.347,2003.904,"What we said in Wilson, I'm quoting, judges -- when judges disagree on a constitutional question, it is unfair to subject public employees to money damages for picking the losing side of the controversy."
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2003.904,2006.689,"I mean, but I think Brogue goes the other way."
2010.10-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2013.259,2028.436,"Well, I agree with -- I agree with that, of course, but at the same time, it does seem that you're imposing a very heavy burden on the officers in this area when do you have a situation where eight judges, when they conduct their research, come out the other way."
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2047.064,2055.436,"--Well, Your Honor, I think -- you know, of course, I'm not sure it will actually come out of their pocket, but I get the crux of your point."
2010.10-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2131.436,2145.494,"--You don't think that an official reading all this Court's cases saying subjective motivation is not proper in determining the application of the Fourth Amendment would be able to think that this would apply here, too?"
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2153.748,2156.95,"--I don't think so, Justice Alito, respectfully."
2010.10-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2200.191,2202.957,But the Fourth Amendment doesn't say you need probable cause.
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2211.897,2224.139,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, but I think -- well, the Terry -- the Terry stops, I think we put to one side, because as the Court in Terry said and as this Court has interpreted Terry, those were because those were not full-scale arrests and the administrative -- sorry."
2010.10-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.139,2227.508,"Administrative searches, automobile searches, you know."
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2227.508,2249.855,"Absolutely, and those all fall into the special needs category, and those were cases you, Your Honor, in Whren distinguished as conceptually different than when there's probable cause of a violation of law, because what you yourself said in Whren was: Look, the government is asking for an exemption from the traditional Fourth Amendment standard and they're saying the reason we want the exemption is because of the purpose of our search."
2010.10-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2300.639,2309.745,"You seem to acknowledge that in -- a dual motive case would not violate the Fourth Amendment, or wouldn't necessarily violate the Fourth Amendment; isn't that right?"
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2309.745,2310.245,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2310.245,2328.04,"Do you think that a reasonable official would appreciate, well, it's okay for me to have a dual motive, but I have to stop and think: Is my interest in investigating this individual further the but-for cause of my desire to get a material witness warrant?"
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2329.057,2348.453,"I think it actually is, Your Honor, and the reason is because I think it's -- I think it actually gives cushion to the reasonable official, because I think once you are saying we want to secure testimony, it might be very difficult, as the Chief Justice was pointing out, to say, well, how I do know if I could have ulterior motives or not?"
2010.10-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2386.495,2390.53,I'm not sure why that just can't be resolved under the issue of materiality.
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2404.457,2407.909,"--That goes to the crux of, I think, what is going on here."
2010.10-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2500.501,2505.119,Where did you allege that the desire to detain was the sole motive for this?
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2505.119,2517.176,"Your Honor, I think that the clearest allegations are at 111 and 112 and 154 of our complaint, in the joint appendix."
2010.10-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2805.778,2810.896,You're -- you're going way beyond what I thought you were arguing.
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2825.323,2825.723,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.10-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2830.794,2831.71,That's what I thought you were saying.
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2831.71,2847.355,"I think what's going on here is there's a unique set of factors with respect to material witness, not the least of which is the history with respect to both material witness arrests and warrants generally, and I think there's been no counter-history by the government."
2010.10-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2848.521,2850.707,We're dealing here with a Bivens action?
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2850.707,2851.123,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2851.123,2864.883,Under what theory is the history of immunity at some point in the 19th century relevant to the scope of the immunity that should be available in a -- in a Bivens action?
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2866.467,2871.537,"Well, Your Honor, I think -- I don't know that I have an independent first principles theory."
2010.10-98,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2880.442,2882.178,Does that make any sense?
2010.10-98,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2912.864,2917.082,"I think, you know, part of what the Court's answer is, it's a practical concern."
2010.10-98,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3025.934,3027.267,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-98,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3030.486,3032.421,Thank you.
2010.10-98,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3120.277,3133.303,"General Katyal, there are some elements of this picture that are very disturbing, and we are talking about the Attorney General and the Attorney General's immunity."
2010.10-98,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3160.271,3167.257,"Justice Ginsburg, with respect to that whole set of questions, conditions of confinement, that isn't before the Court right now."
2010.10-98,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3195.71,3198.812,I would like to go back to the statute.
2010.10-98,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3213.155,3214.755,The officer--
2010.10-98,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3214.755,3215.457,"Yes, yes."
2010.10-98,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3215.457,3219.075,"--you have -- you potentially have a damages against the officer, not against the prosecutor?"
2010.10-98,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3219.075,3219.425,"No, no."
2010.10-98,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3221.344,3221.861,Yes.
2010.10-98,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3221.861,3222.394,All right.
2010.10-98,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3264.021,3271.277,"Justice Breyer, I'm not sure if your hypothetical has it as the prosecutor who is filing the affidavit and lying or the agent."
2010.10-98,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3283.966,3297.475,"But in the case of the agent, you're prepared to say that we will allow the plaintiff to go into his motive to the extent that the plaintiff can show there is no possibility he intended to call this individual?"
2010.10-98,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3297.475,3303.295,--I think that at least for purposes -- I would say there is at least no absolute immunity prohibition against that.
2010.10-98,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3411.93,3414.448,"Thank you, General."
