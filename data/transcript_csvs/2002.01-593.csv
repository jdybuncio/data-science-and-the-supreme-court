2002.01-593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.036,"We'll hear argument now in Number 01-593, the Dole Food Company versus Patrickson, and a companion case."
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,12.952,16.027,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-593,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,24.149,31.764,Is it... is it owned in the same capacity now as it was earlier?
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,31.764,32.941,"No... no, it is not, Your Honor."
2002.01-593,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,32.941,36.45,And was it owned at the time the suit was filed?
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,36.45,39.41,"At the time this suit was filed, the company had been privatized."
2002.01-593,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,41.149,41.291,Right.
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,48.704,50.139,"I certainly intend to do that, Your Honor."
2002.01-593,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,50.139,50.139,Yes.
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,50.139,61.581,"The three reasons, in sum, are that, throughout the period of time giving rise to the claims, Israel owned a majority of the shares or other ownership interests in the company."
2002.01-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.53,121.184,"Yes, but it's a lot of trouble to track these things back, you know, who owns shares many tiers up, and Congress might well have simply determined we will honor the sovereignty of other States when they're the principal stockholder of a corporation."
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,135.922,150.737,"Well, Your Honor, I... I don't disagree that that would be a rational disposition, but I don't think there's any indication in the case law, and there have been numerous cases where tiered entities have appeared before courts, that it's posed any particular problem to identify the tiered ownership structure."
2002.01-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.649,182.153,Your... your principle would apply no matter how many tiers up they go?
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,184.641,190.248,"--So long as the State's ownership interest is the majority ownership interest, Your Honor, there could be--"
2002.01-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.248,194.147,Even though the name of the State does not appear until you get six tiers up?
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,194.147,195.038,--That's correct.
2002.01-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,204.25,205.497,Why do you limit to the majority?
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,210.718,215.055,"--Well, the statute says majority ownership, Your Honor, and we think that--"
2002.01-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,215.055,218.689,But it doesn't say majority ownership of grandchildren of the parent.
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,218.689,230.538,"--It says a majority ownership interest, Your Honor, and we think a majority ownership interest is about as broad a term as... as could be conjured up to try to describe generically the concept of ownership."
2002.01-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,241.817,251.784,"Well, I... I suppose it could mean ownership of other forms, for instance, an oil-drilling venture, a working interest of 70 percent, which is not usually called a share."
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,252.353,253.546,That's true.
2002.01-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,253.546,259.481,"--So... so there... there's work for that phrase in the statute to do without adopting your position, it seems to me."
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,259.481,259.93,There is.
2002.01-593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,279.676,280.621,"Well, it can--"
2002.01-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,280.621,284.577,"--Your argument would be stronger if it were a stand-alone term, but it isn't."
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,307.927,330.269,"--Well, we think, Your Honor, that the phrase needs to be read as a whole, and we do not believe that this is a situation, when the statute is read as a whole, that the... that the principle of redundancy and superfluousness which Judge Kozinski felt, decided in this case dictated the... the restriction to direct ownership should apply."
2002.01-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,330.269,348.908,"Do you... do you agree with the respondents' contention, the United States' contention that foreign countries would not... would not give us this break, that generally speaking, in international law they... they'll only look to the ownership of the immediate company?"
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,348.908,353.579,"I... I think that that's true, Your Honor, but I think it requires a comment."
2002.01-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,378.363,381.7,I... I thought... I remember when they enacted the FSIA.
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,417.623,419.618,"--I think there's an answer to that question, Your Honor."
2002.01-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,459.748,462.84,How can they be sensitive to something that they're willing to do to us?
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,478.653,485.851,--My sense is that the Congress' concern about sensitivities was... was a little different than that.
2002.01-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,502.287,513.732,"Is your point that there are no other countries that have our dual Federal system with State courts and Federal courts, so you're not urging that there's substantive sovereign immunity."
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,523.869,524.646,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,533.233,534.591,Are you contending that here?
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,534.591,546.404,"--Well, we've pled it in our answer, Your Honor, but the issue has... has not been crossed in this particular case, because the judge in... in the district court held that we weren't even a foreign State, so the question didn't even arise."
2002.01-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,563.326,574.45,"For purposes of your argument now, can we assume that you are not claiming the substantive immunity and the question is a forum question, whether you can have access to a Federal forum?"
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,574.45,578.382,"--I think you can assume that, Your Honor, but I think--"
2002.01-593,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,578.382,582.836,Counsel for... I'm just not sure we ever get to this question.
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,610.134,619.584,"--We get to the first question, Your Honor, because the use of the present tense does not clearly indicate the point in time at which the present tense exists."
2002.01-593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,629.952,631.993,"Well, what do we do with diversity jurisdiction?"
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,640.099,647.799,"I don't... the font, the jurisdictional font of this statute, Your Honor is not diversity, it's Federal question."
2002.01-593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.104,658.938,"No, but I... I would like to know just for purposes of analogy, the... when something exists at the time the suit is filed, but is lost during its process."
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,658.938,665.833,--I think that's going to have to be an issue that is decided in... in cases as they develop.
2002.01-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,738.441,739.881,Why... why would we do that?
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,770.253,781.334,"Your Honor, we think that looking at the time of the events that gave rise to the claim is the approach that most closely comports with the policies and purposes behind this act."
2002.01-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,798.27,801.571,What's... what's the sensitivity if somebody decides to sue Czarist Russia?
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,801.571,812.955,"--Well, there's probably a statute of limitations claims on that, Your Honor, but I think the question is whether the... whether the acts that gave rise to the claim are at issue in the case, and I don't think it's difficult to imagine--"
2002.01-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.955,817.692,"You know, there... I... I just don't agree with you that that's... that's the policy of the United States."
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,865.723,888.761,"--Well, Your Honor, except for Judge Kozinski below, every circuit court that has looked at this and looked at the legislative history has concluded, as did the ABA working group, which recently did an extensive study of this statute, and that group was made up of prominent international relations professors and practitioners, that actions of foreign States remain potentially politically sensitive even after an entity is sold."
2002.01-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,907.217,933.179,"Mr. Paden, if you would look particularly to the diversity statute, and now there's a... a provision that expressly deals with a foreign State, everything else in diversity, you would agree, it depends on the time suit was brought, and so if you moved in the interim... there was diversity when it happened, but you move in the interim, when the complaint is filed there's no more diversity."
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,972.239,974.658,"Well, two responses, if I may."
2002.01-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,991.687,992.932,It was 1332 I'm--
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,992.932,995.139,"1332, that refers to claims by foreign States."
2002.01-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1009.588,1016.063,"--So you're saying in court... to be a plaintiff, the foreign State would have to be... it would have to be a foreign entity at the time suit was brought?"
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,1016.063,1020.992,"--The instrumentality has a choice whether or not to come to court in that circumstance, Your Honor, and invoke... and... and--"
2002.01-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1020.992,1024.672,It's not a question of whether it... it chooses to.
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,1026.628,1028.708,--The... the--
2002.01-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1028.708,1034.904,"In other words, does it have to qualify as a foreign instrumentality when it brings the suit?"
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,1034.904,1035.806,--I don't think--
2002.01-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1035.806,1036.861,Suppose it's been privatized.
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,1042.474,1048.586,"--I believe that if the acts at... at stake took place at the time it was a foreign sovereign, it should be able to do that, Your Honor."
2002.01-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1048.586,1064.734,"Those are... then you are interpreting within the very same statute a citizen of a State would be treated one way, or a... a... an entity that was once a foreign State but is no longer would be treated another way?"
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,1064.734,1066.046,That's correct.
2002.01-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1164.835,1170.524,"Well, you've made another significant change, because it wasn't the plaintiffs who brought the Israeli corporations into this action."
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,1175.45,1192.982,"That's definitely true, Your Honor, but I'm simply trying to show that there could be a hypothetical situation that's not entirely far-fetched, where... where a State's ongoing interest in litigation against an entity for acts that took place when the State had responsibility for it in the sense that it owned it, were at stake."
2002.01-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1192.982,1203.781,"Well, but if the State gives up the corporation, and no longer is part of it, I would have thought that that's just one of the risks that they'd have to run."
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,1217.745,1217.917,Well--
2002.01-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1217.917,1222.005,"--I can't get much of a feeling one way or the other about that, to tell you the truth."
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,1226.733,1265.144,"--That's clearly a policy judgment, and what we're left with is this... the wording of the statute and the purposes and policies that lay behind it, and we think that with that information before us, Congress' concern about the risk and the sensitivities both in terms of uniform... the desirability for uniform decisions and potential risks and bias that can take place in multifarious State court juries, those were to be not present when we were going to allow claims to go forward against State entities, and where the acts at issue are the acts of the State entity, those same interests would seem to be implicated."
2002.01-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1276.654,1293.535,"And a lot of those tort claims are going to be for continuing actions, so in your view, if the chemical is disseminated partly while the State is the owner of the company and partly while it isn't, then what happens?"
2002.01-593,0,38238,peter_r_paden,,1293.535,1301.742,"If... so long as within the allegations of the complaint, actions of a foreign State instrumentality are at stake, then it should be within the claim."
2002.01-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1348.204,1349.812,"Mr. Paden, because--"
2002.01-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1349.812,1351.967,--I have one... one small procedural question.
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1413.86,1421.993,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1480.07,1484.252,"Well, what... what is the phrase that you say is familiar from corporate law?"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1484.252,1486.926,"--Well, the concept of a majority of shares."
2002.01-593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1486.926,1488.037,"Are you talking about a phrase, or a concept?"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1488.037,1490.829,"Well, the phrase in particular, Your Honor."
2002.01-593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1490.829,1491.111,Okay.
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1491.111,1492.849,"The... as... I'm sorry, the concept."
2002.01-593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.849,1500.127,"So you're not saying that the phrase, shares or other ownership interest, is a familiar phrase--"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1500.127,1512.767,"Phrase... no, Your Honor, I'm saying it's a concept, the concept of what it means to own a majority of shares in a corporation and, in particular, 1603(b)(2) is written from the perspective of the subsidiary."
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1684.635,1684.811,--Because?
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1685.137,1689.368,"--Well, because Congress was dealing with other foreign owners, other--"
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1689.368,1689.663,"You know, I mean--"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1689.663,1689.794,--Yes.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1689.794,1692.598,--nobody doubts that there are other ways of owning corporations.
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1712.163,1715.64,"Because there... we believe it's... there are two reasons, primarily."
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1726.777,1727.025,Because?
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1727.025,1730.043,--Because stock is not an other kind of interest.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1730.043,1730.769,Because?
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1730.769,1732.884,Because it's already been listed--
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1732.884,1734.737,No... nobody's saying stock is.
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1734.737,1735.215,--Sure.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1735.215,1740.685,"What they're saying is, stock in intervening corporations organized in certain ways--"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1740.685,1740.863,Right.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1740.863,1749.159,"--as under the Public Utility Holding Company Act, is one other way, and I still haven't heard the word... you see, that's why I keep asking, because."
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1749.159,1749.326,Right.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1749.326,1751.73,"Because to me it's an unusual way, not that unusual."
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1759.692,1760.277,That--
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1760.277,1762.352,Now I want to know why that isn't one way.
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1762.352,1762.767,--Because it--
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1762.767,1763.4,One other way.
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1763.4,1763.78,--Right.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1767.247,1768.736,"And I don't quite see that, because--"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1768.736,1768.953,Well--
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1768.953,1769.495,--Go ahead.
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1769.495,1799.977,"--Okay, and then second is, you're absolutely right, the law books are filled, the U.S. Code is filled with many other phrasings of direct, indirect references to affiliates, references to beneficial ownership, all the kinds of things, a control test, as Justice Stevens mentioned, all the kinds of things that could capture this kind of interest, but instead we have the very distinctive phrasing that says, stock, and in our view, once you count stock first as a direct majority ownership, you shouldn't go back and count it again as an indirect form."
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1799.977,1800.385,Now--
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1800.385,1801.6,The other ought to be reserved--
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1801.6,1802.692,--I know that's your... your view.
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1802.692,1802.984,--I know.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1803.479,1804.636,Now... but let me push the because--
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1804.636,1804.917,Yes.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1804.917,1805.79,--one step further.
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1816.686,1817.172,Right.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1817.172,1821.592,"Still you should say, you shouldn't interpret it that way, because?"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1821.592,1827.111,"Because the number of principles that animate the statute, first, this is a jurisdictional statute."
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1875.753,1879.741,"All right, now if I think it is not a stretch, but just another form of ownership--"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1879.741,1880.301,Right.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.301,1881.081,--I'm putting this hypothetically--
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1881.081,1881.595,Right.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1881.595,1928.51,"--I then go on to think, you know, I cannot think of a reason in the world, not even one, not even a shadow of one, as to why Congress would have wanted to say, when country X owns business A, it gets into Federal court, but when everything is the same, but for a stack of papers this thick which puts a bunch of intervening paper corporations between A and Z, it doesn't want it to get into Federal court, I think what could they... what human being could possibly think of any conceivable reason for drawing that difference, and at that point... I'm putting it as strongly as I can... I come up with a blank."
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1941.086,1942.133,Right.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1942.133,1942.837,--doing the same thing.
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1942.837,1943.126,Right.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1943.126,1944.908,"Now, I put it as strongly as I can."
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1944.908,1948.404,"Right, and of course Congress is... Congress has to legislate by category."
2002.01-593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1990.235,1992.353,Why... why would it eliminate the right to jury trial?
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1992.353,2002.646,"--Well, under the FSIA, once a... a... an entity is deemed to be a foreign State, the right to jury trial is lost, even if an exception to immunity is subsequently found to apply."
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2010.758,2030.753,"Of course it does have a few... but nonetheless my question is, what conceivable reason could there be for saying those special advantages disappear when there is country A, and when there is country A to Z, since the only difference between A and A to Z, I'd repeat, is a bunch of paper?"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2030.753,2040.227,"--Well, again, as I said, Congress is not just legislating with that specific example of 100 percent subsidiaries, it's using a... the general category."
2002.01-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2093.649,2094.463,Mr. Massey--
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2094.463,2094.69,Yes.
2002.01-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2094.69,2098.199,"--we're trying to find out, not was... what Congress did was reasonable--"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2098.199,2098.69,Yes.
2002.01-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2098.69,2100.038,--but what did Congress do.
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2100.038,2100.5,Of course.
2002.01-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2100.5,2117.627,"Of course if it... what it did was reasonable, that... nobody could doubt that that would be fine, and in determining what... what Congress did, the petitioners pointed to a number of statutes that use the word, directly, when they meant to cut out the subsidiaries."
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2117.627,2117.92,Yes.
2002.01-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2117.92,2123.821,"They say, shares, or... or a company directly owned by, and this statute is silent."
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2125.382,2127.77,"That... that's... that's correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.143,2158.98,"Is there any context in which we have held that a majority ownership of shares, that... that phrase is satisfied by... by second-tier ownership?"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2158.98,2161.118,--Where this Court has held it?
2002.01-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.118,2161.44,Yes.
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2161.44,2166.342,"I'm... I'm not aware of any... of any case, Your Honor."
2002.01-593,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2166.342,2169.412,Do you plan to address the other question--
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2169.412,2169.554,Yes.
2002.01-593,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2169.554,2169.984,--in the case?
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2169.984,2170.395,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2247.775,2254.135,"Mr. Paden said that that (a)(4) would be interpreted by the different rule, so he's being consistent with--"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2254.135,2255.317,"Okay... well, I misunderstood."
2002.01-593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2288.174,2290.784,--Or it might also extend over a considerable period of time.
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2290.784,2291.088,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.662,2357.101,"Well, their point, though, is that, first my examples were slightly absurd, and... which they were... and secondly, that in any real case where... where you have, say, Communist Russia you're suing, or... or more recent former States, you're... you're actually suing the State, and the... the defense is, but that State no longer exists, like Bosnia or something."
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2380.208,2380.544,--Right.
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2412.446,2417.011,"It works all right with the corporations, but what if you're actually suing the State, which still has some assets somewhere?"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2417.752,2421.797,"--Well, that, of course, isn't... that's not going to be before this Court today, but--"
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2421.797,2426.243,"Oh, no, but if we go into the foreign State, former foreign States don't count, we've decided that, and so I... just curious."
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2427.425,2431.87,"--Well, no, I'm... we're not asking you to decide anything about... about former foreign States."
2002.01-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2432.713,2440.471,"Is there a reading that... that throws out the corporation that used to be owned but now isn't by a foreign State, but keeps the former foreign State within?"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2440.471,2458.368,"--Well, the... the whole immunity that foreign States enjoy is governed by 1604 and 1605, and... and the provision that we're focusing here is... is just the definition of agency and instrumentality, so I... I think this Court could safely leave for another day the issue of the former foreign State."
2002.01-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2468.7,2482.897,"Mr. Massey, practically, is it so in these litigations that if you can't remove to the Federal court, the State courts keep them and try them, whereas if you remove them to the Federal court, they are then dismissed on forum nonconvenience?"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2482.897,2488.513,"Well, it's... undoubtedly the forum nonconvenience defense would be raised in State court as well."
2002.01-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2493.366,2494.386,But in this category of case--
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2494.386,2494.521,--Yes.
2002.01-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2494.521,2496.478,--is that the general pattern?
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2496.478,2498.655,"That is the... yes, that's the general pattern."
2002.01-593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2516.273,2518.559,When was the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act passed?
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2518.559,2520.09,"1976, Your Honor."
2002.01-593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2520.09,2526.012,"We presumably lived, then, for 200 years without it, these cases being tried in State court?"
2002.01-593,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,2526.012,2526.963,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-593,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2606.335,2608.361,"Thank you, Mr. Massey."
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2609.969,2621.578,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-593,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2670.879,2676.066,"Well, they don't think of these things all the time, so... so what... what about... they just don't."
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2744.949,2763.662,"There's a very strong textual indication that that's not a correct reading, and that is found in section 1623(b)(2), where it speaks of a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by the foreign State, or political subdivision thereof."
2002.01-593,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2763.662,2763.885,Yes.
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2763.885,2779.773,"Now, obviously, if Congress had intended that recursive use that you've described, they would not have included, political subdivision thereof, which is also a part of a foreign State and, in fact, that provision excludes agency or instrumentality."
2002.01-593,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2787.443,2790.542,Or... but you're referring there back to the intent of Congress.
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2809.053,2810.067,We think--
2002.01-593,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2810.067,2813.847,"--you've got me back to that because of your response, which referred to the intent of Congress."
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2813.847,2815.821,--We think there are two very clear reasons.
2002.01-593,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2866.689,2870.034,But the statute does refer to other ownership interests.
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2870.034,2871.475,"Yes, it--"
2002.01-593,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2871.475,2872.724,Other forms of ownership.
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2873.918,2882.321,"--Again, Your Honor, we think that it ought to be... that this term ought to be interpreted in terms of a... a test that provides a bright line rule."
2002.01-593,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3018.852,3021.79,"How do you deal with somebody who sues Yugoslavia, as a State?"
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3024.455,3025.016,--I think--
2002.01-593,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3025.016,3027.176,What... that goes to a... West Virginia State court?
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3027.176,3031.317,"--I think the question here is, who exactly are they suing?"
2002.01-593,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3031.317,3032.513,They're suing Yugoslavia.
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3033.233,3033.585,They might be suing--
2002.01-593,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3033.585,3034.919,"--the... it says, defendant, Yugoslavia."
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3034.919,3039.137,"--But that suit most likely has to be served on someone, and it's likely--"
2002.01-593,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3039.137,3051.433,"There is somebody over there who claims to be the recipient of lawsuits... I mean, we could easily construct a serious problem, or you may have looked into it in telling me it just isn't a problem, and I'd like to hear you say that, if that's so, because it would help."
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3051.433,3052.963,--We think it's unlikely to be a problem.
2002.01-593,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3070.802,3073.716,"Okay, so you're telling me, and you've looked into it, this isn't really a problem, it's theoretical, not real?"
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3073.716,3075.933,--We think it is primarily a theoretical problem.
2002.01-593,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3134.957,3141.876,"Mr. Minear, I don't understand how the Act of State Doctrine would apply to sales of Israel pesticide in Central America."
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3141.876,3144.563,It most likely would not apply--
2002.01-593,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3144.563,3144.769,Yes.
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3144.769,3149.836,"--in this situation because obviously, the Act of State Doctrine applies to the acts of a foreign State in--"
2002.01-593,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3149.836,3150.095,Within its own--
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3150.095,3150.942,--within... within--
2002.01-593,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3150.942,3151.064,--Yes.
2002.01-593,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3151.064,3153.253,"--its own territory, within is own jurisdiction."
2002.01-593,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3156.2,3157.306,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."

2002.01-593,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3217.164,3230.771,"We... we have always construed jurisdictional statutes quite narrowly, going all the way back to Strawbridge against Curtis, that said you have to have complete diversity under the diversity statute, and it seems to me you're asking for something different than that here."
2002.01-593,3,38238,peter_r_paden,,3230.771,3239.281,"I think, Your Honor, that the... in the first place, of course, the statute has to be construed to the best one can on the words of the statute and the congressional intent."
2002.01-593,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3294.35,3295.164,"Well, they listed two."
2002.01-593,3,38238,peter_r_paden,,3310.767,3311.335,Correct.
2002.01-593,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3357.09,3391.943,"I think that was conceded, that for purposes of newspapers reports, and... yeah, we understand that you would have five tiers down, if only one person owns it, you say, well, that person owns it, even if it's the fifth tier down, but the question is, in this context of a jurisdictional statute... and I wanted to ask you particularly, you've just heard Mr. Minear's argument, do we, as a Court, owe any special respect to what the executive tells us a statute that deals in the foreign affairs realm means?"
2002.01-593,3,38238,peter_r_paden,,3391.943,3402.256,"--Your Honor, I think in this case that... that we think that the respect that is owed to the Justice and State Departments in this case is... is measured by the persuasiveness of the opinions that they're offering."
2002.01-593,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3443.105,3451.794,"But the... the Government says you are the one who's saying, oh, a foreigner might be offended by the jury trial, whatever."
2002.01-593,3,38238,peter_r_paden,,3451.794,3454.43,"--We're trying to honor the intent of Congress, Your Honor."
2002.01-593,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3454.818,3458.794,"And... and the Government answers no, that we don't think this is going to be disturbing foreign nations."
2002.01-593,3,38238,peter_r_paden,,3460.341,3478.361,"--I think what's salient is what Congress said, Your Honor, and Congress said that when claims are brought, when we are going to allow claims against foreign State entities for their commercial activities or whatever in this country, we're going to accord them the kinds of... the Federal jurisdiction breadth and lack of jury trial which we accord to ourselves when we agree to be sued."
2002.01-593,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3478.361,3487.639,"May I ask you what the purpose of filing this lodging was, this gigantic paper?"

2002.01-593,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3503.601,3507.964,But is this typical of what a district judge would have to look through to figure out ownership under your theory?
2002.01-593,3,38238,peter_r_paden,,3507.964,3508.476,"--No, sir."
