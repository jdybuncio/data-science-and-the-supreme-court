2004.03-1693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,6.316,And we will now hear argument in McCreary County against the ACLU.
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,39.547,42.891,Justice Stevens and may it please the Court.
2004.03-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,105.306,113.313,May I ask you there basically to comment on the point that Justice Scalia made in the course of the last argument?
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,170.527,171.27,--Several.
2004.03-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,197.527,199.96,"Well, they created the land mine basically."
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,200.332,209.331,"They were trying to do the best that they could, trying to follow this ever bending establishment clause jurisprudence especially in the area of displays."
2004.03-1693,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,262.831,267.001,Are you saying that the purpose is neutral or that the purpose doesn't matter?
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,267.001,272.324,"--We're saying that in this case, the purpose is about the display of law."
2004.03-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,280.476,285.949,"--Okay, but if we still have a purpose inquiry, what you say of course is true."
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,310.84,311.666,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,333.214,343.04,"You're not abandoning the position that you have a right to make this kind of religious display, are you?"
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,343.04,343.783,"--No, we're not."
2004.03-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,343.783,344.193,Okay.
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,344.193,357.279,"And that's why we said that they could have defended the individual first display which was the Ten Commandments alone, in part because it is the uniquely recognized historic symbol of law and is commonplace and thematic in the courthouse."
2004.03-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,369.722,402.044,"But is there... I guess... I don't want to tie you up too long but I mean given the history, isn't it still the case that there is no serious reason to believe that there is any object here other than the display of the Ten Commandments including the overtly theistic text and the rest of this is basically enabling context which does not affect the objective, the objective being the Ten Commandments and the religious text?"
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,402.044,409.064,"Your Honor, they must be able to change their misstep, if it was a misstep, that they had."
2004.03-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,416.988,419.012,"Well, not forever but for now."
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,459.796,469.91,--The intent has certainly broadened in this case and there is clearly no evidence in this record that this foundations display is solely purposed or intended to be a religious display.
2004.03-1693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,512.717,515.318,Suppose we go back to the first display.
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,521.179,522.914,--That is arguably constitutional--
2004.03-1693,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,522.914,526.835,Do we take it along with the resolution of the counties?
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,528.61,533.439,"--Your Honor, there was no resolution, Justice O'Connor, for the first display."
2004.03-1693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,533.977,539.755,"So just that first display, what was the purpose of that first one?"
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,539.755,544.008,The purpose of that first one is like it is in many courthouses around the country.
2004.03-1693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,570.607,572.093,The original one?
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,572.093,572.82,The original one.
2004.03-1693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,572.82,592.222,"Was there anything there that said we're interested in history and what we're not interested in is having this on the wall as... to encourage people to study the Bible and to encourage them to study religion and to understand that in their lives, religion should be important and this very solemn secular setting."
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,597.302,602.875,"No, it was just the document itself in a frame on a wall amongst almost 300 other documents."
2004.03-1693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.875,615.961,What if its purpose were to demonstrate... and I quote from one of our earlier opinions... that we are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,620.215,627.289,"I don't believe so, Justice Scalia, because that in fact is an acknowledgement that is part of our history; like in Marsh versus Chambers."
2004.03-1693,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,644.092,653.773,And is it your position that no real harm is inflicted on people who do not agree with that message?
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,653.773,654.97,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-1693,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,668.884,699.803,"Mr. Staver, what about all the distinctions that have been made between messages that are brief or I think the expression has been minimal or minimum in some of our cases, like in God we Trust, like God save the United States and this Honorable Court, like under God, and a document that is about worshipping the Lord, at least as many words devoted to that topic."
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,713.466,724.073,"--Justice Ginsburg, the Ten Commandments is a unique symbol in the area of acknowledgment because of its historic role in influencing our law and government."
2004.03-1693,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,735.219,739.594,Have you read the first four commandments and could you say that?
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,739.594,740.587,Sure.
2004.03-1693,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.708,757.881,Do you think the Ten Commandments are longer than the legislative prayers you've heard at the beginning of congressional sessions?
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,757.881,759.013,"No, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-1693,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,760.028,771.711,"I don't know how much help I can get or not but I was thinking in terms of the involvement of the government, is the government involved in religion when it posts the Ten Commandments alone?"
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,839.289,856.174,"No, Justice Breyer, it is not wrong to end with any more than it would be wrong to begin with the Sunday laws based upon the Sabbath commandment which was a commandment about worship and the end with the secular reason for keeping those particular laws as this Court has recognized in McGowan."
2004.03-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,914.791,925.77,"But I assume if you were running a course in a school about the biblical text, you would explain the differences."
2004.03-1693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,948.515,958.275,"Justice Souter, in fact it would be somewhat comparable because if you're teaching general biblical text, you wouldn't have all the different versions lined out."
2004.03-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,958.275,978.587,"Would you think it was appropriate in a public school course that was otherwise a bona fide course to teach the day on exodus, to teach about simply the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments?"
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,978.587,990.392,"We would believe that, in fact, in this case, I don't even think they thought about whether there were different versions but we certainly believe that they could have the text there and talk about the Ten Commandments."
2004.03-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,990.392,1018.051,"In a public school, wouldn't it be required, at least for intellectual reasons if not the reasons of the establishment clause to say, well, graven images are dealt with differently in the standard Roman translation and the preamble sections of what may and may not be regarded as commandment number 1 are different in the Christian versus Jewish and so on."
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1021.888,1025.314,That's in a school context which this is a courthouse context.
2004.03-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1025.314,1026.057,Exactly.
2004.03-1693,0,36736,mathew_d_staver,,1028.825,1037.287,"Not one to one but I think the version issue, if there is a version that flunks the test, it would be this Court's south frieze."
2004.03-1693,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1052.519,1053.612,You certainly may do so.
2004.03-1693,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1060.754,1065.295,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court."
2004.03-1693,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1080.073,1084.781,Do we have to consider the history of the display at all?
2004.03-1693,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1084.781,1088.906,"--Justice O'Connor, we would urge you not to consider the history of the display."
2004.03-1693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1112.395,1114.874,I don't know what you mean by the acknowledgment context.
2004.03-1693,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1114.874,1118.506,--I think this Court has said that you can accommodate religions.
2004.03-1693,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1270.473,1277.515,"Okay, but at the end of the day in Marsh, there wasn't any question that what they were doing was praying."
2004.03-1693,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1363.048,1365.194,"Justice Souter, I have two points in response."
2004.03-1693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.405,1425.668,"Basically, and I think I understand you, you're saying, and I think you said it earlier, drop the intent clause and basically have a... try to move toward an objective criterion saying there are some ways you can display religious things and some ways perhaps that you can't and try to develop that kind of objective jurisprudence as distinct from an intent jurisprudence."
2004.03-1693,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1426.966,1446.723,"That would be my point, Justice Souter, but I also think independent of that point, it is also not a particular productive jurisprudence to really treat municipalities differently because the mayor in one case may have started with the creche and decided to add the wishing well or in the other case started with the wishing well and added the creche."
2004.03-1693,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1451.264,1471.409,"Mr. Clement, you placed heavy reliance on Marsh, which was prayer and it was undisguised and it was permitted as it has been since the beginning of our nation."
2004.03-1693,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1483.586,1493.867,"Justice Ginsburg, I'm not sure that I could understand the jurisprudence that said this Court could not open its sessions with a prayer but the Capitol can."
2004.03-1693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1499.561,1500.842,I'm not sure we don't do it.
2004.03-1693,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1500.842,1505.217,"You know, it depends on how much content one wants to give--"
2004.03-1693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1505.217,1508.727,I don't know who we're addressing when we say God save the United States and this Honorable Court.
2004.03-1693,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1511.04,1520.245,"The kind of prayer that is used to open the legislative sessions which this Court has distinguished from in God we trust, God save the United States and this Honorable Court."
2004.03-1693,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1520.245,1526.644,"And as I said, Justice Ginsburg, I think if there were a difference in principle, it would have to be a difference based on history."
2004.03-1693,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1530.609,1545.22,I'm asking you what your view is of the compatibility of every federal Court in the country having over the bench a replica of the Ten Commandments and opening each session with prayer.
2004.03-1693,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1545.22,1552.939,"--Justice Ginsburg, I suppose if the federal courts decided to do that, we would probably try to defend them on establishment clause grounds."
2004.03-1693,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1580.803,1588.938,Do you think we have to amend the Lemon test to reach your approach?
2004.03-1693,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1588.938,1597.771,"Well, Justice O'Connor, this Court on a variety of occasions has chosen to simply put Lemon to one side as opposed to overtly amending it."
2004.03-1693,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1597.771,1602.888,"Do you think, then, we have to either put it aside or amend it?"
2004.03-1693,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1602.888,1605.034,"No, I don't, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-1693,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1605.034,1605.86,To decide this case?
2004.03-1693,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1605.86,1606.482,"No, I don't."
2004.03-1693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1666.684,1667.882,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,1671.225,1682.288,"Justice Stevens and may it please the Court, three times in the course of a year, McCreary and Pulaski county posted Ten Commandments displays."
2004.03-1693,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1895.045,1922.621,"Suppose you had a county 100 miles away or a state, a different state, and the same display was put on and the recitation was... and it was a sincere recitation, that the government simply wanted to recognize that the 10 Commandments has played an important role in the civic life of our people."
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,1950.279,1958.62,I think to an extent there is a differentiation because this Court has made clear that any assessment must depend on context.
2004.03-1693,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2042.21,2044.068,Does that mean forever?
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2131.254,2144.257,"I think it's a question of degree and while over time the importance of the purpose may diminish, the purpose does not fully diminish and the effect does not change substantially."
2004.03-1693,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2205.186,2208.53,Why is it?
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2235.984,2238.851,It's the difference between acknowledgment and endorsement.
2004.03-1693,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2268.223,2269.437,I don't think it stands for that.
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2297.535,2300.136,What this display says--
2004.03-1693,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2300.136,2308.514,I don't think they're really saying that the particular commandments of the Ten Commandments are the basis of the Declaration of Independence.
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2319.964,2326.142,"--Whatever the merit of that statement, that is not what these counties have said."
2004.03-1693,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2362.278,2365.251,"If that's what it means, it's idiotic."
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2372.209,2374.356,"I would agree with that, Your Honor."
2004.03-1693,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.356,2380.3,And I don't think that's how somebody would normally read it.
2004.03-1693,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2391.983,2400.645,How long is that resolution going to guide our view of the future displays or even the present one?
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2410.643,2423.846,"I think, Your Honor, it's an element that the District Court in the first instance must accept and gauge in determining whether or not the announced secular purpose is indeed a true purpose or is a sham."
2004.03-1693,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2453.534,2456.506,May I ask you a question on that point?
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2465.339,2466.165,"That is not correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-1693,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2472.853,2473.596,It is still on the books?
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2473.596,2474.423,It is still on the books.
2004.03-1693,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.491,2657.127,Is all of that in the record?
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2657.127,2658.447,That is not in the record.
2004.03-1693,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2658.447,2659.933,Then I don't think we should talk about it.
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2659.933,2676.817,"The District Court was well situated to understand the social fact, historical record and arguments of both the lawyers and the parties and the statements of the parties."
2004.03-1693,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2676.817,2681.814,"Mr. Friedman, can you tell me where in the joint appendix the resolution appears?"
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2681.814,2687.963,"Joint Appendix page 1, number 5, and it's Exhibit 1 attached to it."
2004.03-1693,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2709.845,2711.247,It's not printed?
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2711.247,2714.796,"It is not in the appendix itself, no."
2004.03-1693,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2721.278,2723.097,It is in the record which we have?
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2723.097,2723.673,It is in the record.
2004.03-1693,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2777.256,2785.512,"The other question I have is assuming you didn't have any of this history and they started off with plan 3, would that have violated the establishment clause?"
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2785.512,2787.164,"Yes, Your Honor, I think it would."
2004.03-1693,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2816.348,2818.456,I don't understand the difference.
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2851.604,2853.09,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-1693,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2853.09,2856.041,What does primacy have to do with it?
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2856.041,2864.114,I think it makes it an easier case when it asserts this is the one rather than one of several or one of many.
2004.03-1693,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2864.114,2870.885,"But your real position is they wouldn't have to have done that as long as they had the Ten Commandments in the display, that would be enough?"
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2870.885,2873.978,I think it depends on the content and context of the display.
2004.03-1693,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.978,2883.516,"Exactly what we've got in Exhibit 3 or whatever it is, that we don't have the statement of purposes, we don't have them saying it's the sole source or the primary source."
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2887.231,2888.307,"I think it does, Your Honor."
2004.03-1693,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2888.307,2924.566,"Since you have a minute, give me your opinion to the right standard if hypothetically you start with the Goldberg-Schempp idea, that the government is not absolutely forbidden by the establishment clause to recognize the religious nature of the people nor the religious origins of much of our law and so forth but it's easy to go too far and it's easy in this area you are trading on eggs to become far more divisive than you hoped and really end up with something worse than if you stayed out in the first place."
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2943.868,2952.209,I think the Court's endorsement test has stood the test of time and has worked well.
2004.03-1693,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2970.701,2988.079,Within reason outline an approach that would say a religious display is presumptively for... is a presumptive endorsement.
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,2995.304,3003.478,--We think that test can work very well in a context like this where we're talking about the display of religious texts rather than just symbols.
2004.03-1693,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3038.318,3041.912,Would you explain why you distinguish text and symbolize them?
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,3046.491,3054.748,"It does depend entirely on context, to be sure, but symbols are subject to alternative interpretation."
2004.03-1693,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3083.067,3087.647,I understand the text part but why not adopt the same test for the symbols?
2004.03-1693,2,20857,david_a_friedman,,3104.077,3106.844,There is no reason why it couldn't be applied just as well.
2004.03-1693,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3216.359,3217.573,"Thank you, Mr. Friedman."
2004.03-1693,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3220.529,3231.303,"Justice Stevens, the argument before this Court was unlike anything that went down in the District Court or the Circuit Court of Appeals because never was a resolution ever mentioned."
2004.03-1693,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3262.964,3265.787,"Was there a resolution, Counsel?"
2004.03-1693,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3265.787,3268.25,"For the second display, yes, Your Honor, there was."
2004.03-1693,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3268.25,3271.798,And whatever is in the record is that resolution?
2004.03-1693,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3271.798,3279.517,It is that resolution but it is specific to the second display because it specifically mentions what kind of documents are in that display.
2004.03-1693,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3286.576,3290.828,But is it correct that it was not amended when the third display was created?
2004.03-1693,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3290.828,3297.228,--It was not amended because it was not... it was relevant and fact-specific in the display itself.
2004.03-1693,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3297.228,3300.776,It is the last expression of the governing body's intent?
2004.03-1693,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3300.776,3301.769,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1693,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3308.661,3310.974,But there hasn't been a new resolution.
2004.03-1693,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3310.974,3312.832,--There is not a new resolution.
2004.03-1693,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3312.832,3313.825,And that one wasn't rescinded?
2004.03-1693,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3313.825,3317.085,"That one died, Your Honor, with the Court's ruling."
2004.03-1693,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3317.085,3320.884,"It was adopted and it still is there, presumably?"
2004.03-1693,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3320.884,3322.203,Presumably.
2004.03-1693,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3404.231,3410.38,So presumably these things are open if it goes on to the final hearing?
2004.03-1693,3,36736,mathew_d_staver,,3412.776,3414.157,"Yes, the preliminary injunction."
2004.03-1693,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3424.454,3425.402,Thank you.
