1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.152,"We'll hear argument first this afternoon on Number 87-283, Joseph Budinich v. Becton Dickinson and Company."
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,14.199,16.322,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,81.999,90.526,All the law said is that the attorney's fees are required in these cases.
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,90.526,105.63,"The normal cases construing attorney's fees have dealt with taxing attorney's fees as cost, or as an ancillary or collateral matter, Mr. Justice."
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,125.481,130.932,So you say that's different from the normal award of attorney's fees?
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,130.932,134.634,"In that there is no court determination mandated in that, for one thing."
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,138.944,141.678,As to whether to grant attorney's fees?
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,141.678,143.599,--as to whether to grant the attorney's fees or not.
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,143.599,146.081,Sort of like in the treble damage antitrust case?
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,146.081,148.221,It could be analogized to that.
1987.87-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,166.058,171.65,"You mean to be decided, as to amount, by the jury?"
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,171.65,171.978,It could be.
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,171.978,175.539,"That isn't the way it works in Colorado, in the Colorado courts, is it?"
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,175.539,180.599,"It would be a case of first impression, Mr. Justice."
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,180.599,184.331,You mean nobody's ever raised the point?
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,184.331,185.598,Nobody has ever raised it before.
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,185.598,190.767,"But the practice is that the judge decides the amount, in the Colorado courts?"
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,190.767,201.044,The practice is the judge decides the amount and the fact of this case is that it was submitted to the judge for a determination and this case was tried to a jury.
1987.87-283,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,267.377,277.248,"Counsel, what did the legislature have in mind when they added the final phrase to the statute: to be taxed as part of the cost of the action?"
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,289.648,301.487,"We would submit that after the comma, and that the language that you are quoting, Mr. Justice, is the procedural part of how the attorney's fees are to be collected."
1987.87-283,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,337.958,345.407,"Well, is the entry of the judgement postponed until the amount of the attorney's fees is determined?"
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,345.407,347.485,In Colorado it has been.
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,387.64,411.99,"Well, it does seem there is some sense to what the Tenth Circuit said that you are really inviting just a mass of confusion if in a case tried in the District Court in the federal system you have to examine each state statute to see whether attorney's fees are part of the recovery or separate."
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,417.191,429.404,"Mr. Justice, we would suggest that it is no more complicated or taxing than the substantive state law, come determinative cases, on the Erie line of cases."
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,439.853,444.789,But this type of thing determines the timeliness of appeals in that sort of thing.
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,450.146,465.109,That is correct but only in the sense that finality under 28 USC 1291 can be interpreted either way.
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,496.142,519.601,"But if we interpret it the latter way, so that a state may vary in deciding whether attorney's fees are part of a judgement or something added after, so that it's different from our White doctrine in the federal attorney's fees statute, then every single federal court is faced with the statutes of several different states."
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,527.1,550.808,"We would suggest, Mr. Justice, that if the outcome, if the remedy, is part of substance, that, under the state system level, then the Erie doctrine would prevent a simple procedural rule from applying in the so-called bright line manner in which the Tenth Circuit does follow."
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,573.361,585.138,"What's the practical difference, so far as Plaintiffs and Defendants suing each other in real courts are concerned, other than the fact that an appeal may be untimely if you follow one rule?"
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,598.336,612.252,"--It could affect substance in the essence, in the simplest sense, that the trial court judge would retain jurisdiction over the attorney's fee issue and force a double appeal."
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,615.345,617.531,And it happens in federal cases?
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,617.531,639.116,"It happens in federal cases under the Collateral Rule doctrine perhaps because of the injunctive relief factor on the... the only federal cases that are well-hammered out are the civil rights cases, the 42 USC 1988 cases to implement 1981, 1982 and 1983."
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,639.116,639.631,"And there, there is a double appeal, isn't there?"
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,639.631,641.756,"And there, in essence, there is a double appeal."
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,641.756,648.222,Does it make any difference in the amount you recover or anything like that?
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,648.222,652.751,"It does if you exclude injunctive relief, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,712.993,722.395,"The reason you apply Erie in a federal court is so you'll get the same substantive result, substantive law result, in federal court as you do in state court."
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,733.781,734.516,It could.
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,734.516,735.108,How?
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,735.108,737.889,It could in the sense that the procedure--
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,737.889,739.935,But I'm talking about substance.
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,742.45,757.131,"--If the intention of the statute is to encourage or to make parties... in essence, all attorney's fees cases enacted by statute are compensatory."
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.591,784.386,"Yes, and how would that come out differently in federal court than in state court, if the White rule was followed across the board as the Tenth Circuit?"
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,784.386,786.354,Because the substantive law of Colorado--
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,786.354,790.993,"I mean, would you recover less attorney's fees?"
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,790.993,791.851,--Perhaps.
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.851,792.258,How?
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,792.258,798.051,"If, because attorney's fees can be part of the merits and part of the damages under Colorado's law."
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,833.491,856.872,"But I still haven't heard you say anything as to how if you could recover $10,000 damages and $5,000 attorney's fees... say, if you're trying this case in the District Court of the City and County of Denver, you couldn't also recover $10,000 damages and $5,000 attorney's fees if you're trying it in the United States District or for the District of Colorado?"
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,856.872,861.824,It would be you would lose the right.
1987.87-283,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.0,931.686,I must confess I don't really follow your argument.
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,954.302,964.064,"Mr. Justice, the essence of the response is that you're taking a portion... you don't have finality."
1987.87-283,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,977.683,982.165,Are you talking about arguments made in the trial court or arguments made in the Court of Appeals?
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,982.165,1001.752,"I'm saying that, under Erie and under the unitary... there is not variation in Colorado... under the unitary treatment of cases in Colorado, a case is not final in the federal sense under 1291 until attorney's fees are part of that judgement."
1987.87-283,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1001.752,1007.094,"I understand the conceptual argument, but I think the Chief Justice was asking you as a practical matter, what difference does it make?"
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1019.916,1021.821,You could make those same arguments.
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.237,1079.439,"But there's nothing to be decided about attorney's fees except amount, in Colorado rule."
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1082.141,1083.344,It could be.
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.344,1085.093,"Well, it is."
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1085.578,1093.135,"If, in fact, it could be a source of who decides it, as suggested earlier."
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1093.135,1102.429,"If a liability is appealed separately and it's reversed, there's not going to be any attorney's fees, I gather?"
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1102.429,1107.427,There would not be under the Peace Act.
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.005,1114.377,"If the Plaintiff wins and the Defendant appeals and wins on the merits, there's not going to be any attorney's fees?"
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1114.377,1114.784,That is correct.
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.784,1135.228,"Under your view then, every single case you're going to have to litigate the amount of attorney's fees before you can ever appeal and you're going to have just a lot of useless... everytime there's a reversal, the litigation on attorney's fees will be useless."
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1135.228,1140.117,The litigation on attorney's fees insofar as--
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.117,1141.382,It would just be a waste of time.
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1141.382,1142.148,--It would be.
1987.87-283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.175,1165.842,"Well, it's bad enough to have two pieces of litigation in every case: one on the merits and one on attorney's fees, but it's even worse to go through the procedure of litigating the attorney's fees when there may be no need for it."
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1165.842,1185.132,"If, in fact, a state chooses to put the attorney's fees issue into an element of the case on the merits it is implicit within that decision: a) that they have a right under Erie to do it and b) that it is going to increase the complexity of the litigation."
1987.87-283,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.132,1188.943,Can't we decide how the matters will be appealed?
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1199.313,1222.022,"If, in fact, that decision is for a procedural rule efficiency or efficacy in the administration of the federal courts and if, in fact, it changes the substantive law of the state or changes the finality requirement under state law, which has substance implicit within it, then we respectfully submit you can't do it."
1987.87-283,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.022,1223.226,"Well, I agree."
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1258.743,1276.235,"Because, Mr. Justice, you impose upon Colorado the federal civil rights developing bifurcation collateral issue label for attorney's fees."
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.065,1323.154,"Mr. Frank, let me ask you a question about how Colorado judges deal with this type of wage statute which I see your opponent says really isn't, doesn't, treat it much different than the federal courts do."
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1333.431,1337.804,"There has not, to my knowledge, ever been a case that has done that."
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1337.804,1338.226,Okay.
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1342.225,1346.941,"To my knowledge, the issue has not been determined whether it could go to a verdict or not."
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1351.985,1357.733,"Well, my question was: a verdict just embraces damages and not attorney's fees."
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1359.108,1361.388,It just embraces damages.
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1362.106,1366.183,So then you apply later to the judge for attorney's fees?
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1366.183,1367.213,So far that is correct.
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1367.213,1372.088,And how does that differ from the federal system?
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1372.088,1390.625,"It differs from the federal system now in that the case is not final under Colorado's process, if you will... I won't go any further than to use the word process... until that determination becomes part of the record, howsoever it's done."
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1391.75,1393.844,So it's a question about when the judgement becomes final?
1987.87-283,0,42691,thomas_frank,,1393.844,1399.778,"--It's a question of finality, currently."
1987.87-283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1403.715,1405.089,"Thank you, Mr. Frank."
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1407.026,1414.663,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-283,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1613.911,1621.064,"Well, that's true but they don't give us limitless discretion as to how to regulate it."
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1651.52,1652.473,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-283,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1652.473,1657.799,--because they may never have to reach the... whether there was reliance on it... if there was no falsehood at all.
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1658.033,1658.846,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1987.87-283,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1663.329,1663.704,Why?
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1669.42,1675.401,The Respondent believes that the Petitioner is not correct in his interpretation of Colorado law.
1987.87-283,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.396,1689.302,"And you agree that if you're wrong about that, you lose?"
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1689.302,1689.661,No.
1987.87-283,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.661,1692.504,"Well, then you want to answer my question, don't you?"
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1692.504,1692.754,Yes.
1987.87-283,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.384,1872.603,Are costs or are not costs?
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1872.603,1873.79,--I'm sorry.
1987.87-283,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.631,1878.116,Are not costs.
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1878.116,1881.083,--we still believe they would be collateral to a decision on the merits.
1987.87-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.717,1907.995,"Wouldn't you agree, though, that Colorado law is binding on the federal court as to the entitlement to attorney's fees?"
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1907.995,1911.775,"As to the entitlement to attorney's fees, yes, Justice White, but we do--"
1987.87-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.775,1912.821,So it is a substantive rule?
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1912.821,1917.07,"--We're not talking about the entitlement, I don't believe, in this case."
1987.87-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.864,1935.718,"So the federal court wouldn't be free to say, well, federal law determines whether attorney's fees are to be allowed?"
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1935.718,1937.107,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1948.634,1960.551,"Or, to put it another way, I suppose, without even mentioning attorney's fees yet, to say the federal law has a right to determine when the judgement is final?"
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1960.551,1963.315,"In the federal court system, yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1965.971,1966.502,And appealable?
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1966.502,1967.142,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1987.87-283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.142,1968.049,And appealable?
1987.87-283,1,43232,terre_lee_rushton,,1968.049,1968.938,And appealable.
1987.87-283,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.163,2381.661,"Thank you, Ms. Rushton."
1987.87-283,2,42691,thomas_frank,,2384.254,2389.566,Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Court:
1987.87-283,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2520.826,2522.154,"Thank you, Mr. Frank."
