1959.55,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,268.401,271.651,Do you make any distinction between the real tax payments?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,271.651,272.746,We do not sir.

1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,592.207,607.113,We claim that whether its compensation is really a characterization of legal result and for purposes of the -- putting it under pigeon hole in Section 61 (a) we would say it is compensation.
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,607.8,612.7,Because it comes out of what they've earned?

1959.55,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,708.624,714.477,And Congress has exempted the part that they didn't have to pay from what I gather.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,714.477,716.435,You mean the allowance or the deduction?
1959.55,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,716.435,716.877,Yes.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,716.877,725.107,That's under the general trade or business allowance by deduction of the Commissioner's rule that it is a legitimate trade or business expense.

1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,793.304,809.586,Only life insurance and insurance proceeds for personal injuries are excluded by the code and it's been a consistent position of the service that any other insurance arrangement results in a taxable gain.
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,809.586,813.764,"I think we had a case on that years ago, didn't we?"

1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,814.164,816.641,Maybe that was for injuries from some railroads.

1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,929.951,930.565,By rulings.
1959.55,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,931.061,931.605,By rulings.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,931.605,932.468,There maybe a regulation.
1959.55,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,933.847,938.891,What has been the practice of the department in the collection of these taxes?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,946.089,951.277,I'm informed by the -- the revenue service that the ruling position has been consistent.
1959.55,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,951.277,951.87,I beg your pardon.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,951.87,962.604,"That the ruling decision position, their announced position has always been consistent that these are taxable, but this is the problem always encountered in dealing with -- with small returns."

1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,988.502,989.252,No.

1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1035.017,1042.521,"I -- probably, we do deal with that in our reply brief but that is filed only today."
1959.55,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1051.896,1054.909,Was any exception taken at the trial?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1054.909,1055.787,I believe --
1959.55,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1055.787,1057.306,Other instructions asked?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1057.306,1059.127,"I believe not, sir, I believe not."
1959.55,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1089.757,1094.56,Was that question raised at the trial or did the Government proceed only --
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1094.56,1103.496,"We moved for directed verdict and as the District Court explained it in its later opinion, he did not grant the directed verdict, only ordered to have a complete record."
1959.55,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1110.765,1129.878,The reason that I'm asking about is that I notice it's your argument that -- that you are making points that the judge makes in his instructions to the jury and you're apparently appraising for (inaudible) the instruction on the Union Constitution.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1135.402,1136.54,"I -- Yes, he did."
1959.55,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1145.309,1151.318,"Well that's the construction of the Union Constitution, but the fact that it was paid --"
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1151.318,1151.763,But the --
1959.55,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1151.763,1162.061,"-- pursuant to provisions of the Union Constitution Board according to the district judge's instructions on whether or not, it wasn't delicately handled."
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1162.061,1172.184,"Well, the difficulty with the instructions, it seems to me, is -- well I will give you one example of the kind of inconsistency."
1959.55,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1232.462,1240.235,Do you think that these questions are questions of law or questions of -- for a jury?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1240.235,1240.839,They're always --
1959.55,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1240.839,1244.176,In this case you say it shouldn't have gone to the jury at all.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1244.176,1246.16,That is right.
1959.55,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1303.958,1308.849,Well I say that the -- it was the intention of the union to pay for services.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1308.849,1309.203,Well --
1959.55,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1309.203,1311.614,-- these payments were income.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1314.823,1317.351,"Well, we don't think that's the question."
1959.55,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1318.311,1320.525,But isn't that one little piece of income?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1320.525,1325.494,"No -- it's not a great deal of elaboration, that the question is not one of the intentions."
1959.55,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1380.902,1383.293,"I think that this judge covers that, doesn't he?"
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1397.192,1397.369,Particularly --
1959.55,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1397.369,1398.0,That's part of what you thought.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1398.0,1398.338,Yes.
1959.55,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1415.703,1427.333,"Mr. Barnett, as I understood your answer to Justice Douglas' question as to whether this is the question of law of fact that these are the answered questions or is that coming at the end?"
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1427.333,1427.704,Well --
1959.55,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1427.704,1428.385,I guess --
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1428.385,1429.617,I think that question -- yes.

1959.55,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1440.054,1440.569,All right.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1441.542,1448.367,You need first to go through the problem to find out what it is that turns on and then decide whether that was the question of fact.
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1459.612,1462.923,You mean that's the standard of law that we can go by?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1462.923,1463.606,No.

1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1651.233,1652.084,That is conceded.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1652.084,1652.689,"Oh, yes."
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1660.38,1664.003,"And you say that it's limited to strikers and therefore, that's the difference."
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1664.003,1664.481,Yes.
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1699.473,1703.147,Or the members of the racial group?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1715.631,1718.916,To -- I'm just asking if -- yes.
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1718.916,1720.345,(Voice Overlap)
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1720.345,1724.233,And this is a fund which will be distributed only to the members of the group.
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1724.233,1726.551,"Yes, so that racial group."
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1728.29,1729.893,"No, I think that would not be."
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1732.3,1732.742,What?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1736.403,1737.345,Yes.
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1781.345,1785.096,May I ask you if Congress has been presented with this problem at all.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1785.096,1785.473,"No, sir."
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1786.346,1790.286,Has the department made any effort to get them take it up?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1790.286,1791.137,"No, sir."
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1792.604,1795.244,How long has this effort been made -- elected?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1795.244,1797.258,Since 1920.
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1797.258,1798.3,Since 1920?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1798.3,1798.68,Yes.
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1798.68,1802.521,The Government has been collecting these funds -- taxes on these since 1920?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1802.521,1813.476,"Well as I answered the Chief Justice, we have no records of the extent to which people actually pay taxes when he announced."
1959.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1823.682,1826.273,But do you have any statistics here that you can give us on that?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1826.273,1826.899,"No, sir."
1959.55,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1842.755,1870.417,"Mr. Barnett, do I understand that if this had been -- this fund had been for the purpose of relieving the stress of needy union members and that the money had been paid out in circumstances such as it was paid on here to this man, that the situation would be different, your position would be different?"
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1870.417,1875.239,"If it were limited to unemployed members, generally not strikers."
1959.55,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1875.239,1878.607,To needy -- let's say to needy members.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1878.607,1878.933,Yes.
1959.55,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1881.196,1882.064,Yes.
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1887.443,1887.926,Yes.
1959.55,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1887.926,1889.166,Would the situation be different?
1959.55,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1889.166,1897.036,I don't think it makes any (Inaudible) fact the striker if the policy is to give it to all unemployed members.
1959.55,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1956.97,1959.104,Mr. Rauh.
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,1959.104,1961.195,May it please the Court.
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2097.201,2105.584,"Mr. Rauh, this case could be decided restrictively to the facts that you just stated which I take for granted as so."
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2107.713,2112.206,"It's up to Your Honor, as to determine how much farther in the record they would go in an instant case."
1959.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2137.846,2142.587,"So, that -- that to same therefore the argument goes out that this is just a return of something that he paid."
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2142.587,2144.257,"Yes, precisely, Your Honor."
1959.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2146.833,2147.645,I didn't ask it.
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2148.182,2150.23,Someone asked Mr. Justice Brennan that --
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2150.23,2156.009,"My question to you wasn't hostile because if that's all there is to the case, I don't see why we are (inaudible)."
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2156.009,2157.299,Well --
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2157.299,2165.433,"It's just a -- strikingly just a very particular special case, but that isn't the norm of strike benefit --"
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2165.433,2165.755,All right.
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2166.301,2167.436,Is that the normal strike benefit?
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2167.436,2168.002,"No, sir."
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2171.158,2172.454,Well I'm just -- I'm not asking you one way or the other.
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2177.92,2184.515,"Well, if you would have asked me how I got here, I don't explain that I'm not sure on that ground."
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2277.675,2278.875,"You are arguing the other cases, aren't you?"
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2278.875,2279.968,"No, Your Honor."
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2280.352,2283.729,Will it give us the benefit of your wider experience with the unions?
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2283.729,2285.429,"I hope, too, sir."
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2484.359,2496.299,"Maybe the difficulty isn't' trying to deal with these questions on slogans like right, benefit, Social Security in relation to tax question."
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2496.299,2496.616,It may be.
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2496.616,2502.311,"And between private -- between private grant to public grant, there may be a difference that's valid --"
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2502.311,2509.073,"But there has been no suggestion of that either in the law or in the Government's brief other than the assertions of it, Your Honor."
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2509.073,2514.427,"With great respect to the Government's brief on speaking isn't to be limited by their briefs, is it?"
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2514.427,2517.358,I hadn't suggested that.
1959.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2533.733,2534.72,Twenty five?
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2534.72,2538.127,"Twenty five of the white one, Mr. Chief Justice."
1959.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2613.483,2615.723,"Well, it has been suggested ever since 1920."
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2615.723,2624.731,"And precisely what I wanted to answer at this point, that is not -- that is not -- not a correct -- I don't mean to disagree with that."
1959.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2717.375,2727.34,"Well as a practical matter, the district judge makes a statement on page 46 of the record that there were unbelievable number of men who had pay a similar tax."
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2727.34,2736.416,"There is no -- there's not one word in the record, if Your Honor please, that supports that statement if he -- if he get -- if it has -- it happened at this particular time."
1959.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2833.711,2834.5,Thirty one.
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2834.5,2846.779,"-- just before the footnote, rulings rendered before Glenshaw Glass cut unordered and adhered to by the Commissioner seems have to say, this walls of rulings rendered after Glenshaw Glass recognizes nontaxable."
1959.55,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2866.956,2881.379,"Mr. Rauh, without going through all these and I haven't read them today, are these cases where the theory is based that the person is simply being made whole with the equivalent of a verdict for personal injuries or insurance for personal injuries?"
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,2881.379,2884.059,"Some would be, Your Honor, they wouldn't."
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3200.124,3202.403,"But that isn't the only reason, Mr. Rauh."
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3205.898,3215.906,"Well, there is -- if Your Honor please, there is not a single suggestion at any time of any factual support for that argument."
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3215.906,3218.128,"No, but I don't need any factual support."
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3221.383,3227.716,"I would say, sir, that there are mixed motives in practically everything one does in life."
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3227.716,3238.502,"But you know, it's better than our view that -- that but for strike that the presence of a strike, the availability of the strike has something to do with getting people to go on strike."
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3238.502,3239.942,I wouldn't accept that --
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3239.942,3241.032,You wouldn't accept.
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3241.032,3248.127,Probably I will accept something else if I could compromise a little bit here on what -- what we could accept.
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3257.087,3258.427,That's too large in abstraction.
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3258.427,3264.201,"Well, I was going to try to say what -- I was going to try to say what they were and what the dominant one was."
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3283.872,3284.738,I think that's my suggestion.
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3291.082,3292.456,I wouldn't -- I couldn't quite --
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3292.456,3293.881,Would he -- would you agree with that?
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3293.881,3295.175,"No, I can't quite buy that."
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3295.175,3296.391,It doesn't very much bother you.
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3296.391,3308.557,"And I'll -- and the reason I can't, if Your Honor please, is that I think the -- the heat and emotion of a group about to take a strike code does not really consider that."
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3362.996,3378.206,"My question hasn't implied my attitude towards the problem before us, but I'm surprised if you would deny that the existence of a strike has something to do with determining the recommendations of leaders of labor whether they should go on strike."
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3378.206,3380.631,"If this is a good example on that, if Your Honor please --"
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3380.631,3382.701,I'm not talking about this particular thing.
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3397.349,3399.564,And precisely -- I was going to say it's unimportant.
1959.55,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3401.467,3403.632,But I like to get learning where I can get it.
1959.55,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3403.632,3404.482,Mr. Rauh.
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3404.482,3405.577,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.55,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3405.577,3415.93,"I understood you to say, you used this phrase, that some who have received these benefits have gone back in, by that, I assume you meant that after you received the benefits they've returned to work."
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3415.93,3416.844,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.55,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3416.844,3417.37,Yes.
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3422.785,3425.403,"No, Your Honor, they wouldn't be in the class that it's given to their partners."
1959.55,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3425.403,3426.829,Because they would no longer striking?
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3426.829,3427.31,That's right.
1959.55,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3440.953,3451.243,Is there not then some connection and relationship between the $16.50 pay than the continuation of the strike by remaining a striker?
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3451.243,3464.86,"I agree, if Your Honor please that there were in the unions a mixed motivation of hardship and strengthening this -- of alleviating hardship and strengthening striker."
1959.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3530.5,3532.729,Before you can get to that just one question.
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3544.491,3545.587,"Well, no, sir."
1959.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3551.268,3552.327,There's no legislation.
1959.55,1,32532,joseph_l_rauh_jr,,3552.327,3556.376,-- to commerce and as the Government has never gone to Congress and asked for this.
