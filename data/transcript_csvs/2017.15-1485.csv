2017.15-1485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.64,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-1485, the District of Columbia versus Wesby. Mr. Kim."
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,7.64,26.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Probable cause is a practical standard, and thus it accounts for the practical limitations that officers face when making arrest decisions, including their inability to look directly into the minds of suspects offering innocent explanations for suspicious conduct."
2017.15-1485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,46.52,65.2,"Mr. Kim, before you do that, could you clarify the other charges that are in this case, the one relating to disorderly conduct and negligent supervision? Where do they stand? And are they in any way affected by the argument you're making today?"
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,65.2,69.88,We do not pursue an argument that probable cause existed for disorderly conduct.
2017.15-1485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,85.0,89.24,"I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understood what you just said."
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,97.08,97.4,"No, that's right, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,97.4,103.96,"So why would our finding of probable cause affect it? I think those stand on their own, don't they?"
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,103.96,111.88,"No, Your Honor, if -- if there was probable cause, the negligent supervision would fail as a matter of law. That was undisputed in the courts below, and it's undisputed in this Court."
2017.15-1485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,111.88,114.36,"Well, we'll let your adversary answer that."
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,114.36,123.12,"Thank you, Your Honor. So my clients responded to a neighbor's complaints about illegal activities in a house in their residential community that was supposed to be vacant."
2017.15-1485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,131.08,141.52,"I'm sorry, why isn't there a right? Someone invites me into what they claim is their home or their place of living."
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,143.76,145.92,"Yes, there was a claim of invitation, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,150.72,151.0,But I don't --
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,151.0,151.4,-- a claim --
2017.15-1485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,151.4,154.44,-- have a property right when I get invited into someone's home.
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,154.44,155.0,"To be sure, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,155.0,156.92,I don't ask to look at their lease.
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,167.76,175.88,"Your Honor, we're not suggesting that there has to be some type of confirmation by any party guest of the inviter's right to invite."
2017.15-1485,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,233.0,235.28,"Just to make sure I understand, Mr. Kim."
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,252.68,255.28,"That's correct, Your Honor. It's actually multiple tippers."
2017.15-1485,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,255.28,255.8,Multiple?
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,255.8,256.6,"Multiple tippers, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,258.84,264.4,How -- just how many were there? These were calls to the officers before they went there --
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,264.4,264.72,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,264.72,265.76,-- or when they were there?
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,265.76,266.64,Before they went there.
2017.15-1485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,266.64,267.28,And how many?
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,267.28,269.32,"We don't know that, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,270.44,271.2,But more than one?
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,271.2,274.04,We do know from the arrest report that multiple people did complain.
2017.15-1485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,277.76,278.0,With more --
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,278.0,279.92,-- at least some calls before the investigation began.
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,279.92,282.72,How many people said the house is supposed to be vacant?
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,282.72,284.16,We know at least two.
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,284.16,284.48,Two said --
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,284.48,284.92,At least two.
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,284.92,286.52,-- the house is supposed to be vacant.
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,287.44,294.16,"Yeah, but then, when the police actually entered the home, they could see with their own eyes that the house was essentially unfurnished and in disarray in a manner that --"
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,294.16,295.8,There were some chairs and mattresses?
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,295.8,296.32,"That's right, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,296.32,296.76,Anything else?
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,296.76,298.16,There was -- there were some chairs.
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,302.72,304.28,Utilities working or not?
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,304.28,306.76,"Utilities were working, Your Honor, it appears; electricity and plumbing."
2017.15-1485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,306.76,307.2,With more --
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,307.2,313.12,"But that's consistent with there being a continued claim of right by the owner over the home, but he was absent from the home."
2017.15-1485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,321.04,325.04,Were the -- were the tips anonymous?
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,325.04,325.96,"No, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,329.6,338.24,"I mean, the -- I am told, perhaps I shouldn't take this into account, but compared to the Middle Ages with which I am more familiar -- (Laughter.)"
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,338.24,344.56,"-- the -- the people today, younger people frequently say, hey, there's a party at Joe's house."
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,365.04,365.08,Well --
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,365.08,378.6,"Because I -- if I just think that's what happened, hey, there's a party at Joe's house, I would think the people who went over there, whether they knew Joe, heard it secondhand, thirdhand or whatever, are normally naturally going to think that Joe has a right to the house."
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,382.6,388.84,"For two reasons, Your Honor. First, if I take your hypothetical correctly, Joe had the authority to throw the party."
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,389.28,391.52,"No, no, but I'm not talking about Joe's authority."
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,394.84,395.6,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,395.6,409.32,When they hear there's a party -- I don't want to repeat myself -- I'm saying what -- what I would assume is the normal thought in the partygoer's house is no more than just what I said. There's a party at Joe's house.
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,427.28,434.8,"Absolutely, Your Honor. What's different about this case are these facts: First, it was a house that was supposed to be vacant and looked vacant."
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,439.28,444.0,"No, no, I know that, but now put yourself in the mind of the -- of the partygoer."
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,469.8,479.72,"Well, the absence of the supposed host, Joe or Peaches, you can name however you want, the host wasn't even there. The person who supposedly gave them the authority over the house --"
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,479.72,479.88,Okay.
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,480.92,481.24,-- wasn't even there.
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,481.24,481.56,Okay.
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,481.56,486.52,There were illegal activities happening there or so the officers reasonably could think of the type typically associated --
2017.15-1485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,486.52,487.84,Was it -- may I stop you there?
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,487.84,489.08,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,489.08,501.4,"Didn't the person who extended the invitation, Peaches, hadn't she been there and she said she left to go to the store, but she had been there?"
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,501.4,506.0,"Your Honor, there was evidence that she told Officer Parker that she had gone to the store."
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,512.92,513.16,Okay.
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,529.68,530.52,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,549.4,549.84,Okay.
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,549.84,556.04,"And I don't think we should discount the fact that Peaches proved herself to be quite evasive, untrustworthy."
2017.15-1485,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,567.2,569.12,"That's it, though, that's it, nothing else?"
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,569.12,572.24,"There is more, Your Honor. I could keep on going."
2017.15-1485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,625.96,637.96,"Mr. Kim, why weren't any of these partygoers arrested? For example, one among the many officers said he smelled marijuana, but, as I understand it, no drugs were found, correct?"
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,637.96,639.84,"The evidence is that no drugs were found, that's right, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,639.84,642.52,Not marijuana or any other.
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,656.72,667.84,"Your Honor, everyone was arrested because the officers believed and they had probable cause to believe that everyone in the house had committed the offense of unlawful entry. Specific people in the house may have also committed other crimes, but --"
2017.15-1485,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,667.84,669.8,But they weren't charged with those crimes.
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,669.8,671.72,"As far as we know from the record, that's right, but --"
2017.15-1485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,671.72,673.88,How many -- how many people were in the house?
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,673.88,674.72,At the time 21.
2017.15-1485,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,676.32,697.16,"Mr. Kim, could you tell me a little bit about how you think the summary judgment posture of this case does or doesn't matter? I mean, usually in summary judgment cases, we say we need to view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. And many of these facts, you could see it one way or you could see it another way."
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,713.64,720.44,"Thank you, Your Honor. I think the essential facts were undisputed until Respondent's brief on the merits."
2017.15-1485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,744.8,751.44,What are the -- you said you were happy to discuss the reasons that the -- the -- the disputed facts come too late.
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,752.76,767.0,Because it was inappropriate for the respondents to wait even in their cert papers to raise these disputes and it was -- it is inappropriate for them to ask this Court to be the first Court to parse the record closely to consider these claims of dispute. These disputes were --
2017.15-1485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,767.0,785.68,"Why -- why would -- why would they be asking that? I mean, one thing is their motion for summary judgment, which was successful. But why would you be entitled to summary judgment in view of the disputed facts that they claim now?"
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,785.68,788.56,"Because, Your Honor, their disputes are waived or forfeited."
2017.15-1485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,822.2,822.36,What --
2017.15-1485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,822.36,826.52,So they -- they didn't dispute the central facts in their brief in opposition?
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,826.52,826.8,That's right.
2017.15-1485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,826.8,828.64,Facts that were laid out in the petition for cert?
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,828.64,832.88,"That's right, Your Honor. In fact, they affirmatively agreed to what we think is the most central fact."
2017.15-1485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,870.64,875.48,"They weren't charged with trespass, unlawful entry, were they?"
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,875.48,878.36,"They were, Your Honor. Unlawful entry was the charge."
2017.15-1485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,878.36,887.56,I thought that that charge was not made once they were at the police station and instead they were charged with disorderly conduct.
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,887.56,888.96,That's correct.
2017.15-1485,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,895.68,915.28,"And wasn't that because when their superior was on the scene and determined that the owner had not leased the house to anyone, he thought that that was sufficient to arrest?"
2017.15-1485,0,62854,todd_s_kim,,915.28,919.76,"Well, yes, Your Honor, that appears to be Sergeant Suber's subjective reasoning."
2017.15-1485,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,937.68,938.72,"Thank you, Counsel."
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,948.96,984.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are two fundamental errors in the way that the lower courts analyzed the question of probable cause in this case. First, they took certain important facts out of context, viewed them in isolation, and engaged in precisely the sort of divide-and-conquer analysis that this Court has said is inappropriate. And the second is they concluded that because those facts were susceptible to possible innocent explanations, they could not contribute to a finding of probable cause. Neither of those is correct."
2017.15-1485,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1097.92,1112.48,"You are saying that anytime a policeman goes into a house and there's a party and people tell you, somebody invited me, and it turns out that that somebody didn't have a right to be in the house, you can arrest them?"
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1112.48,1114.08,"No, I'm not -- I'm not saying that."
2017.15-1485,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1114.08,1114.52,You're not?
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1114.52,1114.52,No.
2017.15-1485,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1114.52,1116.08,Then what else is there here than that?
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1116.08,1116.16,Well --
2017.15-1485,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1116.16,1118.04,"Oh, sorry, there is one other thing."
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1138.96,1140.68,"It is not what I'm saying, and I think --"
2017.15-1485,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.68,1140.96,Okay.
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1141.72,1143.36,"Well, because -- there are two answers."
2017.15-1485,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1160.96,1168.04,"I'm saying what else is there here? And I don't see anything else. And maybe it's a question of believability, then let's have a trial?"
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1168.04,1176.04,"Well, let -- let me -- let me talk about the facts of this case, if I can turn to that. I think it's useful to think of this almost as like two sides of a ledger."
2017.15-1485,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1194.68,1207.64,"But the story of the -- of Peaches, who extended the invitation, was that she had just leased the house."
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1222.48,1230.6,"I -- I think that that is a perfectly permissible inference from the facts that you described, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.15-1485,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1255.84,1271.56,"What -- what was that? If all it had, according to you, was a bed and some folding chairs and utilities that worked, nothing had been turned off, what happens during a party?"
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1271.56,1271.96,Well --
2017.15-1485,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1271.96,1276.92,Disarray? So what was different in this disarray from a party?
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1276.92,1285.84,"Well, the -- the evidence in the record indicates that the house was considerably more dirty than just an ordinary house."
2017.15-1485,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1311.4,1312.8,Mr. Parker --
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1312.8,1313.72,Yes.
2017.15-1485,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1313.72,1319.24,"-- you know, you're exactly right, that, of course, we have to view this through the eyes of the officer."
2017.15-1485,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1365.24,1372.16,"-- where you didn't -- don't know the host, but you know Joe is having a party."
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1405.04,1421.92,"Well, I -- I think there are a couple of ways. I think the overarching point here is that, as I said, when a partygoer goes to a house, if it turns out that it actually is vacant and that they actually are intruding, the police, upon encountering that situation --"
2017.15-1485,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1421.92,1423.44,"Right, but they don't know that, as I said."
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1423.44,1423.84,That's right.
2017.15-1485,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1423.84,1435.08,"I mean, from the partygoers' point of view, they just know that Joe is having a big party, and it's a good time, and -- and maybe there will be some liquor and maybe there will be some recreational drugs."
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1438.48,1445.68,"I -- I think that that's an entirely possible inference to draw, but it's not the only inference."
2017.15-1485,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.36,1554.24,Finish your sentence.
2017.15-1485,1,62835,robert_a_parker,,1554.24,1558.76,-- when dealing with these sorts of people would think.
2017.15-1485,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1559.28,1570.0,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Garrett."
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1570.0,1579.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court should affirm the grant of Respondents' summary judgment motion. Respondents uniformly told police they had been invited to a party."
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1599.88,1606.84,"Well, there was a lot more involved that the Petitioner is relying on than those things that you just listed."
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1612.0,1614.76,So there was also the fact that Peaches was absent.
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1676.56,1680.2,Does it matter that the tips they had said that it was vacant?
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1680.2,1684.08,"Well, the tip, I think the tip is hard to sort of decipher."
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1709.76,1717.48,The important thing I suppose would be what the officers were told and whether it was reasonable for them to act on what they were told.
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1717.48,1720.36,"And it certainly was reasonable for them to act, Chief Justice Roberts."
2017.15-1485,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1743.72,1748.2,What should the officers have done after they had made all their inquiries at the house?
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1748.2,1768.8,"I think there are several things they could have done here, Justice Alito. Number 1, they now had information from the owner that he didn't want them there. They immediately could have asked the individuals or ordered the individuals to leave and, if they hadn't, that's unlawful entry. They could arrest. They could have issued a citation for disorderly conduct which likely would not have raised Fourth Amendment concerns at all."
2017.15-1485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1800.12,1807.92,"The key things that I hadn't fully taken in, one, you put yourself in the position of the officer."
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1844.08,1844.6,But --
2017.15-1485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1844.6,1853.24,"And -- and would a reasonable officer have concluded that the partygoers knew or they knew it was a vacant house? If so, that's enough."
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1853.24,1853.48,And --
2017.15-1485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1853.48,1857.08,"Because it is trespass to go into a vacant house, I gather."
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1857.08,1857.84,"No, it's not, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1857.84,1864.84,"It's not? Well, but the other stuff they have, I guess, isn't it? Vacant -- you can't -- it isn't trespassing in the District of Columbia to go into a vacant house?"
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1864.84,1865.72,"No, it's not, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.4,1867.32,What if -- go ahead.
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1867.32,1895.48,"Well, if a house is actually vacant -- I mean, this is the oddity of how this argument comes up -- if a house is actually vacant or abandoned, it's not trespassing because somebody is not maintaining their control over it. It is prima facie evidence of trespass if somebody's in a vacant house that is boarded up or otherwise secured in a manner that conveys it's not to be entered. I think one fact that was not talked about here is that there was no evidence of boarding up and there's no evidence of forced entry."
2017.15-1485,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1895.48,1905.28,"Well, when those tips -- when the people nearby called it and they said the house is vacant, you think they were referring to the technicalities of District of Columbia law? Don't you think they meant --"
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1905.28,1905.52,No.
2017.15-1485,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1905.52,1907.64,-- that nobody was living there?
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1907.64,1908.96,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1946.88,1949.36,"Well, the fact of what you just mentioned is troubling to me."
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1981.84,1984.2,"Well, it depends on what the party looks like."
2017.15-1485,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1984.76,1987.8,It looks exactly like this party.
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1987.8,1992.68,"Well, then I think the police need to invest- -- no, I think the police -- if the house is completely empty --"
2017.15-1485,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1992.68,1997.08,The facts are exactly the same except the party is in Potomac.
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,1997.08,1999.84,"Well, I think it would be a closer case, but I --"
2017.15-1485,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1999.84,2000.84,Why would it be a closer case?
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2000.84,2001.2,Because --
2017.15-1485,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2001.2,2005.44,"I mean, is the expectation, well, this is a low-income neighborhood; we don't care what goes on here?"
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2005.44,2023.8,"Oh, quite the opposite. The point is that we're looking at this from a police officer's commonsense perspective. And certainly it seems like commonsense that, if you're in River Terrace, the condition -- the facts that the home doesn't look the same as it might in Northwest D.C. is something the police ought to take into consideration."
2017.15-1485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2024.08,2027.04,This is important to me.
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2034.44,2035.08,"No, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2035.08,2042.8,"And, indeed, if the officers -- which is unlikely -- had known all these details, they would have known it's not vacant."
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2052.12,2053.12,Correct.
2017.15-1485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2053.36,2077.56,"So then the question becomes did -- would a reasonable officer have believed that they were trespassing and they were trespassing if and only if there is some reason a reasonable person could have believed that they knew that the person who invited them, first, second or thirdhand, did not have a right to be there?"
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2077.56,2078.56,Correct.
2017.15-1485,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2078.56,2082.2,And there's -- you think there's nothing to have a trial about?
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2082.2,2094.64,"Oh, I -- well, so let me -- let me maybe use that question as a transition to Justice Kagan's question about the differing standards of review in the different motions. So, both parties filed motions for summary judgment."
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2152.92,2155.24,But they did mention them in their petition.
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2184.92,2189.6,Because we can't challenge them when reviewing our motion for summary judgment.
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2189.76,2191.68,"No, no, these are historical facts that they asserted."
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2208.36,2221.8,"Again, I'm not sure I -- I could have much to add, other than if the question is whether we're reviewing our motion, we do take those facts as true. But they clearly -- Petitioners clearly know how to say we want a directed judgment in our favor."
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2241.32,2251.4,"Well, but I do think, again, under our rules, in reviewing either motion, you take the facts as they asserted in the petition that you either accepted or did not rebut."
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2251.4,2258.0,And -- and we don't dispute those facts in the context of our motion.
2017.15-1485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2363.44,2390.8,"Here, we've -- we've been talking about probable cause up until now, but there's also the qualified immunity question, and this Court has said that there's no liability on the part of the officer unless he or she knowingly violated the law or was plainly incompetent. So can you explain how you cross that hurdle?"
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2390.8,2391.6,Yes.
2017.15-1485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2434.32,2438.08,"Well, Mr. Garrett, as you say, it is an objective standard."
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2494.52,2498.68,"Well, I think what they make of that law -- and I want to make one clarification."
2017.15-1485,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2504.52,2506.32,Are all the others unlawful entry statutes?
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2506.32,2506.48,Yes.
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2571.48,2578.96,Did I understand you to suggest that the officers should have done more by way of investigation before arresting the partygoers?
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2578.96,2580.88,"Well, I was asked what else could they have done."
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2595.6,2602.44,I thought -- I thought I recalled from the Petitioners' brief that the police interviewed every one of the people at the party.
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2602.44,2604.96,"Well, I -- I don't think that's clear."
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2621.32,2622.76,How many officers were there?
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2622.76,2624.84,Ten to 15.
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2636.6,2645.92,"I thought -- I thought the record established that -- well, Mr. Kim represented that of the 21, 19 people could not identify the person who invited them."
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2645.92,2647.24,"That's not accurate, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2677.76,2684.48,"Does -- I don't recall, does the petition say anything about whether the police interviewed everyone at the party?"
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2684.48,2688.52,I don't recall.
2017.15-1485,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2791.52,2814.68,"Mr. Garrett, I just wanted to get back to Justice Alito's question because, as I understood it, you -- you agreed that it would be acceptable for an officer to make this arrest in a more affluent part of town. And maybe I'm mistaken in that, but because perhaps the furniture situation one should understand would be less in this area of town than that area of town."
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2831.72,2833.76,"I'm sorry if I misspoke, Justice Gorsuch."
2017.15-1485,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2844.08,2844.32,Right.
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2844.32,2844.76,And so --
2017.15-1485,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2844.76,2847.12,The commonsense perspective is it's a new tenant.
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2847.12,2847.56,I agree.
2017.15-1485,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2847.56,2853.68,"And so the new tenant, we all live -- if I work with boxes, and whatever part of town we're from."
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2859.12,2866.12,"No, no, no, Your Honor. All I'm saying is there are several considerations that could be taken into account in the condition of a property."
2017.15-1485,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2893.12,2894.4,Take away the for sale sign.
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2901.28,2908.96,"No, I think it's -- well, again, I think it's different because in that case there may likely be forced entry into the home because they don't have keys to the home."
2017.15-1485,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2908.96,2910.4,You keep adding facts.
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2915.64,2921.08,"I'm saying it's a closer case, but if there is some -- if the police come upon evidence --"
2017.15-1485,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2921.08,2931.04,"Shouldn't I worry that you think it's a closer case, that officers implicitly may distinguish, and you suggest should, based on where in town they're enforcing the law?"
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2931.04,2933.96,"Well, I think -- I think the contrary rule would be very odd."
2017.15-1485,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2953.32,2958.04,"Just out of curiosity, who is the bachelor at this bachelor party? (Laughter.)"
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2958.04,2964.36,"It -- it's not clear, but I'm glad you asked, Justice Alito, because the evidence on that is at JA 193."
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2983.0,2992.28,"I -- I hate to keep raising the point, but did you challenge the assertion that they said it was a bachelor party in your brief in opposition, because they certainly made that point in the petition for cert --"
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,2992.28,2996.0,"No, it was -- it was -- we agree that they all said it was a bachelor party."
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2996.0,2998.36,"I'm sorry, what is --"
2017.15-1485,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2998.36,3000.36,I thought some said it was a birthday party.
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,3000.36,3001.08,"No, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3009.36,3011.84,So Peaches is the host at a bachelor party.
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,3013.4,3043.8,"Yes. Justice Ginsburg, that evidence came in at trial after the summary judgment was concluded and, in fact, that happened on a couple of occasions where officers changed their story, and we were able to cross-examine them about it and get the officers to effectively admit their memory was better now than two years ago. And I think that, combined with the fact that the police report had a falsity in it, probably added to the damages result here."
2017.15-1485,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3043.8,3044.8,"I'm sorry, what's the falsity?"
2017.15-1485,2,62900,nathaniel_p_garrett,,3044.8,3050.08,"Oh, the police report states that Officer Parker found marijuana and field tested it for THC."
2017.15-1485,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3058.08,3063.48,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kim, four minutes remaining."

2017.15-1485,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3068.04,3107.88,"Mr. Kim, I don't know if I agree completely with your opposing counsel that the wealth of the neighborhood should make a difference, but I suspect that if police officers arrived at a wealthy home and it was white teenagers having a party, and one of them says, ""my dad just bought this house,"" that it would be very -- and I told the kids they could have a party, and it became, Joe told me to come, and Larry King told me to come, and X King told me to come, that those kids wouldn't be arrested."
2017.15-1485,3,62854,todd_s_kim,,3114.08,3114.32,"Well, Your Honor --"
2017.15-1485,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3114.32,3139.24,"So, how is this case different? Same set of facts: Sparsely furnished, even a little bit dirty, lights are on, that sort of thing. So shouldn't we have a rule that if we're going to require mens rea at all, that police officers should be treating people equally?"
2017.15-1485,3,62854,todd_s_kim,,3139.24,3141.72,Absolutely police officers should treat people equally.
2017.15-1485,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3152.76,3159.32,Twenty one people en masse arrested for trespassing for going to a party.
2017.15-1485,3,62854,todd_s_kim,,3162.56,3166.32,"Yes, Your Honor, because, first, they were responding to a community complaint."
2017.15-1485,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3175.0,3176.4,Peaches had keys.
2017.15-1485,3,62854,todd_s_kim,,3176.4,3176.92,We don't know that --
2017.15-1485,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3176.92,3181.04,"If those partygoers -- well, we know there wasn't forced entry."
2017.15-1485,3,62854,todd_s_kim,,3181.04,3183.16,"There is no evidence of forced entry for sure, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3204.56,3206.8,"Mr. Kim, you got up and said you had a few points."
2017.15-1485,3,62854,todd_s_kim,,3208.0,3208.52,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.15-1485,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3290.04,3309.32,"Mr. Kim, realizing that this is not the legal question before us, I'm just curious as to what your answer is. If you were giving counsel to the Police Department, and they said in a situation like this what should we do, a very different question from the legal question before us, but what would be the answer to that question?"
2017.15-1485,3,62854,todd_s_kim,,3309.32,3310.52,I think it's difficult.
