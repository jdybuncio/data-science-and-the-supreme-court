1967.405,0,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,31.206,33.599,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1967.405,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,33.599,34.492,Mr. Hutt.
1967.405,0,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,34.492,42.292,"I would like to defer to Mr. Tom Davis, a member of this bar and of the State of Texas bar to move the admission as pro hac vice."
1967.405,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,42.292,44.846,Permission is granted.
1967.405,1,42634,tom_davis,,44.846,48.381,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1967.405,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,56.621,57.602,Motion is granted.
1967.405,1,42634,tom_davis,,57.602,63.179,Thank you Your Honor.
1967.405,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,63.179,64.878,Mr. Davis.
1967.405,1,42634,tom_davis,,64.878,68.048,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1967.405,2,32786,jutice_stewart,,243.932,245.64,All for public drunkenness?
1967.405,3,42634,tom_davis,,245.64,247.344,All except for one.
1967.405,4,32786,jutice_stewart,,783.931,783.977,How hard --
1967.405,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,783.977,796.141,Aren't there so many communities so that don't have any medical facilities in this day regardless of what the humanities of this -- of such cases are?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,845.481,852.17,There can be no question that there's going to be some temporary dislocations where this Court to hold down.
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.69,859.083,Of course the --
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,859.083,861.707,There will be temporary dislocations.
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,861.707,868.996,Doesn't your argument go far to be saying that they may not criminally punish?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,879.63,880.046,"Yes, yes."
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,880.046,885.473,"And if the -- if they're danger to themselves and somebody else, you say they should be taken to a hospital?"
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,885.473,887.59,"No, no."
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.029,906.496,"I didn't say -- I just said it's a -- here's a gentleman who maybe hopelessly drunk on a street and he maybe in danger to himself, his condition maybe dangerous to himself."
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,906.496,906.966,Yes sir.
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.966,909.585,I thought awhile ago you suggested he should be taken to the hospital?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,909.585,911.264,"Yes sir, I do."
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,911.264,913.77,Against his will?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,913.77,918.765,"Once again, I don't think a person in that condition can rationally refuse medical health."
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,921.301,926.517,What will be -- how soon at the hospital may he decide he wants to leave?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,926.517,928.559,Well I think when they sober him up.
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.559,928.846,When?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,931.17,933.045,Whatever it takes medically to --
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.045,935.259,You mean like 48 hours or 4 days?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,935.259,937.545,"No sir, I don't think it takes that long."
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,938.395,942.327,"But in any event, your argument is that they may not arrest them and take them to jail?"
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,942.327,943.476,That is correct.
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.476,953.633,So it's just an imposition of criminal punishment is they may not take them to the -- take them -- arrest and take to jail or even take them to the jail.
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,953.633,960.572,"Well, we need to differentiate between two classes here of people here."
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,962.833,966.532,And your just -- I gather your argument is just addressed to chronic alcoholic?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,966.532,967.332,That is correct.
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,967.332,968.902,Not just to people who are drunk.
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,968.902,969.564,That is correct.
1967.405,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,969.564,973.499,"Well how -- who determines where there's a chronic alcoholic, the policeman?"
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,973.499,976.655,"No sir, that was what I was going to point out."
1967.405,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,987.682,989.089,Take him where?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,989.089,990.981,To the station.
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,990.981,991.527,-- to arrest?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,991.527,992.689,"Yes, yes."
1967.405,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,992.689,994.046,Against his will.
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,994.046,996.105,Yes.
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1010.543,1014.048,But not in this case there's not much question about this --
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1014.048,1014.968,There's no question at all about it.
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.968,1020.046,-- at this person and they don't need to take him to the station to find out because they're well acquainted with him.
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1020.046,1021.328,That's right.
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1021.328,1024.835,So you woud say they had no power to arrest this man?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1024.835,1027.367,Unless in the sense to take in for punishment.
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1027.367,1030.468,Well let me see if I get your proposition correctly.
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1056.004,1056.639,That's right.
1967.405,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1057.197,1078.191,"Well then that's to say then if, as I understand it, if an officer comes upon a person who is drunk, and if there is an ordinance that makes an offense -- makes an offense of public drunkenness then the officer may arrest him, correct?"
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1078.191,1081.861,"Now, do I understand you're purposing this, he comes across and know him chronic alcoholic?"
1967.405,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1081.861,1083.75,"No, no he comes across a person who is drunk."
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1083.75,1085.106,"Who is drunk, okay."
1967.405,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1085.106,1086.139,And he may arrest him --
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1086.139,1086.257,Yes.
1967.405,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1086.257,1087.909,-- for the offense of public drunkenness.
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1087.909,1089.36,Yes sir.
1967.405,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1089.36,1091.477,But -- and take him to the police station.
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1091.477,1092.337,Yes sir.
1967.405,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1092.337,1105.177,"But once he gets him there, he may not prosecute him for the offense -- well he may prosecute him for the offense of public drunkenness, but the defendant will have a defense of chronic alcoholism, is that it?"
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1105.177,1105.98,That is correct.
1967.405,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1105.98,1110.682,Well then I don't quite understand the relevance of many of our -- of this discussion of --
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1110.682,1111.029,I think we're focusing --
1967.405,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1111.029,1112.915,-- take him to a hospital first as well.
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1112.915,1115.578,Well I think we're focusing on a very narrow part.
1967.405,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1130.881,1150.882,"Yes, but I want to get clearly that you're not disputing the constitutionality of a public drunkenness, ordinance or statute nor on its face nor on of the arrest under that of a person who is drunk on the street and his prosecution for that offense."
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1156.315,1157.005,That is correct.
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.363,1167.292,"But if he attempts to cross a known alcoholic, a chronic alcoholic, may he do the same thing?"
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1167.292,1173.693,"Your Honor, certainly we would hold that he would pick him up and take him to a health facility."
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1173.693,1176.854,"Well I know but you're arguing about the constitution, I suppose and the --"
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1176.854,1195.075,"Constitutionally, I don't believe it would be a false arrest, because as I stated a moment ago to the answer Justice Fortas' question, they have a power not only to enforce the rules, but also to protect the health of the citizens."
1967.405,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1206.048,1224.784,Is there any other instance in the law that you know of where it makes that kind of a distinction between the right to prosecute or right to arrest?It sounds I -- it seems to be something that --
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1224.784,1226.186,Well I'm not saying --
1967.405,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1226.186,1235.817,-- is a noble and I'm not at all sure that anyway that it would achieve the objective that you desire.
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1235.817,1239.345,I am not saying the police have the power to arrest.
1967.405,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1239.345,1246.071,"Well then, how do they take -- what do you call it when they pick up the fellow and he says “I don't want to go.”"
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1246.071,1248.004,Let's focus on it this way.
1967.405,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1248.004,1252.05,And they take him up anyway and take him to the precinct.
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1252.05,1257.405,Let's focus on it this way.
1967.405,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1263.806,1265.213,Well that's good.
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1265.213,1270.921,"If a man is insane and he's out in public, they pick him up and they take him to the health facility."
1967.405,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1272.893,1275.47,"No, are you sure of that?"
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1275.47,1277.515,Well the defense of insanity is raised.
1967.405,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1277.515,1278.646,I beg your pardon?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1278.646,1281.154,The defense of insanity is raised quite a bit.
1967.405,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1281.154,1284.225,Asserted by the police -- before the police officer?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1284.225,1284.252,No.
1967.405,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1284.252,1286.571,And he tries him for insanity?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1286.571,1292.224,"No, what I'm saying is defense of insanity is raised is a defense to many crimes."
1967.405,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1295.517,1304.946,"I think I agree with that Mr. Davis, but the policeman takes a risk that he may be prosecuted in that instance."
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1327.044,1327.565,Yes sir.
1967.405,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1327.565,1342.346,"And the, is -- sister or brother or mother or father calls the police, the police come out then and they see that this person is obviously having a psychotic episode."
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1366.132,1366.527,I do too.
1967.405,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1366.527,1369.908,I'm not sure where the authority comes from.
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1369.908,1370.06,I do too.
1967.405,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1370.06,1374.549,"Well isn't that about what you're talking about here, that is to say."
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1425.755,1428.0,"No, it's not."
1967.405,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1437.075,1446.616,The time to put this on the same basis as in the person who has a psychotic episode and he's taken off to the hospital.
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1491.894,1492.55,Yes I --
1967.405,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1492.55,1493.837,-- an extreme view?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1493.837,1494.567,-- I do.
1967.405,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1534.882,1536.336,And you're not talking laws are you?
1967.405,5,42634,tom_davis,,1536.746,1538.903,"No, I'm talking of practical application."
1967.405,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1538.903,1545.072,You're talking of good conduct and this is not a court of conduct.
1967.405,6,32786,jutice_stewart,,1545.072,1548.751,I had thought that your point was considerably narrower.
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1596.287,1605.904,"That is correct and I confused the issue by talking practicalities of how we get to that point, is what I did."
1967.405,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1605.904,1618.143,"I must say Mr. Davis, I don't have any statistics, but I would imagine that there's more public drunkenness of non-alcoholics than there is of alcoholics in the sense that you're talking about."
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1618.143,1622.612,"I think that's correct, but here is the point."
1967.405,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1627.442,1663.355,"Well I'm just wondering though in terms of the ultimate of a -- what in effect you're urging is that society ought to come around to the view that the chronic -- the alcoholic who was in that sense has the disease ought be treated medically and -- society ought to provide facilities and it has to be a public -- a burden because largely the instance of this disease is with people who can't themselves afford the expense of the treatment, isn't that right?"
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1663.355,1665.352,"That is correct, yes sir it is."
1967.405,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1665.352,1665.375,But the --
1967.405,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1665.375,1679.141,Do you make any distinction between these situations and narcotic addicts who are obviously under the effect of narcotics publicly?
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1679.141,1691.957,That of course is a difficult question and it's -- I think we can talk about it in general conclusion but we don't focus on the issues.
1967.405,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1692.351,1692.744,Why not --
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1692.744,1693.335,-- focusing --
1967.405,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1693.335,1693.348,-- why not focus on the issue.
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1693.348,1694.959,-- let's focus on the issue.
1967.405,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1696.406,1696.707,Right.
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1696.707,1698.685,Let's focus on the issues.
1967.405,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1745.316,1751.442,"And yes, are they always typically harmless?"
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1771.854,1776.706,"Your Honor, all I can do is cite the authorities to the Court which I'm familiar with."
1967.405,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1789.067,1803.375,"Well all they have to do is go to any police court and see these -- a lot of these people who are often arrested for public drunkenness, also arrested for petty theft and things of that kind."
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1803.375,1810.484,"Well I think it's important here that I distinguish what a person, an alcoholic, even if he is a chronic alcoholic."
1967.405,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1818.956,1826.102,I understood you as far as that's concerned but you said these people do anything except just be drunk in public.
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1832.014,1833.361,I don't --
1967.405,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1833.361,1837.411,I've had experience of seeing police force in cooperation --
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1837.411,1848.699,Well I think this would be a very good point for me to defer to the amicus counsel who will state in some detail exactly what the Court is positioned on right now.
1967.405,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1850.632,1851.651,May I ask you a question --
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1851.651,1852.134,Yes sir.
1967.405,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1852.134,1854.351,-- just to see if I understand.
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1872.029,1875.392,"No sir, for the crime of public intoxication."
1967.405,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1875.392,1878.295,Well I'm -- yes for the crime of public intoxication.
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1878.295,1878.535,Yes sir.
1967.405,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1878.535,1890.189,"But he can not constitutionally be convicted, but if the policeman comes along and sees the man, you -- it seems to me it gotten awfully considerably, duty of arrest."
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1903.693,1904.388,"Yes sir, he would."
1967.405,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1904.388,1906.646,And the defense would be later set up.
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1906.646,1907.522,That's correct.
1967.405,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1907.522,1911.318,And the policeman would be absolutely justified in making the arrest.
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1911.318,1911.851,That is correct.
1967.405,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1911.851,1914.453,Because I understand it that's what you've been trying to argue?
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1914.453,1919.778,Yes sir and I think it's wholly applicable to alcoholism too.
1967.405,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1927.031,1950.297,"Well then as I understand it, there is in your argument, there is no question as to the right of a policeman to arrest a man for being drunk in public, that there's no question about his right to put him in jail for that offense."
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1981.123,1981.75,Yes it is.
1967.405,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1981.75,1983.599,And do you go any farther than that?
1967.405,7,42634,tom_davis,,1983.599,1985.05,No sir I do not.
1967.405,7,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1985.05,1992.602,Thank you very much.
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,1992.602,1996.315,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1967.405,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2004.008,2013.474,May I ask you at the outset if you disagree at all with what counsel had just stated in answer to my question.
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2013.474,2017.722,"I would pose one qualification, Your Honor."
1967.405,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2043.841,2046.251,You mean because he's a chronic alcoholic?
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2046.251,2060.786,"Because he is a known chronic alcoholic, for example, a man in the District of Columbia where that incident took place who had been adjudicated by court to be a chronic alcoholic and had been acquitted on 31 prior occasions."
1967.405,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2074.987,2097.669,"Well does a police officer when he's charged with the administration of law of that kind, have a right to judge the man's defense and either convict him of in his own mind and take him to jail, or acquit him on the street even though he is publicly drunk in violation of an ordinance?"
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2097.669,2105.663,"As I say Your Honor, I am not an authority under law of probable cause for arrest and I have not researched that in detail."
1967.405,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2111.946,2114.339,Did they raise the question of constitutionality?
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2114.339,2116.729,They did not discuss it in constitutional terms.
1967.405,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2116.729,2117.957,"Yes, that's what we're dealing with here."
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2117.957,2119.091,That's what we're dealing with here.
1967.405,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2119.091,2121.974,"Yes, but other than that, you agree thoroughly with what --"
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2121.974,2123.526,"I certainly do, yes."
1967.405,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2123.526,2144.176,"I suppose if it's unconstitutional to convict a person who is an alcoholic in the medical sense, then it is unconstitutional to arrest a person who is an alcoholic in the medical sense."
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2203.616,2205.189,I'm a little bit --
1967.405,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2205.189,2211.448,Then you get all of these questions as to the capability or non-capability of the opposite.
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2211.448,2219.358,"Well, Mr. Justice Fortas I am troubled by your analysis a little bit, and I'd like to use the analogy to the insane."
1967.405,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2240.501,2242.91,"Well, yes I'm not sure."
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2242.91,2244.132,Because you have questions.
1967.405,8,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2244.132,2253.338,"I'm not sure that I agree with you there, but I think too that those are very different considerations."
1967.405,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2253.338,2257.706,We'll recess.
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2257.706,2263.617,--private agencies and trained or professional personnel as well as lay persons.

1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2351.507,2352.862,We think it unnecessary --
1967.405,8,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2352.862,2363.057,-- the police can't disturb a person (Inaudible) do anything to him except take him to a hospital.
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2363.057,2363.577,Well I think --
1967.405,8,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2363.577,2368.741,(Inaudible)
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2368.741,2375.339,I think there is a tenable position that has been urged to the Court in the brief on that very point.
1967.405,8,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2383.0,2419.975,"(Inaudible) individual known to the police officer already have a record (Inaudible) drunk at the street, take him in the drunk tank, and the only thing that your (Inaudible) is that they must be under the government policy allowed the defense of chronic alcoholism so it --"
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2419.975,2432.021,"I think this raises a very important question of what this means to a community with a ruling that is handed down, for example in the District of Columbia, in Philadelphia and Atlanta, Georgia and in the Fourth Circuit."
1967.405,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2453.616,2454.872,As to any person?
1967.405,8,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2454.872,2456.703,As to any person.
1967.405,9,32786,jutice_stewart,,2475.832,2478.368,That might be the practical result of the court's decision --
1967.405,10,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2478.368,2478.9,That is correct.
1967.405,11,32786,jutice_stewart,,2478.9,2482.117,-- but you're not implying that that is constitutionally required are you?
1967.405,12,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2482.117,2484.48,"No, we are not arguing that point in this case Your Honor."
1967.405,13,32786,jutice_stewart,,2484.48,2489.18,All you're arguing is that chronic alcoholism is a defense to this charge?
1967.405,14,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2489.18,2497.804,"That is the entire issue in this point, in this case, but I did want to answer the question that was posed."

1967.405,14,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2544.19,2545.56,I do not.
1967.405,14,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.356,2593.902,What is the authority of the police to say in the District of Columbia not to arrest but to -- against the person's will take him to someone to facilitate.
1967.405,14,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2595.873,2596.943,At the present time Your Honor?
1967.405,14,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2596.943,2598.552,Yes.
1967.405,14,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2598.552,2612.445,The authority and at this at one time was debated in the District of Columbia as to whether there was a common law authority to pick up an incapacitated drunk on the street and take him to a health -- to a hospital.
1967.405,14,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2640.868,2646.462,What -- and what's the limit of -- this is of course if think and --
1967.405,14,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2646.462,2647.092,That's right.
1967.405,14,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2647.092,2658.258,"-- and as a practical matter, what are the limits of the power to hold?"
1967.405,14,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2662.527,2662.681,I would say --
1967.405,14,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2662.681,2664.833,-- you just sober him up then turn him loose?
1967.405,14,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2664.833,2680.604,"I would think, the way I would analyze it and this is my personal view point, is that the state is justified in intervening in a parens patriae view or rather role anytime that the individual is incapacitated for any reason, whether it's drunkenness and whether he's an alcoholic or not."
1967.405,14,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.604,2681.557,Sure.
1967.405,14,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2681.557,2696.306,"But that once he becomes in a position where he is, you might say sufficiently in possession of its faculties to make a rational decision which has to be a medical judgment that he should be allowed either to leave or to stay."

1967.405,14,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2771.939,2774.804,Undertake the responsibility for this treatment.
1967.405,14,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.804,2781.099,That's -- assuming that you don't claim to have a personnel in the facilities now?
1967.405,14,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2781.099,2789.153,"No, certainly not, and I think the brief for the amici points out in some veil of detail that we don't have the facilities today."
1967.405,14,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2813.603,2816.208,Awaken then persuaded?
1967.405,14,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2816.208,2817.007,Pardon sir?

1967.405,14,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2818.414,2819.884,"That's correct, yes."

1967.405,14,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2830.173,2840.168,"Yes, and the thing that is I think disturbed the amici is that in most jurisdictions where there has been no court decision, there has been no progress."

1967.405,16,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,2940.486,2942.834,"That is entirely correct, yes."
1967.405,17,32786,jutice_stewart,,3323.084,3324.834,Has to -- the man has to be both.
1967.405,18,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,3326.094,3326.939,That's right.
1967.405,19,32786,jutice_stewart,,3343.869,3344.57,He knew he was confessing.
1967.405,20,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,3344.57,3356.533,He knew -- he knows he's confessing but he's powerless to avoid it and the alcoholic is powerless to avoid either drinking or he is powerless -- and he is powerless to avoid stopping.
1967.405,21,32786,jutice_stewart,,3359.179,3365.117,"There's a different definition, somewhat different definition on page 10 of the petitioner's brief."
1967.405,22,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,3379.972,3380.979,There are many --
1967.405,23,32786,jutice_stewart,,3380.979,3383.665,Well this seems to be -- well is this a different definition?
1967.405,24,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,3391.633,3401.804,"Well, the difficulty is this, that there are many different definitions in a sense for many different purposes."
1967.405,25,32786,jutice_stewart,,3452.33,3456.446,Well the Texas statutory definition is different again.
1967.405,26,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,3456.446,3458.171,It says loss of self control.

1967.405,30,37984,peter_barton_hutt,,3469.937,3482.073,"Yes, and that stands from a 1947 District of Columbia statute, which frankly was enacted before as much as is now know was known."
1967.405,31,32786,jutice_stewart,,3482.073,3482.605,But it is --

1967.405,43,21451,david_robinson_jr,,3764.452,3773.654,He has a record of 73 arrests over a period of 16 years which is to say of being arrested between four and --
1967.405,43,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3773.654,3778.208,That's above average isn't it?
1967.405,43,21451,david_robinson_jr,,3778.208,3778.77,That's true.
1967.405,43,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3778.77,3783.371,"I don't know the local conditions, but I would think it's above average."
1967.405,43,21451,david_robinson_jr,,3783.371,3788.41,There's no doubt that this person frequently drank to excess.
1967.405,44,32786,jutice_stewart,,5020.608,5035.432,"You mean because of Robinson against California, a person, a narcotics addict who commits another crime would have a defense."
1967.405,45,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5042.039,5057.468,"No Your Honor, we do not believe it does follow from Robinson against California, but the critical importance of this case as we see it is that it seeks to extend Robinson versus California to exculpate with respect to crimes of behavior."
1967.405,46,32786,jutice_stewart,,5072.983,5074.511,Well what is the behavior here?
1967.405,47,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5087.821,5088.6,That would be behavior --
1967.405,48,32786,jutice_stewart,,5088.6,5093.582,"But that's not criminal behavior if you're sober, is it?"
1967.405,49,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5093.582,5096.471,"Well, I suppose when one lies across the sidewalk that would likely be –"
1967.405,50,32786,jutice_stewart,,5096.471,5100.336,"Well he wasn't arrested for obstructing the sidewalk, was he?"
1967.405,51,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5100.336,5100.933,No Your Honor.
1967.405,52,32786,jutice_stewart,,5100.933,5102.981,Well what was his behavior?
1967.405,53,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5102.981,5104.683,According to the record --
1967.405,54,32786,jutice_stewart,,5104.683,5106.513,It's a condition wasn't it?
1967.405,55,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5113.587,5115.977,Well I assume that's correct.
1967.405,56,32786,jutice_stewart,,5122.307,5123.829,I'm talking about his case.
1967.405,57,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5123.829,5137.211,"-- which is inseparable under the theory proposed would include such things as littering the streets, becoming incontinent, becoming ill sick to one's stomach, abusing --"
1967.405,58,32786,jutice_stewart,,5137.211,5140.92,It's not a crime to become sick to your stomach is it?
1967.405,59,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5140.92,5142.209,Pardon me?
1967.405,59,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5382.068,5386.36,Aren't you back for this business of attacking the findings?
1967.405,59,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5389.215,5393.04,"No, I'm trying to understand what the findings mean Your Honor."
1967.405,60,32786,jutice_stewart,,5630.644,5634.409,"I don't quite understand, this is the VERA study that was referred to earlier?"
1967.405,61,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5634.409,5635.646,It is quite Your Honor.
1967.405,62,32786,jutice_stewart,,5635.646,5637.713,The VERA institute?
1967.405,63,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5639.492,5643.702,I was talking about their reference to Saint Louis statistics with respect to --
1967.405,64,32786,jutice_stewart,,5643.702,5644.955,That's the Saint Louis statistics?
1967.405,65,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5644.955,5646.921,-- with respect to cooperation of alcoholics.
1967.405,66,32786,jutice_stewart,,5646.921,5649.609,"And this was rather coerced cooperation, you say, because it --"
1967.405,67,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5649.609,5650.764,Well as I --
1967.405,68,32786,jutice_stewart,,5650.764,5651.524,-- cooperated with the --
1967.405,69,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5651.524,5672.259,I read the article to which they referred and it was an article by a person that has some responsibility for the program and I assume that he would not do it injustice and he indicated that if they didn't cooperate with the seven-day detoxification that they were subject to criminal prosecution in the Saint Louis.
1967.405,70,32786,jutice_stewart,,5849.425,5860.337,Those statistics don't help you do they have to chose that even with the best kind of care 90% of the people still can't help themselves?
1967.405,71,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5860.337,5861.705,Well it --
1967.405,72,32786,jutice_stewart,,5861.705,5867.965,How can that kind of a condition or situation warrant criminal prosecution?
1967.405,73,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5867.965,5868.7,It doesn't indicate the way --
1967.405,74,32786,jutice_stewart,,5868.7,5873.519,"If the best kind of maximum care, still 90% of the people can't help themselves."
1967.405,75,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5873.519,5874.432,Well we think there --
1967.405,76,32786,jutice_stewart,,5874.432,5875.212,How can the civilized society --
1967.405,77,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5875.212,5875.948,-- we think there are values --
1967.405,78,32786,jutice_stewart,,5875.948,5879.024,-- criminally prosecute those to those 90%?
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5879.024,5881.751,Well we feel there are values in the present system.
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5917.093,5920.751,How about the $50 fine?
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5920.751,5933.366,Well the $50 fine I suppose is less arguably of benefit to the appellant.
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5942.007,5949.977,Well $50 fine on $12 a week would be rather difficult.
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5953.063,5954.504,"That's what the evidence suggests, yes."
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5954.504,5962.559,"And he needed part of that for his wine, so he had pretty hard job to get to $50.00, wouldn't he?"
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5962.559,5964.04,"I assume he would, yes."
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5964.04,5972.003,So the $50 clearly punishment for being arrested for being drunk.
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5977.816,5986.136,If he were to have to pay the $50 fine that would be punishment that punishment again presumably includes some other objectives.
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5993.369,5997.304,Had he been fined before?
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,5997.304,5998.587,Is that is what Your Honor?
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5998.587,6001.997,Had he been fined before?
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6001.997,6006.495,The only penalty permitted by the Texas statute is a fine.
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6006.495,6010.498,And he had been arrested and convicted how many times?
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6010.498,6013.926,He's been arrested 73 times.
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6013.926,6021.828,And it had what effect on him insofar as stopping him from drinking?
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6021.828,6023.488,I don't follow you Your Honor.
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6023.488,6025.359,Well he got locked up again.
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6025.359,6027.316,"Yes, he had been locked up in jail before."
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6027.316,6037.39,"And so he's fined $50, so that $50 could not be to deter him from drinking could it in the future?"
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6037.39,6044.057,"Well if he didn't have the $50, presumably he would not pay the $50.00 and that would not deter him from drinking."
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6044.057,6045.431,And he would go to jail?
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6045.431,6046.936,And he would go to jail.
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6046.936,6050.208,And after he got out of jail?
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6057.627,6058.237,The chances are --
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6058.237,6063.704,-- which is punishment for being arrested for being a drunkard.
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6063.704,6072.942,"Well I still -- if by in a sense it is punishment, but I don't think it's purely retributive punishment."
1967.405,79,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6090.072,6091.551,Well that's this case?
1967.405,79,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6091.551,6093.639,That's his case.
1967.405,80,32786,jutice_stewart,,6093.639,6099.141,Do you see any equal protection issue in this case?
1967.405,81,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6099.141,6101.27,I think that there's an equal protection issue.
1967.405,82,32786,jutice_stewart,,6104.541,6109.821,"Apparently, your brothers in the other side are relying entirely in the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments."
1967.405,83,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6109.821,6109.84,Yes Your Honor.
1967.405,84,32786,jutice_stewart,,6109.84,6112.157,Out of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
1967.405,85,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6112.157,6112.497,Yes Your Honor.
1967.405,86,32786,jutice_stewart,,6112.497,6114.849,"You do see one lurking here, do you?"
1967.405,87,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6114.849,6115.828,I see an issue Your Honor.
1967.405,88,32786,jutice_stewart,,6115.828,6127.846,So do I.
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6127.846,6135.146,"With respect to the Robinson case and the Driver case and the Easter case, we will rely on what we've said in our brief."
1967.405,89,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6605.807,6609.982,What's the Galt case got to do with that?
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6610.507,6635.901,"Well the Galt case, it seems to us, to involve an inquiry into what has happened in another area of deviant behavior where there's been an effort to terminate the criminal process and replace it by a therapeutic approach with long term treatment available without specific criteria as to the amount of social damage which is been caused."
1967.405,89,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6635.901,6639.658,So I suppose people read opinion very differently.
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6648.672,6679.673,"Well the third approach is the approach which I gather is essentially urged here by the appellant and by the ACLU, although not by the Philadelphia amicus and that is terminate the possibilities of compulsory criminal control, terminate the possibilities of compulsory civil control and allow chronic alcoholics if they wish to remain on the street."
1967.405,89,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6749.462,6755.687,But nobody suggested that they be arrested for being sociopaths.
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6755.687,6761.579,No Your Honor and we do not suggest that he appellant be arrested for being a chronic alcoholic.
1967.405,89,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6761.579,6762.994,What do you suggest?
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6762.994,6769.61,We suggest that when he appears drunk in a public place that he be subject to arrest.
1967.405,89,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6769.61,6780.905,And how about a sociopath who engages in deviant behavior on the public street without injuring anybody or injuring himself?
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6780.905,6781.899,Well --
1967.405,89,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6781.899,6784.989,A little cookie.
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6784.989,6786.708,Just a little cookie?
1967.405,89,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6786.708,6788.441,Yes.
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6788.441,6793.406,Well I would suppose it would depend upon what is deviant behavior it was.
1967.405,89,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6808.027,6821.144,"You know we're not -- as I understand it, this statute does not talk about public intoxication involving a public nuisance as a difference between public intoxication."
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6843.715,6847.483,Well I would agree Your Honor.
1967.405,89,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6871.673,6885.11,No but you're talking about public nuisances and the statute talks about public intoxication.I thought you said a minute ago you agreed that they're not the same thing?
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6885.11,6897.11,Well I -- what I meant to say was that I could -- I agreed to the statute would apply to people whose behavior was not markedly disorderly.
1967.405,89,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6897.11,6899.405,Well that's what we're talking about in this case.
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6913.044,6913.278,Well the --
1967.405,89,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6913.278,6936.364,"They very well be that, and I happen to believe that it is very different matter if you're dealing with disorderly conduct or being a public nuisance for whether it is or is not a different matter, it's not the issue before this Court at the present time."
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,6936.364,6945.28,We believe that the principle which is urged as a basis for the constitutional adjudication by this Court does indeed reach disorderly conduct.
1967.405,89,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7097.057,7113.59,"Mr. Robinson, may I ask you if the State of Texas has a law authorizing the arrest and commitment of an alcoholic to --"
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,7113.59,7115.588,I am informed that they do --
1967.405,89,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7115.588,7119.841,-- they do have for that grounds alone.
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,7119.841,7125.523,Well I am informed they have a commitment statute permitting the commitment of alcoholics.
1967.405,89,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7125.523,7129.867,"Yes, but is it voluntary commitment or compulsory?"
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,7129.867,7132.136,I don't have personal knowledge of that.
1967.405,89,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7151.919,7157.815,Do you know what the rule is in other states?
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,7157.815,7177.951,I'm informed that the states have statutes with relating to civil commitment of alcoholics to quite generally and that they typically limit the term of permissible commitment between 30 -- between I think either 30 or I think between 90 days and three years.
1967.405,89,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7177.951,7201.34,"The reason I was asking, I suppose there're a lot of these people who are in the condition of this man whose case is here today who would much rather be in and out of jail the way he is than to be committed to a mental hospital for a long period of time."
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,7240.612,7242.32,I have no idea what the Court would do.
1967.405,89,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7245.122,7249.029,"Yes I -- and that is a matter of concern, isn't it?"
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,7249.029,7250.269,"I assume it is, yes Your Honor."
1967.405,89,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7250.269,7252.573,I would think so.
1967.405,89,21451,david_robinson_jr,,7252.573,7253.143,Thank you Your Honor.
1967.405,89,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7253.143,7270.346,Thank you Mr. Robinson.
