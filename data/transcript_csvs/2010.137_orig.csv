2010.137_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.122,"We will now hear argument next this morning in case 137 on our original docket, Montana v. Wyoming and North Dakota."
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,10.839,16.176,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.137_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,63.006,85.42,"General Bullock, would you please point to the precise language of the compact that freezes consumption, as distinguished from the amount of water diverted, which freezes consumption as of January 1st, 1950?"
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,85.42,87.706,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.137_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,111.487,114.255,"Well, the uses existing is irrigation."
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,114.255,115.624,Um--
2010.137_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,115.624,124.813,"I don't see where it says, and so I can understand, the amount of water diverted can't be increased."
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,124.813,134.503,"--Your Honor, the whole of Article V(A) and V(B) -- I mean, no one contests that it's a full allocation of the water."
2010.137_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.038,176.08,"But why doesn't the language in Article V(A) -- and this is not too helpful -- simply restate the issue before us, what is a beneficial use by the upstream owner?"
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,176.08,187.637,"--Well, Your Honor, it need not because in article II(H) it defines what a beneficial use is, and that's that use by which the water supply of a basin is depleted."
2010.137_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,199.045,202.813,That's the essence of the argument before us.
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,229.647,245.84,"Your Honor, the return flow is the basis of Montana's water right, so that the return flow under the compact isn't actually beneficial use."
2010.137_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,245.84,247.14,That's not actually true.
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,284.132,289.1,"The equation, Your Honor, that consumption is the same thing as--"
2010.137_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,289.1,289.917,As use.
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,289.917,291.769,--as use?
2010.137_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,291.769,292.486,Uh-huh.
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,292.486,305.046,"Well, we could go actually to the special master, who himself had stated that when exploring -- I mean, the beneficial use reflects the historic consumptive use."
2010.137_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,320.055,325.023,Could someone pre-1950 who irrigated crops change the crops?
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,325.023,331.494,"It's -- it's an open question, Your Honor."
2010.137_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,337.933,341.135,How in the world do any States monitor that?
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,395.269,404.708,"To the first question, Your Honor, even as of 1950, the drafters recognized that this was a fully appropriated river; it had reached its maximum practical limit."
2010.137_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,436.945,445.016,"But all that shows is -- or might show in a particular case, is that the amount of water is reduced."
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,463.478,466.096,"--And, Your Honor, you don't--"
2010.137_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,466.096,468.798,So the -- so the flows don't necessarily answer the question.
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,468.798,477.051,"--Well, Your Honor, it's ultimately up to each State to administer their rights and their water intrastate."
2010.137_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,486.592,489.71,But if you've -- we've been talking about beneficial uses.
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,512.557,524.078,"Your Honor, even at the time of the compact, Wyoming recognized their paper rights, that appropriative right, was much more than the actual use occurring."
2010.137_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,537.505,538.722,"Well, isn't that what's going on here?"
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,549.996,564.153,"--Mr. Chief Justice, two things, the first of which, the beneficial use is -- I mean, we can't read this definition of beneficial use out of the contract or out of the compact -- and it is a contract, actually, among States."
2010.137_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,577.313,578.779,Given the same conditions.
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,628.246,634.65,"Effectively, Your Honor, it could be yes."
2010.137_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,634.65,636.185,"Well, I didn't say it could be yes."
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,650.694,653.979,"I certainly can't answer that, and they didn't need to know, from the perspective--"
2010.137_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,653.979,654.513,"Oh, they didn't?"
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,705.412,715.804,"--First, Your Honor, the individual landowner does not have to put water back in that they didn't even know what they were."
2010.137_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.637,755.929,So you say you get the same amount of water and it's up to -- it's up to Wyoming to figure out who they have to cut down for not putting back enough to meet that amount?
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,761.999,763.617,"--Your Honor, I don't say we--"
2010.137_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.617,764.584,I'm trying to help you.
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,764.584,766.35,--Sorry?
2010.137_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,766.35,769.886,"Yes, I think that is what -- the answer is yes, isn't it?"
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,769.886,776.873,"Yes, but -- but, Your Honor, we don't say the exact same quantity of water."
2010.137_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,779.075,780.475,"Under like water supplies, yes."
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,780.475,781.125,Yes.
2010.137_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,791.846,801.269,"I thought you referred us, just while you're going through your notes, to page 82, and there's an intriguing footnote where the special master talks about his own -- his own book."
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,823.118,824.685,"Footnote 15, yes, Your Honor."
2010.137_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,824.685,826.154,"The footnote on that page, yes."
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,826.154,830.872,And there he's talking about--
2010.137_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.872,832.74,It seems to say what you say it says.
2010.137_orig,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,832.74,859.308,"If your understanding is correct, would the result be that landowners in Wyoming would only be allowed to consume as much as they consumed in 1950, but landowners in Montana could take advantage of improved irrigation techniques and use much more of the -- they could divert the same amount of water, but they could use much more of it?"
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,859.308,861.827,"--No, Your Honor, that would not be the case."
2010.137_orig,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,861.827,862.627,Why wouldn't it?
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,862.627,870.765,"First, for the irrigators in Montana -- I mean, one of the things -- Montana sought to have a system of interstate administration."
2010.137_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,913.275,917.663,And what happens under Montana law?
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,917.663,929.387,"Under Montana law, if there's an injury, and that's -- that's actually -- and the special master pointed this out in another one of his footnotes, that that still would be actionable."
2010.137_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,941.195,942.379,"Yes, but your people can do that."
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,952.786,953.836,"Both can, Your Honor."
2010.137_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,968.346,974.1,"Your people are entitled to take out the same amount they took out before, right?"
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,974.983,976.285,Under like water supply conditions.
2010.137_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,976.285,989.343,"Whereas the people in Wyoming, you say, are not entitled to take out the same amount; they are entitled only net the same amount that they had before."
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1010.006,1017.279,"Your Honor, I don't think that it does give us a great advantage, because we still have to deal with the same amount of water supply that we would have had."
2010.137_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1030.753,1036.323,"Do you have ultimate liability to Montana -- pardon me, to North Dakota for overuse?"
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1036.323,1038.942,"--We do a little bit, Your Honor."
2010.137_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1041.708,1052.814,"Well, I won't -- I won't get into that, but it does seem to me that the Chief Justice asked the question, if you're entitled to take the water, you can use it for any purpose."
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1085.885,1086.903,Sure.
2010.137_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1096.509,1098.545,--The Utah case is your best case?
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1098.545,1108.234,--That's -- that's the only case that any of the parties cited that actually deals with the change from sprinkler -- or flood to sprinkler irrigation.
2010.137_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1156.565,1167.439,"--I would think your best point is not all of that stuff, but simply the definition section, which very clearly makes a distinction between beneficial use and diversion."
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1208.282,1209.968,"I -- I -- I agree, Your Honor."
2010.137_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.872,1217.488,"Well, all right."
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1217.488,1228.846,"--But I agree that the plain language -- and especially in an area where there's so much ambiguities the special master acknowledges, why change the status quo of what was occurring?"
2010.137_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1229.396,1231.548,I don't understand why that's a good -- good answer.
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1255.163,1265.603,"--Your Honor, but they're depleting more from the basin, and that's -- you can have beneficial use for non-consumptive purposes."
2010.137_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1265.603,1267.655,That's back where -- that's where I was here.
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1338.797,1344.035,"Your Honor, the seepage cases, though, deal with adjoining landowners--"
2010.137_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1344.035,1344.585,"Yes, they--"
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1344.585,1347.987,"--not the same river flow, and the special master acknowledged that."
2010.137_orig,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1347.987,1348.47,--Uh-huh.
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1348.47,1363.013,"That -- and I guess what I was earlier trying to explain is certainly each appropriator knows how much water it would -- would be receiving, what the flows typically are, and they all basically judge on it."
2010.137_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.817,1426.003,"Where was that again, where at?"
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1426.003,1435.109,"That's at 3a of the appendix, Montana's motion -- or the response to Wyoming's motion to dismiss the bill of complaint."
2010.137_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1435.109,1459.49,"General, assume that you're right, that what was guaranteed was the same amount of water flowing into Montana as in 1950, and I -- I take it you don't care how Wyoming deals with this, but what -- if you're right, what could Wyoming do?"
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1469.782,1472.065,"No -- I mean, no, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.137_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1491.211,1509.507,"So, you say it doesn't -- they don't -- Wyoming doesn't have to know whether farmer A or farmer B is taking more than they took in 1950 -- I mean, is using more than they used in 1950; they just have to know what the total amount is, and Wyoming can make that up?"
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1509.507,1510.775,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.137_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1510.775,1513.894,So really -- I'm sorry.
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1523.183,1524.233,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.137_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1524.233,1524.783,All right.
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1552.25,1557.888,"No, Your Honor, we can't necessarily satisfy all the needs."
2010.137_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1596.596,1602.25,"Before any 1950 use, post-1950 users are permitted?"
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1602.25,1607.202,"We're still at the stage of discovery, but, yes, likely that's how it would occur, Your Honor."
2010.137_orig,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1607.202,1610.856,So why isn't this a premature lawsuit?
2010.137_orig,0,40991,steve_bullock,,1662.804,1668.625,"It is, or that quantity under like water supply conditions."
2010.137_orig,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1682.818,1683.868,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,1693.408,1698.461,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.137_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1765.606,1771.76,But what is the controlling principle in answering the question that I think you properly put?
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,1796.725,1799.677,The standard is the standard of waste of practical irrigation.
2010.137_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1799.677,1800.529,Standard of?
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,1800.529,1802.981,"Waste, of not wasting water in practical irrigation."
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1824.81,1825.694,I thought--
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,1825.694,1826.227,It's a question--
2010.137_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1826.227,1834.631,Suppose the first -- suppose the first crop absorbs 50 percent of the water and returns 50 percent by seepage.
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,1844.855,1851.276,"--The -- the way that the water is -- there's -- there's a basket, Your Honor."
2010.137_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.253,1967.318,"But we're dealing here with a compact which has a text, and -- and what the water law of Wyoming or of Montana happened to be cannot overrule the text, and I am -- I'm hung up on the fact that article V(A) says appropriated rights to the beneficial uses of the water of the Yellowstone River System existing as of January 1, 1950: appropriated rights not to diversion, not to diversion for beneficial uses, but appropriated rights to the beneficial uses, which is defined -- which is defined in the compact to say that use by which the water supply of a drainage basin is depleted when usefully employed."
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2003.509,2019.453,"Your Honor, the definition has two components, the classic beneficial -- the component that would come from a classic beneficial use definition, which is useful employment for activities of man, a beneficial purpose, which -- a nonwasteful purpose, that's a start."
2010.137_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2019.453,2021.137,That's not how it's defined.
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2021.137,2023.754,"That's -- that's the last portion, that's the second part."
2010.137_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2023.754,2024.672,"Well, that's fine."
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2024.672,2029.29,The first part is use by which the water supply of a drainage basin is depleted.
2010.137_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2049.038,2050.654,Are you addressing the word depleted?
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2050.654,2056.275,--I'm addressing the word supply of the drainage basin; and then it is depleted.
2010.137_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2061.528,2069.034,"Are you saying that ""depleted"" means only what's withdrawn and it's not calculated by -- with reference to what is returned?"
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2069.034,2071.601,That's correct.
2010.137_orig,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.601,2074.569,Obviously you're saying -- to read it with a different emphasis.
2010.137_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2105.402,2107.854,Why don't you emphasize both of them?
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2119.562,2123.114,If you had a--
2010.137_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2123.114,2129.168,Is the diversion for a beneficial use the same thing as a depletion?
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2129.168,2130.703,--May I give an example?

2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2207.636,2208.636,I--
2010.137_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.636,2216.326,I was trying to give that stark difference some effect in the later sections of V(A).

2010.137_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2226.783,2227.899,Okay.
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2227.899,2231.318,And so we have two -- those terms are both used.
2010.137_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.876,2245.911,Where -- where -- what part of V(B) are you talking about?
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2245.911,2251.482,I'm talking about at the bottom of V(B) where you're talking about the three -- the third-tier rights.
2010.137_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.482,2257.386,The point of measurement shall be below the last diversion?
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2257.386,2259.42,"No, no, 5B."
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2274.764,2276.847,--Excuse--
2010.137_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2276.847,2277.499,For -- exactly.
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2285.419,2291.557,"--Counsel, could I -- could you answer, do you see a difference?"
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2295.461,2311.22,"I think there's a difference in that the -- in practical terms, the depletion -- the depletion and the beneficial use definition, a diversion would be the only way to deplete that."
2010.137_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2314.438,2322.111,"So once again, you're saying that depletion is a calculation of what is taken without reference to what returns?"
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2322.111,2323.228,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.137_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2323.228,2326.48,And your best authority for that is?
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2326.48,2355.665,"The best authority, I think, is the Special Master's discussion of this, that the only practical way water supply of the drainage basin would be -- the quantities of water in the rivers themselves would be depleted would be through a diversion."
2010.137_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2357.931,2372.239,"Just to follow up on Justice Kennedy's point, because I think it's important: So you were reading -- when it says ""is depleted"", you think all you have to show is that it's less than when you started, and once that is shown, it is depleted."
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2375.191,2383.963,"Yes, depletion would be moving it from this glass of water, if that was the river, and it reduces the quantity of water in the river."
2010.137_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2385.331,2385.798,And you don't care how much?
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2395.204,2395.687,Yes.
2010.137_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2396.087,2400.091,"Well, I guess to get back to the point, wouldn't the normal word be ""divert""?"
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2400.091,2404.293,"--It may well be, Your Honor."
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2412.582,2417.303,"So could I go back to my question, which is twofold?"
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2430.693,2433.026,"That has been deferred, is my understanding."
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2433.026,2455.659,"My problem with this is -- and I think I need to understand what the fight is about here, or what the dispute is about -- it really does seem to me that it is a question of remedies, not about whether you're taking more water rights through irrigation or not."
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2560.744,2566.565,"I disagree -- the language in Article V that disagrees with that is the very first few words, ""appropriative rights""."
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2589.261,2591.447,"But this is not happening today, is it?"
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2591.447,2592.447,"--Oh, yes."
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2593.697,2595.982,"All right, but that's an isolated year."
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2608.457,2610.242,"Both States, at times."
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2630.322,2631.738,I don't disagree.
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2631.738,2632.472,Quite simply--
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2632.472,2642.844,"I don't disagree, but as I read the Article, it says, you put all the water that's available to pre-1950 appropriated uses."
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2669.446,2671.43,"--Yes, and on an ongoing basis."
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2674.382,2675.015,Exactly.
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2675.015,2677.501,It's all done in a system that's dynamic.
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2677.501,2706.437,"But that's why -- I do understand the remedies were deferred, but to the extent that we were to rule that appropriated rights included the right to change irrigation methods or crops -- we don't have to reach crops, because that's not at issue here -- in the end, you're only entitled to take the appropriated uses, including irrigation rights, that existed pre-1950."
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2716.559,2717.026,No.
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2717.026,2721.363,Before you can use post-1950 water?
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2721.363,2722.18,Yes.
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2739.992,2746.246,Why aren't you taking more of the percentage that way of post-1950 waters?
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2754.601,2755.851,--60 percent.
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2755.851,2756.536,Whatever it was.
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2787.056,2792.377,"Your Honor, I'm not following, because there's a distinction between each class of water."
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2792.377,2793.442,"Yes, I understand that."
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2793.442,2796.244,"And in your -- in your question, I'm not following which class you are referring to."
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2796.244,2831.752,"I'm answering this only -- I'm asking this because I know we've deferred decision on the remedy, but for me that is so integral to the issue here because when they talk about being entitled to a water flow, I see that as being entitled to a pre-1950 satisfaction of water needs or beneficial uses before anybody gets 19 -- post-1950 water."
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2883.534,2893.223,We -- Wyoming is not entitled on the same river to take post-1950 water when there is a pre-1950 use in Montana that's not satisfied.
2010.137_orig,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2896.608,2897.508,The question is what?
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2897.508,2899.227,--He has -- the Special -- I'm sorry.
2010.137_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2904.198,2907.15,"Just before you sit down, I don't know why you think we have deferred the remedy question?"
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2918.405,2926.111,"Well, no, my understanding was the Court had simply sent it back to the Special Master for consideration, that's all."
2010.137_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2926.111,2927.277,"Well, thank you."
2010.137_orig,1,38146,peter_kenneth_michael,,2928.063,2928.829,Thank you.
2010.137_orig,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2928.829,2943.489,"Mr. Jay, maybe you can help clarify something."
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2949.993,2950.61,Mr. Chief Justice--
2010.137_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2950.61,2953.012,"I know you want us -- you don't want us to reach it, but it's still before us."
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,2953.012,2954.631,"--Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.137_orig,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2969.156,2981.964,"Could you -- but your brief, before we entered that order, said the Special Master was right, that they have to satisfy their needs from pre -- post-1950 users."
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3001.694,3014.085,"Both of their pre-1950 users have to be satisfied first, yes, we agree with that, so that no one in Wyoming is supposed to be taking post-1950 water until pre-1950 users in Montana are satisfied."
2010.137_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.894,3060.131,"And so on your theory in that situation where there isn't enough for all the pre-1950 people, it's Wyoming that gets all the water?"
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3070.506,3074.458,"Both States have affirmatively rejected the idea of a middle ground like that, Justice Breyer--"
2010.137_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3074.458,3076.124,There's no fair way to decide this case?
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3076.124,3083.711,"--Well -- well, Justice Breyer, we -- we submit that enforcing the compact according what -- what the States signed up for is--"
2010.137_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3083.711,3084.461,Is fair.
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3084.461,3084.98,--Precisely.
2010.137_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3084.98,3091.884,"I thought that was the way appropriation law works in the west, I mean, the person who gets it, gets it?"
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3094.669,3095.286,Provided they--
2010.137_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.286,3096.787,"The person who doesn't get it, gets it."
2010.137_orig,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3098.503,3101.739,"Well, I mean, I don't mean -- isn't that the difference between eastern water law and western water law?"
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3109.678,3114.582,--And here the States decided not to do that on an interstate basis.
2010.137_orig,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3133.294,3170.919,"Mr. Jay, I thought that the Special Master, very important to him was the meaning of a appropriate -- appropriative rights, and he said that the Wyoming law is just as you've described, that is, the farmer can use all that water; and he said Montana law is uncertain, but Wyoming law is not out of line with the general approach."
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3184.826,3194.701,"Under this compact, Justice Ginsburg, the appropriative rights existing in each signatory State as of January 1st, 1950 are water preserved and carried for by article V(A)."
2010.137_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3261.66,3263.528,Could you -- and this is II--
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3263.528,3267.813,"II(H), which is on page A4 to the appendix to the special master's report."
2010.137_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3289.513,3293.365,"Well, hydropower would -- would not constitute a diversion."
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3293.365,3295.233,"But a mill race would, Justice Scalia."
2010.137_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3304.338,3306.457,"Well, but that -- that's a diversion."
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3306.457,3309.826,"Yes, that's a diversion, but not a depletion."
2010.137_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3309.826,3317.913,It means the taking or removing of water when the water so taken or removed is not returned directly into the channel of the Yellowstone River.
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3325.836,3335.292,"But the -- the point, Justice Scalia, article V(A) doesn't use diversion, and that -- that's precisely the point, it doesn't use diversion; it uses -- it uses beneficial use."
2010.137_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3336.06,3338.577,Why doesn't it use diversion if it means what you say?
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3338.577,3343.88,--Because they -- it didn't use diversion because it wasn't quantifying them.
2010.137_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3348.701,3350.084,Of course it's quantified.
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3355.605,3370.198,"--It's not quantified in the sense -- as Justice Breyer pointed out, no one -- they didn't write down, especially in Montana, because as the special master said on page 22, Montana didn't have a centralized system of rights; they didn't know exactly how much was being diverted in Montana."
2010.137_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3394.246,3402.919,So your linguistic argument is they didn't use the word diversion because they didn't want to throw the mill race example into the definition; is that right?
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3402.919,3407.24,"My argument, Justice -- my argument, Justice Breyer, is that they didn't want mill races or hydropower to count."
2010.137_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3407.24,3415.327,"They didn't want mill races in the definition, so they didn't purposely use diversion, that's why they used the word depletion."
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3415.327,3420.445,"They used the word depletion, but they didn't make the amount of depletion the measurement -- that is the point."
2010.137_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3420.445,3422.314,A mill race is not a diversion.
2010.137_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3422.314,3423.114,"Correct, and they wanted that."
2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3423.114,3426.783,"A mill race is a diversion under the common understanding of that term, Justice Scalia."
2010.137_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3427.135,3427.718,Not under the definition.

2010.137_orig,2,45148,william_m_jay,,3492.91,3498.647,I -- I think that that's right.
2010.137_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3519.375,3522.16,"Well, I mean, that -- that's the key to this case, I take it."
