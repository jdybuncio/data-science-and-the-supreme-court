1974.74-8,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.93,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 74-8, O'Connor against Donaldson."
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,14.843,17.751,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,54.847,56.995,Who initiated the commitment proceeding?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,57.935,61.068,"It was initiated, I believe by his family, his mother and father."
1974.74-8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,61.068,62.609,Are their parents -- are both with parents?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,62.609,67.484,"Who were residents of Pinellas County, Florida."
1974.74-8,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,100.433,115.839,"The court found that he had not been offered if I recall correctly, the jury's finding is that he had not been offered occupational therapy, is that not correct?"
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,115.839,117.184,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice I believe at one time --"
1974.74-8,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,117.184,120.553,If the Court of Appeals to the Fifth Circuit seem to focus on that?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,120.553,122.11,There was some question as to that.
1974.74-8,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,159.178,171.854,"As you read this record what was the latest date, just the year would be enough to aid me, when he refused to some form of therapy that was offered to him?"
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,171.854,172.858,"Well, he would've --"
1974.74-8,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,172.858,174.622,"He was for 15 years, wasn't he?"
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,174.622,178.25,"Yes sir, he was in about 14 years in the hospital."
1974.74-8,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,239.022,247.285,"In that respect Mr. Gearey, how did it come about that he was finally released after these many years?"
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,247.285,263.475,"Well, he received a new attending physician late in 1970 or early 1971 and that attending physician determined that in his judgment Mr. Donaldson was indeed fit to be released from the hospital."
1974.74-8,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,263.475,268.482,This is one who succeeded the doctor who is the party then here?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,268.482,281.171,"Yes, Dr. O'Connor, the petitioner whom I represent was Mr. Donaldson's attending physician very early in his confinement up until 1958 or 59."
1974.74-8,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,324.022,330.37,I take it that Dr. O'Connor at all times had the power in the Florida system to release him?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,330.37,331.34,"Yes sir, he did."
1974.74-8,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,348.662,358.77,But he didn't have -- did he have the power to release him unless he arrived at that conclusion that he had progressed sufficiently to be released?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,358.77,361.088,No Mr. Justice White.
1974.74-8,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,386.167,388.409,Was not that refused here?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,388.409,390.693,Yes Mr. Justice Blackmun it was.
1974.74-8,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.855,414.762,Of course this fellow MR. Lembcke in New York tried it for years to get him released.
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,414.762,423.64,"Yes sir there were two efforts to have Mr. Donaldson released, one, Mr. Lembcke and one the Helping Hands Organization in Minnesota."
1974.74-8,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,447.463,451.81,What do you mean by adequate supervision?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,456.794,463.058,He had the supervision and the treatment that was available at the hospital and to which he would submit.
1974.74-8,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,480.069,489.451,"Incidentally, is it agreed on the part of the state and the appellants here that Mr. Donaldson was not dangerous, either to himself or to others."
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,489.451,491.951,"Well, there was some questions as to that."
1974.74-8,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,531.82,535.292,Aren't you bound by the jury's verdict to a certain extent on that.
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,542.93,546.495,"Yes sir, to some extent we are, there was a charge to that offend."
1974.74-8,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,546.495,552.235,To what extent aren't you bound by it?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,552.235,564.67,"Well, I think we would have to say we were bound by jury's finding on that regard as they were instructed to that effect."
1974.74-8,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,599.457,604.86,"They submitted all of those habeas applications incidentally, all of them?"
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,604.86,606.568,Not all of them are cited in the brief.
1974.74-8,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.734,622.077,"I for one would appreciate it, if you could supply information as to those -- their citations, at least their case numbers if they are not reported."
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,622.077,623.343,Cetainly Sir.
1974.74-8,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.343,626.179,At your convenience.
1974.74-8,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,626.179,631.778,Were there evidentiary hearings in any of those habeas corpus proceedings?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,631.778,635.143,Mr. Justice Powell I'm not certain.
1974.74-8,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,662.53,668.022,Were there any opinions written by district judges in any of those cases?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,668.022,669.36,Not to my knowledge.
1974.74-8,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,679.149,690.816,"While I have you interrupted, would you summarize briefly the procedure that took place at the time of respondent's commitment, what did Florida law then require?"
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,690.816,708.494,"Okay, under the Florida Law in 1957, the law required a petition on behalf of a number of citizens that they felt -- a particular individual needed -- who was mentally ill needed care."
1974.74-8,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,717.744,719.433,Hearing before whom?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,719.433,721.744,Before a county court judge.
1974.74-8,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,772.332,777.186,Is the record of that hearing included in the record of this case?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,777.186,778.929,"No sir, it is not."
1974.74-8,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,788.498,792.667,And just one more question along these lines.
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,807.791,813.02,I believe release was available on petition from the patient.
1974.74-8,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,813.02,815.107,Do you say you believe is the --
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,815.107,824.552,"Yes sir, I believe under the statutes at that time there were several ways the patient could receive release and a petition from the patient was one of them."
1974.74-8,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,829.718,831.85,A petition to court?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,831.85,836.637,"Yes, I believe he would have petitioned the court which had committed him originally."
1974.74-8,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,836.637,839.844,Was any such petition filed by respondent?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,839.844,842.425,"No sir, not into this case that I'm aware off."
1974.74-8,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,842.425,853.746,But could you say that petition would have the burden approving that he had been cured before petition could prevail?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,853.746,864.007,Under the 1957 law -- I feel the burden probably would have been on the patient to have shown that he was cured.
1974.74-8,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,864.007,865.082,He was cured?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,865.082,866.869,Yes sir.
1974.74-8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,866.869,870.755,This is a situation where in fact he had no treatment isn't it?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,870.755,876.556,"Well, I -- that's really the question here whether there had been treatment and of course we submit that there was treatment."
1974.74-8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,876.556,881.8,"Incidentally a due process hearing which you just described, was that at the time the initial commitment?"
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,881.8,882.739,Yes it was sir.
1974.74-8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,882.739,887.757,"And there's been none -- no other state proceeding, comparable state proceeding set?"
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,887.757,891.273,"No, there was none."
1974.74-8,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,891.273,903.6,"According to your statement to the case on page four of your brief, he could have been released upon his applications if there were no objection from the head of the hospital, that's the way I read it."
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,903.6,904.306,That's correct.
1974.74-8,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,904.306,908.026,That is just his application I suppose to the hospital itself.
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,908.026,908.374,"Yes, I expect --"
1974.74-8,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,908.374,909.968,Would be released if there were no objection.
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,912.642,913.208,Right.
1974.74-8,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,913.208,926.349,"And then an alternative way of release is even without a petition from anybody, if three members of the hospital certified that he -- to a restoration of mental competency."
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,926.349,930.623,"Yes, that's correct."
1974.74-8,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,931.487,932.712,Then I take it that you --
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,932.712,933.114,Yes sir.
1974.74-8,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,933.114,946.341,"And I take it, the issue of dangerousness would not be involved in that except as it might bear indirectly, collaterally on whether he had recovered."
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,946.341,948.603,That's correct.
1974.74-8,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,948.603,956.849,If he showed that he was not dangerous that wouldn't be enough to bring about his release?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,956.849,960.129,I don't believe it would have been under that procedure.
1974.74-8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,994.704,999.726,Is that automatic that is without any initiation on his part of that hearing?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,999.726,1003.5,"That's correct, after six months every patient is reviewed."
1974.74-8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1003.5,1005.073,And where is that hearing?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,1005.073,1005.517,Pardon?
1974.74-8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1005.517,1006.79,Where is that hearing?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,1006.79,1010.267,That's conducted at the hospital before a hearing examiner.
1974.74-8,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1024.236,1028.806,"And if he is not released, is that determination subject to judicial review?"
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,1028.806,1033.855,"Yes sir, it would be and in addition he would again be reviewed periodically."
1974.74-8,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1037.181,1043.219,"Is hearing officers neutral officer from the outside, is he?"
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,1043.219,1045.134,"Yes sir, he is."
1974.74-8,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1045.134,1049.696,Something like the hearing examiners in the federal system.
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,1049.696,1051.283,Yes.
1974.74-8,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1062.961,1064.457,He's not part of the hospital staff?
1974.74-8,0,39412,raymond_w_gearey,,1064.457,1065.042,Oh!
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2102.664,2106.822,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2171.713,2189.192,"What is your view as to whether the new Florida statute would give to the patients, all the protection they need, assuming first that it's enforced and applied not ignored."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2189.192,2199.494,Mr. Chief Justice I believe that the new Florida statute is in many respects more comprehensive than the constitutional right we are urging in this case and I think properly so.
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2199.494,2202.859,"Because it's an automatic review every six months, is that correct?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2202.859,2204.978,That is correct Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2204.978,2219.019,"So that at most, there is the opportunity to demonstrate capacity to be released or the propriety of release with great frequency."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2219.019,2221.741,That is correct Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2221.741,2233.468,"When you say that it's more comprehensive, I take it, then you mean that it's better than the undefined constitutional right postulated by the Fifth Circuit."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2233.468,2236.568,"Your Honor, let me address that point."
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.33,2280.794,"Well now, you might say that at least they ought to offer such treatment, opportunities are reasonably available within the arc."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2280.794,2281.67,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2281.67,2291.253,"But even though that might not give a realistic opportunity to be cured, I take it there are some conditions that aren't thought to be curable."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2291.253,2293.304,That may be Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2313.438,2319.614,The instructions didn't though allow for any case like that.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2330.629,2331.749,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.298,2339.022,Yes.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2339.022,2344.224,"Now, let me continue to point out that under the instructions in this particular case --"
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2344.224,2350.556,"So that if you would run into a case like that, perhaps this particular formulation of the right to treatment might have to be monitory."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2350.556,2352.297,That may be Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.1,2370.532,You're suggesting I take it that this case should be narrowly decided?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2370.532,2372.513,"Yes Your Honor, we are."
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2372.513,2379.485,And the court should not try to range for a field on this other -- what you called difficult question?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2379.485,2380.626,I think that's correct Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2390.183,2392.717,"Given the Florida statute, he really doesn't need it, does he?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2392.717,2394.558,"That's right Your Honor, absolutely right."
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2423.244,2426.161,I think that comports with the instruction given by the trial judge here?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2426.161,2427.598,"Absolutely Your Honor, absolutely."
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2433.526,2436.762,"But first, did the Solicitor General say a constitutional right?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2436.762,2438.152,Yes Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2438.507,2472.792,"And did he take into account the language of the charged that has to do with -- I've forgotten the precise words, Mr. Justice White focused on a few moments ago, all treatment, not treatment that's available, you are instructed that person who is involuntarily, civilly committed does have a constitutional right to receive such treatment as you will give him as will give him a realistic opportunity to be cured."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2484.952,2485.993,Yes it does Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.655,2492.0,"Well, what does that got to do with this case?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2493.603,2494.227,Yes Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.876,2503.715,Let me have it.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2506.587,2507.58,No Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2514.815,2530.588,"Well, I know, but the Solicitor General says that he is filing in as much as your brief characterizes the actions and the position and United States suspecting involuntarily confined mental patients, right to treatment I believe a appropriate device in the court more fully."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2530.588,2531.905,That's correct.
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2531.905,2536.311,It's prompted by what you said in your brief about what the United States does.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2536.311,2536.985,That's correct.
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2536.985,2543.031,Yes.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2543.031,2549.193,Let me point out one fact that I think is very important in this case.
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2593.469,2605.773,"But that doesn't -- he knew perhaps they're unlawful under the statutory tests than in effect in Florida, doesn't mean he knew that he was depriving anybody of any federal rights."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2605.773,2608.079,"But Your Honor, I think the answer to that question can be found in --"
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2608.079,2609.023,That wasn't in --
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2609.023,2621.224,"-- Monroe versus Pape I believe where this Court indicated that under Section 1983, proof of a specific intent to deprive a person of a constitutional right is not required."
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2631.359,2633.482,Which in fact is a violation of federal law.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2633.482,2633.535,That's right.
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2633.535,2633.956,Constitutional or statutory.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2633.956,2639.376,"Monroe v. Pape, this Court said that if a man is held responsible for the natural consequences of his acts."
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2653.539,2663.127,"Well, what exactly do you rely on for stating that the jury must be found that he knew that his acts were unlawful?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2663.127,2675.122,"Your Honor, I believe that that instruction is quoted at page 74 of our brief."
1974.74-8,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2723.92,2736.158,"The instruction doesn't say legally proper, it just says proper so it doesn't really draw the distinction that they believed in good faith that it was lawful but in fact it turned out not to have been lawful."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2736.158,2736.352,Your Honor --
1974.74-8,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2736.352,2738.754,Maybe that's not preserved by objection.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2738.754,2743.666,"I'm reading these two instructions together, the first of which says proper and the second of which in elaboration, talks about lawfully required."
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.666,2751.101,And it also -- and it also doesn't particularly confer to any federal lawful --
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2751.101,2752.23,No it does not Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.523,2755.942,And we're dealing here with a --
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2755.942,2756.437,Yes Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.366,2763.229,Where is that?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2763.229,2767.979,Pages 39 and 40 of respondent's brief containing the instruction relevant to that point.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.758,2795.999,"Now you wouldn't defend that instruction standing by itself, would you?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2795.999,2796.243,I'm sorry.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.435,2801.693,"Well, do you think that was a proper instruction standing by itself?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2801.693,2803.056,I think this is certainly a proper instruction.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.056,2818.95,"Well, here's what the jury could've found -- could've based liability on, if the doctor simply knew that the patient was mentally ill and that he was not receiving treatment."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2818.95,2820.318,Your Honor I think --
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.318,2826.978,Now you wouldn't suggest that that is the definition of the constitutional right to treatment?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2830.848,2831.406,Yes.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.778,2837.718,"Well, I asked you about this instructions standing alone."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2840.656,2842.671,I think there's nothing improper about this instruction.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2842.671,2856.644,"Well, if the jury could've found that simply could've based liability simply on finding that he was ill and not receiving treatment without regard to dangerousness either to himself or others."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2856.644,2858.898,"If that instruction were read alone, you're correct Your Honor."
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2858.898,2860.529,"Well, that's what I asked."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2860.529,2860.784,I'm sorry.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2861.873,2863.377,Where is it corrected?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2863.377,2870.708,"It is then corrected if you'll look on the next page of respondents brief as the court elaborates, page 40 of respondent's brief."
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2895.802,2904.249,Now you don't defend that prior instruction standing alone?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2904.249,2906.699,I think all the instruction certainly have to be read together Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.357,2923.544,"Well, for example, assuming then, a patient is dangerous to himself or others, then what is your position with respect to the constitutional right to treatment?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2923.544,2930.546,"Your Honor, our position would be as follows, although that question does not arise in this case."
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2930.546,2934.702,Because of the way he amplified his --
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2934.702,2935.784,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2958.481,2960.011,Do you mean that that man was found --
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2960.011,2962.297,This was such then available?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2962.297,2962.776,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2962.776,2964.465,"Well, but --"
1974.74-8,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2964.465,2981.775,You mean if somebody is found not guilty of first degree murder by a reason of insanity and that he can petition for a federal habeas corpus and be released if he can prove that he is not really receiving satisfactory treatment.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2981.775,2981.896,Oh!
1974.74-8,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2990.027,3003.344,So you don't mean then or that only somebody who has committed through the criminal process by a criminal trial is exempt from this requirement for treatment.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3006.841,3008.303,"No, we would not Your Honor."
1974.74-8,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3009.543,3015.974,"Well, would you -- well, if -- but your underlying theory has to either embrace it or not embrace it, I would think?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3015.974,3030.919,"Well, the theory of this case is where the purpose for a confinement is not a criminal law or purpose then the patient confined would have an opportunity for a reasonable level of treatment."
1974.74-8,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3064.174,3073.636,And when you talk about criminally confined persons you include a person who is found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed as a result of that.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3073.636,3074.942,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.942,3093.995,But is it not true that in a good many jurisdictions now the verdict of the jury not guilty by reason of insanity either by a statute or by a judicial decision must be followed by the traditional civil commitment proceeding in order to confine him.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3093.995,3095.656,"Yes, Your Honor, that is certainly true."
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3095.656,3115.865,"Now, in that case your statement of your underlying theory would reach it because his confinement would have been pursuant in those cases to a civil commitment proceeding which was triggered by a jury verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity when he was criminally prosecuted."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3115.865,3116.978,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.973,3165.454,What can be found to be in connection with his commitment found to be dangerous to himself or others?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3165.454,3170.156,Your Honor the commitment papers are sketchy and inconsistent on that point.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.522,3176.51,I had that in the brief somewhere and I just wondered what the truth with the matter was since they're not part of the record here.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3176.51,3179.735,"Well, there was -- I can say this, Your Honor."
1974.74-8,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3240.811,3243.107,But it was agreed.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3243.107,3244.712,"It was agreed your -- it was litigated, Your Honor."
1974.74-8,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3244.712,3249.499,It was agreed that he was committed for two reasons that he was a danger to himself to others.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3251.91,3254.823,"Your Honor, we never conceded that he was dangerous at the time of commitment."
1974.74-8,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3254.823,3256.476,Is it disputed?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3256.476,3257.36,"No, we didn't dispute it."
1974.74-8,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3281.001,3287.449,But why weren't all of the tests made to find out whether or not he was a danger to others.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3287.449,3291.594,The tests on that point are absolutely clear Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3317.458,3320.311,"He was not tested in Jacksonville, did he say that?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3320.311,3320.809,"No, Your Honor."
1974.74-8,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3321.912,3325.425,I thought you said all of them did.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3325.425,3326.939,Let me be clear.
1974.74-8,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3326.939,3327.686,Please.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3327.686,3339.767,"All of the employees at the staff of Florida State Hospital with the exception of petitioner said that in their opinion, respondent was not dangerous."
1974.74-8,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3350.464,3359.851,"But all of this came about, about the simple question I asked is didn't you agree that he was committed for the two reasons."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3359.851,3361.717,"No, Your Honor, we did not."
1974.74-8,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3384.918,3394.382,"So, it's not essential to your success here that you re-litigate a finding of dangerousness that might have been made in the 1957 proceeding."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3394.382,3395.382,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3395.382,3416.585,"Well, could I ask -- let me be clear about one thing, suppose that the threshold of the case you could win your case at least in one way if you -- if it were held that there was no -- the state had no right to commit anybody just for treatment if he was not dangerous to himself or others?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3416.585,3418.241,That is correct Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.241,3422.001,How about that -- have you taken any position on that in this case?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3422.001,3424.75,We do take a position on that in a footnote.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3433.59,3450.803,"Well, it might avoid an awful lot of future lawsuits around in the future litigation about the definition of the right to treatment if there was -- if the state couldn't confine people at all unless they were found to be dangerous."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3450.803,3451.311,That's right Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.311,3454.761,In which event there might not be any right to treatment.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3454.761,3456.446,Simply a right to liberty.
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3475.415,3477.714,Did the Court of Appeals take the position on that?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3477.714,3478.497,"No, I don't think it --"
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3478.497,3479.907,Was this issue ever raised in this case?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3479.907,3483.251,"The issue was specifically raised in this case, Your Honor."
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3505.247,3512.061,"In terms of proper approach to constitutional questions, what do you think we should do about that issue, just leave it alone or what?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3512.061,3540.461,"Your Honor, I think the appropriate course for this Court to take on that issue in this case would be either expressly to reserve that decision or to indicate as it has indicated in other cases that if that the question was squarely presented to the Court, it would probably rule as a matter of constitutional law that involuntary confinement of non-dangerous persons is not constitutionally justified."
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3540.461,3544.453,"Well then, if we held that in this case we wouldn't reach these (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3544.453,3550.235,"You wouldn't reach the right to treatment at all, that's correct Your Honor."
1974.74-8,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.598,3565.719,Do you think that jury had to have found that he was neither dangerous to himself or others.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3565.719,3568.283,"Under these instructions, yes Your Honor."
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3568.283,3604.149,"Did the instructions of the trial court give any indications to the jury that they were to examine the entire 15 years of confinement and consider whether there was one situation prevailing in part of that time and another at a different part that is, having in mind that this man was a Christian Scientist and that this record shows beyond any dispute that he had categorically refused certain treatments at certain time, did you give the jury a chance to treat that as a mitigating factor?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3604.149,3605.149,Absolutely Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3630.841,3640.474,"Well, on that respect, do you think the verdict is consistent with the undisputed evidence that he did consistently over a long period of time refuse any treatment whatever?"
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3640.474,3647.946,"Yes, it's quite consistent Your Honor because first of all, the verdict is rather modest I think in this case for a 15-year deprivation of liberty."
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3723.702,3753.598,"Mr. Ennis, directing or just thinking about a problem not of the emotionally ill who were -- some of whom at least are presumptively curable, some of whom are not and any of whom, it was just a over presumption as contrasted with the mentally retarded as a result of a congenital serious brain damage, for example."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3753.598,3755.431,Yes Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3755.431,3783.35,"Surely, would you quarrel with the state's constitutional power to enact a law or to have a program that would say we're going to institutionalize these people in order to take them out of the families of the impoverished and others to give them the best custodial care, we can and is decent so far as the care but they're untreatable."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3788.802,3789.277,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3805.14,3806.733,Autistic persons?
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3806.733,3808.455,Even autistic persons Your Honor.
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3808.455,3814.113,"Well, there are many varieties but I have premised this on people who had congenital brain damage."
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3814.113,3814.452,Yes.
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3814.452,3815.795,Physical brain damage.
1974.74-8,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,3815.795,3816.41,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-8,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3829.221,3831.351,"I know some of these things, yes."
