1985.84-5786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,58.478,"Mr. Klein, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,58.478,60.117,Thank you.
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.773,160.905,"Well, how does it differ, Counsel, from the question of whether a guilty plea was voluntary in Marshall v. Lonberger or a finding that a particular venireman was biased in Patton v. Yount, and the competency question in Maggio?"
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,160.905,168.324,"--Yes, Your Honor, these were the decisions relied on by the Third Circuit, and I would say that the policy decisions there are totally different."
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,170.792,173.635,What policy decisions are you talking about?
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,173.635,179.805,"--Decisions... what the courts were deciding there, what they were pleading--"
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,179.805,181.288,What this Court was deciding.
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,181.288,196.485,"--What this Court was deciding there were questions of credibility and demeanor which the Court, the state courts were in a superior position or had a superior opportunity to review, to assess, to judge--"
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.485,199.967,"Well, why does the... let's take Marshall v. Lonberger."
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,210.792,229.643,"--When you are dealing with voluntariness of a confession and you have a defendant or a petitioner in front of you, you cannot deal with the assessment of credibility and demeanor at a closed, inherently secret and inherently coercive setting such as an interrogation."
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,252.072,261.802,"Well, so you say it depends on... that the cases I have referred to depend on the fact that the witnesses were present before the judge who made the finding?"
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,261.802,263.973,That appears to be one of the factors involved.
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,272.671,276.171,"Well, but they dealt with other constitutional issues certainly."
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,279.811,322.278,"I think that Congress has recognized and this court has recognized that when you are dealing with voluntariness of a confession, you are dealing with... excuse me, I lost myself for a second... voluntariness of a confession, that state courts do not offer the proper institutional setting for final adjudication of federal rights, and that in the past and the potential is still there for state courts to defeat federal claims by failing to, as the Court said in Culombe, to draw the inferences that the historical facts compel."
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.278,327.635,"Well, you... you refer to our decision of Culombe v. Connecticut?"
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,327.635,331.321,Culombe--
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,331.321,333.383,"Yes, how many people joined the opinion to which you are referring?"
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,333.383,335.038,--In Culombe?
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,335.038,337.194,Is it Culombe v. Connecticut?
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,337.194,340.91,I guess.
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,340.91,345.159,And how many Justices of the Court joined the opinion from which you are quoting?
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,345.159,347.612,I thought it was three or four.
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.866,696.877,"Well, your suggestion is that the habeas court should just given independent... draw its own view as to voluntariness, make its independent determination."
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,696.877,703.562,An independent determination of course deferring to the historical facts or the--
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.562,705.952,"And be bound by the historical facts, if supported by the record."
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,705.952,706.358,--Yes.
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,706.358,717.51,"Being bound... and what about inferences from other fact, to other facts, of other facts from those facts, the same with those except as to voluntariness?"
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,717.51,717.947,No.
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,737.815,742.469,But there are other historical facts that you find by drawing inferences from other historical facts.
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,742.469,742.75,--Yes.
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.75,747.046,And those would be... you are bound by those findings.
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,747.046,751.013,"Provided that they are done without reference to the legal standard, yes."
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.013,751.388,Yes.
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,759.617,763.304,"Yes, I would."
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.304,768.474,"And in dubious cases, it is appropriate that the state court's determination should control?"
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,768.474,773.644,I think when we're talking about questions of credibility and demeanor.
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,773.644,775.658,"No, I mean talking about the ultimate judgment."
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,775.658,777.627,The... excuse me?
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,777.627,779.813,About the ultimate conclusion about voluntariness.
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,779.813,786.732,When those ultimate conclusions don't need an application of legal standards--
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.732,790.747,"In doubtful cases the court should make its own... make up its own mind and not defer, is that it?"
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,790.747,796.228,"--Yes, and in cases of this nature, the Court--"
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,796.228,801.648,"Of course, I'm reading from Justice Frankfurter, isn't it in Culombe?"
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,801.648,802.429,"--Culombe, yes."
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.429,806.177,"You disagree with that, with what he said."
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,806.177,808.63,I did not disagree.
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,811.801,816.579,"Well, great weight should be accorded to the inferences which are drawn by the state courts."
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,834.573,836.961,"Well, I didn't see it that way."
1985.84-5786,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,836.961,837.478,All right.
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,867.356,874.415,I don't think that we have the same type of abuses that the early courts were dealing with here.
1985.84-5786,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,893.361,907.933,"Well, I suppose that a federal habeas court in any event could declare certain interrogation tactics improper as a matter of law or define that the voluntariness finding is not fairly supported by the record."
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,907.933,908.902,"--Yes, it could."
1985.84-5786,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,908.902,913.118,And aren't those sufficient in the way of protections today?
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,913.118,916.913,I do not think that the fair record support standard would be sufficient.
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.858,969.019,"Each of the cases that I mentioned to you earlier, Mr. Miller, involved a federal constitutional right, Patton v. Yount, Marshall v. Lonberger, Sumner v. Mata, and the Maggio case, and in each of those this Court said that the 2254 presumption of correctness applied even though we were dealing with claims of federal constitutional rights."
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,974.235,981.262,"--I think it is distinguishable, and I also think in those cases you indicated that you weren't talking about mixed questions."
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,981.262,999.677,"But why should voluntariness of a confession be a ""mixed question"" when the bias of a juror, the suggestibility of a pretrial identification, a competency standard, when they apparently are not mixed questions?"
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,999.677,1020.856,"In all of those cases the Court is able to talk to the... they have voir dire of the jury, jury members, they are able to assess by what they see in front of them, and in voluntariness of a confession case you have a completely different situation."
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1029.055,1033.086,"But it still has to be done by hearing witnesses in open court, doesn't it?"
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,1033.086,1042.723,--Your hearing witnesses in opening court doesn't deal with the credibility or demeanor or the situation of what went on at the interrogation proceeding.
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1043.691,1056.967,"No, but that's the only... unless you have some sort of a tape or a videotape, that's the best way we have of finding out what went on during the interrogation is examining the witnesses who were present."
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,1056.967,1064.073,"--This is correct, but this Court is in no different a position than the lower courts."
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1081.145,1084.97,"But the state courts here had live witnesses before them, didn't they?"
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,1084.97,1092.359,"--They had live witnesses before them, but they weren't... they didn't have the interrogation before them."
1985.84-5786,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1092.359,1097.435,I guess I just don't follow your reasoning.
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,1098.012,1098.746,Excuse me?
1985.84-5786,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.746,1100.667,They had a tape of the interrogation.
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,1100.667,1102.198,They had a tape of the interrogation.
1985.84-5786,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.129,1127.001,One of the things that puzzles me about this case is what are we talking about when we talk about historical fact as opposed to the ultimate conclusion?
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,1141.869,1156.457,"The state courts found that there... while there was a promise of psychiatric help, that this in itself was not coercive enough to overbear his will, and it did not find that--"
1985.84-5786,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.457,1157.614,But it did find there was the promise.
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,1160.645,1164.721,--Not in the promise to help.
1985.84-5786,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1187.979,1193.32,What did the state court say about all the statements to the effect that I'm your brother and you can trust me and all that kind of stuff?
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,1193.32,1202.285,"They found that under the totality of the circumstances, applying the law to the facts as they saw it, that this did not overbear petitioner's will."
1985.84-5786,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.003,1206.33,But they didn't necessarily find that there was no falsehood or deception involved.
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,1206.33,1208.47,"--No, they did not."
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.173,1212.718,"Well, did they find that there was some?"
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,1212.718,1252.843,"--They, they basically said that if what the police did was... they did find that there were lies, that there were some deceptive practices, but that these practices did not operate to overbear petitioner's will, and I think in this regard, in my second point, I wanted to note that this Court has observed that illegal and unconstitutional practices get their first footing by silent approaches and slight deviations from the accepted legal procedures, and I think this case is a perfect example of where those silent approaches and slight deviations can lead."
1985.84-5786,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.43,1314.818,"Now, are these the findings, somebody's findings that you are just reading, or is that your version of the record?"
1985.84-5786,0,38049,paul_martin_klein,,1314.818,1322.518,--These are findings in the... to the extent that they are clear on the tape as to what the detective said.
1985.84-5786,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1491.668,1500.633,Ms. Paskow?
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1500.633,1503.226,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.064,1560.109,"General Paskow, what are the state court's findings on the question to which deception played a part in the whole confession?"
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1560.109,1574.807,I believe that the state court found that he was not deceived into believing that Boyce was anything other than an investigating officer investigating a crime.
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.836,1600.843,"Really, it didn't seem to me they addressed... it is a very difficult question the extent to which deception is appropriate in an examination like this, and I just don't know what the factual predicate on which the ultimate conclusion was based really was, whether they thought there was quite a bit of deception but it was perfectly proper, or they thought there really wasn't very much and it didn't have much effect on him."
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1606.074,1609.105,"Perhaps that's so, but--"
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1609.105,1614.118,Does the state have a position on whether there was a significant amount of deception employed in the interrogation?
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1614.118,1616.368,--We think there was very little deception.
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1616.368,1621.445,"You think all the talk about how he was really your brother and I'm trying to help you and all that, that that wasn't deceptive at all?"
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1621.445,1622.116,"No, sir."
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.116,1622.46,You don't.
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1622.46,1622.507,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.157,1644.545,"Let me take it one step further, if I may."
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1644.545,1644.763,Yes.
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1644.763,1655.119,"Supposing one disagreed with that and thought it was deceptive, that there was a misleading impression that the man was really not an adversary but was trying to help a person in need of psychiatric help."
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1657.555,1659.758,"No, sir, not in this case."
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.758,1661.632,So you win on either approach to the case.
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1661.632,1662.897,We think we do win this case.
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1704.77,1706.535,And on his doorstep.
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1706.535,1707.535,I don't think there's anything more compelling--
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.535,1707.723,And on his doorstep.
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1708.192,1708.645,--Excuse me?
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1708.645,1709.487,And on his doorstep.
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1712.596,1713.204,"That, that was never developed at trial."
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1716.5,1724.091,"Do we know whether, do we assume it was made or it was not made, under the state court's findings of fact, or don't we know?"
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1724.091,1724.465,--That the statement was made?
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.465,1730.244,That the interrogating officer incorrectly stated that blood had been found at the front of his house.
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1730.244,1732.978,We don't know whether he incorrectly stated it or correctly stated it.
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1737.163,1742.708,"And the state court didn't make a finding one way or the other as to whether it was correct or incorrect, or did it?"
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1742.708,1749.003,--I don't think it was a relevant fact for them to make in order to come to their--
1985.84-5786,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1749.003,1755.032,"You don't think if that was a false statement made to induce him to confess, that that wasn't even relevant?"
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1755.032,1763.31,"--If it had been significant in the decision, they would have made a specific finding with respect to it."
1985.84-5786,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1827.19,1850.649,"Well, of course, there are precedents going the other way in connection with this specific question here of voluntariness of confessions, are there not, holding that it's a matter for review by the federal court without the presumption of correctness?"
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1850.649,1853.929,--There are cases going the other way.
1985.84-5786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.483,1877.997,"Yes, but it is talking about facts."
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1877.997,1881.683,But I don't think there was the sensitivity to the distinction between--
1985.84-5786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.683,1884.464,"Well, I know, but the statute itself says factual findings will be used."
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1884.464,1891.054,"--That's correct, and we would say that state of mind of a defendant is traditionally something that should be considered a fact."
1985.84-5786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.054,1894.475,"Well, that isn't what some of the other cases."
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1894.475,1895.77,I think--
1985.84-5786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.77,1896.52,Some of the older cases.
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1897.551,1901.348,--I think you can read some of the older cases to say just about both sides of the question.
1985.84-5786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.784,1907.594,"Well, what about, what about, what about Culombe?"
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1907.594,1912.546,--Culombe also has Justice Frankfurter's language that you quoted before that--
1985.84-5786,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.546,1916.715,"Well, I know, but what did he say about voluntariness, the inference of voluntariness?"
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1925.181,1949.139,"--I think, I think the way to really look at Culombe is more the totality of the circumstances themselves are, were inherently unconstitutional or involuntary, per se, that voluntariness in that case was looked at more as... that the legal standard being applied was being... that anything under those circumstances would have been involuntary regardless of the effect it would have on defendant's will."
1985.84-5786,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1949.139,1959.214,"What about Mincey v. Arizona where the Court said, the Court is under a duty to make an independent review of the record?"
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1959.214,1968.836,"Well, of course, that case didn't come up in a habeas context so that we don't have the 2254(d) presumption applying in that case, and I think that's a distinguishing feature."
1985.84-5786,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1976.239,1984.11,"Do you think that makes a difference on the characterization of whether it's a mixed question of fact and law, how it comes up?"
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1989.546,1997.808,--I think Mincey could very easily have been analyzed as being per se the tactics employed and per se unconstitutional without reaching--
1985.84-5786,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1997.808,1998.839,But that isn't what the Court said.
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,1998.839,2011.88,"--Well, I think the Court examined the totality of the circumstances there on an independent review, which of course would not occur in a habeas context."
1985.84-5786,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2041.743,2046.164,"Ms. Paskow, Davis v. North Carolina was a habeas case, wasn't it?"
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,2046.164,2048.539,"I'm sorry, I don't recall."
1985.84-5786,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2048.539,2068.217,That's in 384 where we said that... and it is a habeas case... and there we said it is our duty in cases dealing with a question whether a confession was involuntarily given to examine the entire record and make an independent determination whether defendant's will had been overborne.
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,2072.73,2087.646,"Frankly, Your Honor, I can't say that I am, but if in fact it stands for the proposition that Your Honor has said, I would suggest that now we should come further from there and give effect to what Congress has said 2254(d) with respect to--"
1985.84-5786,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2087.646,2089.724,"Well, that was a 1967 decision."
1985.84-5786,1,16726,anne_c_paskow,,2091.8,2094.83,"--Since that time we have had, we've had Patton v. Yount and we've had--"
1985.84-5786,2,38049,paul_martin_klein,,2652.76,2653.776,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-5786,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2653.776,2654.322,"Thank you, Counsel."
