1961.454,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,7.105,"Number 454 Bernard Silber, Petitioner, versus United States."
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,13.19,16.682,May it please the Court.
1961.454,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,470.971,478.727,Was that objection (Inaudible) witness before a grand jury (Inaudible)
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,478.727,480.174,I suppose not sir.
1961.454,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,480.174,482.894,(Inaudible)
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,482.894,499.816,"Well, I think there are many reasons in the first place and one of the considerations is that a grand jury investigation is by law subject to secrecy."
1961.454,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,522.116,527.568,What about the time of the lawsuit (Inaudible) do you object on that ground?
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,527.568,529.158,If it were --
1961.454,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,529.158,530.481,In his conscience.
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,530.481,547.03,"If it were sufficiently relevant to lawsuit, perhaps -- if it were relevant, perhaps he could not have answered on these grounds or he would be more accurate, have had the opportunity of taking risks of not answering and answering."
1961.454,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,551.05,557.822,(Inaudible)
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,557.822,584.95,"Because the purpose of a congressional committee had always understood was to secure information for legislative purposes, and not to engage in a program of exposure for exposures sake if I may quote language from -- I am sure some decisions of this Court either majority or minority."
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,846.451,851.707,Are you going to get to the probable cause questions?
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,851.707,853.321,Probable cause --
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,853.321,854.933,"Is that an argument in this case, don't you?"
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,857.489,858.345,Yes.
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,858.345,863.59,"That's your Point 3, are you going to argue on that?"
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,867.565,869.971,"Oh yes, of course sir."
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,874.563,874.933,Yes.
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,874.933,876.62,I'll get to that very shortly.
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,990.308,997.806,I gathered the Government's position as whatever meaning it had does not have the meaning it has in Fourth Amendment cases or in arrest.
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,997.806,999.158,That's true.
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,999.356,1000.624,Did you say it does?
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1000.624,1002.097,I contend that it does.
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1110.897,1117.626,"I take it when you say he ran for office on the Communist party ticket, this --"
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1117.626,1119.524,"Mr. Davis ran, not the witness."
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1121.073,1123.271,"Yes I know, both Mr. Davis and Amter."
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1123.271,1123.373,Yes.
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1123.373,1126.406,"I gather in those days, it was quite legal for the --"
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1126.406,1126.422,Oh yes.
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1126.422,1127.745,Communist Party.
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1127.745,1128.731,Yes indeed.
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1227.018,1231.348,"Tell me Mr. Rabinowitz, I gather you're not arguing or perhaps you are when I ask the question."
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1241.908,1248.93,"No, I am arguing that this was the indiscriminate dragnet procedure."
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1248.93,1258.725,"Well now, what you're saying is that if they subpoenaed him, they must in fact have had information which would constitute whatever probable cause is --"
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1258.725,1259.28,Right.
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1259.28,1260.394,-- before they could --
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1260.394,1260.853,Exactly.
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1260.853,1261.048,-- follow.
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1261.048,1267.254,And let me make a distinction between this case and almost every other case that has come before the Court.
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1311.057,1312.618,"Well, I think Shelton may have been --"
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1312.618,1313.487,It may have been --
1961.454,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1313.487,1316.526,-- Shelton who has just been anonymous letter in the file.
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1316.526,1317.732,That may have been the case.
1961.454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1402.844,1413.71,I think -- are you now arguing within the corners of the Barenblatt opinion or are you asking us to overrule that?
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1413.71,1424.343,"Well with respect to the constitutional issues, I am asking you to overrule the Barenblatt and Wilkinson and Braden decision."
1961.454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1424.343,1429.2,"Aren't you -- are you also making an argument that within the framework, within the context --"
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1429.2,1430.255,"Yes, I --"
1961.454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1430.255,1438.327,"-- of that opinion that applying the -- your concept of the balancing test, that the balance here should be struck to favor the petition?"
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1438.327,1439.61,Yes sir.
1961.454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1439.61,1442.039,"Also in -- in that sense, you're not asking us to --"
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1442.039,1461.235,"No, in that sense, I am asking you follow what I conceived to be the ruling in the Barenblatt and Wilkinson and Braden cases."
1961.454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1674.539,1682.099,Do you -- do you construe these questions as requesting the names of people?
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1682.099,1703.395,"So the counsel at the -- the pertinency that was explained to him at the hearing was that he -- the pertinency that was explained by counsel was, “We want to know so that we can call these people and they may be able to give us information.”"
1961.454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1703.395,1703.599,Certainly.
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1703.599,1709.701,"I will concede that these questions do not, on their face, call for names."
1961.454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1710.497,1712.723,How else can you look at the question?
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1712.723,1730.41,"Well, you can look at the question by examining the reason for pertinency given by the -- by counsel at the time that the question was asked and the Government is bound by its explanation of pertinency."
1961.454,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1755.014,1759.785,The question was it wasn't who recruited him but just whether the person who have had recruited him was a communications person?
1961.454,0,43662,victor_rabinowitz,,1759.785,1766.847,"Yes, but the explanation of pertinency was that this would supply the Committee with the names of persons."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2017.662,2021.368,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2297.139,2304.156,I don't -- this is perhaps a collateral issue but I had in some witness in California identified -- was that -- that was the Wilkinson's case.
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2304.156,2305.562,I -- Wilkinson I think was --
1961.454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2305.562,2307.625,Whether they're having at the committee a witness in California (Voice Overlap) --
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2307.625,2308.706,I believe that so Your Honor.
1961.454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2308.706,2310.218,-- had identified at Wilkinson (Voice Overlap) --
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2310.218,2310.971,I believe that so.
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2367.48,2391.663,"Well, may I ask Mr. Terris, if -- I'm starting this with if the Fourth Amendment standards for probable cause were applicable here, if they were, is the Government's position that the information in this memorandum will satisfy those standards of probable cause?"
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2391.663,2396.388,"Your Honor, my answer to that is the last two of the three arguments that we have."
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2400.923,2400.989,Why?
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2400.989,2402.059,-- and if it does apply.
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2402.059,2402.383,That's why --
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2402.383,2402.577,Okay.
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2402.577,2405.475,"-- if it could start with if, I would say, if they were."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2405.475,2409.642,"Well, it's hard to know what if you say that it applies but doesn't have any content."
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2410.541,2411.383,"Well, I'm not trying (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2411.383,2413.795,The third -- the third argument.
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2413.795,2414.698,Yes.
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2414.698,2421.002,"If it applies, we submit that the standard is the same as subpoena duces tecum."
1961.454,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2471.775,2473.714,Go ahead and apply it to that person.
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2473.714,2474.241,Pardon me?
1961.454,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2474.241,2475.04,Go ahead and apply it to that person.
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2475.04,2480.916,"Okay, investigation is authorized by Congress."
1961.454,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2480.916,2482.741,Okay.
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2482.741,2491.621,"That was the decision in Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson is for a purpose Congress can order, that's again satisfied by Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson."
1961.454,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2502.117,2503.773,"Well now, wait a minute."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2509.185,2509.208,Right.
1961.454,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2509.208,2511.416,-- irrelevant to the inquiry.
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2518.525,2522.36,"Okay well, I'm going to --"
1961.454,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2522.36,2531.798,"Well, you should -- you should have some reasonable cause to believe that he knows something relevant to the inquiry that you can see that."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2531.798,2534.382,"Well, that isn't what the sentence -- that isn't what the sentence says in (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2534.382,2536.891,"Well, I know, but the (Voice Overlap) -- documents, the sentence."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2536.891,2537.217,No wait.
1961.454,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2546.752,2553.614,"Oh yes, but the document sought -- they believe that the reasonable cause with the documents, the contents of the document relevant to the inquiry."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2553.614,2571.605,"Well I -- I think I cannot agree but I'm not sure -- I'm not sure that it makes a difference because as I've said, I'm going to accept under the First Amendment, and a witness can't be subpoenaed if that is the result of indiscriminate dragnet procedures lacking a probable cause."
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2607.034,2616.59,"Yes, but what you've just read from Oklahoma case that you have reasons to (Inaudible) reasonable cause for belief that the contents of the documents are relevant."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2630.097,2630.688,As I see --
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2630.688,2632.028,-- upon the inquiry.
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2640.672,2652.092,"As I see Your Honor, I want to get into a sterile argument because in the sense that I'm not sure that what you've said is any different than what really the Court was saying in the Barenblatt case but I don't think --"
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2652.092,2652.121,I don't know what --
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2652.121,2653.254,-- that is the wording of --
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2653.254,2655.462,I don't know what the Court was saying in the Barenblatt case but what I was trying to find out --
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2655.462,2663.307,"Well, let me say this sentence, the very wording of the Barenblatt case is not too far from what you said."
1961.454,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2692.538,2695.284,-- (Voice Overlap) -- if you don't produce it in the response to the subpoena.
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2695.284,2701.484,"And if he -- and if a witness doesn't have the information he says, “I can't answer.”"
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2709.361,2723.497,"Well, I -- I thought what we were discussing Mr. Terris is, what is if the Committee has to know about a prospective witness before properly, they may subpoena him under that testimony of the Barenblatt case that you've been repeating to it over and over all day."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2723.497,2735.833,"Right, I'm -- preliminary, all I've meant to say is that Oklahoma Press establishes that under the Fourth Amendment the Committee doesn't have to know very much."
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2812.179,2827.506,"Well, may I ask you Mr. Terris what Mr. Arens testified too that it had information and it's filed as to the Communist Party of membership petitioner, is that which later will develop in cross-examination, is it not the information?"
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2827.506,2829.658,I would assume that so I -- in Braden what happened --
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2829.658,2837.164,"In other words, the (Inaudible) from the New York Times in this report of Mr. Russell --"
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2837.164,2837.341,Yes sir --
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2837.341,2840.535,"And all that -- that's all he was referring to, was it at the trial?"
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2840.535,2842.175,Well there -- there are four things Your Honor --
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2842.175,2843.342,Yes.
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2843.342,2844.421,I assume that's right.
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2916.88,2924.475,"Well maybe, my memory doesn't serve me but I thought what they were after there where the -- in effect the registry of the hotel."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2924.475,2924.891,That's right.
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2924.891,2934.785,"Now, all with the background of much correspondents between Dr. Uphause and the other people."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2934.785,2936.634,I think that's right Your Honor.
1961.454,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2955.706,2965.002,"Mr. Terris, do you think this whole issue is eliminated by the fact this gentleman sort of a trial or sort of the hearing then everyone's a communist?"
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2965.002,2975.885,"I don't think -- I think probably it's a technical matter that it is not eliminated, that the essential inquiry is what the Committee knew prior to the time."
1961.454,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2984.514,2985.692,"Yes, but the issue is different here."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2986.461,2987.621,"Yes, yes."
1961.454,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3007.273,3013.748,All you would do then -- all you would then is letting -- according to your idea was (Inaudible)
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3013.748,3026.694,"Well, that's of course a difficulty which in the Fourth Amendment area you don't have because in the Fourth Amendment area, you can say that the evidence can't be -- can't be admitted."
1961.454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3037.957,3048.115,And do you say that you've got a probable cause rule or some kind or simply some question about raising it in some -- based in the hearing?
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3048.115,3056.974,Not -- insofar as this is under the First Amendment and it's very -- it's a little bit hard for me to know exactly what the petitioner is raising in his brief.
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3063.922,3066.965,I thought he was relying on what -- on that same statement from Barenblatt.
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3066.965,3069.798,"Well, it's not quite that clear from the brief."
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3104.782,3125.492,"Well, I -- as I recall the Shelton argument, I think the Government's position there was that even an anonymous letter he said somebody by the name of Shelton at the New York Times we think as a Communist, was sufficient test -- to support subpoenaing Shelton to come down and testify."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3125.492,3134.449,"But one additional fact Your Honor, and that is that the letter came from an informant who've been previously found to be reliable."
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3134.449,3137.589,"We don't have -- we don't have reliable informant here, do we?"
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3137.589,3138.925,We don't know whether he's reliable.
1961.454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3144.824,3145.877,What is the --
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3145.877,3146.617,Collaboration --
1961.454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3146.617,3148.334,-- (Voice Overlap) -- of the New York Times?
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3148.334,3149.237,"Well, the two things that he --"
1961.454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3149.237,3154.604,Or one of the other is one collaboration of it?
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3154.604,3160.328,"Well, let me tell the Fourth state, the four documents in which we rely."
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3223.838,3229.472,I gather you don't rely on the one but his son whose first name was unknown was also identified at New York Times.
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3229.472,3238.202,"Well, I don't rely on the fact that his son was a member of the Communist Party but I rely in the fact that the --"
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3238.202,3240.17,"If that's all there was, you wouldn't think he was a member?"
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3240.17,3252.247,"Well that -- I mean if his son was a member, that isn't of course what it might -- the emphasis Your Honor of the sentence that you read, I would put rather differently, it was also identified."
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3266.739,3267.468,Do you think that was enough?
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3267.468,3270.763,"No, I wouldn't even rely in there for collaboration."
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3270.763,3279.242,"But now let's see, we know that if they pick him up off the street that isn't enough and that if they merely say that the son was a member, that is --"
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3279.242,3281.524,"Yes Your Honor, I don't think --"
1961.454,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3281.524,3282.972,"Well now, we're getting somewhere."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3282.972,3292.234,"Well, Your Honor with all -- with all respect, I don't think that there ever has been a case in which the Committee has done either one of those two things."
1961.454,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3292.234,3306.425,Do you find (Inaudible)
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3306.425,3310.082,"I find nothing in Barenblatt, Wilkinson or Braden."
1961.454,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3321.49,3338.965,(Inaudible)
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3338.965,3339.679,I'd like to state --
1961.454,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3339.679,3341.561,(Inaudible)
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3341.561,3362.026,"In our view, the Committee has reasonable ground to believe that either the petitioner was a member of the Communist Party or that he was closely allied to the Communist Party and we think it would've certainly been enough if he'd even been closely affiliate with the Communist Party, surely likely he would had information about Communist activities."
1961.454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3452.649,3454.285,And as an officer of the --
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3454.285,3456.754,"And he was not an officer, he was a long time member."
1961.454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3456.754,3457.778,"Member, long time member."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3457.778,3466.614,That's right and there's no -- and there's no indication that he -- that he was ignorant of the affairs of the American Communications Association.
1961.454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3533.551,3543.961,"This -- and I don't want to delay you for this question as to what indictments -- indictment must contain, you say it's not in this case."
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3548.532,3549.256,That's right Your Honor --
1961.454,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3549.256,3549.268,Right.
1961.454,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,3549.268,3551.878,-- but it wasn't raised in this Court.
