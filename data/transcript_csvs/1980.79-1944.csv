1980.79-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.991,We will hear arguments next in Payne v. Chrysler Motors.
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,98.247,100.965,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1944,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,250.676,271.19,"Well, do you concede that findings of discrimination under the Act, without any evidence sufficient to survive a motion for a directed verdict, dealing with causation and damage, would be insufficient to support a monetary award?"
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,271.19,291.17,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would say that if price discrimination alone with absolutely no other evidence is the only evidence before the Court, then I would say that that's true; that price discrimination in a vacuum cannot be found to cause injury."
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,291.17,298.807,"Well, what about price discrimination plus the fact that the two customers are competitive?"
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,300.026,302.109,I think you have got to go farther.
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,304.144,305.578,"Well, I wouldn't think you would; yes."
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,305.578,335.782,"But I would submit to Your Honor, Mr. Justice White, that in this case there was substantial corroborating evidence supporting an inference of injury resulting from substantial price discrimination taking place, occurring in a market where there was keen competition and in the face of tight profit margins, and where the substantial price discrimination could have been reflected in the retail sales price."
1980.79-1944,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,405.975,425.871,Do you think that Mr. Payne's testimony itself without the testimony of Dr. Ignatin would have required the district court to submit the case to the jury on the issue of damages and required it to accept an award of damages that was within the range of his testimony?
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,425.871,433.994,"Under the... no other rebutting evidence whatsoever, yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I do."
1980.79-1944,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,468.55,479.056,"Well, what if you have only these two questions on the damage issue, and they're put to Mr. Payne by Mr. Payne's counsel,"
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,498.047,516.426,"--I believe, under even the standards that this Court has established on proof of damage and proof of amount of damage, that you would have to go farther than just mere self serving conclusions in the absence of any other supporting evidence."
1980.79-1944,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,979.496,1017.754,"Do you agree with all of the Bruce's Juices language on page 746, 330 U.S., where the Court says that the plaintiff here is not complaining of the high price of the object sold, but it's complaining that he didn't get enough of what he wanted, in effect?"
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1038.617,1047.639,"Only in the context, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, of the competition in the market, because that in effect reduced the price."
1980.79-1944,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1143.318,1160.394,"In Bruce's Juices, on page 746 the Court is discussing the refusal to outlaw these discounts flatly, and it says, at the top of the page,"
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1188.847,1200.588,"To a certain extent it's true that Chrysler's rebates lessened the price, the ultimate price of the car to my client."
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.88,1282.706,"Well, counsel, suppose before a discrimination takes place, two competitors are each selling 500 cars a year and then the manufacturer lowers the price to one of the dealers but not to the other."
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1312.875,1314.744,"Yes, Mr. Justice White, it is."
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.744,1317.429,"Well, is that an injury to competition?"
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1317.429,1320.731,"It's an injury to competition; yes, it is."
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.731,1332.122,"Did the Court of Appeals here assume an injury to competition but then just say, the injury to competition, there's no proof that it caused any injury to your client?"
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1332.122,1344.08,"The Court of Appeals, if I read their opinion correctly, stated that the proof of price discrimination by itself does not prove competitive injury, nor does it prove--"
1980.79-1944,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1344.08,1351.667,It began its opinion by saying that it didn't need to decide whether or not there had been a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act.
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1351.667,1352.319,--That's correct.
1980.79-1944,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1352.319,1363.042,"And if there had been a violation of it... but I guess it proceeded to assume that there had been one, and if there had been one, then there was an injury to competition."
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1363.042,1363.994,It did not--
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1363.994,1371.747,So it necessarily said that even if there was a violation there was not causation.
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1371.747,1373.182,--That's... right.
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1390.058,1409.022,"Well, if... why didn't you just take the... if you really are prepared to support your answer to my question of a while ago, I suppose you would say that whether your client lost sales in this case or not, he paid more for his cars, and therefore he lost some profits."
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1409.022,1409.806,Absolutely.
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1409.806,1411.239,That's all you have to say.
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1411.239,1414.925,I think that the 5th Circuit recognized that.
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1414.925,1416.359,"Well, but they didn't."
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1417.192,1423.263,"Well, they distinguished paying more for cars and lost profits."
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.425,1480.818,"--Well, my example to you, though, the 500-car example, the disfavored dealer is making the same profit, after the discrimination."
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1486.839,1488.974,"--Yes, you can, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1523.212,1531.135,"The fact is, though, that after the discrimination, in my example, the favored dealer didn't pick up any sales."
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1531.135,1537.054,"Well, the favored dealer may not have wanted to pick up sales."
1980.79-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.497,1590.97,"Mr. Reeves, is there any evidence in this record of injury to competition other than the injury to your client?"
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1590.97,1604.111,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe I mentioned just briefly that the economist testified that the price discrimination resulted in a two pronged effect."
1980.79-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1630.211,1635.182,He testified that the market price as a whole was raised by reason of the discrimination?
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1635.182,1640.586,"As, in his view, that was the effect of that type of rebate program."
1980.79-1944,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1640.586,1641.003,I see.
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1651.559,1655.113,That's another piece of corroborating evidence that supports--
1980.79-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1655.113,1659.33,But that's only corroborating if you assume that he went out of business because of the price discrimination.
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1661.449,1680.878,"--That's true, but the Court of Appeals again took the position, Mr. Justice Stevens, that despite the expert testimony by Dr. Ignatin that the price discrimination... if there had not been any price discrimination, Payne would not have gone out of business."
1980.79-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1748.522,1760.78,"Is this much true, that if the Court of Appeals is correct in believing there was a violation, or at least assuming there was a violation, it must have assumed that at least some of the expert's testimony was truthful, at least the part about raising prices?"
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1776.042,1792.317,"I think that's a good inference, if you will, from the reading of the 5th Circuit's opinion but I would like to say also that the statutory requirements under Section 2(a) are even less than showing injury to competition."
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.671,1802.206,That may be so to show a violation.
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1802.206,1803.406,To show a violation--
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.406,1813.431,But you don't... doesn't a treble damage claimant have to prove an actual injury to competition?
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1813.431,1815.447,"--Not the competition, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.018,1835.394,"That is, you say even if it were found that there actually was not, or even if... you could say, even though there's no proof of actual injury to competition, the plaintiff could recover?"
1980.79-1944,0,19856,c_lee_reeves,,1835.394,1836.427,I don't think so.
1980.79-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1842.031,1844.583,"We will resume there at one o'clock, counsel."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,1869.114,1875.752,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1950.199,1957.353,"Well, don't you think we have to judge this case on the assumption there was a violation of the Act?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,1957.353,1961.655,--I think the 5th Circuit said they had not decided that issue.
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1965.273,1966.927,Yes; even if there was.
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,1968.241,1969.239,There was not causation.
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1969.239,1969.677,"However, there was an injury."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,1969.677,1985.187,"I think that the significance is that to show the substantive violation of 2(a) you only, at least under Morton Salt and that FTC action, you only have to show a reasonable possibility that injury might result from a price discrimination."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.398,2009.536,"Well, what about in my example of the two dealers with each selling 500 cars?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2044.059,2052.665,"Not necessarily, if it didn't affect the competition, it if was no... it seems to me there may not have been competition in that hypothetical, but I say, if you--"
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.665,2054.481,"Well, they were both competing with one another."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2065.739,2070.977,"--Well, I would think that under the structure of the Robinson-Patman Act, there probably would not be a violation."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.244,2075.68,"There would not be injury, you think, or what?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2075.68,2084.369,"--I think it would not be under 2(a) because the Act is not designed, I think, to insure that everybody is going to pay the same unit price for what they purchase."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2100.396,2106.9,"But if his... the lowering of his profits certainly makes him less effective, threatens his effectiveness as a competitor?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2106.9,2112.47,"It may threaten his effectiveness, but until something actually happens I don't believe he has a cause of action."
1980.79-1944,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2150.943,2168.571,"Therefore, in answer to my brother White's question, your answer would be that in his hypothetical case there wouldn't be a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act, because there would not be injury to competition, since each dealer continued to sell the same number of cars as he had in the past."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2168.571,2169.24,"I think that's correct, sir."
1980.79-1944,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2169.24,2173.792,"Therefore, you wouldn't get to the next step of whether or not the plaintiff had shown injury?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2173.792,2176.077,To himself.
1980.79-1944,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2176.077,2179.296,Because there wouldn't be a violation of the Act.
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2179.296,2180.798,Correct.
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2180.798,2196.907,"Let me ask you, Mr. Forman, supposing that the two dealers handled both the Chrysler cars and also General Motors cars, and General Motors and Chrysler agreed to charge a higher price to one than the other."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2203.644,2207.213,I think then you've got a price fixing conspiracy.
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2207.213,2208.298,You've got a violation of the Sherman Act.
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2210.4,2213.269,"Well, I think you would because that case is an overcharge case."
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2215.535,2226.26,"What assurance... whether you call it an overcharge or price discrimination, how does it differ in terms of its impact on the person who makes less money than if the illegality had not been present?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2226.26,2229.145,--I think the difference is in the design of the two acts.
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.074,2274.74,"Well, how can you say that?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2287.232,2288.698,So if Chrysler had lowered the--
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.698,2298.622,"I suppose instead of initially charging $5,000 and later rebating $500, you might initially just charge $4,500."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2307.561,2317.251,"--Well, he'd have been a little bit better off, but I think the key in the Section 2(a) case is how much worse off you are because somebody else received a lower price than you did."
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.209,2346.603,"Would the case be different if instead of a rebate you originally had a list price of $4,500 and then without announcing it publicly they wrote a letter to Payne that said that we've decided to charge you $5,000 a car from now on, and they just raised the price to Payne without... Payne never did know what his competitors were getting, anything like that?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2353.942,2354.726,Just made less money out of it.
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2358.428,2363.398,"But if they raised the price by agreeing with their competitor to do it, why then, of course he would have an injury?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2378.324,2382.026,"Well, I think in the Sherman Act case you don't have to show any competition."
1980.79-1944,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2382.026,2382.742,"First of all, you have to show a violation of the law."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2382.742,2386.511,"Is maybe the answer, you don't have to show that Mr. Payne was competing with anybody."
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.62,2404.891,"Well, I understand the argument how one may be a violation of law and the other is not."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2413.661,2423.369,"I think there is in terms of antitrust injury, which is the injury that is defined in Brunswick that flows from the anticompetitive effects of the violation."
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.995,2561.839,"But it is applicable to suggest that my hypothetical, or maybe Justice White's hypothetical, that sales to two different prices, where there is no transfer of business back and forth, would violate the Robinson-Patman Act in a proceeding brought by the Commission?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2561.839,2564.724,It would bar him proceeding.
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2628.216,2634.303,"Well, you can say that they're just bare allegations but he did say he lost sales."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2634.303,2637.155,And I would suggest that he had to go forward and show that he lost sales.
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2640.273,2652.68,"Well, he says, I own the business, I know how many cars I've been selling lately, and I know that I haven't been able to sell as many cars as I used to."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2652.68,2658.515,"I think he'd have a number, then, to give you, but he's submitted no number here of the number of automobiles--"
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.515,2662.802,"Well, if he had just said, by the way, and what I mean is, I lost 20 sales."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2664.571,2666.288,"--Well, I think he should have something--"
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2666.288,2670.392,"Or does he... should he have to call an accountant and get out his records, that sort of thing?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2670.392,2672.025,--I would submit that you probably do.
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.61,2679.831,"Well, why do you need corroboration?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2684.3,2687.168,"Because if you don't, I don't think you have any protection for the defendant."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2687.168,2689.453,"--Well, the court could say, I just don't believe you."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2696.373,2697.459,Pardon me?
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2697.459,2701.344,"Well, what if the court believes him, that he did lose sales?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2703.696,2704.379,I don't see how.
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2713.069,2721.925,"Well, he says, I lost sales in the amount of $80,000, out of which I could have have made $80,000 in profit."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2723.191,2724.877,"He said, I would have made $80,000 in profit?"
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.796,2735.165,"Well, if the judge were to say to him, I believe you all right, but you have to prove it with some papers?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2736.017,2736.9,I think that's right.
1980.79-1944,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2739.786,2746.123,"Well, why isn't his testimony evidence?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2746.123,2752.86,It isn't evidence because there is not enough there to protect a defendant.
1980.79-1944,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2763.484,2766.436,"Well, you're not saying it's not evidence, you're saying it's insufficient evidence?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2766.436,2769.638,It's insufficient evidence to substantiate the verdict.
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.638,2771.955,Even though you may believe him?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2771.955,2775.542,I think he has to have some substance behind it.
1980.79-1944,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2781.446,2784.148,You're just saying that it's conclusory?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2784.148,2784.831,--Correct.
1980.79-1944,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2791.902,2805.061,Conclusory is something that one usually hears applied to pleadings rather than evidence.
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2830.026,2841.917,"I think you may have the best evidence rule there would be applicable, to show the bills rather than showing his pure testimony of what he claims he paid."
1980.79-1944,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2841.917,2844.702,Do you mean the judge couldn't rule with it?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2844.702,2852.272,"Provided you didn't object on best evidence, or demanding best evidence."
1980.79-1944,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2854.824,2859.462,"Well, suppose he didn't object?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2863.364,2865.98,He might in that case.
1980.79-1944,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2867.066,2870.268,"What records, if any, did Mr. Payne produce?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2870.268,2877.672,He didn't produce any records other than his financial statements which were submitted to Chrysler.
1980.79-1944,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2877.672,2885.36,"Did you demand any records, any of the records you are now talking about?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2888.995,2890.412,"Parts of it, Your Honor."
1980.79-1944,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2890.412,2893.281,"Well, did counsel for Chrysler demand--"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2893.281,2896.399,I think we demanded all the documents that he had.
1980.79-1944,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2896.399,2897.518,--And how did the court rule on that?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2897.518,2898.385,At trial we didn't.
1980.79-1944,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2902.203,2908.241,Did the trial court sustain your request that all documents be produced?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2908.241,2911.193,"--Well, it was not... no, he overruled us, Your Honor."
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2981.97,2985.239,Do those figures relate to the models on which he claimed there was a price discrimination?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2985.239,2992.593,"--Well, he claimed in his brief that, every sale, there was a discrimination."
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2992.593,2999.649,"I understand him to say there was a price discrimination on some at some periods of time, and some models, but not constantly?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,2999.649,3002.951,It did vary among styles.
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3002.951,3007.069,And I thought he said some of the rebate programs were lawful and some were unlawful?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3007.069,3013.491,"Well, he determined that on about whether he was the most favored dealer, is what it boils down to."
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3074.613,3077.582,"Of course, that goes to the question of violation, doesn't it?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3077.582,3084.752,"Well, I think he also has to show that there was in fact actual competitive injury, and that--"
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3084.752,3086.688,"He did go out of business, didn't he?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3086.688,3091.825,"--Well, he claimed... the violation had to occur prior to that time."
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.825,3095.126,"That's a fact that's consistent, at least, with his testimony, isn't it?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3095.126,3098.328,"Right, but the violation had to occur prior to him going out of business."
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3098.328,3105.082,"Right, but the fact that he did not survive in the competitive market is consistent with his theory that he suffered some harm that caused him some--"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3105.082,3116.74,"Well, I think there's also evidence in the case that the reason that... and I think this average gross profit on the retail sales demonstrates that his new car sales was not hurting."
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3129.967,3144.542,"--I still am not sure you answered my question, whether those profit margins on the new car sales on page 10 of your brief related to the models and the periods of time when the price discrimination claimed to be illegal was in effect?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3146.242,3155.165,"They cover his sales for the entire year, but as counsel for the plaintiff indicated, I think, on footnote 3 of his brief, he says,"
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3188.738,3198.194,"There is some discussion in the briefs about the used car business and how much they made on over allowances, or something like that, on each used car transaction."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3202.313,3208.3,It shows that his used cars was low and that's on page 269.
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3257.732,3265.053,If it's within his peculiar knowledge and he gives testimony that's based on his peculiar knowledge would that be sufficient to support a conclusion on the testimony?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3265.053,3267.655,"--I would think he'd have to come forward with some documents to show, and there shouldn't be--"
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3267.655,3270.257,"If there's documents, then it's just not within his peculiar knowledge."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3271.392,3282.431,"--Well, if it's within the company, it certainly is, within his accountant... they certainly could have shown a transaction and said, look, this car, we overvalued it, at this price."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3331.095,3332.614,Was there a verdict in this case?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3332.614,3333.314,"There was a verdict, Your Honor."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3333.314,3337.349,And did you object to any of the instructions?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3337.349,3339.684,"Yes, Your Honor, we did object to some instruction."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3339.684,3345.254,"Of course, you don't argue now that there are any instructional problems?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3345.254,3346.537,"Well, the 5th Circuit didn't reach that issue."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3356.229,3362.466,I take it that the jury must have decided not only that there was proof of injury but they knew how much it was?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3362.466,3370.387,"Well, the only evidence in this case that was submitted, which is evident from a review of the record, is this mathematical calculation of what they considered was the price discrimination."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3370.387,3373.339,"Well, you think the jury departed from its instructions?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3373.339,3378.059,"They would have had to, Your Honor, because there was no other evidence."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3378.059,3384.262,But you don't complain about the instructions about causation and the fact of injury and the amount?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3386.848,3392.333,"We did object to some instructions, yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3392.333,3396.287,On those particular ones or not?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3396.287,3397.82,I don't think we did--
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.82,3399.322,"In any event, the jury did not--"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3399.322,3403.608,--We did not on the math because he said that the price discrimination is not a proper measure.
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3403.608,3408.861,"--But the jury certainly thought there was some evidence of... I know you say there wasn't, but--"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3408.861,3412.146,"That's our point, here, that there wasn't any."
1980.79-1944,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3417.367,3439.797,"--Do you say that the jury's rendition of a money judgment for you is inconsistent with the doctrines of RKO v. Bigelow, and Story Parchment where you're talking about business damages and their inherent difficulty of proof?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3439.797,3446.803,"Yes, Your Honor, but those... they allow some reasonable means of reflecting the antitrust injury."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3464.514,3465.114,"Well, he went on, then."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3469.982,3474.053,"--That's right, but he offered no showing of what the profit would have been in a normal everyday--"
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3474.053,3476.988,"Yes, I know, but he testified as to that, didn't he?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3476.988,3478.088,--He stated purely--
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3478.088,3479.94,Didn't he testify in court on that?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3479.94,3480.49,--He said we lost--
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3480.49,3482.706,And the jury must have believed him.
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3484.725,3488.627,--But there was no measure of what the profits would have been from losing those lost sales.
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3579.05,3587.523,"Didn't you... I suppose you asked the judge not to take the case to the jury, give the case to the jury at all?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3587.523,3588.123,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3588.123,3591.724,And after verdict you asked for judgment notwithstanding verdict?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3591.724,3592.509,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3592.509,3594.426,And the judge disagreed with you?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3594.426,3595.545,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3595.545,3600.247,So he didn't buy your argument of no evidence?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3600.247,3601.349,"He did not, Your Honor, because--"
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3601.349,3606.401,And he didn't buy your argument there wasn't evidence about amount?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3606.401,3608.834,"--No, Your Honor, he didn't, but there wasn't any, that's the point."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3617.857,3627.065,"I know, but they had to do away with his own testimony as sufficient evidence to prove anything."
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3627.065,3627.248,--Correct.
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3628.765,3633.218,What if they were wrong on that?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3633.218,3642.824,"--I would hope, without arguing... this is evidence that they could indeed... he should have been able to produce them."
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3644.357,3647.392,"Well, that may be so, but what if we disagree with you on that?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3655.364,3657.683,"Well, then, you will come to the measure of, did he--"
1980.79-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3657.683,3661.218,"I know you think we'd be wrong, but what should we do if we are so grossly erroneous?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3661.218,3666.022,"--Well, then I think you can tell them that he provide a reasonable measure of the amount of his injury."
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3695.94,3699.725,"The trial judge rejected that remedy too didn't he, in his instructions?"
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3699.725,3702.075,"He did, Your Honor, and--"
1980.79-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3702.075,3706.229,He gave the instruction on that precise point that you wanted?
1980.79-1944,1,30222,j_ross_forman_iii,,3706.229,3707.245,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1944,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3718.82,3721.003,Mr. Reeves.
1980.79-1944,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3721.003,3724.222,"Mr. Reeves, may I ask you a question at the outset?"
1980.79-1944,2,19856,c_lee_reeves,,3756.893,3758.511,"I don't think so, Mr. Justice Powell."
1980.79-1944,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3781.06,3784.178,"So that if you prove discrimination, you're entitled to damages?"
1980.79-1944,2,19856,c_lee_reeves,,3784.178,3793.884,"If you prove discrimination that is sufficient to show or allow a jury to reach the inference of injury, yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1944,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3807.378,3815.215,"Well, are you saying that even if this owner hadn't got on the stand and said he lost sales or profits, that you should win?"
1980.79-1944,2,19856,c_lee_reeves,,3815.215,3815.765,I am.
1980.79-1944,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3834.778,3837.913,Would you defend the 9th Circuit's view of the Robinson-Patman Act?
1980.79-1944,2,19856,c_lee_reeves,,3837.913,3858.677,"I do, and the 8th Circuit's, and the 7th Circuit's, in Bargain Car Wash, Mr. Justice White, as not permitting... or not saying automatic damage, because it is, there's always the possibility of rebuttal by the defendant if the extraordinary circumstances this Court talked about in Bruce's Juices are present."
1980.79-1944,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3863.296,3872.986,"What do you do with the congressional history, where they had a presumptive damage provision and they eliminated it during the course of enacting the Robinson-Patman Act?"
1980.79-1944,2,19856,c_lee_reeves,,3872.986,3881.342,--That is the presumption... the presumptive damage rule was in the Senate's version of the bill.
1980.79-1944,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3902.172,3906.474,"Well, then you say there is a presumption of damage?"
1980.79-1944,2,19856,c_lee_reeves,,3906.474,3938.259,"I say that this Court should reaffirm the minimum damage rule that it indicated in Bruce's Juices and in Morton Salt which permits an inference of damage, at least in that amount, subject to rebuttal, and that the mere fact that there was at one point a provision of presumptive damages does not mean that that, the elimination of it by Congress meant that Congress didn't want that type rule, because that rule was redundant."
1980.79-1944,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3950.317,3951.217,"Thank you, gentlemen."
