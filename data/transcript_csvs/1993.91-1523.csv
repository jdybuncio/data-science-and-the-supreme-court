1993.91-1523,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.8,"We'll hear argument now in Number 91-1523, the Florence County School District Four v. Shannon Carter, et al. Mr. Ayer."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,11.8,12.87,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.91-1523,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.111,98.345,"Well, Mr. Ayers, the... it's defined, I guess, in section 1401?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,98.345,100.657,"1401(a)(18), Your Honor."
1993.91-1523,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.657,108.082,Do you think that that provision is applicable at all to private placements?
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,109.251,110.443,"Well, Your Honor--"
1993.91-1523,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.443,112.135,"--cover, really, State placements--"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,112.135,113.524,--I think the place--
1993.91-1523,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.524,114.776,--or State provision of--
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,114.776,131.838,"--The place to begin in thinking about it is with the initial section of the act, which states the purpose of the act, and it states that purpose very explicitly in terms of assuring that all children with disabilities will have available to them a free, appropriate public education."
1993.91-1523,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,137.662,138.033,"--Well, okay."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,155.763,175.406,"Well, the statute does not explicitly provide for the Burlington remedy, either, and so the fact that there is a remedy there is something that is recognized as necessary to accomplish the purposes of the act, so I can't point to something specifically that limits a remedy that is not explicitly dealt with in the statute."
1993.91-1523,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,176.958,178.377,--than that.
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,184.571,186.853,"--Well, I would disagree with that."
1993.91-1523,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,186.853,189.423,The only thing you can do is to send the person to a public school.
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,190.645,199.021,"Well, the public aspect I think has two parts within the definition, one is that it be a public expense, and that is certainly possible, and the other... well, there's three, I guess."
1993.91-1523,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,207.536,212.231,"Well, you're willing to acknowledge that it doesn't have to be under public supervision, that that's not--"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,212.231,212.549,"Well, I--"
1993.91-1523,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,212.549,215.561,"--what free appropriate... what an appropriate public education means, right?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,215.561,219.144,"--Justice Scalia, I think it depends how you define public supervision."
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,241.009,288.7,"Mr. Ayer, you made, I think, a very helpful and candid concession in your reply brief in which you say there are situations that would be an exception to this strict Burlington requirement that it must be a place that is approved by the district, and I'd like to call your attention to page 9 of your reply brief where you said, in the second full paragraph, that the Court should not allow FAPE's educational standards and IEP requirement to foreclose unreasonably the pursuit of educational opportunity through the unilateral parent placement process recognized in Burlington."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,310.753,311.484,"Correct, Your Honor."
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,311.484,325.874,"And in this case there was no list supplied by the public school authorities as there was in Burlington, so why isn't that enough to make it exceptional?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,325.874,326.244,Well--
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,326.244,335.319,"Why shouldn't there be a burden on the public system to say to the parents, here is a list of approved private facilities?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,335.319,345.337,"--Your Honor, there's certainly nothing in the statute that dictates in what manner the public school authorities are required to be cooperative with the parents."
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,392.878,430.152,"So it comes down to who has the burden of inquiry, or it's a question of whether the public authority has to supply either a list or a procedure, and you say no, the parent has to ask, and if the parent doesn't ask, then there is effectively no recourse for the parent even though the very first step in this case is a given... that is, the public authority has not been able to provide the education that the statute requires."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,430.152,447.304,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'd like to take a couple of steps back, because I think you only get to the issue that you are raising, which is whether or not it is essentially not possible to accomplish not possible for the parents and the private school to accomplish the objective of the statute."
1993.91-1523,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,497.235,498.416,May I just interrupt you there?
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,542.846,550.66,"Well I have not, I have not heard, I have not seen or heard of that notion in the cases Justice Souter--"
1993.91-1523,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,557.946,575.887,"Let me, if I may interrupt you, do you claim that either of the conditions in question here, either the requirement of IEP or the requirement of teacher certification, is for the benefit of anyone other than the student?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,575.887,580.109,No I think it is for the benefits of the students.
1993.91-1523,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,580.109,597.063,"--So that if then the students or their parents say well we'll waive those so long as we can get, in fact, an adequate education elsewhere, why shouldn't they be allowed to waive them and why should their waiver be a bar to reimbursement?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,597.063,606.957,"--Well, I think this goes directly to the question of whether State educational authorities were intended under the act to be left in the primary role with regard to the making of educational policy."
1993.91-1523,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.957,607.838,Exactly.
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,636.099,656.241,"Your Honor, I think that what Congress intended to do was to create a mechanism that relied on essentially three different factors to assure the quality of education, and I don't think that they assumed that parents were in many... in most instances the best judges of what would be a quality education."
1993.91-1523,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,656.241,662.215,"Ah, the best judge is going to be the judge in a contested case for reimbursement afterwards, or if not the best judge, an adequate judge."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,668.608,682.137,"Well, it... the standard that is applied, as I was saying just now, there are three elements, essentially that the statute puts in place, and I would submit they work like the legs of a stool to elevate together the quality of education."
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,734.31,749.581,"Are you contending that the... that what went on at this Trident School... it wasn't an IEP, but there were, what was it, goal-settings, and I think more frequent reviews... that that wasn't a reasonable substitute?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,753.364,764.1,"Well, Your Honor, I think... I think it is perfectly clear from the court of appeals decision that the court of appeals did not view what went on at Trident as complying with the act, because it says explicitly that."
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,764.1,766.063,"It wasn't an IEP, but--"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,766.063,766.451,It wasn't an IEP.
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,766.451,777.738,"--there was a setting of goals for this student to achieve, and an evaluation whether the student... of the student's progress periodically, was there not?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,777.738,778.008,That's correct.
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,778.008,790.528,"And I'm asking you, in terms of quality, was it substantially less effective in measuring the child's progress than the IEP?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,790.528,799.744,"Well, what is missing from that, from what you've described, and I think, Your Honor, you have accurately described what is in the decisions in terms of what kind of process there is."
1993.91-1523,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.883,839.001,"Mr. Ayer, what does a parent... what is a parent supposed to do when a school district such as your client has failed to provide the IEP, the FAPE, and what the statute requires, but there happens to be no alternative school around that works via an IEP, and the parent finds the best school available, saying, you know, the school district has failed me, has violated the statute, I'm going to do the best I can for my kid--"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,839.001,839.281,Well--
1993.91-1523,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,839.281,846.614,"--and there happens to be no private school who is willing to go through all of the folderol of an IEP, or they think an IEP is really not the best way to do it?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,847.796,850.838,"--No, I don't think that's necessarily the case, Your Honor."
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,862.104,878.875,"Mr. Ayer, did I take it that your answer to the question I asked you before was that if these parents had inquired, if they had only inquired, tell us a school, and they got no answer, then you would say, yes, then they would be entitled to reimbursement?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,878.875,879.306,Well--
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,879.306,892.254,"So does the whole thing come down to whether the State has to provide them with a list, or a process, to find out what would be an acceptable school, or whether the parents have to initiate the inquiry in the first place?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,892.254,912.949,"--I don't think it comes down to that, Your Honor, I think the first issue must be whether the holding of the court of appeals decision, which is that the free appropriate public education requirement is entirely inapplicable in the Burlington context, with the one exception of the requirement that the education provide educational benefit."
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,912.949,919.602,"Well, let me ask you the question in a different way, and if I... this is the way I see it, and if I'm wrong please tell me."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,932.53,934.801,In this case?
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,937.933,938.303,In this case.
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,948.511,949.441,Well--
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,949.441,952.122,--for the default on the part of the public school system?
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,952.122,960.868,"--The parents have the right to remove the child, as was indicated from... in Burlington, to remove the child from the public school and find an alternative placement."
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,962.41,963.242,And that's what these parents did.
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,963.242,974.578,"--The issue here is whether the parents, in doing so, the parents nonetheless are governed by the requirement of the act and the primary purpose of the act, which was to... is to achieve a free appropriate public education."
1993.91-1523,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,974.578,983.093,"Well, let's go back to the purpose again, because I don't think you've answered one of the questions that we keep asking, and that is, for whose benefit are these conditions which collectively make up the purpose?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1013.974,1016.296,It is primarily to benefit the children.
1993.91-1523,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1016.296,1027.092,"Isn't that a relevant fact, then, in deciding to what extent those conditions may be waived and to what extent they may be waived consistently with the purpose of the statute?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1027.092,1044.374,"It is a relevant fact, Your Honor, I think first with regard to the requirement of meeting State standards, that whereas the primary purpose is to benefit the children, a secondary purpose which is made explicit in the statute and which this court has recognized is to leave State authorities as the primary authorities in determining educational standards."
1993.91-1523,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1047.194,1049.426,What if you can't satisfy each of them?
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1051.599,1054.36,"I don't think... I think that's a false hypothesis, Your Honor."
1993.91-1523,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1054.991,1062.165,"Well, it is... it is if you are correct that the conditions are in effect enforceable conditions without any possibility of waiver."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1062.165,1062.896,"--That... well, I--"
1993.91-1523,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1062.896,1067.427,But that in effect assumes the answer to the question that is before the Court.
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1067.427,1090.572,"--I think on the IEP requirement that the statute... any fair reading of the statute does not contemplate that in a usual setting in a public school that if the parents and the teachers sit down and parents and the school authorities sit down and they say, well, now, we're going to be funding this under the IDEA, but you'd just as soon not do an IEP, wouldn't you?"
1993.91-1523,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1103.842,1108.246,"Mr. Ayer, a little while ago you told... started to tell us about a three-legged stool."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1108.246,1108.584,--Yes.
1993.91-1523,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1108.584,1110.136,You told us what the first two legs are--
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1110.136,1110.397,"Well, I--"
1993.91-1523,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1110.397,1111.286,--but you never got to the third.
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1111.286,1111.707,"--Well, the--"
1993.91-1523,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.707,1112.257,Would you tell me what it is?
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1112.257,1112.628,--Yes.
1993.91-1523,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.455,1123.704,I forgot the first two already.
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1124.806,1140.116,"--The first two legs, Your Honor, were the requirement that the education meet State educational standards, the second was that it be provided in compliance with the IEP requirement, and the third is that it be ""appropriate""."
1993.91-1523,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.347,1220.188,"Of course, you're... go on."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1251.147,1253.811,"You mean, before Burlington was decided?"
1993.91-1523,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.811,1254.15,Yeah.
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1254.15,1258.363,"I can't tell you what I would be... I wasn't involved in that case, and I don't know what I'd be arguing."
1993.91-1523,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1259.504,1280.81,"Isn't the logic essentially the same, and I mean, I don't see how you can argue in the face of Burlington consistently with the Burlington logic that these provisions are so obviously nonwaivable, or nonmalleable, and as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, I thought in your reply brief you were conceding as much."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1280.81,1288.373,"Well, I would just again ask the question, do we believe that they are waivable in the context of a public school placement?"
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1288.373,1311.217,"You told me that if... that this would be a different case if these parents had inquired of the school system, is there a place that satisfies your requirement where we can put our child, and you said that what the case comes down to is that the parents failed to make that inquiry."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1311.217,1313.969,"Your Honor, I did not mean to say it would come out a different way."
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1316.681,1326.738,"Does this school district have either a list of approved places or, does it have a procedure that parents can use to find out?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1326.738,1337.514,"It doesn't have a list, and whether or not it has a procedure in terms of a way that parents could get that information, we don't know, and the reason we don't know is that any effort was... no effort was taken."
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1338.646,1340.065,Why shouldn't it be--
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1340.065,1340.446,--and ask the question.
1993.91-1523,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1340.446,1353.355,"--if the school district is in default because it has not provided the required education, why shouldn't it be incumbent on the school system to show that indeed it has a procedure?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1370.416,1395.173,"Well, I think... this is a case where what occurred was that, while the review process under the statute was going forward, the parents, completely on their own and without any conversation with the school, and without telling the school district authorities that they were doing it before they did it, they took the... they applied to the Trident School, they took the child out of the school, and they put her into the Trident School, so that this is not a situation where the--"
1993.91-1523,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1395.173,1396.523,They took a big risk in doing that.
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1435.028,1435.358,--Well--
1993.91-1523,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.358,1443.105,"--You know, the school board had its chance, decided not to provide these services, and it seems to me it falls back into the lap of the parent."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1443.105,1448.718,"--Your Honor, I think that's... I think it's a bit of an oversimplification to say that they decided not to provide the services."
1993.91-1523,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1465.459,1474.154,"Well, Mr. Ayer, we take this case on the assumption that the public school failed to provide the free appropriate public school education."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1475.604,1475.845,--That's correct.
1993.91-1523,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1475.845,1486.232,"And in those circumstances, does it boil down, in effect, to whether the courts below abused their discretion in ordering the remedy they did?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1488.753,1491.325,"Well, you can case it as an abuse of discretion."
1993.91-1523,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1527.228,1544.329,"Well, it could well be that there is language under the opinion that goes further than perhaps you think it should, but at bottom you have a judgment in favor of reimbursement of these parents, and do we review that on an abuse of discretion standard?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1544.329,1550.093,I... it is ultimately a question of whether discretion has been abused.
1993.91-1523,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.093,1557.669,"Well, Mr. Ayer, I thought your position was that if the school in which the child is placed does not meet the State standard, there's no reimbursement, period."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1562.292,1567.114,The general rule is that the education that's going to be publicly funded must meet the standards of a free appropriate--
1993.91-1523,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1567.114,1568.776,"--If it doesn't, there's no reimbursement to the parents."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1569.858,1572.608,"--That's the general rule, and the only exception to that, I think, is going to be--"
1993.91-1523,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1572.608,1577.442,"Well, not only the general rule, that's the rule you say the statute requires, as I understand it, in all cases."
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1586.428,1597.545,"--Well, I think we do recognize the possibility that where there's... as in Honig, where there's a substantial showing that accomplishing the purposes of the act is not going to be possible, or has been prevented--"
1993.91-1523,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1597.545,1615.146,"Well, do you think this case would be any different if before making the placement the parents had gone to the school authorities and said, we propose to put the child in this particular school, and they said, well, you know, there are two teachers there that aren't certified, and we, of course, have put some of our placements there, but we want you to know that there are two uncertified teachers?"
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1616.488,1616.858,--It might well.
1993.91-1523,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1628.325,1631.427,The school's position was that the program at its school was sufficient.
1993.91-1523,0,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1633.579,1644.886,"But they also... they also understood, Justice Stevens, that they have obligations under Burlington, that there are Burlington rights, and I think it's really unreasonable to think that school districts are simply going to ignore the fact that parents have these rights."
1993.91-1523,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1647.856,1649.108,"Very well, Mr. Ayer."
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,1650.368,1659.875,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.009,1757.85,"You say, would have."
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,1760.842,1761.022,--Absolutely.
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1761.392,1762.523,What the school board projected?
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,1762.523,1769.286,"The school board said, we will have you reading half... 5 months more, after a year's worth of intense special education program."
1993.91-1523,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1835.959,1841.673,The petitioner argues that there was a unilateral withdrawal and that the parents walked away from the process.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,1857.354,1861.357,--It was not an issue at either the due process hearing or the U.S. district court.
1993.91-1523,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1867.832,1871.422,--But that contention was never made below by the State in the trial court?
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,1871.422,1874.715,About... the issue of Trident not being--
1993.91-1523,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1874.715,1881.951,"That there would have been a likelihood, a realistic likelihood that an IEP would have been developed if the parents had remained in the process?"
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,1881.951,1882.84,"--No, sir."
1993.91-1523,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1883.641,1884.312,That was never contended.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,1884.312,1884.773,--It was never contended.
1993.91-1523,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1901.242,1913.571,"Mr. Wright, in view of the expense to the State, and it is quite expensive... what was the... how much per year, 30... over $30,000, was it?"
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,1913.571,1915.243,"Over 3 years it was $30,000."
1993.91-1523,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1923.418,1934.454,"In any event, it is an expense for the State we multiply many times if you prevail."
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,1959.951,1961.253,I think that's a proper burden.
1993.91-1523,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1961.253,1963.633,There parents didn't do that.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,1975.261,1985.579,"The record at the administrative due process hearing... not in the court of appeals, not in the joint appendix, but in the due process hearing, will show the parents said,"
1993.91-1523,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2007.813,2009.395,What was the State's response?
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2009.395,2014.317,"--Three hours a week is appropriate, 1/2-a-year's gain over a year is appropriate."
1993.91-1523,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2017.308,2023.433,"So you say that the inquiry that Mr. Ayer said might have made this case different, in fact happened?"
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2023.433,2024.913,Absolutely.
1993.91-1523,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2024.913,2027.036,As in the record of the administrative--
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2027.036,2030.877,"The due process hearing, the trial... the actual testimony before the administrative hearing officer."
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2030.877,2032.9,--Is that record part of our record?
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2032.9,2045.286,"It's... it was a part, of course, of the trial court's record, the U.S. district court judge, and parts of the due process testimony are within the court of appeals joint appendix."
1993.91-1523,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.967,2066.259,"What is it that's in the transcript, that they told them they were going to place the child at Trident?"
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2066.259,2067.311,"No, sir."
1993.91-1523,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2070.494,2072.603,They asked whether these three schools might be proper placement.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2072.603,2076.597,"--we want self-contained, 3 hours a week are not adequate, our daughter needs total immersion."
1993.91-1523,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2110.238,2112.121,"Well, what is the major city, Mr. Wright?"
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2112.121,2114.852,"--I believe it would be Florence, South Carolina."
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2114.852,2130.804,"But in fairness, Mr. Wright, at that hearing the issue between the school board and these parents was still whether 3 hours a week is enough or not, whether you need a self-contained program, or whether 3 hours a week would be enough."
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2143.29,2144.943,"Well, no, it did go beyond that."
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2149.374,2157.121,"But the school district said, none of these schools is any good, not because the schools are not qualified, but simply because we insist that 3 hours a week is enough."
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2159.753,2159.953,That's correct.
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2159.953,2160.333,Okay.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2160.333,2163.415,"In other words, they put blinders on to anything beyond 3 hours a week."
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2163.415,2174.703,"So there was never really put to the school district the question, assuming... assuming that I don't believe you, what other schools would you recommend?"
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2176.542,2176.712,That's correct.
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.712,2182.076,--to accept the recommendations of people who already thought that 3 hours a week for this child was enough.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2186.35,2194.695,"Not in quite those words, but why can't daughter go down the road to District 1 and why can't you simply pay District 1, what you--"
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.695,2197.176,"The response to that was, she doesn't need any more than 3 hours a week."
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2197.176,2197.456,--Exactly.
1993.91-1523,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2197.827,2198.398,Mr.--
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2228.436,2234.93,"I think they would, given the assumption, as a part of your question, that the school system said here is our list of approved schools."
1993.91-1523,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2234.93,2239.104,"Well, and should the parents have an obligation to inquire, do you have a list?"
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2239.104,2239.425,Yes.
1993.91-1523,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2263.49,2264.459,Now--
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2271.855,2275.476,"--Well, needless to say, those aren't the facts in this case, and there is a--"
1993.91-1523,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2275.476,2278.0,"Well, I understood... and maybe... I don't want to unduly complicate it."
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2301.993,2314.943,"--That's a difficult question, as you're perhaps aware, the Second Circuit has wrestled with, the Fifth Circuit has wrestled with, and if this preexisting list in fact is not appropriate as a matter of true fact, what do parents do?"
1993.91-1523,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2329.973,2332.284,"Well, you don't ask me, but I was asking you--"
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2332.455,2332.735,"Yes, sir."
1993.91-1523,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2332.735,2338.337,"--whether your position would be the same, and I thought you were going to tell me that it would be."
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2338.337,2357.241,"Well, Your Honor, I think that in one of the friend-of-the-court briefs that was filed by the Maryland Disability Law Center, they synthesized what the problems were with, for example, there's a case, Jack Strothy, where there was... the schools on the list were obviously absolutely inappropriate, and the trial district court judge said, my hands are tied."
1993.91-1523,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2362.524,2366.858,"Well, doesn't the principle that you contend for today untie his hands?"
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2389.712,2408.483,"--I can only respond... I can't respond any better than perhaps the Carrington court did and Alamo Heights, saying that you have to balance on a case-by-case basis the cooperativeness of the parents, whether or not the school system truly defaulted under their obligations--"
1993.91-1523,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2408.483,2416.451,Where does that leave the school district if you have to balance in every single case the... there would be no certainty as to what anyone's obligations were.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2416.451,2435.211,"--There would be problems with it, absolutely, and hopefully what that would then result would be school systems back, for example, with Shannon Carter in '83, when they have a learning disabled child doing good quality work at that point, making a finding, saving dollars by providing appropriate education then, or in '85 when the parents requested a more comprehensive--"
1993.91-1523,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2435.211,2440.936,"Well, that's not going to obviate the need for some sort of certainty, if those early trials wont work out."
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2440.936,2444.077,"--Yes, sir, it's created--"
1993.91-1523,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2444.077,2458.418,"Mr. Wright, are you saying, at least in... there was no list, there was no process disclosed to you, so in the absence of those, this case doesn't have to go to the further question suppose there had been a list and it wasn't adequate?"
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2458.418,2460.019,--That's exactly what I'm saying here.
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2470.734,2471.605,But you didn't even ask.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2483.393,2486.225,"Parents, I don't believe... the answer's no."
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2486.225,2488.037,But you didn't ask anybody for anything.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2496.112,2497.522,The parents did not do that.
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2501.414,2504.336,What's the magic difference between a list or no list?
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2505.788,2515.563,"--The burden would be to the school system, when they knew parents were seeking Trident, to say, well, if you want approval for Trident, here is the procedure that has to be followed, here are the requirements."
1993.91-1523,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2533.857,2537.59,"But the burden of coming forward should be on the one who has the evidence, that's essentially your position--"
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2537.59,2540.471,"--Not the one who has the evidence, the one who is in the better position."
1993.91-1523,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2540.471,2540.752,--Right.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2540.752,2541.089,The one who's educated.
1993.91-1523,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2541.089,2542.01,Right.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2542.01,2544.312,That would be my position.
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.312,2553.979,"Even though you're still taking the position that you don't have a right to go to any school, you expect them to come forward... you don't have a right to any other school because 3 hours enough."
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2556.781,2558.113,It becomes a--
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2558.113,2559.482,--This is contrary to human nature.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2563.656,2577.805,"--And if they don't give a list and parents then obtain a placement that later is determined to be appropriate, and the public school's program is inadequate, the school is a master of their own destiny, they saw fit not to provide this list, then the parents should not be held accountable for that."
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.638,2587.661,I think once you concede that you're bound by a list that the schools posts your case becomes a lot weaker.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2593.265,2595.386,I'm not here today arguing against lists per se.
1993.91-1523,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.386,2597.416,I know that.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2597.887,2601.07,But I think that's a difficult part of the entire case.
1993.91-1523,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2610.657,2614.8,Isn't there... just refresh my recollection about one aspect of the facts.
1993.91-1523,1,38435,peter_w_d_wright,,2621.313,2621.673,That's correct.
1993.91-1523,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2663.1,2664.562,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2666.672,2677.75,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.91-1523,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.899,2793.645,"Of course, they always have an incentive to ask for a list anyway, or to select a school from a list that is provided, a very considerable incentive, don't they?"
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2800.251,2812.168,"Well, it certainly increases your chances of getting reimbursement, Justice Scalia, but part of our point is that just because you choose a school from a list doesn't mean you satisfy the substantive showing that it's appropriate for your child."
1993.91-1523,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2812.168,2813.578,Who would contest it?
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2818.123,2831.299,"On the contrary, Your Honor, I think they very well could contest it, because they don't want to provide reimbursement, and just because it's on the list, although it satisfies the particulars of the definition of a FAPE, it might not meet the substantive standard under Rowley for--"
1993.91-1523,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2831.299,2833.921,"I see, they would still contest the IEP--"
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2833.921,2834.132,--Exactly.
1993.91-1523,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2834.132,2837.924,"--and all of that, but they certainly couldn't come forward and say, this is a no-good school."
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2837.924,2851.383,"They couldn't come forward and say, it doesn't come forward and comply with the procedural and formal requirements, but under Rowley they could certainly try and come forward and say, this school is inappropriate in that it doesn't provide the sort of education that your child needs."
1993.91-1523,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2851.383,2854.465,"Well, they could continue to contest their own inadequacy."
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2854.465,2858.027,"Correct, and they could contest that, too, and those are the two elements of the inquiry."
1993.91-1523,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2926.493,2937.299,"Ms. Wax, we're going back now to the setting in the school system and not when we're in court talking about the parents' choice."
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2957.521,2964.317,"Your Honor, that overstates the statutory interest in having parents and school districts consult and confer."
1993.91-1523,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3097.815,3104.9,"So you are, in effect, asking us to disapprove... what was it, the Second Circuit?"
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3106.94,3107.27,Tucker.
1993.91-1523,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3107.27,3108.482,--you have to pick from the list?
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3108.482,3109.712,"Yes, we are, Your Honor."
1993.91-1523,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3157.975,3160.926,"Well, now, Ms. Wax, do you think there's no limit at all here?"
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3185.671,3187.493,"--Well, we don't agree--"
1993.91-1523,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3187.493,3188.572,That's your view?
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3188.933,3189.343,--No.
1993.91-1523,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3189.343,3195.118,--no cautionary concerns here at all?
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3195.118,3208.816,"We would distinguish between the availability of some reimbursement, okay, which we think should not be affected by the alternatives that might be available but should only be determined by whether this school that the parents chose meets the appropriate standard."
1993.91-1523,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3209.176,3213.741,"Well, do you think under the statutory scheme a court could deny full reimbursement?"
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3213.741,3214.63,"--No, we do not."
1993.91-1523,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3217.602,3218.553,"Well, that's what I'm asking you."
1993.91-1523,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3221.426,3238.636,"On equitable grounds because, it considering that the substantive standard of appropriateness is really a standard that sets a floor, and that therefore the court could say, well, since that floor is abided by, we can limit the amount to what the floor would cost."
1993.91-1523,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3238.636,3241.958,"Thank you, Ms. Wax."
1993.91-1523,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3244.459,3247.272,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.91-1523,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.272,3250.223,"Mr. Ayer, I hate to take part of it, but it's an important point to me."
1993.91-1523,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3262.161,3264.114,"Well, we weren't proposing to make up a list, Your Honor--"
1993.91-1523,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.114,3264.455,I didn't--
1993.91-1523,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3264.455,3268.465,"--but if someone were to make a list that reflected State standards, it would only reflect State standards."
1993.91-1523,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3268.465,3269.477,--Not cost.
1993.91-1523,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3269.477,3272.198,"Well, that list would not, and you could have another list that would."
1993.91-1523,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3309.672,3310.012,Your time--
1993.91-1523,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3310.012,3310.683,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.91-1523,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3310.683,3311.524,"--Your time has expired, Mr. Ayer."
