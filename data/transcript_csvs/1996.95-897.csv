1996.95-897,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.577,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-897, Francis Bernard Auer v. David Robbins."
1996.95-897,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,51.766,78.843,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.255,138.954,I've noticed with interest that the Federal Government does not follow the salary basis test for employees that are under the jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management.
1996.95-897,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,141.428,144.422,"Well, it attempted to choose not to go along with that at all."
1996.95-897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.557,199.871,And now are all Federal employees applying this salary basis test?
1996.95-897,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,199.871,205.366,"--Well, first of all the court of claims found that to be the case."
1996.95-897,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.909,260.683,"But Justice O'Connor was not asking about court decisions, she was asking about the position being taken by the executive branch--"
1996.95-897,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,260.683,261.074,I believe the--
1996.95-897,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,261.074,263.615,--and in fact... and OPM takes a different--
1996.95-897,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,263.615,263.815,--Right.
1996.95-897,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,263.815,264.696,"--view from Labor, doesn't it?"
1996.95-897,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,264.696,270.26,The Office of Personnel Management takes the position that Federal employees can be exempted based on pay classification alone.
1996.95-897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,344.859,352.946,"Well, they also have a regulation saying the Federal Government can dismiss or suspend employees for 14 days or less."
1996.95-897,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,352.946,354.385,--Right.
1996.95-897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,354.385,355.467,By way of discipline.
1996.95-897,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,355.467,384.386,"They have a regulation to... yes, that's true, they do, and in the... and the... that raises the question of whether that would make all Federal employees subject to that rule, which doesn't cover all Federal employees, but I think it covers all Federal employees in the Classified Service, nonexempt, and I think that is part of the struggle the Department of Labor has had, and that is why the Department of Labor has had the practical rule to the longstanding salary basis test, and I think I can explain how the practical rule I think works."
1996.95-897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,469.183,486.487,"Well, of course, here you're asserting, I guess, that because of one instance involving one sergeant that all the other people who have never been disciplined fall under some nonexempt status."
1996.95-897,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,486.487,488.267,--I am... I am--
1996.95-897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,488.267,498.394,"Just on the basis of some possibly broader State rule applicab... or a county rule, or police department rule here."
1996.95-897,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,498.394,514.293,"--I'm asserting that all sergeants and lieutenants in the St. Louis Police Department whose pay is contingent and who all the witnesses, including the chief of police, including all... everyone who testified, no one ever testified that any sergeant or lieutenant's pay was not subject to discipline."
1996.95-897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,526.063,531.897,"Well, that's what it looks like, because it didn't happen to anybody else in the numerous plaintiffs here, did it?"
1996.95-897,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,531.897,538.428,"--It... I'm sorry, it didn't... there is evidence in the record that it did happen to other sergeants, in fact, and in fact it did happen to other sergeants."
1996.95-897,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1483.907,1506.27,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-897,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1540.555,1555.564,"Would that more than theoretical possibility be satisfied in an instance in which the employer had promulgated the manual solely to salaried employees, and yet nonetheless provided as to them that there would be these impermissible dockings."
1996.95-897,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1557.247,1565.193,"I would say that if you just had that you could reach that conclusion, Justice Souter, subject to whatever the employer might show in response to that."
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2065.739,2074.625,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2148.723,2150.646,"Well, he could say that's not my fault, that's the Secretary's fault."
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2152.096,2152.486,Well--
1996.95-897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.486,2153.728,"I mean, we'll blame it on him."
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2153.728,2157.281,--We think that that shows that that interpretation really doesn't make sense.
1996.95-897,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2157.281,2172.428,"Well, would you agree that if you had a manual that applied only to salaried employees, and specifically provided for discipline that would be inconsistent with salaried status, that that would be enough to preclude salaried status?"
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2172.428,2179.143,"If the discipline... if the manual was worded in such a way that discipline was mandatory, I would agree with you, Justice Souter."
1996.95-897,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2179.143,2194.585,"Well, I... wouldn't... wouldn't we be entitled to act on the assumption that the manual was not a totally nugatory exercise and that, in at least some instances, consistently with the manual, discipline would be applied?"
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2197.396,2199.577,"Yes, but I still--"
1996.95-897,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2199.577,2213.805,"I mean, your argument has to say... it seems to me seems to be, even when they specifically say they will do and are entitled to do what is inconsistent with salaried status, we won't take them at their word."
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2216.04,2234.694,"--What I'm saying is, and I think the Secretary of Labor has agreed with our position, is that... is that as... you have to look at what actual experience... the best evidence is what is the actual experience in the application of whatever manual... if you have a manual or not, what has actually happened, and the evidence in this case is very clear."
1996.95-897,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2287.118,2290.541,"--Oh, I quite agree, but that's not the case that I put to you in the question."
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2290.541,2317.349,"Well, I think I'm agreeing with you if you have a manual that says this is specifically applicable to exempt employees, or functionally exempt, and it provides that penalties will be imposed for certain forms of misconduct that would be periods of less than a week, if you accept the Secretary's interpretation of the salary basis test, then I would agree with you."
1996.95-897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.349,2319.281,But the Secre... but penalties may be imposed.
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2322.524,2341.557,"Well, I think then you have to look at the practice, because I think as one of the justices earlier pointed out, I think you... where there are a range of penalties, as there are in this case, there's no reason to assume that the employer is going to choose a new proper penalty and thereby convert all of his or her salaried employees to nonexempt employees."
1996.95-897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2341.557,2356.319,"Well, you know, all the text of the regulation says is not which amount must be reduced because of variations in the quality or... it says which amount is not subject to reduction, and you know, subject to reduction doesn't mean will certainly be reduced."
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2356.319,2357.459,Well--
1996.95-897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2357.459,2374.839,"It just means it's subject to reduction, and as I understood the exception is, if that thing is just a paper tiger, that in fact it is never used, that's one thing, but if it's even used in one case, it seems to me that's enough to show that it's for real."
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2374.839,2399.046,"--Well, but the state of the record here, Justice Scalia, is that in the period between 1979, when the statute was amended, and the time we went to trial in 1993, not one witness came forth to testify that he or she had been subjected to a disciplinary proceeding initiated by the department, by the police department, based on a variation, which is the word in the interpretation, on a variation in the quality or quantity of work."
1996.95-897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.386,2399.767,"Of course, the burden's on the employer."
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2399.767,2400.097,--Not one appears.
1996.95-897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2400.097,2403.79,The burden's on the employer here to show that nobody had.
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2403.79,2404.341,The employer--
1996.95-897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2404.341,2407.764,"Did anyone come in on behalf of the employer and say, nobody has?"
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2407.764,2421.986,"--The employer prevailed on the salary test on partial summary judgment prior to the trial, and the record shows that I queried the trial judge both at the beginning and at the end of my presentation to ensure that that issue was no longer in the case."
1996.95-897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2421.986,2430.243,"Do you claim to have established at trial that nobody had, that nobody had been subjected to this disqualifying kind of discipline?"
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2430.243,2435.966,At the trial there was no evidence to that effect because we had prevailed on partial summary judgment prior to trial.
1996.95-897,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2435.966,2437.046,"Okay, but it seems to me that's your burden."
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2437.046,2448.235,The trial judge found that we met that burden when he ruled in a pretrial ruling which granted partial summary judgment on the salary basis issue and took that out of the case.
1996.95-897,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2448.235,2452.967,May I ask you to just address the one thing that I find a little puzzling?
1996.95-897,2,32509,john_b_renick,,2463.015,2465.196,"Well, I think there are a couple of reasons for that."
