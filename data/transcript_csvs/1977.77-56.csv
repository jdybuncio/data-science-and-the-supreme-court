1977.77-56,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,60.721,"We will hear arguments next in the matter of Edna Smith, the appellant, 77-56."
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,64.211,67.712,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.77-56,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,207.195,222.31,Would you suggest that the right to face-to-face solicitation is co-extensive with the right to advertise and announce the fees which will be charged for a particular service?
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,222.31,237.285,"Certainly not co-extensive, but to the extent that the same interests of providing information for informed decision making by the person to whom the information is directed."
1977.77-56,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,245.015,267.275,"Do you suggest that a face-to-face solicitation by an trained lawyer on the one hand and the untrained layman, untrained at least in the law, presents the same arm’s length factors as an announcement in the paper of a schedule of fees?"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,267.275,280.698,"Well, in the first place, I think I should point out that in this case the conduct which is alleged to be solicitation, the letter which was written by Ms. Smith, was not a face-to-face confrontation of that sort."
1977.77-56,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,280.698,284.357,I was beginning by relating it to the case which we just heard argued.
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,284.357,298.293,"Right and with respect to it, I think that clearly anytime there is a face-to-face confrontation, there are other factors operating that are not operating in a written communication."
1977.77-56,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,298.293,304.997,Do you think the written letter is equated roughly to the announcement in the newspaper?
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,304.997,312.544,I think it is closer to that certain event than an in-person solicitation.
1977.77-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,467.501,476.651,"In this case Mr. McClain, your client pursued a little more aggressively than in Button, did she not?"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,491.906,495.424,"The record does not really reflect that, Your Honor."
1977.77-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,521.416,532.136,It is clear though that your client did make a second attempt to persuade the litigant to file a suit?
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,532.136,535.673,"I do not agree with that characterization of the letter, Your Honor."
1977.77-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,571.672,585.001,"Well, putting to one side the characterization of the letter which maybe subject to reasonable interpretations on both sides, that follow-up letter is a fact that was not present in Button, is it not?"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,585.001,591.342,"To my knowledge, in fact, that was actually probably one of the problems in Button."
1977.77-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,599.638,604.505,"Well, was there or were there not evidence of follow-up letters in Button?"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,604.505,608.739,"To my knowledge, I know of none."
1977.77-56,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,608.739,617.894,I am not sure whether your colloquy with Mr. Justice Rehnquist refers to the letter which I thought was the only letter.
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,636.662,638.6,"That is the letter we are talking about, Your Honor."
1977.77-56,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,767.156,781.608,"Mr. McClain, would the theory of your case be different if your client had been an ACLU lawyer who would have tried the case had the solicitation been successful?"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,781.608,786.296,I do not believe that there is a distinction in the Button case.
1977.77-56,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,795.528,800.524,And you stand on Button on that particular point?
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,800.524,804.429,I think that this case is less extreme than Button.
1977.77-56,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,804.429,807.607,Can I have one step further?
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,834.131,842.769,"I believe, Your Honor, that the distinction between commercial and non-commercial speech is a much narrow one."
1977.77-56,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,853.699,861.441,"So even if there were a fee interest in the damage recovery, you would not regard that as commercial speech?"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,861.441,884.903,"I do not believe that makes it commercial speech and that has been true in the pornography and obscenity area and that has been true in many cases before this Court, that there is a financial element, does not make the speech per se commercial, as I read the opinions."
1977.77-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,884.903,886.981,Then what does make it commercial?
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,886.981,891.785,"If the only purpose is commercial, as in the case that was just argued before ours, then it is commercial speech."
1977.77-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.785,901.036,"So if a drug store had a sale, “if you bought one cake of soap, you get a second cake free,” that would not be commercial for the second cake of soap?"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,901.036,904.084,"I would certainly think that is commercial speech, Your Honor."
1977.77-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.084,919.558,"Is it not any offering of goods or services at any price commercial in the general sense of the word as contrasted to the other kinds of speech, social, economic, political, or religious?"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,919.558,938.612,"I think that the offer of goods or services to the individual who is offering for compensation, I do not think the offer of free services, for example, would fairly be characterized as commercial."
1977.77-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,969.66,971.844,"Mr. McClain, I do not think that distinction could holdup."
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,986.592,993.62,Would the attorney in that case be looking to seek to get an award of fees from the defendant on some?
1977.77-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,993.62,998.665,"Yes, from the corporation, -- it is just like they were here, as in this case."
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,998.665,1006.774,I think it is really different because when you are looking to get compensation from a corporation in which the person holds a stock.
1977.77-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.774,1020.681,"Let us say it is a class action instead of a derivative suit then, but they just want to get money, and would the mere fact that there would be no charge unless the litigation was successful make it not commercial speech, is that your position?"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1021.829,1030.126,"No, sir, not unless it were successful, but just the fact that there would be no charge to the litigation was my position."
1977.77-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.126,1034.808,No charge to the person being solicited for the litigation.
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1042.192,1044.976,"No, sir, not at the time the letter was written, I do not believe the record supports that."
1977.77-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.976,1047.508,"It is a suit for damages, it was described as a suit for damages."
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1047.508,1049.037,That is correct.
1977.77-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1058.763,1068.274,Do we not have to accept that the state Court’s view of the matter that it was contemplated that the fee would be paid to the ACLU and that would be dollars?
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1068.274,1070.767,That might be ordered by the Court.
1977.77-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1070.767,1076.503,"Yes, just like the damages would be ordered by the Court."
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1076.503,1094.362,"But in a different sense, -- one important factor is that, for example, the record does not support any notion that Ms. Smith new that the ACLU would ask for attorney’s fees in connection with any litigation."
1977.77-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.362,1095.91,Do you not think that is a reasonable inference?
1977.77-56,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.91,1097.606,"What if it did, what would that violate?"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1097.606,1098.917,"Sir, I am sorry?"
1977.77-56,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.917,1103.546,What if it did then what would that violate?
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1103.546,1116.253,I am just making the point Your Honor that the record in this case does not reflect that Ms. Smith was acting in a fashion to get money for the ACLU.
1977.77-56,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1116.253,1117.494,What if she were?
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1117.494,1118.726,I think it is protected.
1977.77-56,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.726,1126.275,She was charged with aiding an organization to promote her legal services with that of her associate.
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1129.791,1139.31,"Well, one of the things that the state Court relied on was the possibility of financial benefit to the organization, making it a non-exempt organization."
1977.77-56,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1143.451,1151.9,But I have understood that all of this colloquy was directed at whether this was commercial or non-commercial speech.
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1155.937,1161.177,"I believe that is the way it started out, Your Honor."
1977.77-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1191.194,1195.845,"When you say substantial civil liberties litigation, what do you mean?"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1198.929,1203.858,The constitutional or possibly a statutory right protecting civil liberties.
1977.77-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1203.858,1210.64,How does one know the contours of that if you include within it statutory rights?
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1210.64,1235.827,"For example, there are a number of statues which are deemed to enforce provisions of the Bill of Rights or interests related to the Bill of Rights, certain provision of the Omnibus Crime Control Act involving electronic eves dropping or aimed at the same interests that are protected by the Fourth Amendment."
1977.77-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1235.827,1244.89,What about a state statute that gives you a right of action against someone who deliberately runs you down in a car for personal damages?
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1246.854,1252.836,"No, sir, that is not."
1977.77-56,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1252.836,1257.465,"What is the difference between that and the sterilization, which is a bad form of battery, I guess?"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1257.465,1281.692,"Well, the issue that was raised in the related litigation on behalf of other women who had been sterilized by this doctor, making that a condition a receipt of governmentally supported services, violated the Federal Civil Rights Act 1983 and 1985."
1977.77-56,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1281.692,1286.737,"I was under the impression, maybe I have a wrong view of the record, that this doctor did these services free at this, that is not --"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1286.737,1287.451,That is not correct.
1977.77-56,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1287.451,1288.794,"That is not, I see."
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1293.231,1304.179,The patients were Medicaid patients and the doctor would accept them as Medicaid patients only if they would accept sterilization.
1977.77-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1315.959,1319.272,They were these raw maternity cases?
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1319.272,1320.516,"With respect with this doctor, that is correct."
1977.77-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.516,1328.831,"They were Medicaid cases of pregnant women and the expenses were in connection with the birth of their children, is that it?"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1328.831,1330.197,"That is my understanding, Your Honor."
1977.77-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1330.197,1341.584,"And after the second or third, I guess it was the third child, he said “no, I will not be your physician anymore unless you agree to be sterilized.”"
1977.77-56,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1341.584,1352.455,"That is my understanding of that record, I was not involved in that case myself."
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2056.44,2072.703,"Yes, sir, Mr. Justice White, it is, of course, our claim that the conduct in this case did violate DR2-103D and I think it is important to look at the South Carolina Supreme Court's --"
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.703,2076.761,"Well, you can just tell me, how did it?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2076.761,2109.059,"It violated the disciplinary rule because it recommended the services of the ACLU which has as members cooperating attorneys, both Ms. Smith’s private law partners, one was a staff attorney for the ACLU and the other one was a cooperating attorney, both of which were participants in the subsequent litigation that arose out of these events."
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.059,2119.605,You think that she was aiding an organization to promote her services or an associate’s service.
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2119.605,2122.348,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.348,2126.651,"The associate was not a law partner, I take it."
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2126.651,2130.045,The associate was not a law partner of the firm?
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.045,2136.123,Yes.
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2136.123,2137.651,I do not quite understand what you mean by that.
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2137.651,2141.679,"They were sharing expenses and keeping their own fees, that is what the finding is."
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2141.679,2145.68,"Yes, sir. The court and counsel --"
1977.77-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2145.68,2151.429,Do you say that brings them within the definition of associates?
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2151.429,2151.704,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2166.015,2169.729,Do they have to be partners to get within 103D or is also their --
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2169.729,2170.062,"No, sir."
1977.77-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2425.223,2426.641,Where do we find that?
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2426.641,2429.634,That is at Page 57 of the Appendix.
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.331,2464.162,"Mr. Kale, may I just ask one question here."
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2477.193,2482.601,"Your Honor, we do not believe it would be."
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.359,2489.314,"No, sir."
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2522.9,2530.157,"Your Honor, I can only refer to the decision of the South Carolina Supreme Court."
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.631,2556.624,"Well, if that is so and if the ACLU did not decide to provide free legal services for this person until after the first meeting, how could the ACLU communicate that information to that person?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2559.751,2570.917,"Your Honor, I do not think it is necessary that the organization state to the potential client that they desire to bring it."
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.829,2589.046,"Well, what I am saying -- supposing the first meeting was a little more inconclusive -- assume the first meeting is legal advice about a potential lawsuit and nothing about financing or willingness to participate and then the lawyer goes home."
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2598.756,2612.987,"Your Honor, under my reading of the disciplinary rules, they would not be able to communicate the letter even if they had not advised her in the July meeting."
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2612.987,2616.711,"Then, there is just no way that that information could be communicated to the potential client."
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2622.119,2625.421,Not through personal solicitation.
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2625.421,2636.273,"Would you say the same if the writer of the letter is an employee of the American Civil Liberties Union, a hired lawyer or a paid staff member?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2636.273,2636.586,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2639.729,2642.416,You do not think that is covered by Button?
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2642.416,2646.887,"No, sir."
1977.77-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2771.257,2778.877,Can you decide this case on the basis of how you feel about particular kinds of lawsuits?
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2783.215,2797.091,"Your Honor, I think it would be difficult to draw a disciplinary rule that distinguished between a conduct on the basis of the type of lawsuit that was brought."
1977.77-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2823.569,2837.361,"How about Rule 10-B5, for example that certainly encourages litigation between an established relationship of a client and a stockbroker?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2856.688,2861.573,"Your Honor, I think you can if it is a private relationship."
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2943.591,2964.416,"If the legal department of a Union writes to one of its members recommending that the members start litigation with respect to something that has happened to them, would that be proscribed by these rules or the Union is not the kind of an organization that is covered by the rule?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,2964.416,2982.368,"Your Honor, I think the rules in question specifically have excluded the Court’s line of decision in the Union cases, where collective activities to members to attain access to the legal system has been protected."
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3022.756,3029.025,"But if the Union were involved, I suppose its lawyers could make recommendations to its members."
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3029.025,3032.104,"Yes, sir, to its members."
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3032.104,3033.505,"But, not to outsiders?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3033.505,3035.198,"No, sir."
1977.77-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3035.198,3052.672,Was there not something in Justice Black’s opinion to the effect that this was embraced within the services that the Union members were receiving in exchange for their dues to have a lawyer experienced in these kinds of cases?
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3053.515,3059.357,I believe you are right Your Honor.
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3101.019,3118.023,"What rule would cover, if there is one, a direct solicitation by the ACLU, say that precedent of the ACLU, a non-lawyer wrote the same letter to this lady, would there be similarities?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3118.023,3120.751,"We can not prohibit a non-lawyer under the disciplinary rules, from doing anything."
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3120.751,3125.593,"Yes, but is there a statute that prohibits that kind of solicitation?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3125.593,3130.613,There is a statute in South Carolina prohibiting solicitation.
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3130.613,3134.053,Would it cover my example?
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3134.053,3135.76,"Your Honor, I cannot say for sure."
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3139.426,3145.889,"But if the organization uses a lawyer to solicit, it is covered under this rule?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3145.889,3147.009,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3152.26,3158.877,I take it you indicate there are other prohibitions about a non-lawyer soliciting business for lawyers.
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3158.877,3166.456,We have a criminal statute in the State of South Carolina which prohibits solicitation.
1977.77-56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3166.456,3168.909,Solicitation has a variety of meanings?
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3168.909,3171.858,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-56,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3173.604,3174.512,By a non-lawyer?
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3174.512,3177.999,"Yes, sir. [Laughter]"
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3177.999,3189.871,"Mr. Kale, the distinction between members and non-members, the Button case if I remember involves solicitation of litigation of non-members of the NAACP, did it not?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3189.871,3190.534,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3229.784,3236.127,How is that different from an ACLU program to put an end to sterilization?
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3236.127,3249.512,"Your Honor, we would maintain that the difference being that the action in desegregation cases were actions against government."
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.52,3267.921,"So they probably found no state action, but at the time of what we are describing as a solicitation, it was the view of the ACLU and its attorneys that there was a valid state action theory that they could proceed on, was it not?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3269.556,3280.949,"Your Honor, I think you would have to look at the view as far as the disciplinary actions of the appellant at the time she wrote the letter."
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3284.153,3288.258,...against the doctor on the theory that the doctor is acting Colorado state law.
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3288.258,3298.592,"If we have to go one step further and say “what happened in subsequent litigations, did we not envision an action against government?”"
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3333.357,3334.576,"But, why not?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3351.372,3358.79,"Your Honor, the difference is that of course I think, it interfered with a private relationship, obtaining a relationship --"
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3358.79,3365.819,"Imagine at the time of litigation, it grew out of the NAACP activities under quite a few private relationships."
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3365.819,3372.617,"Yes sir, but not the established type of relationship that you have between a doctor and his patient."
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3391.52,3394.044,"That does not turn on the kind of litigation then, that turns on --"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3394.044,3395.104,"No, sir."
1977.77-56,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3395.104,3397.378,-- on the kind of compensation.
1977.77-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3397.378,3419.209,"Well, Mr. Kale, with all respect to my colleagues and many here in the room, what is the difference for constitutional purposes between the relationship between a doctor and his patient or a lawyer and his client and the relationship between the Avon lady and the person she calls on to sell cosmetics to?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3419.209,3426.801,"Well, of course the Avon lady and her client is purely a commercial type of relationship."
1977.77-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3426.801,3430.194,"Yeah, ordinarily, I would think of her as a customer rather than a client."
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3430.194,3431.229,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3455.256,3460.606,So you say it heightens the state’s interest when you have this kind of professional relationship?
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3460.606,3462.091,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3462.091,3483.212,"Would the NAACP today violate this rule or the paid staff lawyers for the NAACP, if they wrote non-members of the NAACP suggesting litigation to cure some situation that the NAACP thinks should be cured?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3483.212,3492.877,"Your Honor, I do not believe the Court intended in NAACP v. Button to give the NAACP a complete blanket exemption from soliciting clients."
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3492.877,3493.426,What is your answer?
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3495.344,3495.64,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3497.082,3501.04,"Well, do you think it would or not?"
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3501.04,3505.87,What was the specific litigation they were soliciting?
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3505.87,3510.781,To a school suit.
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3510.781,3512.981,"Not a school suit, no, sir I think."
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3512.981,3514.484,What do you mean no school suit?
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3514.484,3516.601,Do you mean for desegregation?
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3516.601,3525.007,"Yes, the it wants to get specific individuals to bring the suit and they will represent them."
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3525.007,3532.21,"Then, I think you are of course getting very, almost in a factual situation in NAACP v. Button."
1977.77-56,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3532.21,3546.874,Even though the paid lawyer for the NAACP is writing a letter soliciting business or soliciting a lawsuit and the NAACP will profit from an attorney’s fee?
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3546.874,3566.525,"Well, Your honor, of course the type of conduct that was involved in the case before the Court in 1963 which the Court I think very closely stated that they were limiting their decision to the record on the Court."
1977.77-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3566.525,3586.356,We will resume there at 1 o'clock counsel.
1977.77-56,1,39645,richard_b_kale_jr,,3590.0,3593.658,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3657.957,3658.661,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
