1989.88-1281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.538,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1281, Alex Ngiraingas v. Francisco Sanchez."
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,16.623,19.735,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,211.735,218.84,Did the Court literally say in Monell that Section 1983 was to give... to be given the broadest possible construction?
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,218.84,222.093,"Well, maybe that is overstating it just a bit."
1989.88-1281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,222.093,222.784,"It's a strange view, certainly."
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,226.617,229.88,"Well, the broadest construction consistent with the terms used."
1989.88-1281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,241.807,247.691,"Well, the broadest possible construction, I suppose, would include states."
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,247.691,251.684,I think there is an argument to be made for that.
1989.88-1281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,295.555,309.854,"Well,... sort of a standard rule of construction that if you, if you intend to include a sovereign or a state you ought to say so."
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,309.854,318.448,The rule of construction I think Justice White is referring to is that person does not ordinarily include the sovereign.
1989.88-1281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.073,363.118,You mean territories are just subject to tort suits despite the territorial legislature saying they are immune?
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,365.629,372.194,--They have sovereign immunity from territorial... from acts arising on the territorial law in territorial courts.
1989.88-1281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,372.194,373.135,Why do they have that?
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,373.135,380.831,Based on this Court's decision in Polyblank that the logical and practical--
1989.88-1281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,380.831,383.363,"Well, that's a long-standing tradition, isn't it?"
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,383.363,384.275,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1989.88-1281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,384.275,392.599,But you say 1983 wasn't... didn't have to respect that kind of immunity.
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,392.599,403.425,"I'm saying that it is illogical to consider that Congress would have intended to immunize a territory, which is a creature of Federal law, from an act of Federal law."
1989.88-1281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,439.552,443.685,What about our decision in District of Columbia v. Carter?
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,452.04,469.252,"Because this acts on the color of... District of Columbia law were not included in... in the... in 1983 at that time, and this Court held that District... properly so, that the District of Columbia is neither a state or a territory."
1989.88-1281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,469.252,473.445,Whereas you say that Guam would be a territory.
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,473.445,473.926,Yes.
1989.88-1281,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,473.926,477.739,And you think Carter would come out differently now?
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,477.739,478.641,Yes.
1989.88-1281,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,478.641,481.593,Because 1983 now says territory?
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,481.593,487.358,"I think that's some evidence, although the cases obviously are not consistent in that regard."
1989.88-1281,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,541.856,546.448,And why aren't we bound by the Dictionary Act definition of persons?
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,546.448,549.63,"No, I believe this Court should be bound by that act."
1989.88-1281,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,549.63,555.715,Doesn't that suggest to us that territories are not persons?
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,555.715,561.278,"No, territories are bodies politic, as this Court has held in Puerto Rico v. Shell."
1989.88-1281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.278,563.7,That's the original form of the Dictionary Act.
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,563.7,566.22,"The 1871 version, yes."
1989.88-1281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.22,572.225,"And, as amended, what did it say?"
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,572.225,577.36,It said corporations and partnerships were substituted for--
1989.88-1281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,577.36,578.889,And you say that we shouldn't even look at that?
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,578.889,580.802,"--No, that was passed later."
1989.88-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.557,662.283,"On that line of reasoning they probably would have wanted it to apply to the states as well, in fact especially."
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,662.283,676.342,"Well, given the... given the constitutional immunity which this Court relied on... on... in Will, I think there is ample basis for the Court's decision in Will."
1989.88-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,676.342,687.188,"That was a decision not based on immunity, but based on the... the perceived intent of the Congress at the time."
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,687.188,687.288,Right.
1989.88-1281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.674,729.586,"Don't you think it is much more likely that the Reconstruction Congress would have been, would have been more concerned about states than it would have been... about constitutional violations by states than it would have been about constitutional violations by territories that are subject to the complete control of the Federal Government?"
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,729.586,734.932,There is no question that states were the main focus of the debates on Reconstruction.
1989.88-1281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.37,764.711,The people who were doing the violating wouldn't be immune in their individual capacity.
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,764.711,765.412,No.
1989.88-1281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,765.412,768.395,"So it's not really a haven, is it?"
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,768.395,777.691,"Well, if... if Section 1983 were not construed to apply in territories, and I suggest--"
1989.88-1281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.691,781.795,"Well, they would have to flee to the territory and then be elected to some office, wouldn't they?"
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,782.026,783.599,--Which might not be too hard.
1989.88-1281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,900.949,906.745,"But the territorial legislature could give the people everything that Section 1983 can give them, can't it?"
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,906.745,907.354,Yes.
1989.88-1281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,907.354,912.449,And yet the... the legislature doesn't realize that the people need this remedy?
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,912.449,912.89,No.
1989.88-1281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.89,918.724,What about... what about the people of the states?
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,918.724,922.494,"I think they are in the same position, frankly."
1989.88-1281,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,922.494,931.059,So we should give the people in the territory favored position as compared to the people of the states?
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,931.059,934.282,The states are the entities that have the favored position.
1989.88-1281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,934.282,942.55,"May I ask this question just to get it straightened out in my... in states of course you have a lot of cities you can sue, municipal corporations."
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,945.822,953.138,"There are local villages, but the only village officer is what... is a mayor, and he essentially has no power."
1989.88-1281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.161,960.004,"--The local villages or towns have police forces, you say?"
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,960.004,960.424,"No, they don't."
1989.88-1281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,960.424,966.928,So the only governmental entity that has a police force that can engage in the kind of conduct we are talking about is the territory itself?
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,966.928,967.479,That's correct.
1989.88-1281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.479,970.183,Which is somewhat different from the situation in most states.
1989.88-1281,0,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,970.183,970.691,That is correct.
1989.88-1281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1004.417,1006.438,"Very well, Mr. Siegel."
1989.88-1281,1,31736,john_patrick_mason,,1007.649,1014.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1281,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2192.311,2209.391,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1281,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2299.146,2305.271,"Mr. Feldman, is there any significant difference between incorporated territories and unincorporated territories?"
1989.88-1281,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2305.271,2306.913,"No, I don't believe there is."
1989.88-1281,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2347.242,2356.477,Would your position on whether the territory is a person be the same in the case of the Northern Marianas?
1989.88-1281,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2356.477,2369.076,"I think, as a general matter, the arguments that we have advanced in support of Guam's immunity in this case would apply to the other territories, if it is a self-governing entity."
1989.88-1281,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2369.076,2371.797,How about the District of Columbia?
1989.88-1281,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2371.797,2375.781,The District of Columbia is a bit more difficult a case for a number of reasons.
1989.88-1281,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2495.937,2509.237,"Well, Mr. Feldman, if the... if Guam is not a person under the meaning of Section 1983, do we have to go further and deal with sovereign immunity?"
1989.88-1281,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2509.237,2512.579,"No, I would... you don't... I would suggest you don't."
1989.88-1281,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2763.055,2769.379,"Well, if we thought Congress had meant to include Guam as a person, that would be a fairly strong overriding policy, wouldn't it?"
1989.88-1281,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2773.613,2774.554,--If--
1989.88-1281,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.554,2780.728,"If Congress had specifically intended Guam to be treated as a person, you would still say there is a sovereign immunity defense?"
1989.88-1281,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2780.728,2783.502,"--Well, Congress may have intended that Guam be treated as a person."
1989.88-1281,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2836.376,2838.296,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
1989.88-1281,3,32823,jeffrey_r_siegel,,2841.87,2845.493,"Thank you, Your Honor."
