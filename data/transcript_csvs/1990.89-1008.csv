1990.89-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.106,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-1008, Dwight H. Owen v. Helen Owen."
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,50.554,57.259,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1008,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,62.811,65.122,I can't hear you.
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,66.744,76.051,"--The scope and effect of section 522(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the lien avoidance provision."
1990.89-1008,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,76.051,80.656,"You can... crank up that, and maybe you'll... the other way."
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,87.06,103.749,"The issue in this case is the, is the scope and effect of 522(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the lien avoidance provision."
1990.89-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,189.316,193.68,"That was the way South Carolina law treated it, wasn't it?"
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,193.68,195.561,That is Florida law.
1990.89-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.561,197.293,"Oh, I am sorry, Florida law."
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,197.293,202.055,That's purely an expression of the way Florida law treated it.
1990.89-1008,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.553,296.839,"Well, Mr. Fishell, could, could a State decide that it wasn't going to allow an exemption at all for homesteads?"
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,296.839,303.655,"--I see nothing wrong, I see nothing wrong with that conclusion."
1990.89-1008,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,313.231,318.514,"And if it did that, then there wouldn't be any relief available under 522(f)?"
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,318.514,319.005,Absolutely.
1990.89-1008,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,351.967,364.496,"Well, that Florida law... Florida law at the time this bankruptcy was filed provided that this homestead was not exempt."
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,372.012,373.122,Well--
1990.89-1008,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,373.122,375.673,Wasn't that true under Florida law?
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,380.347,381.078,"--The lien... yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1008,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.474,392.177,"Well, to that extent the... this property was not exempt."
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,392.177,398.571,"But only to that extent was it not exempt, only as to this particular creditor."
1990.89-1008,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,414.402,427.733,"You think, then, you think a State couldn't say, well, we grant a homestead exemption, but, except that all mechanics liens will be good against the homestead?"
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,427.733,428.582,Well--
1990.89-1008,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,428.582,430.264,Yes or no?
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,430.264,434.067,--I think they could.
1990.89-1008,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.346,442.692,"So they could say, they could say sure, we have a homestead exemption that is good against all liens except mechanics liens?"
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,442.692,446.275,"--Your Honor, I'm not suggesting that the Florida--"
1990.89-1008,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,446.275,447.365,And then how about in bankruptcy then?
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,447.365,459.203,--I am not suggesting that the Florida statute regarding... or the Florida decision law regarding homestead exemptions is in any sense invalid.
1990.89-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,544.163,550.056,"But to say he was entitled to the exemption generally really doesn't say a whole lot, does it?"
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,557.279,558.771,Under State--
1990.89-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,558.771,559.861,Under State law.
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,559.861,562.114,"--Under State law, Your Honor, that is correct."
1990.89-1008,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,604.96,615.779,"Well, I think... why didn't Congress intend that by permitting a State to opt out of the Federal scheme and specify its own exemptions?"
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,615.779,616.73,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1990.89-1008,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.73,624.985,You would think they would have contemplated that the State could quali... could define the exemptions they were granting in any way they wanted to.
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,624.985,632.119,"--Well, Your Honor, they did in a sense, Congress did in a sense allow States to opt out."
1990.89-1008,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.956,671.555,I guess that is why the case is here.
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,671.555,674.718,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think so."
1990.89-1008,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,761.744,770.19,"Do you give any significance to the introductory clause of 522(f), notwithstanding any waiver of exemptions?"
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,775.293,778.365,"Well, Your Honor, the--"
1990.89-1008,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,778.365,779.006,Or is it?
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,779.476,806.804,"--Some State statutes have, have defined their exemption laws in such a way that certain, certain acts or agreements undertaken between the creditor and the debtor have the effect of waiving an exemption or waiving a protection in bankruptcy that might be, that might be, might have been accorded the debtor in the particular property."
1990.89-1008,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,806.804,809.485,Those aren't taken care of by 522(e)?
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,809.485,826.268,"No, Your Honor, I don't... 522(f) I think is broad enough to cover any kind of exemption that--"
1990.89-1008,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,826.268,833.073,"But is it needed in light of 522(e), under your view, under your interpretation?"
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,842.94,856.471,"--Well, in other words, even a voluntary relinquishment of a protection that the debtor might have under State law wouldn't preclude him from asserting his exemption rights once bankruptcy is filed and lien avoidance is sought."
1990.89-1008,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,856.471,856.711,All right.
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,856.711,862.357,That--
1990.89-1008,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,862.357,872.562,How critical is the language in the statute 522(f) that refers to an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled?
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,872.562,886.971,"--Well, I think that is significant if you look at it from the point of view that there must be some reason for the lien avoidance remedy that Congress enacted."
1990.89-1008,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1067.367,1081.696,"Mr. Fishell, do you, do you give any weight to the fact that 522(f) does not say notwithstanding any waiver or exemption that the debtor may avoid a lien on the interest of the debtor?"
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,1098.837,1130.386,"No, Your Honor, I don't, I don't think that that... I don't think that that refers to a situation where a lien... if it, if it is in essence a prospective fixing of the lien, this may in many ways be an unrealistic view in the sense that if a debt is discharged it may not constitute a lien postpetition."
1990.89-1008,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1150.552,1161.217,"Yes, I think... I think I, I think I... I understand what you are saying, but I don't under... I don't understand why the, why the statute is phrased the way it is."
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,1174.527,1191.059,"Well, I don't... all I am suggesting is that I don't, I don't think that it had to have referred to a situation where the Congress contemplated the fixing of a lien at some time postpetition."
1990.89-1008,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1194.313,1194.573,Um hum.
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,1194.573,1196.382,--a bankruptcy petition is filed.
1990.89-1008,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.91,1205.831,What did they have in mind?
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,1212.236,1224.364,"Well, I don't think, I don't think that it necessarily cannot... I don't think it's a situation where it could not be read to apply to liens attaching prior to bankruptcy."
1990.89-1008,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1233.761,1239.956,--May I ask you another question just referring to the language of 522(f).
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,1264.45,1266.523,"That's, that is correct, Your Honor, the bankruptcy."
1990.89-1008,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1266.523,1270.023,So that there was no impairment of the exemption.
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,1289.206,1295.029,"Your Honor, the bankruptcy court decision on that issue specifically did not determine--"
1990.89-1008,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.029,1295.6,--I understand.
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,1295.6,1299.193,--this particular creditor's rights with respect to the property.
1990.89-1008,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1299.193,1305.628,"But it did hold, as I understand it, that the property was exempt from, it didn't have to be listed, or whatever you do, as an asset of the estate."
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,1305.628,1308.069,"That's, that's correct."
1990.89-1008,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.773,1315.594,"Which is, it seems to me... that's the complete exemption to which you are entitled if the property was exempt."
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,1332.615,1343.304,"--Well, the impairment exists because under State law this property remains subject to this particular creditor's lien."
1990.89-1008,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1343.304,1343.444,Right.
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,1348.159,1351.531,Well--
1990.89-1008,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1351.531,1353.711,"Maybe I, maybe I missed something in that language."
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,1353.711,1360.426,--The lien avoidance provision is specifically designed to avoid liens that impair exemptions.
1990.89-1008,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.165,1408.736,But not in the bankruptcy proceeding.
1990.89-1008,0,39198,robert_l_fishell,,1408.736,1414.443,"No, sir."
1990.89-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1578.943,1580.826,"Very well, Mr. Fishell."
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1582.446,1585.138,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1008,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.757,1633.111,"Mr. Dyk, is the Florida homestead allowance, is it of a specific dollar amount or is it of a, is it of a piece of property?"
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1633.111,1634.022,--It's a piece of property.
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1678.854,1688.931,"Wasn't there a, didn't the bankruptcy court decide that there wasn't a exemption?"
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1700.771,1703.094,"--The, the bankruptcy court--"
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.094,1703.815,"Yes, yes, yes."
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1708.099,1708.78,--Yes.
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.78,1712.681,And the bankruptcy court rejected that.
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1712.681,1714.193,"No, not quite--"
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.193,1714.793,Well--
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1714.793,1716.345,--What the bankruptcy--
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1716.345,1717.996,"--Well, you objected to it, but you didn't win."
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1717.996,1718.727,--No.
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.127,1742.171,"Well, that's right, but that's... I know the lien avoidance was not at issue at that time."
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1742.171,1743.032,"--Yes, it was."
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1743.032,1745.493,"Well, he didn't decide it, anyway."
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1745.493,1745.794,He didn't--
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.794,1757.524,"He said that, he said that this property was exempt under Florida law in this bankruptcy proceeding from the claims of general creditors, and was not subject to the general administration of the trustee."
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1757.524,1758.504,--That's correct.
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1784.751,1786.423,"We didn't appeal that order, I guess?"
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1786.423,1790.117,"--I don't think it was appealable, because it wasn't an adverse judgment against us."
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1794.829,1798.121,"Well, literally he cited against you by saying that there was an exemption."
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1799.714,1801.754,"No, he reserved the question of whether--"
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.754,1807.658,"I know, but... you, you, just a while ago you said that, you said that this property just wasn't exempt."
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1807.658,1808.329,--That's correct.
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1808.329,1811.454,There wasn't anything for 522(f) to operate on.
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1811.454,1813.554,"That's correct, and that is what we said in the bankruptcy court."
1990.89-1008,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.797,1836.151,What sort of a... what phase of the bankruptcy proceedings was it that the bankruptcy judge made this particular finding?
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1836.151,1838.612,Very... early in the bankruptcy proceedings.
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1849.19,1851.131,"Right on, right on the schedule?"
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1851.131,1852.033,Right on the schedule.
1990.89-1008,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.906,1856.898,By your client?
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1856.898,1857.178,--Yes.
1990.89-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1873.199,1875.189,"Yes, but, let me just stop you, if I may."
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1889.949,1890.75,"Oh, absolutely."
1990.89-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1892.032,1907.613,"So then if it's, if it's at least in the category of exempt property, why, how do you get around the language of 522(f) that the only thing that, about the exemption that wasn't impaired is the lien, to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption, to which--"
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1907.613,1911.396,"Justice Stevens, I was not agreeing that it is exempt property."
1990.89-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1925.247,1928.248,"--In other words, the condominium is treated as though it were two separate parcels."
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1933.462,1933.622,--Right.
1990.89-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1947.113,1962.192,"The problem I have with that is the language of the statute refers to an interest of the debtor in property to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption, and so forth, which seems to me to assume for purposes of that language that the amount of the lien is less than the total value of the property."
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1962.192,1963.661,"Well, I--"
1990.89-1008,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.661,1965.224,It talks about to the extent of the impairment.
1990.89-1008,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1965.224,1973.338,"--Well, I think in many cases it, the amount of the lien will be less than the total amount of the property, just apparently it doesn't happen to be the case here."
1990.89-1008,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1973.849,1978.684,"Well, but not, not under your view, because you say there are really two kinds of property."
