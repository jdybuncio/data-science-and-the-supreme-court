2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.736,"We'll hear argument next in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,8.157,11.129,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-5306,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,40.338,45.861,"Yes, it was authorized by the district court in the sense the district court put it on a piece of paper."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,50.055,54.607,The district court put it on there.
2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,94.862,101.728,But you knew that 14 days was the maximum because the motion asking for it cited and quoted from the rule.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,101.728,105.32,"Well, that... we did cite from the rule."
2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,122.221,124.712,"What if, what if the District Court gave you an extra month?"
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,132.238,148.357,"--Well, then you get into certain time limits, whether it's reasonable under the circumstances, would a reasonable attorney or litigant rely upon a, you know, expansive period of time that the court gave to it."
2006.06-5306,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,158.865,166.459,"But wouldn't a reasonable lawyer have said see, I referred to the rule, when I made this motion for extension of time."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,197.779,200.543,"Well, looking back, that is probably correct."
2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,225.879,228.419,Why isn't... this is just a notice of appeal.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,249.855,253.936,"--Well, the only reason for delaying it is obviously workload."
2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,278.665,284.609,Does it make... does it a difference that we're dealing with the safety valve provision?
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,307.292,318.122,"Well, I suppose at some point, someone may say well, if the court gave you 180 days to do the act, someone may say well, that appears to be unreasonable in connection with that."
2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,341.056,352.884,"Well, but as soon as you start talking about an exception from the provision in the rules, then you're going to get a lot of applications and there are going to be a lot of different reasons for why it wasn't filed on the last day."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,358.577,361.86,"Well, this is an equitable rule in itself."
2006.06-5306,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,372.997,376.829,Well it is an equitable rule conditioned upon compliance with time limits.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,376.829,379.511,"--Well, that's... that's once it's granted."
2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,387.636,389.288,"No, but Justice Kennedy's point I think is critical."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,414.434,420.857,"--Well, I think in past cases the Court has always recognized there are deadlines but there are exceptions to deadlines."
2006.06-5306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.745,468.58,"Mr. Mancino, your position here is that this rule is not jurisdictional."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,484.41,486.393,"Well, I believe--"
2006.06-5306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,486.393,486.744,Right?
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,493.486,505.845,"--Well, I think when the court of appeals does that, I think in all fairness, they should advise the parties in advance that they we're considering this on our own, that the appeal was out of time, and would you like to--"
2006.06-5306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.845,509.979,"No, no, but I'm asking whether a court of appeals has to even worry about that?"
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,515.852,516.774,--Correct.
2006.06-5306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,525.27,528.351,"And you need an objection or else it's, it will be okay?"
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,528.351,529.152,--I'm sorry?
2006.06-5306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.152,532.073,And you need an objection or else it will be all right?
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,532.073,532.524,Yes.
2006.06-5306,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,535.424,545.622,That means that a rule... that... 14 days is really a rule left to the discretion of the district judge.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,556.939,571.148,"--Well, I... I believe it does call for a timely objection by somebody to say something, rather than to just sit back and let it expire, knowing that someone did something that they should not do in connection with--"
2006.06-5306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,571.148,572.71,Suppose you have problems at home.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,600.541,601.39,--Well I--
2006.06-5306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.39,603.042,Because the other side's agreed.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,610.216,617.302,"--Well, there you have somewhat advance knowledge that you're doing something possibly contrary to a rule."
2006.06-5306,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,627.8,637.914,"Well, I mean, that... that may, that may be true of this stage; but Justice Scalia's question points up the problem of what do we do if we write this case?"
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,648.661,654.156,"--Well, I believe you can come up with all sorts of scenarios."
2006.06-5306,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,655.046,657.116,That's why we're wondering how to write the opinion.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,657.717,674.659,"--And where did the litigant reasonably rely upon an order of the court, which apparently the court had authority to issue, regardless of the court making a mistake or doing something intentionally--"
2006.06-5306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.659,677.499,"And the person who did the reliance was you, I guess?"
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,677.499,678.42,"--Yes, that's correct."
2006.06-5306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.42,687.497,And is it correct that... who... was this litigant represented by counsel during the period when he didn't get the notice of the September 9 order?
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,687.497,687.978,Yes.
2006.06-5306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,693.071,698.893,"So neither the, neither the prisoner nor you received any notice of the first goof up?"
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,698.893,704.978,"Well, the first... well, we received notice of the judgment on the merits."
2006.06-5306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,719.627,720.798,I see.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,720.798,737.99,"But in the, in that court, there was a transitioning to this electronic filing, which not everybody was set up at that particular time; so apparently the order may have only gone to... on the electronic filing system to those who were set up, and we were not set up on that thing."
2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,751.978,755.01,"Would your... would your proposed exception, does it work the other way?"
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,781.901,793.746,"Well I would believe you could then argue that the rule says that, the judge was wrong in... you know... in truncating your appeal time to file the appeal."
2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,793.746,795.849,Why wouldn't the same approach work the other way?
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,798.31,811.139,"Well, because the exceptions to all of these time deadlines, you have cases from this Court where people untimely file a motion for a new trial."
2006.06-5306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.02,866.145,"You know sometimes, sometimes district courts take jurisdiction over a case that they... that they shouldn't have jurisdiction over."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,866.145,867.126,Well--
2006.06-5306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,867.126,875.989,"And sometimes in reliance on that, you go through a whole trial and it comes up to the court of appeals and we say huh, there was no jurisdiction here; too bad."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,875.989,876.55,--Well--
2006.06-5306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,876.55,881.265,Even though the court said it and you went through a whole trial in reliance on the district judge.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,883.625,889.25,"--Well, that's a whole... I believe that's a whole different scenario than presented here."
2006.06-5306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.02,892.401,"It's even worse, it seems to me."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,895.133,895.774,--Right.
2006.06-5306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,895.774,899.427,"But if it's jurisdictional, we have to say, you know, too bad."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,909.973,919.36,"Well, the rule I always remember from law school is that parties cannot voluntarily confer jurisdiction on a court that does not have it."
2006.06-5306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,945.779,948.548,I know I could find this out by looking at a calendar.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,952.832,954.703,--I believe--
2006.06-5306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,954.703,956.946,"We don't have a weekend problem, do we?"
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,956.946,957.917,"--I believe it was not... I don't believe it was a weekend, no."
2006.06-5306,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,957.917,959.549,I looked at this.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,979.342,980.123,When it's entered.
2006.06-5306,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,980.844,996.302,And was there a submission or an implication in your remarks that you thought that the order was not entered until three days later?
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,996.302,997.404,No.
2006.06-5306,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,997.404,1002.266,Is there an entry... is there a time entry on the dock... on court's order?
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1002.266,1002.817,No.
2006.06-5306,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1005.298,1006.16,I know that it's a handwritten one.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1013.777,1014.057,--No.
2006.06-5306,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1044.89,1046.829,What about the weekends?
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1057.99,1060.391,--That I cannot answer.
2006.06-5306,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1060.391,1061.85,It looks like it was the middle of the week.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1068.074,1070.926,"Well, what I think was done--"
2006.06-5306,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1070.926,1073.34,"Which may not be jurisdictional, the weekend rule."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1073.34,1078.443,--What I believe is that this was sent out by mail.
2006.06-5306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1089.579,1092.681,Maybe Arabic numerals aren't jurisdictional either.
2006.06-5306,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1092.681,1096.504,They're not.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1103.19,1112.945,"--Well, normally if you are allowed to do an act by mail, you have three days, you can serve a party and then you have three days to file with the court as part of the Civil Rules."
2006.06-5306,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1125.362,1135.41,"Speaking of the three-day mail rule, maybe the judge's intent when he signed this was that it actually was entered, took effect as of three days later."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1135.41,1140.783,"Well, there's really no... looking at the document, there's no way of telling that."
2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1165.167,1176.196,"All of that might have... all those things might have been going on in the judge's mind, but you don't contest that the 14-day period was not complied with?"
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1179.589,1180.698,"--No, I do not."
2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1278.553,1297.246,"One of the things I think the drafters of the rule wanted to assure is that there would be a point at which the prevailing party in the district court could know with certainty there wasn't going to be further proceedings in the case, and that's the purpose of the 180-day period and all that."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1307.661,1320.51,"Well, unless the court specifically granted to the litigant a specific period of time, and you know, normally litigants and lawyers do not ignore what the court says."
2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1334.939,1339.341,"Well, what would be an unreasonable period of time if the two or three days is not?"
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1340.803,1350.44,"--Well, if you go back to the rules, you're going into the six months, 180 days, and then, you know, you would say something."
2006.06-5306,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1391.236,1399.962,But the respondent said he had no reason at that time to believe that you wouldn't follow the rule and file within the 14 days.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1410.377,1414.641,"--Well then, the judge may have said well, I don't... look at the rule."
2006.06-5306,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1478.401,1499.636,"Mr. Mancino, I take it that what you are really proposing is sort of a rule that if... if counsel could reasonably be misled to overlook the mistake by the court, that your reliance upon the court's mistake should... should, in fact, be respected."
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1508.692,1509.934,I believe so.
2006.06-5306,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1509.934,1516.108,"I mean, that's how we distinguish your case on your view from the case in which you get 180 days instead of 14?"
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1516.108,1517.006,Right.
2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1520.66,1524.833,You think we should have a rule of reason rather than a per se rule.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1525.234,1529.756,"That's the prior case, because they made that."
2006.06-5306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.756,1538.051,"Let me ask this question: Is the order on page 151 of the joint appendix, just those three lines, that's the entire order that the judge entered?"
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1540.262,1543.234,That is what's handwritten on the original documents.
2006.06-5306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1543.735,1546.176,--He did not make the findings that the rule requires?
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1546.176,1546.607,No.
2006.06-5306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1565.038,1567.121,Because the motion requires--
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1567.121,1568.221,"--motion to vacate, you have 30 days to appeal."
2006.06-5306,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.221,1572.184,--The rule requires that he make three specific findings which he did not make.
2006.06-5306,0,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,1572.184,1581.521,"He did not make it, but you assume that the judge did by granting the motion, and nobody else said anything about it anyway."
2006.06-5306,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1583.462,1588.905,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,1591.526,1600.542,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-5306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1651.465,1653.336,What type of jurisdiction are you speaking of?
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,1665.224,1673.89,"--Your Honor, I think it is its own form of subject matter jurisdiction in the same way that final judgments on appeals are subject matter jurisdiction."
2006.06-5306,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1709.773,1710.975,Isn't that just a word game?
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,1718.679,1721.163,"Well, I think, Your Honor, the same way that final judgments are."
2006.06-5306,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1736.352,1739.384,Can you think of anything that's enacted by Congress as jurisdictional?
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,1739.384,1750.801,"--No, Your Honor, but when there is a background, as there is in this case, of 150 years of practice where Congress has enacted against that background, it is presumed to be jurisdictional."
2006.06-5306,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1770.506,1777.329,Doesn't the latter suggest that a rule that concerns the transfer of a case from one court to another is not necessarily jurisdictional?
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,1777.329,1783.453,"Your Honor, I think the latter recognizes the fact that it doesn't necessarily have to be."
2006.06-5306,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1829.573,1833.435,"Well, it seems to me that's what we're back to, that it's long been treated as jurisdictional."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,1844.734,1859.702,"Well, Your Honor, it's more than just history, because I think Congress reenacting 2107 against this background for 150 years, that this issue has been treated as jurisdictional, puts Congress behind this as well."
2006.06-5306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1864.177,1867.76,"The provision of, is it 2107?"
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,1867.76,1869.379,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1869.379,1872.901,Where does that appear in the judicial code?
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,1876.425,1877.366,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1890.112,1895.557,"But it is under the heading procedure, court procedure, right?"
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,1895.557,1900.019,--It's time for appeal to court to proceed.
2006.06-5306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1900.019,1906.054,"Yes, but that's under a chapter that deals with procedures, as opposed to jurisdiction."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,1906.054,1907.786,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1933.683,1943.96,"You know there have been a spate of cases that said the word ""jurisdiction"" has been vastly overused, it's a word of many meanings."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,1953.675,1958.619,"Yes, Your Honor, in the same way that amount in controversies are also subject matter."
2006.06-5306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1958.619,1961.579,But amount in controversy is in 1332.
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,1977.601,1978.182,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2024.833,2033.627,What characteristics are you asserting follow from calling it jurisdictional in this case?
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2033.627,2034.959,"Your Honor, the--"
2006.06-5306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.959,2038.632,"Number one, it can't be waived, right?"
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2038.632,2039.351,--That's correct.
2006.06-5306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.351,2040.753,Number two--
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2040.753,2041.862,It's non-forfeitable.
2006.06-5306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2041.862,2047.666,"--The court of appeals has to inquire on its own, right?"
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2047.666,2048.697,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.697,2049.748,Anything else?
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2049.748,2050.5,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.914,2083.56,"Except at least as to the second, at least as to the second, I don't know of any matter that a court has to inquire into sua sponte which is not jurisdictional."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2091.206,2105.126,"Well, Your Honor, in Day versus McDonough in dealing with a habeas, with a habeas statute of limitations, this Court approved the court of appeals raising that issue sua sponte, although they... although in that case the Court--"
2006.06-5306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2105.126,2105.556,It may.
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2105.556,2106.087,--It may.
2006.06-5306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.087,2107.647,But not must.
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2107.647,2108.458,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2108.458,2109.738,Not must.
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2114.952,2116.121,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2123.527,2125.838,"We could call it ""quasi-jurisdictional""."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2127.34,2128.04,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2137.736,2138.778,"Well, what do you think is the--"
2006.06-5306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2138.778,2140.15,How far do you take it?
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2174.601,2176.103,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2191.685,2193.075,Let's take it a step further.
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2207.313,2216.83,"Your Honor, collateral attacks for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are not normally sustained, if that's what the... if I understand your question correctly."
2006.06-5306,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2241.548,2247.701,"What about something here I hadn't run across, called the unique circumstances doctrine."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2286.945,2295.3,"Well, Your Honor, the unique circumstances doctrine doesn't apply here because there wasn't an act which if requested could have been properly done."
2006.06-5306,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.3,2305.779,"Yes, yes, the act was that he filed a motion to reopen, which motion to reopen postponed the time of appeal."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2319.149,2321.069,"Your Honor, I think that--"
2006.06-5306,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2321.069,2323.12,"I agree there were two parts to it or two acts, if you want."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2323.12,2332.736,"--But, Justice Breyer, in this case I think that what would have had to happen is that the Petitioner would have had to move for 17 days in order for the act to be properly done."
2006.06-5306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2333.676,2348.625,"I thought what we were talking about was that if the order had said 14 days instead of 17, then the act would have been properly done."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2369.899,2376.995,"Well, Your Honor, the judge... our argument is in part that the judge had no power to authorize it."
2006.06-5306,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2402.612,2408.715,"So he hasn't received, just quoting from Osterneck, he hasn't received assurance that the act has been properly done?"
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2408.715,2409.346,That's right.
2006.06-5306,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2409.346,2417.651,"In other words, if he came back and said, was my notice of appeal timely or something, and the judge at that point ruled, then it might come under that provision."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2427.548,2428.677,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2428.677,2429.749,Why does that matter?
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2466.306,2474.071,"Your Honor, the purpose of the unique circumstances doctrine is not to give a license to litigants to rely on district court errors."
2006.06-5306,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2474.071,2478.783,"That would be the very narrow circumstances doctrine, not the unique circumstances doctrine."
2006.06-5306,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2479.334,2483.607,"I notice the court applied it twice, so it couldn't quite be the unique circumstances."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2483.607,2486.058,"That's right, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2486.058,2487.26,May I ask this question.
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2500.429,2504.631,"Your Honor, the question is when the clerk of court would have entered for the entry of judgment."
2006.06-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.631,2512.106,If he'd entered this order on February 12 or 13... I forget which day it was... the appeal would have been timely?
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2512.106,2513.078,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2513.078,2518.131,And I'm just... and the order was defective because it didn't make findings required by the rule.
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2531.859,2540.645,"I think the key question, Your Honor, I think is when the... when the order is entered into the docket, which is done by the clerk of court."
2006.06-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2542.616,2545.21,My question is what if that's somewhat ambiguous?
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2552.563,2554.136,"Your Honor, that's a different case."
2006.06-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2557.349,2557.569,I understand.
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2570.108,2572.128,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.171,2585.738,"If he had written here, instead of 2-10> [""], he had written down 2-12> [""], then the prosecutor 3 days later realized he had written down the wrong date, would that have made the appeal untimely?"
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2585.738,2592.253,"--Your Honor, I think the question at that point is what is the time period entered into the formal docket, and what is the actual judgment."
2006.06-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2592.253,2593.514,"And that's ambiguous, I'm saying."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2594.704,2602.31,"If for some reason the court records are jumbled for some reason or another and nobody can determine when that entry of order is, that's a different case."
2006.06-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.31,2606.561,"In that case, you then rely on the February 27 date in the order?"
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2614.939,2620.663,"Again, Your Honor, the critical thing with the rule period is the time period from the entry of judgment."
2006.06-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.663,2626.757,"I know, and I say it's hard to figure out when the order was actually written down in the docket."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2626.757,2634.241,I think that the question that would be required then was for whoever was filing the notice of appeal to determine when the entry of the docket is.
2006.06-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.265,2643.027,And not rely on the 2-27 date.
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2643.027,2649.381,I would certainly suggest that a litigant argue on... err on the side of caution if at all.
2006.06-5306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2649.381,2657.375,Justice Breyer quoted from the Osterneck case.
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2686.665,2687.816,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2694.35,2698.983,--The case that I'm reading from is the concurring opinion in Carlisle against United States.
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2701.076,2706.99,"Thompson is the case, Thompson... this Court has not relied on the unique circumstances doctrine in 40 years."
2006.06-5306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2729.554,2737.611,"But they would have filed that notice of appeal earlier if the judge had said, your motion for a new trial is untimely."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2773.024,2781.269,"But, Your Honor, there is nothing that the court did that prevented the litigant here from filing on time."
2006.06-5306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2788.742,2792.846,There was nothing in Thompson that prevented filing the notice of appeal.
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2792.846,2798.9,"--Except in Thompson, Your Honor, he was told that he had the right to proceed on a motion for new trial."
2006.06-5306,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2801.842,2802.844,You can finish your answer.
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2802.844,2812.14,"In Thompson, Your Honor, the difference is that... that the litigant was sent down a different road which was inconsistent with his filing a notice of appeal."
2006.06-5306,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2817.233,2818.943,"Thank you, Mr. Marshall."
2006.06-5306,1,45595,william_p_marshall,,2818.943,2819.865,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2006.06-5306,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2819.865,2824.727,We'll hear from Mr. Stewart.
2006.06-5306,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2824.727,2836.775,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
2006.06-5306,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2877.394,2881.175,"Mr. Stewart, do you think this is subject... that question is subject matter jurisdiction?"
2006.06-5306,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2881.175,2885.319,We would... we would characterize it as a species of appellate jurisdiction.
2006.06-5306,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2942.017,2944.486,"Mr. Stewart, that's one those interesting examples."
2006.06-5306,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2950.491,2951.222,That is an anomaly.
2006.06-5306,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2988.156,2991.279,"Mr. Stewart, should we repudiate the unique circumstances doctrine?"
2006.06-5306,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2991.279,3007.068,--I don't think you need to... I think you should repudiate any conception that Federal courts have freewheeling authority to excuse noncompliance with statutory time limits for taking appeals.
2006.06-5306,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3007.068,3012.932,"Well, the unique circumstances doctrine is one circumstance in which courts, say yeah, you can excuse it."
2006.06-5306,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3012.932,3016.625,"Well, I... I think actually both Harris and Thompson are explicable on other grounds."
2006.06-5306,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3021.357,3027.962,"But on the grounds for which they have been taken as authority, is it your view that we should repudiate those grounds?"
2006.06-5306,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3027.962,3028.412,--Yes.
2006.06-5306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3044.414,3045.874,Well... in criminal.
2006.06-5306,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3045.874,3051.238,In criminal cases the time for taking an appeal is not specified by statute.
2006.06-5306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3069.659,3078.585,"But in... though of course, you'd have to confine it very narrowly, I take that doctrine, if there weren't a statute, you read it into the rule."
2006.06-5306,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3094.905,3098.999,--Well I think it makes a fundamental difference that there is a statute in place.
2006.06-5306,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3107.904,3112.837,You're sure habeas cases are classified for this purpose as civil rather than criminal?
2006.06-5306,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3112.837,3114.629,"Yes, there's no... no dispute about that."
2006.06-5306,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3137.615,3140.967,"Looking at the rule, it does require these findings."
2006.06-5306,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3148.329,3156.416,I think the courts of appeals have not required that they be written on the record but have required that there be a basis appearing in the record for those findings.
2006.06-5306,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3322.296,3327.381,But it begins with the exception as provided in subparagraph (c).
2006.06-5306,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3327.381,3328.122,--That's correct.
2006.06-5306,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3329.812,3330.132,Yeah.
2006.06-5306,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3330.132,3343.52,"--but we're saying that the rule specifies that if the various time restrictions are not complied with, the appeal will not bring... I'm sorry, the appeal shall not bring the judgment, order, or decree before the court of appeals."
2006.06-5306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3349.373,3367.015,"What do you think, if we did go to Thompson and looked at that, this would be a fortiori from Thompson, as described in Osterneck, was a case in which the judge simply said from the bench look, your... your... the new trial motion is timely, though it wasn't; it was out of by two days."
2006.06-5306,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3377.323,3379.374,"Well, are two things we would say about Thompson."
2006.06-5306,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3439.353,3440.655,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2006.06-5306,3,38138,paul_mancino_jr,,3443.176,3450.831,"If this were a case where someone just missed the 30-day deadline, I don't think we would be talking."
2006.06-5306,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3491.109,3494.091,"Mr. Mancino, does the record tell us how you got notice of that order?"
