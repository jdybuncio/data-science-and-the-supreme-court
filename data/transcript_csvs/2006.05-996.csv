2006.05-996,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.154,We'll hear argument first today in Marrama versus Citizens Bank of Massachusetts.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,8.004,10.606,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-996,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,51.266,62.906,"Mr. Baker, as I understand it subsequent to the grant of certiorari in this case, your client filed for relief under Chapter 13 and that relief was denied."
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,72.112,75.814,In the present case or the new case?
2006.05-996,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,75.814,77.35,What relief is open to you in this case?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,90.741,95.545,The circumstances of the new case are entirely different.
2006.05-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,121.195,131.551,But if he isn't eligible... the new case determined that he was not eligible because his debts were too high.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,140.324,141.693,"Yes, Your Honor, he did."
2006.05-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,141.693,144.242,Or he didn't reduce the debt.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,159.202,167.641,"I wouldn't say it would be the end of the matter in the present case because the eligibility was never questioned below, was never a factor below."
2006.05-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,167.641,174.58,"But now there has been a finding, and it's an essential finding, that there be eligibility."
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,183.52,185.002,In the prior case?
2006.05-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,203.497,220.459,"But that's a question you can argue on appeal in... from the recent decisions, but for the moment you have a bankruptcy court making that determination, which I think would be preclusive on another bankruptcy court."
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,220.459,226.946,"The... well, the... the bankruptcy court made a decision in the current case, the new case, but they haven't dismissed it."
2006.05-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,280.231,295.776,"If the decision is affirmed on appeal to the First Circuit, do you think you could still argue that there's qualification for Chapter 13, after the court of appeals has affirmed a determination that there isn't?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,295.776,298.311,I'm... I don't quite follow the question.
2006.05-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,299.895,308.5,We have now a judgment that this debtor is ineligible for Chapter 13.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,320.224,327.045,"Yes, Your Honor, because there's a three-year difference between the two and substantially different facts."
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.91,354.029,They're not at issue as far as this mootness question goes.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,392.606,406.914,"Well, I would respectfully say... suggest that it does, Your Honor, because once... we don't really get to the eligibility question until the court below considers it in the context of the case that's at bar."
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,414.986,421.007,"Well, didn't you make that argument to the bankruptcy court that found that you were not eligible?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,421.007,429.862,"--No, Your Honor, because as I mentioned before, the case law in the First Circuit up to this point has held that a Chapter 7 debtor does not have standing to object to claims."
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.183,435.399,That's what I'm asking.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,442.453,444.705,"--In the old case, yes, once we converted the chapter."
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.705,448.007,And they rejected it?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,448.007,448.859,No.
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,455.097,456.88,I don't care about the present case.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,471.539,472.724,I did.
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.724,473.791,"They rejected it, right?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,473.791,474.808,Pardon?
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.808,476.143,And they rejected it?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,476.143,479.978,"The bankruptcy court did reject it, yes."
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.286,495.405,But you said it was only a Chapter 7 debtor who couldn't object.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,495.405,496.007,Right.
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.007,499.126,But you are applying under Chapter 13.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,499.126,499.492,Right.
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.15,520.121,Didn't you object to that and say you should look at these claims afresh?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,520.121,520.804,Yes.
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.804,522.239,And what did the court say?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,526.376,532.113,It... the bankruptcy court in the new case said... pardon?
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.01,555.878,What did the bankruptcy court say?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,555.878,562.365,--The bankruptcy court sustained our objections to those claims and in fact reduced the total substantially.
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.365,563.382,I don't understand that.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,568.019,570.436,We are not finished with the claims objection process.
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,571.521,572.104,Of course you are.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,579.576,584.611,--Because the bankruptcy court rendered a final decision which is on appeal in the new case.
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.567,594.336,It is terribly confusing.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,605.792,611.346,And it did so by reference to the claims that had been filed in the previous Chapter 7 case.
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,653.458,656.244,"And you objected to that, I gather?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,656.244,656.677,--Sorry?
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.677,660.028,"You objected to that, to that ruling?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,660.028,674.455,"Not necessarily, because it does give you a vehicle to go back to the old Chapter 7 case and do the procedural claims objections in that case, which is what we did, and we substantially reduced the total of the claims."
2006.05-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,674.455,677.323,What is the status of the Chapter 7 case?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,683.561,686.263,A determination of no discharge had been entered.
2006.05-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,699.82,703.474,But there's a determination that you're not entitled to a discharge?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,704.99,707.259,That's correct.
2006.05-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,707.259,710.644,If we just could go to the merits for a second here.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,718.817,721.436,"The plain language of the statute says that, yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,721.436,722.469,No matter what?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,728.14,728.79,I'm sorry.
2006.05-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,730.125,733.41,I'm just producing examples where it's clear you can't convert.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,737.262,738.679,Not if there's no Chapter 13.
2006.05-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,738.679,739.13,"No, okay."
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,742.099,742.832,If the debtor dies?
2006.05-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,742.832,744.015,Yes.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,746.384,748.169,"Well, there is a rule, I believe it's--"
2006.05-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,748.169,750.705,Even though there's no such person existing any more.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,756.792,757.142,--Right.
2006.05-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,760.661,762.513,I'm trying to produce ridiculous examples.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,777.673,780.474,"--Well, again, Your Honor, the rule says--"
2006.05-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,780.474,797.484,"What about if, in fact, the conversion is part of a scheme to defraud millions of people in a foreign country because it will be viewed as a signal that they should mail their life savings into a particular account in Switzerland?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,799.336,800.652,"--The statute is plain, Your Honor."
2006.05-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,800.652,801.654,You say yes on that?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,801.654,802.288,I would say yes.
2006.05-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,802.288,805.59,Even though it's going to bilk people out of millions of dollars?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,805.59,810.594,I think that the statute is plain and says that the debtor may convert.
2006.05-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,810.594,811.31,No matter what?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,813.446,814.329,Even if he's insane.
2006.05-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,814.329,818.331,"Well alright, then I can't get anywhere with my hypotheticals."
2006.05-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,821.551,827.871,"Mr. Baker, couldn't the... let's say the conversion goes through."
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,870.032,872.567,The bankruptcy court could certainly do that.
2006.05-996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,878.888,885.142,"Yes, but your claim doesn't rest on a due process denial of hearing does it?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,908.24,910.692,"Well, I wouldn't say he could immediately reconvert."
2006.05-996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,916.513,919.131,But due process is not the issue here.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,936.843,937.393,Yes.
2006.05-996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,937.393,960.292,"Well then, why would we have a system as ridiculous as to preclude the court from looking at fraud or bad faith at the moment of election, go through the paperwork and the folderol of converting to 13, and immediately turn around, admittedly having the power, to deconvert?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,963.577,966.446,"Well, perhaps, but it is the system that Congress has given us."
2006.05-996,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,971.998,982.456,"When cases are reconverted to Chapter 7, is that typically done before or after the filing of the Chapter 13 plan?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,982.456,992.477,"Most of the time, a plan is... I don't do it this way, but most practitioners will file a plan at the same time as they file the notice, the motion to convert."
2006.05-996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,992.477,994.679,But they don't have to.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,994.679,995.965,They don't have to.
2006.05-996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,995.965,1001.517,And the deconversion could be done prior to the filing of the plan?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1001.517,1004.419,I suppose arguably it could.
2006.05-996,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1012.991,1022.949,"Creditors... under Chapter 13 one of the prerequisites to approval of the plan is that the creditors get at least as much as they would have gotten under Chapter 7, right?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1022.949,1023.883,--That's correct.
2006.05-996,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1023.883,1029.952,So presumably the creditors might want to see what the Chapter 13 plan looks like themselves.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1029.952,1030.852,Exactly.
2006.05-996,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1042.077,1044.962,Could the district court... pardon me.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1073.481,1078.635,"Well, again, the statute says that the debtor may convert except in certain circumstances."
2006.05-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1089.325,1099.449,"But there is a difference, and this is... assume with me, which apparently you don't agree, that everywhere in law there are implied exceptions for unusual circumstances."
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1163.873,1177.866,"--Because ultimately the Chapter 13 trustee has the same powers of the Chapter 7 trustee with the exception, as Your Honor is pointing out, of possession of the property in the bankruptcy estate."
2006.05-996,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1191.975,1194.077,If I could come back to a prior question.
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1227.299,1233.869,"--Well, ultimately the case is about the language of the statute and whether the court should apply it as written."
2006.05-996,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1234.369,1240.808,You can't provide any reason why there's a difference between those two?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1240.808,1242.508,--I'm sorry?
2006.05-996,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1242.508,1261.722,"You deny... do you dispute the fact that the bankruptcy court could simultaneously convert on the motion of the debtor from 7 to 13 and during the 20-day period that's required by the rule, the rules, reconvert?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1264.255,1270.142,I dispute that the court could do it sua sponte and without notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
2006.05-996,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1270.142,1281.1,"If it gives notice and an opportunity for a hearing during the 20 day period... you have to give 20 days notice before the conversion takes place; is that correct, from 7 to 13?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1281.1,1283.968,I believe that's correct.
2006.05-996,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1287.504,1293.074,"If it has the hearing during that period, you don't dispute that the court could do that, or do you?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1293.074,1296.11,"Well, again we come to the question of when the plan gets filed."
2006.05-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1300.347,1306.101,"But here there was a hearing on the motion to convert, right?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1307.051,1308.869,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1308.869,1315.273,"And as I understand it, there was no objection to the character of that hearing?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1338.389,1359.635,"The procedure I would, I would expect to see is that if the court saw an issue of fact with respect to whether the case had been converted or whether the debtor was eligible for it to be a debtor in the chapter to which he seeks conversion, then an evidentiary hearing would be required."
2006.05-996,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1418.091,1430.148,"But your case as I understand it, your case does not turn on the question whether there was or was not, should or should not have been a hearing in this case, an evidentiary hearing in this case; is that correct?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1430.148,1430.948,That's correct.
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.639,1455.764,"Mr.... Mr. Baker, I have... I have a question on a matter that really upsets me and causes me to wonder how, you know, how much we can rely upon your description here."
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1494.739,1497.674,"On the petition date itself, he was not."
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1522.908,1530.145,"It says employment, occupation, name of employer: Capital Carpet and Flooring."
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1552.858,1553.777,--Right.
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1553.777,1556.978,Does he go around swearing he was when he wasn't?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1556.978,1559.913,"No, he was... he was not employed at the time."
2006.05-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1600.824,1607.978,"Look on page 64a of the appendix, the meeting of creditors."
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1618.786,1620.252,Right.
2006.05-996,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.769,1660.363,"May I ask, I may have missed some of the colloquy here... is it correct that he would not be eligible to file a... to have a, institute a Chapter 13 proceeding if he had unsecured debts of over a certain amount?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1660.363,1661.279,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-996,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.279,1672.587,"And what if at the time he makes the motion to convert, which you say he has an absolute right to make, what if the record then disclosed that he had debts exceeding that amount?"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1676.623,1684.894,"The bankruptcy judge should examine the claims that have been filed, if any, do the arithmetic, offer the debtor an opportunity--"
2006.05-996,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1684.894,1686.43,He concludes they're over the amount?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1689.046,1690.415,--He should deny conversion.
2006.05-996,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.415,1691.015,He should what?
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1691.015,1692.015,He should deny conversion.
2006.05-996,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.75,1695.969,"So he does not have an absolute right in all cases to convert, then."
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1695.969,1699.571,--It's absolute except in the two circumstances stated in the statute.
2006.05-996,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1711.896,1712.296,"Thank you,--"
2006.05-996,0,20612,david_g_baker,,1712.831,1715.364,Thank you.
2006.05-996,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1715.364,1723.936,Mr. Brunstad.
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1723.936,1726.888,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1742.517,1746.552,Under... you think 105 is an affirmative grant of power?
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1746.552,1763.013,"I think the second sentence of 105(a) supports the traditional powers that courts have had to grant relief, to prevent or to deny relief to prevent abuse or to remedy bad faith conduct."
2006.05-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1775.738,1778.29,105(a) is much more limited than that.
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1814.529,1853.821,"--Well, Chief Justice Roberts, I think that in order to understand 106(a), the second sentence, completely, I think it is important to understand it was added to 105 in 1986 in response to a number of decisions that were holding that the courts did not have the... the bankruptcy courts did not have the authority to sua sponte take action to prevent abuse, to monitor their own calendars, to make sure that inappropriate things weren't happening, and that Senator Hatch when he introduced this legislation which was ultimately enacted, the goal was to overturn cases like the Second Circuit's decision in Grissom to provide expressly and perhaps not as clearly as perhaps they intended, to give the courts this power."
2006.05-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.321,1869.366,Was that Second Circuit's decision a decision that said the court didn't have the power because it had not been moved to take that action by the party who had the responsibility for raising the issue?
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1871.65,1872.568,"--In part, yes."
2006.05-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.185,1877.02,Then... then you haven't contradicted what the Chief Justice suggested.
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1877.02,1883.257,"--Well, I think... I think 105(a), the second sentence is worded the way that it is."
2006.05-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1929.138,1934.725,"What do you do about the different structures, wording between 706(a) and 706(b)?"
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1949.568,1954.806,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the drafting conventions between the two subsections is key."
2006.05-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1974.95,1983.789,So you think under those other provisions the court doesn't have this inherent power or the implicit power from 105(a) that you're arguing for here?
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1983.789,1991.979,"Well, if you look at section 1307(b), upon request of the debtor the court shall dismiss the case, that is an absolute right."
2006.05-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2048.998,2067.395,"If you, if given that the court has express statutory authority to reconvert from 13 back to 7, why should we take the leap of conferring inherent equitable authority to do something, when the statute addresses it in a much more specific way?"
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2067.395,2069.212,"Two primary reasons, Your Honor."
2006.05-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2072.882,2074.299,"Well, maybe, maybe not."
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2087.44,2099.248,"But the debtor could argue in the context of the motion to convert, well, I would like to propose a Chapter 13 plan, perhaps the misconduct wasn't that severe, and the court can take that into consideration allowing the debtor to proceed."
2006.05-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2109.239,2111.424,Even if it might injure the creditors.
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2111.424,2113.774,"Well, the court can take that into account."
2006.05-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2153.701,2159.989,What limitations would you recognize on this inherent authority to take action?
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2162.791,2182.87,"--Well I think that... Mr. Chief Justice, I think that they're the same sorts of limitations that require the district court, when it is considering invocation of its inherent powers, whether to exercise them or not, we have always sort of recognized a special situation for bad faith conduct and clearly abusive schemes."
2006.05-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.566,2232.287,"Mr. Brunstad, are you going to address the mootness point?"
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2233.82,2234.07,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2299.895,2304.633,Did you make the jurisdictional objection before the second bankruptcy court?
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2304.633,2308.751,"We did not participate in the second case and make that objection, Your Honor."
2006.05-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.751,2310.953,How so?
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2310.953,2317.976,"I think that it was primarily, it was, the debtor was litigating and we did not make the jurisdictional argument."
2006.05-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.976,2321.178,I find that extraordinary.
2006.05-996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2321.178,2325.213,So it wouldn't be before the First Circuit.
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2325.213,2331.3,"That particular issue, I think the appeal of the second case is pending before the district court."
2006.05-996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2353.982,2358.351,It's hardly a summary disposition.
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2361.47,2368.825,"Well, this particular bankruptcy judge obviously had a lot of experience with this particular debtor, having presided over the first case as well, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.216,2381.833,"This case, your case?"
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2381.833,2384.351,"The current case today, yes, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2384.351,2385.618,May I ask this question.
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2401.98,2407.284,"Yes, Justice Stevens, but they're not tailored to this particular problem or abuse."
2006.05-996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2414.82,2416.972,Are there any criminal sanctions?
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2416.972,2428.364,"--There might be criminal sanctions for willful... basically, in essence, it's sort of an idea of theft, you know, by not disclosing assets, but it's a relatively high bar for criminality."
2006.05-996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.732,2435.534,Then how are the creditors hurt by this series of events?
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2435.534,2446.409,"Well, the creditors are hurt because in the chapter 7 case, once the bankruptcy case is filed, the trustee takes possession of all the debtor's property, which becomes property of the estate."
2006.05-996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2536.335,2540.303,Wouldn't a Chapter 7 case be refiled immediately?
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2540.303,2542.322,"--Not necessarily, Your Honor."
2006.05-996,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.441,2549.476,"But the creditors aren't going to let him just run away with the assets, are they?"
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2549.476,2562.534,"Well, Justice Stevens, in many many Chapter 7 cases, in many many bankruptcy cases, you have creditors, most of the creditors may hold claims of $500, $1,000, $3,000."
2006.05-996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2607.448,2621.339,"Could the Chapter 7 trustee be appointed the trustee in the Chapter 13, the same trustee who has now been... he's terminated because the Chapter 7 has been converted."
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2628.511,2630.395,"--No, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2648.592,2651.961,What does the trustee do?
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2654.745,2655.812,The Chapter 13 trustee--
2006.05-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2655.812,2657.614,"I mean, the property doesn't vest in him, you've told it."
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2662.332,2663.268,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2675.926,2677.159,"He's called a trustee, though?"
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2677.159,2678.742,"--Correct, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.742,2680.711,Well that's really not his capacity.
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2680.711,2683.563,"In practical reality, that's correct, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2712.932,2714.932,It's called Chapter 13 day?
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2714.932,2718.05,"In many places it is, Your Honor, and they have a Chapter 13 bankruptcy judge."
2006.05-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2764.615,2785.278,"The sense it makes is that that's what the statute provides, and rather than relying on this alleged inherent power that apparently is not boundless, and that the bounds of which will have to be articulated in case after case after case, the statute provides a very clear mechanism to address the issue of fraud which allows him to reconvert it back to Chapter 7 promptly."
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2785.278,2793.134,"Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, in the Link case, the Court rejected that argument in construing section 41(b), where the Court said, quote,"
2006.05-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2860.66,2864.111,"Well, I still haven't gotten an answer, I think, on what the prejudice is."
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2879.138,2880.823,"Well, the creditors suffer, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2909.573,2920.298,"Is it true or not what I said, because I don't know the area, that if in fact you had a dishonest debtor, the present... the proceeding is dismissed on 7."
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2929.987,2940.177,"Justice Breyer, that is certainly possible, and I think that is why Congress has said you don't have an absolute right as a debtor under section 707 to dismiss your Chapter 7 case."
2006.05-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2940.177,2941.379,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.05-996,1,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2941.379,2944.246,Thank you.
2006.05-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2944.246,2948.032,We'll hear from Ms. Blatt first.
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2958.673,2961.875,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-996,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2987.407,2990.625,Why isn't the power to reconvert sufficient?
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2990.625,3005.821,"The power to reconvert under section 1307(c) is in this case, where the court is already confronted with an adjudicated bad faith litigator, it's indirect, it's inefficient, and it's inadequate to protect the bankruptcy process."
2006.05-996,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3021.081,3030.102,"Well, what are the odds that that's going to happen if you have a judge who's exercised enough by the fraud to exercise inherent authority to deny relief?"
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3032.721,3034.738,"Well, he may or may not."
2006.05-996,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3062.658,3068.811,"Well, why wouldn't that trustee recommend to the bankruptcy judge that he reconvert it to Chapter 7?"
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3068.811,3072.363,"--Well, the Chapter 7 trustee is, he's terminated on conversion."
2006.05-996,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3086.456,3094.545,Why can't they just have an order to the bankrupt... to disclose the asset in the Chapter 13 proceeding?
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3094.545,3096.312,--An order to disclose the asset?
2006.05-996,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3096.312,3098.414,In the Chapter 13 proceeding.
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3098.414,3105.735,"Well, we're talking about a case the court may or may not know about the fraud, and the trustee may or may not tell someone in time."
2006.05-996,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3106.102,3107.953,"Well, in this case they knew about it, didn't they?"
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3107.953,3110.904,"--Yes, and there was a basis to oppose conversion."
2006.05-996,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3114.958,3118.427,"Whenever he denies the motion, he must know about it."
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3120.11,3130.668,"--We're by hypothesis talking about an absolute right to convert, and what I'm trying to say, in jurisdictions where there is an absolute right, the practice of bankruptcy courts is not to simultaneously convert."
2006.05-996,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3169.343,3172.395,May I just clear up one detail that's confusing to me.
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3180.651,3182.451,"Yes, in the majority of jurisdictions."
2006.05-996,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3200.664,3202.548,I wouldn't call it a right to convert in bad faith.
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3210.67,3217.241,"--Well, I think that our point is that the absence of bad faith is implicit in the statute because there is this background rule."
2006.05-996,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3249.093,3257.465,"What about the idea that the debtor can come in and say under 13, look, whether the facts bear this out in this case or not, I've got a job now."
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3267.506,3268.206,Here's why.
2006.05-996,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3269.672,3272.874,"And he says, I'm sorry about that bad faith business."
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3272.874,3273.707,--Sure.
2006.05-996,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3305.678,3316.051,"If the statute didn't provide that a Chapter 13 plan could be reconverted to a Chapter 7, would the court have the inherent equitable authority to do that?"
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3316.051,3317.819,--To reconvert to Chapter 7?
2006.05-996,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3317.819,3318.669,Sure.
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3318.669,3320.188,I don't know if that would be an appropriate remedy.
2006.05-996,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3387.478,3391.632,"Well, what about the difference in language under 706(a) and the other provisions?"
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3401.154,3412.379,--I think section 706(a) is fairly read as granting a statutory right to convert absent the two statutory exceptions or the court's proper exercise of inherent authority.
2006.05-996,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3450.468,3453.972,Does the government have any position on the mootness question here?
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3453.972,3457.324,"Well, our position is that it's not moot because it's on appeal."
2006.05-996,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3470.549,3478.254,"I guess I've been assuming... but the eligibility under Chapter 13 even under the present case is a present day question, right?"
2006.05-996,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3485.291,3490.212,"We have not compared the two, the two chapters... well, there was never a Chapter 13 petition."
2006.05-996,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3505.322,3506.924,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."
2006.05-996,3,20612,david_g_baker,,3508.307,3510.459,"Thank you, Your Honor and Mr. Chief Justice."
