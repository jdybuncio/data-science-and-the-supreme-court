2010.09-893,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.278,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-893, AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion."
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,10.448,13.056,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-893,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,78.84,102.347,What if -- what if a State finds it unconscionable to have an arbitration clause in an adhesion contract which requires the arbitration to be held at a great distance from -- from where the other party is and requires that party to pay the cost of the arbitration?
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,105.704,107.049,"It can, Your Honor, and--"
2010.09-893,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,107.049,111.483,"Well, that wouldn't apply to other -- to other contracts."
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,111.483,126.118,"--But the legal doctrine that the State is applying there, as States have and as we discuss in our brief, is a doctrine that applies a general principle of unconscionability with principles elucidating how it applies that apply evenhandedly across the board."
2010.09-893,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,126.118,127.553,Are we going to sit in judgment?
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,139.845,151.665,"If it wants to apply a lesser standard to arbitration clauses, yes, absolutely you can, because that would -- that would violate what is at the core of the provision, which is discrimination against State law."
2010.09-893,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,181.262,186.589,"What's the difference, then, with the act that you are positing?"
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,236.959,238.831,"I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-893,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,242.563,251.447,"So how do you address Justice Scalia's -- if you are saying there is no difference between those two things, then how can a State find those terms unconscionable?"
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,254.589,263.944,"I think the critical question is: Is the State applying the same principles to arbitration, of unconscionability to arbitration agreements, as to other agreements?"
2010.09-893,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.418,293.152,"--That is bad, absolutely, but that's not what the State is going to do."
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,310.754,314.159,"Respectfully, Justice Scalia, I don't think that's what the State is doing here."
2010.09-893,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,322.888,323.294,There's nothing--
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,323.294,323.824,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-893,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,323.824,332.681,--There is nothing that indicates that California's laws are applying a different concept of unconscionability.
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,378.695,383.628,"Well, they haven't said that, Your Honor, but their opinion makes clear that they do."
2010.09-893,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,408.024,409.131,I was under the impression--
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,409.131,409.88,So it's clear that they are applying a different--
2010.09-893,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,409.88,433.449,"--I was under the impression, Mr. Pincus, that Discover Bank specifically cites a case which arose not in the arbitration context, but instead in the general litigation context, which is this America Online case, and thereby made clear that its rule, however different it may seem to you from normal contract provisions, its rule applied both in the arbitration sphere and in the litigation sphere."
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,433.449,438.417,"--Justice Kagan, I think that question goes to -- to a separate question."
2010.09-893,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,466.139,466.498,"Well, this--"
2010.09-893,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,466.498,468.295,"Well, any contract that would have an arbitration clause."
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,468.295,471.496,"True, Your Honor."
2010.09-893,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,486.49,488.693,Can we criticize one feature of this?
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,518.24,539.528,"Well, we -- we do make an argument, Your Honor, that the impact of this rule is much more significant on arbitration than it is on litigation, because it basically -- with respect to litigation, it is reaffirming the default rule, but with respect to arbitration, it has a quite significant different effect, which is really to transform arbitration in the ways that the Court described in Stolt-Nielsen."
2010.09-893,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.63,571.298,"Yes, but some -- some elements of unconscionability can only arise in a litigation or an arbitration context, such as requiring the complaining party to litigate or arbitrate at a distant location."
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,575.138,594.132,"Well, that -- that now turns to the second argument that Respondents make, which is, even if the mere fact that it applies to litigation and arbitration satisfied section 2, the rule satisfied -- satisfies section 2 because it is merely a specific application of California's general unconscionability rule."
2010.09-893,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,594.132,594.46,Yes.
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,594.46,612.406,"And -- and our response to that is: It is quite clear that in three critical respects, it is the principles that were applied -- not the result, but the principles that were applied in order to find unconscionability here -- are different than the principles applied in every other context."
2010.09-893,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.046,613.311,Three?
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,613.966,620.213,"--The three are, first of all, looking to the effect on people other than the parties to the dispute."
2010.09-893,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.025,622.273,I was going to ask you about that.
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,622.931,626.086,--the question is: Is it fair to the person before the court to apply the contract to them?
2010.09-893,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,663.085,669.628,I thought that Discover Bank is the California case that sets it out; is that correct?
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,669.628,670.237,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-893,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,670.237,672.3,So that's California law.
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,730.725,736.614,"Well, and the only -- as I said, there are two questions in this case and I think it's helpful to keep them separate."
2010.09-893,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,747.735,748.078,No.
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,790.607,817.299,"--Well, I think this is exactly the 9,000-foot meadow, Your Honor, because I think the problem here is there is -- it is not possible, based on the language of section 2 or any other basis that we can think of, to say a statute that requires the full use of discovery procedures in court and in arbitration or factual determinations by a panel of six individuals selected at random--"
2010.09-893,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,817.299,818.676,"Mr. Pincus, are they necessarily saying that?"
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,858.077,865.435,"--Well, I think the problem, Justice Ginsburg, is both prongs of that requirement are independently problematic."
2010.09-893,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,887.004,887.394,But they're not requiring--
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,887.394,888.408,--is independently--
2010.09-893,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,888.408,890.922,--But they're not requiring arbitration--
2010.09-893,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,890.922,893.262,"Go ahead, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-893,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,893.262,899.275,--They are not saying you have to arbitration -- class actions in all arbitration proceedings.
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,955.88,962.58,"--Your Honor, I think that's the precise difference between the two issues that are -- that are in this case."
2010.09-893,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1003.095,1004.046,--But Mr. Pincus--
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1004.046,1006.905,And so the very same argument being made here could have been made then.
2010.09-893,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1006.905,1012.559,"--But, Mr. Pincus, I'm not understanding what test you are asking us to formulate."
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1053.434,1067.426,"What separates the two is, is the State in the particular case in which the determination is made applying principles that apply to -- across -- that apply to its unconscionability doctrine across the board."
2010.09-893,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1067.426,1068.522,The State says yes.
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1068.522,1069.27,"Well, but I think--"
2010.09-893,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1069.27,1070.518,The State says it absolutely is.
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1072.847,1075.39,"--Well, let me answer that in two ways, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-893,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1124.823,1127.151,I thought that -- I don't want to interrupt your complete answer.
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1127.151,1127.478,--Sure.
2010.09-893,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1127.478,1139.614,"But I thought that was the gist of your argument, the heart of your argument, that traditional unconscionability in California and elsewhere focuses on unfairness to the party who is before the tribunal."
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1148.892,1151.219,"That's exactly right, Justice Alito."
2010.09-893,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1151.219,1167.242,"But, Mr. Pincus, the State says, well, our unconscionability doctrine may not have done that in the past, but now in the year 2010 it actually applies to more things than it did in the past, and we do take into account third parties and that's our new unconscionability doctrine."
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1174.175,1177.876,"But it is not the State's general unconscionability doctrine, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-893,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1226.281,1227.232,"Why, why, why?"
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1227.232,1228.063,"But here, that's not -- I'm sorry."
2010.09-893,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1228.063,1228.609,Why?
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1282.882,1285.505,"Two answers to that, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-893,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1329.484,1338.605,But it seems to me that all State -- most State statutes pertaining to contracts pertain to a class that is not entirely universal.
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1368.577,1369.688,"Well, Your Honor--"
2010.09-893,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1369.688,1371.872,And I'm not quite sure what your test is.
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1373.389,1389.615,"--Well, I think the ""any contract"" language of the statute shows that Congress was not enacting -- was not providing that everything other than facial discrimination qualifies for the savings clause, because it could have said any nondiscriminatory rule."
2010.09-893,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1412.041,1415.039,So how do you have special rules applicable to banks?
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1415.039,1418.054,"Well, most -- most--"
2010.09-893,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.054,1424.426,"Contracts by banks, can't a State say, you know, certain bank contracts have to have this or that?"
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1424.426,1441.888,"--In most of the examples that we have looked at of situations like that, the contract principles that are being applied are general principles, and perhaps they are being applied -- they are being specified for four particular categories of contracts, like the UCC, but they are tied to general principles."
2010.09-893,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.888,1443.136,They claim that here.
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1446.213,1456.835,"But -- but I think, as I have discussed, the problem here it has the label ""unconscionability"" on it, but the test that is applied has nothing to do with the test that is applied in every other context."
2010.09-893,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1483.839,1487.415,So then we have -- we have to serve as reviewers of State law?
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1487.415,1489.053,I--
2010.09-893,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1489.053,1492.633,We have to look at what the States are doing in -- to interpret their own laws?
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1492.633,1508.172,"--I think what the Court has to do, as it does in the independent and adequate State ground context and other contexts, is to determine whether the State is -- is applying a rule that is -- that discriminates, because the core protection of section 2 is discrimination."
2010.09-893,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1523.025,1539.848,"So if we look at the California law and we find other instances of unconscionability that are applying a standard less stringent than ""shock the conscience"", then we would say okay?"
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1539.848,1540.753,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-893,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1573.27,1573.988,"Then, Mr. Pincus--"
2010.09-893,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1573.988,1574.284,Thank you.
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1574.284,1575.017,I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
2010.09-893,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1575.017,1575.735,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
2010.09-893,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1575.735,1576.156,Thank you.
2010.09-893,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1576.156,1582.236,Mr. Gupta.
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,1582.236,1584.42,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-893,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.532,1655.277,If I could just go to your -- your second reason seemed to be focused particularly on arbitration as opposed to a principle that applies to every other contract.
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,1655.277,1658.763,"Well, let me be clear about what I mean by the second reason."
2010.09-893,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1691.515,1701.947,"No, but the substantive State liability rule on the issue you are addressing is that you consider the issue of consent ex ante, and with respect to arbitration you are considering it at the time the dispute arose."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,1705.553,1712.007,"Well, first of all, I think it is a -- it's a question of State law whether the determination is ex ante or ex post."
2010.09-893,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1712.475,1712.897,"Well, sure."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,1714.129,1714.503,--Right.
2010.09-893,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1714.503,1719.377,It's a question of what the State law provides; then you consider whether it's consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act.
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,1719.377,1719.892,Right.
2010.09-893,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1795.187,1804.293,"Well, what other area of contract law does the court consider unconscionability not with respect to the parties before the court, but with respect to third parties?"
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,1804.293,1815.633,"Well, I think, first of all, the California State law is applying an exculpatory clause prohibition that has been on the books since 1872 in California."
2010.09-893,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1819.115,1822.988,But isn't that -- doesn't that look to the parties before the court rather than third parties?
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,1822.988,1823.628,--No.
2010.09-893,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1860.471,1867.155,"Well, it's a general rule of contract law that contracts contrary to public policy could be unenforceable."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,1884.006,1893.063,"Well, again, I want to try to explain why I don't think that the Concepcions are -- are any different from the -- what Mr. Pincus is describing as third parties."
2010.09-893,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1927.032,1928.159,"Well, maybe you can explain it this way."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,1947.992,1948.382,Right.
2010.09-893,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1949.805,1952.945,Why is -- why are they better off with a -- with a class adjudication?
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,1952.945,1969.077,"--Because from an ex ante perspective, again when they enter into the contract, they have -- there -- it's not reasonable to be -- to expect that they will be among the very few people who will recognize that there's fraud, recognize a legal claim, and come forward."
2010.09-893,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1988.505,1993.177,And -- and isn't that what distinguishes this from the ordinary unconscionability analysis?
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2034.706,2035.954,I don't think it is.
2010.09-893,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2066.803,2071.893,Suppose that this doesn't have what's called a blowout clause.
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2094.226,2100.832,"Well, under this clause the consumer will always have the ability to proceed on a bilateral -- on a bilateral basis."
2010.09-893,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2100.832,2106.579,So then the bank has to have -- liability exposure for two different proceedings?
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2106.579,2108.97,"I mean that's true anyway, right?"
2010.09-893,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2111.75,2121.823,But you are saying then California can say it's unconscionable to allow the parties to agree that there will be just the single arbitration proceedings?
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2144.486,2145.188,--Right.
2010.09-893,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2145.188,2151.891,"Rather than FAA, but I think it does bear on at least section 4 of the FAA."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2151.891,2161.355,"Well, and maybe I'm misunderstanding your question, but I think, you know, that's true of any of the procedural limitations that the Petitioners concede would be subject to the unconscionability doctrine."
2010.09-893,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2185.36,2192.965,"Counsel, I've asked your adversary this question and I'm not sure yet what his answer is, so I'm asking you it."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2221.44,2222.548,"Right, and we don't deny that's true."
2010.09-893,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2243.243,2244.007,How do we test that?
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2244.007,2244.553,--that there is a limit--
2010.09-893,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2244.553,2255.234,"I mean, other than -- I don't want to look through legislative history and determine whether some committee person said something that sounds like subterfuge."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2261.59,2264.745,--I think in the first instance it would be an objective determination.
2010.09-893,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2291.125,2291.983,Where do you get--
2010.09-893,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2291.983,2292.685,Your brother says that the--
2010.09-893,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2292.685,2296.572,"--Where do you get ""obvious subterfuge"" in the Federal Arbitration Act?"
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2296.572,2309.773,"That's not in the Federal Arbitration Act, Your Honor, but in Mullaney v. Wilbur case and other cases where the Court is describing the limits on deference to State law, those are the kinds of standards the Court has used."
2010.09-893,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2325.032,2329.529,"But that's in the independent and adequate State ground context, which strikes me as quite different."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2339.898,2354.455,"--Well, I'm addressing -- Justice Sotomayor's question, if I understand it, is when you have a facially nondiscriminatory rule of contract law, where when you look at the face of the opinion nothing suggests it's nondiscriminatory."
2010.09-893,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2364.028,2368.622,"--You have to -- you would do it differently, because they might be telling the truth."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2455.472,2459.11,Obviously we concede that those kinds of rules are preempted.
2010.09-893,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.11,2471.686,"But what's your answer to his specific effort to assimilate the issue in this case, which is the class action, to the made-up issue, which you concede is a discrimination?"
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2471.686,2472.466,Right.
2010.09-893,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2500.481,2515.213,"What about -- what about a rule that says what you have to have in any contract is a rule that all the rules of the Federal Civil Procedure apply to discovery, not necessarily in a courtroom, but you have to follow exactly those procedures?"
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2515.213,2522.225,"--I think that would bring into play the second limiting principle, because parties could contract, obviously, to agree to certain procedural rules like that."
2010.09-893,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2526.877,2527.177,Okay.
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2529.33,2529.626,Right.
2010.09-893,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2570.766,2580.264,"Mr. Gupta, is -- I'd like you to focus on Stolt-Nielsen."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2636.192,2642.084,I think Stolt-Nielsen is properly read as -- the questions there was a question of contract interpretation.
2010.09-893,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2654.812,2659.889,But here you have an unwilling defendant who doesn't want class arbitration.
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2659.889,2672.851,"Well, the defendant here has specified in its arbitration agreement that if the class-action ban is invalidated, it would prefer to face any class-wide proceedings in court, and that choice is up to the defendant."
2010.09-893,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2706.586,2713.866,"Mr. Gupta, AT&T says that nobody would ever choose class arbitration; it's the worst of both worlds."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2727.031,2736.651,"--I think one answer to that is that some parties have chosen class arbitration, and we cite some examples in the brief."
2010.09-893,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.15,2775.54,Of course.
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2787.738,2796.7,"--I mean, one could say the same thing about many of the procedural limitations that both parties agree are subject to the unconscionability doctrine."
2010.09-893,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2846.411,2853.755,"That's true, as long as those impediments are removed on an -- on an equal footing with all contracts."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2853.755,2854.035,--That's right.
2010.09-893,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2873.103,2879.008,"Can I take you back to a question that was asked a few minutes ago, because I'm not sure I understood your answer."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2891.256,2902.123,"I think in the first instance, I don't think that -- I'm assuming that you're describing a rule that purports to apply general contract law, let's say unconscionability; right?"
2010.09-893,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2902.123,2902.388,"Yes, uh-huh."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2902.388,2915.994,I don't think -- I think it would be hard for a State to credibly claim that the absence of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure systematically exculpate one party from -- from liability.
2010.09-893,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2916.322,2920.712,"No, I just -- I'm not putting this under an unconscionability label."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2931.409,2947.513,"--Well, whether or not they constitute discrimination against arbitration, I think your first hypothetical would be preempted, because a State could not credibly be serving the purposes that the savings clause serves in insisting on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
2010.09-893,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2947.513,2947.825,Why?
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,2947.825,2956.666,Because -- because I don't think that a credible argument can be made that that systematically serves and functions as an exculpatory clause.
2010.09-893,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2969.987,2974.39,"No, but I really would appreciate it if you would answer my hypothetical on one that was posed before."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,3001.004,3025.322,"--No, I think -- I think -- I think a better way to analyze that is under the rubric of obstacle preemption, because there are important purposes that are served by the savings clause in invalidating certain procedural procedures that have an exculpatory effect, a substantively unfair effect, but at the same time the act, to be able to function, has to allow parties to contract for--"
2010.09-893,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3025.322,3025.619,"Well, okay."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,3042.343,3042.643,--Right.
2010.09-893,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3042.643,3049.311,"--we have to make a value judgment about whether these things, one thing or the other, fits with arbitration."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,3051.296,3052.981,"No, I think -- I think that's not right."
2010.09-893,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3073.567,3086.719,"And when it -- when it imposes the rule that the -- the rules of evidence apply across the board, it says it feels that these are necessary in order for parties to be treated fairly in every method of adjudication."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,3086.719,3087.187,Right.
2010.09-893,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3103.866,3105.741,Where do we look to find the answer?
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,3156.871,3176.52,"--I think you have to look first at what the State law is trying to do, and the -- the hypotheticals about the insistence on jury trials, insistence on Federal Rules of Evidence or civil procedure, those are clear -- it just would not be credible for a State, I think, to say that those things are required."
2010.09-893,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3176.52,3179.737,Is your test a purpose test or an effects test?
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,3189.248,3190.621,I think you can look to both.
2010.09-893,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3253.032,3263.873,If you stick with the theory that the test is whether or not the law in question is inconsistent with the idea of arbitration -- whose idea of arbitration?
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,3273.914,3274.32,Right.
2010.09-893,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3323.941,3333.218,"Yes, but I -- I find it difficult to regard as -- voiding exculpatory contracts."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,3366.847,3372.423,"--Well, with respect, Justice Scalia, that is not the rule of law that this State has announced."
2010.09-893,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3387.588,3387.806,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-893,1,20895,deepak_gupta,,3387.806,3388.493,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-893,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3388.493,3391.226,"Mr. Pincus, you have 4 minutes remaining."
2010.09-893,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3391.226,3393.13,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
