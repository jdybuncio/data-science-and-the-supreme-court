1986.86-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,52.033,"Mr. Schafer, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,52.033,61.722,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-6,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,141.507,144.459,In the meantime he had been sentenced?
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,144.459,145.592,"--Yes, he had been, Your Honor."
1986.86-6,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,145.592,148.077,Why did the State rush to judgment on the sentence?
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,148.077,154.414,"I wouldn't classify it a rush to judgment, Your Honor, but I would say this, although it does not appear in the record."
1986.86-6,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,195.122,198.943,Don't you normally wait until all the litigation is concluded?
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,203.478,205.728,"We did not know that, Your Honor."
1986.86-6,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,223.071,229.676,"Well, it seems to me there ought to be a place in the great State of Arizona where you could have safe incarceration."
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,229.676,233.211,"Well, it was more than safety, Your Honor."
1986.86-6,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,244.317,246.602,Where are Dunlap and Robison now?
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,246.602,250.054,Mr. Robison is still in prison on a different charge.
1986.86-6,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,253.056,255.29,He is free?
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,255.29,256.724,"Yes, he is."
1986.86-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.794,468.329,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Schafer."
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,484.458,490.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,642.493,647.497,"Mr. Schafer, let me just ask one procedural question, if I may."
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,661.74,663.356,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,663.356,666.208,And certiorari was sought here and refused?
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,666.208,666.808,That is correct.
1986.86-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,666.808,672.196,And in the second federal habeas he did not raise the issue?
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,672.196,673.548,He did not raise it.
1986.86-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,673.548,678.416,And the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals sui sponte ordered it briefed?
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,678.416,679.785,"Correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,679.785,682.67,When the second habeas was on appeal there?
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,682.67,683.304,Yes.
1986.86-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,683.304,690.76,But your petition for certiorari raises no objections to that rather curious procedure?
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,690.76,691.893,"We have not, Your Honor."
1986.86-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,694.545,694.862,All right.
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,694.862,713.356,"As this Court noted in Jeffers, there are exceptions to the Brown lesser included offense rule, and as I say, one of those is where the defendant himself asks for two trials or where his deliberate actions force two trials."
1986.86-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,718.91,731.985,"Mr. Schafer, if the Supreme Court of Arizona had come out the other way in construing Adamson's plea bargain, you would concede, I suppose, that what he said was correct?"
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,731.985,733.918,"I think I would have to, Your Honor."
1986.86-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,733.918,734.135,Yes.
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,738.472,740.589,"Yes, if they had ruled that way."
1986.86-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,740.589,755.6,"And as I understand, what he says is that as soon as he got the final word from the Supreme Court of Arizona on their construction of it, he offered to restore matters to the status quo ante as best he could."
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,757.716,760.468,I don't disagree with what he did.
1986.86-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,786.953,798.093,"And so, you say he construed... and I am not saying you are wrong, but you say he construed the agreement at his peril, so to speak, like most other contracting parties do."
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,801.295,803.145,Yes.
1986.86-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.317,821.423,Isn't it rather hair-splitting to say that the state court has the ultimate word on what the contract means?
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,831.148,835.783,"I think we have to concede, Your Honor, that that would be a federal question as to whether double jeopardy was waived."
1986.86-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.783,841.754,"Well, there could hardly be a voluntary waiver if the meaning of the contract was unclear, could there?"
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,841.754,851.11,"Your Honor, I see that quite clearly and that's a factual determination, as to what were the terms of the agreement which, if I liken to--"
1986.86-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,851.11,861.433,"That's right, so it comes down to saying that the state court decides what the agreement meant but we decide whether the agreement clearly meant that?"
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,872.725,876.527,"--I wouldn't concede that, Your Honor."
1986.86-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.414,890.187,How could it be... how could we hold that there was a voluntary waiver if we think the agreement was unclear?
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,890.187,897.674,"I don't believe... well, in that kind of a scenario I believe I would have a problem and so would the Court in that regard."
1986.86-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,897.674,897.974,Right.
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,897.974,904.261,"But I don't believe this Court can go back over to what the Arizona Supreme Court has already done, which is supported by the record."
1986.86-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,904.261,907.113,But do you agree that there must be a voluntary waiver?
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,907.113,911.266,"Your Honor, it was just for the purpose of the answer to that question."
1986.86-6,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,937.482,941.084,"Well, what does apply if Zerbst doesn't, Scott?"
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,941.084,963.199,"--Your Honor, I believe that this Court has said, and I think the two cases are Tateo and Dinitz, if I recall, that in this kind of a situation, and I liken it to this where there is a retrial after reversal, that the considerations that go into Johnson versus Zerbst really do not apply and perhaps they should not apply in this situation."
1986.86-6,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,963.199,969.77,"Well, I agree with you on that, but because I think that is what U.S. versus Scott said specifically."
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,974.472,999.789,"I believe I would be, Your Honor, and my argument is that Johnson versus Zerbst really should not apply here because there are other considerations that this Court has to have in mind and they could not be fulfilled, I think in most of the cases, if we were to apply a Johnson versus Zerbst theory to this and require that there be a knowing and voluntary waiver by the defendant."
1986.86-6,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1117.414,1123.085,"All this could be avoided had you not had him sentenced, couldn't it?"
1986.86-6,0,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,1123.085,1124.687,It may well have been.
1986.86-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1124.687,1127.305,"Thank you, Mr. Schafer."
1986.86-6,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1128.839,1140.697,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1244.229,1267.594,"Mr. Englert, do you think that it would be possible for a defendant who had entered into a plea agreement of this type to ever make a good faith challenge to a provision in the agreement that the defendant thought was unclear without thereby in effect waiving the double jeopardy--"
1986.86-6,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1267.594,1268.796,"It most certainly would, Your Honor."
1986.86-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1291.579,1308.755,"--But by taking the route of challenging the enforceability of the agreement and refusing to testify unless and until it was clarified as it was in this manner, would not suffice?"
1986.86-6,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1308.755,1312.057,"I should think not, Your Honor."
1986.86-6,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1342.178,1345.547,You are speaking now of the April 1980 agreement?
1986.86-6,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1345.547,1351.034,"Your Honor, I am speaking of the April 30, 1980 letter from Mr. Adamson's counsel."
1986.86-6,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1351.034,1352.968,Do you feel that was a breach of the agreement?
1986.86-6,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1352.968,1353.819,Absolutely.
1986.86-6,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1353.819,1359.104,"Well, I thought it was conceded that it was not one."
1986.86-6,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1359.104,1363.425,"Your Honor, I was not at the argument before the Ninth Circuit."
1986.86-6,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1370.595,1377.816,"Well, if it is conceded, why are we bothering with it up here?"
1986.86-6,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1377.816,1391.159,"--That concession was mistaken, and that, I believe, is made clear starting with the letter of April 9th, 1980 from the State and continuing through six years of proceedings in State courts, federal habeas courts."
1986.86-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1600.393,1601.845,"Thank you, Mr. Englert."
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,1603.279,1609.233,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1968.36,1971.043,"In the sentence before that, Mr. Ford, he said,"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,1979.464,1993.522,"Well, I think it is an inartful letter asking for negotiations, Your Honor, and I think that both sides in this case, if they were at this point the negotiations broke down, and I think partly because of these kind of miscommunications between counsel."
1986.86-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.127,2133.113,I don't understand your position.
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2137.248,2140.099,That letter does not constitute a refusal to testify.
1986.86-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.099,2140.718,"You mean if I say,"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2146.455,2148.122,If you say--
1986.86-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2148.122,2149.105,Sort of like assault or--
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2149.105,2155.811,--I want ten million dollars for my testimony and if you don't give it to me we can anticipate that I won't be testifying.
1986.86-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.171,2187.865,"--The agreement surely contemplates his agreement to testify without any further preconditions, so whether you're breaking the agreement simply depends upon whether you are refusing to testify without preconditions or not."
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2198.305,2205.661,I think the agreement contemplated that he could be reprosecuted if he refused to testify.
1986.86-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2205.661,2212.315,"If he refused to testify period, not if he refused to testify including with conditions, right?"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2212.315,2212.898,That's correct.
1986.86-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.49,2233.061,A person wouldn't be entitled to treat a contract as breached upon that statement?
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2233.061,2235.18,"Under the restatement, no."
1986.86-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2270.167,2275.721,"But supposing the seller delivers the 1,000 widgets and says,"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2285.577,2292.35,"--Well, under the law of anticipatory breach as I understand it, Mr. Chief Justice, if the person says,"
1986.86-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2302.005,2306.157,"You use the word, ""We can anticipate that"", instead of, ""I won't""?"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2326.404,2344.198,"--It is very close to a refusal, but it is... again, Justice Scalia, I think it is important that we are talking in a context of agreements between lawyers and discussions between lawyers, where lawyers can take and disagree over their position without forfeiting all their client's rights."
1986.86-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2344.198,2355.84,"But that is not just what the law... when you make noises like a lawyer you have consequences like lawyers, and that's what the doctrine of anticipatory breach is all about."
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2359.208,2381.621,"Without... well, let me retreat from the position and point out, because I do not want to get fixed to this question of whether or not... I mean the State, the important thing is, I guess, if this is a breach, I think as your question earlier to Mr. Schafer pointed out, Mr. Roberts, the Assistant Attorney General of the State of Arizona conceded in the Ninth Circuit this wasn't a breach."
1986.86-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2381.621,2384.923,But we are not bound by concessions made in the Ninth Circuit.
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2384.923,2397.0,"Well, perhaps you are not, Mr. Chief Justice, but at least it indicates that a reasonable person with some knowledge of this case and the law could believe that Mr. Adamson could write that letter or his lawyers could write that letter without breach."
1986.86-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2397.0,2401.952,"That it may indicate, but certainly we evaluate for ourselves what is before us."
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2405.254,2412.926,"I agree, Your Honor, and of course it's not... again the question is not breach."
1986.86-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.91,2445.064,"Well, why do you need a waiver in this case, Mr. Ford?"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2452.735,2460.156,"--Well, Dinitz and Scott, as I understand them, involve a different double jeopardy interest."
1986.86-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2471.095,2472.547,That is secondary.
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2472.547,2487.724,"This Court certainly said, I believe in Dinitz itself, that this is not the same as the central common-law basis for the double jeopardy clause which are the three common-law pleas and one of those is what is involved in here."
1986.86-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2558.736,2563.724,"Well, that depends on what voluntary election you want to talk about."
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2600.211,2604.179,"Justice Scalia, I hate to split this hair, but it's a critical hair in this case."
1986.86-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.179,2604.646,--I understand.
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2604.646,2607.881,"And that is, he did not agree that if he should breach he could be retried."
1986.86-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.829,2680.613,Why can't you?
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2680.613,2681.779,There is a question of voluntariness in the future.
1986.86-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2681.779,2684.698,"Just bringing waiver, what's the matter with it?"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2684.698,2687.4,It's a waiver that involves two different event.
1986.86-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.393,2733.779,"So, there was really no way to enter into this plea agreement?"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2740.183,2742.118,--I think there absolutely was.
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2776.041,2794.252,"Well, what if the agreement had just right out said he would testify as often as necessary against these people, if they are convicted after the first trial and appeal successfully he will testify at the second trial?"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2802.941,2824.272,"It has been our position from the beginning, at least arguendo, I think, Justice White, that if he were with clear knowledge that he was in breach to have done an act that the agreement said clearly was... waived his double jeopardy rights--"
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.272,2833.627,"Well, he just refused to testify and refused to perform a contractual obligation."
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2837.746,2843.0,"--Again, I am having difficulty with the contract language."
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2854.938,2857.354,"No, no, my example is, he says,"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2861.942,2864.127,--And I agree that--
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2864.127,2868.996,"And then, then after the reversal he says,"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2882.838,2884.707,"--If the agreement says,"
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.277,2892.644,"Well, the agreement didn't say that."
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2895.313,2904.835,--I don't see how... the loss of federal constitutional rights doesn't follow automatically from any breach of contract.
1986.86-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2906.871,2909.906,Would you answer Justice White's question for me if you won't answer it for him?
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2909.906,2911.656,"--I am sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2912.406,2915.81,"The question is, if the agreement said,"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2933.937,2934.421,I am sorry.
1986.86-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2941.175,2947.079,"It simply says,"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2959.851,2967.074,--Unless there is something in the plea agreement that either implicitly or explicitly waives double jeopardy--
1986.86-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2967.074,2969.608,"--Well, say what's in this plea agreement."
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2969.608,2982.833,"--If what is in this plea agreement was in the plea agreement in the situation that Justice White has described, we would say that a waiver could be found under those circumstances, and a knowing and voluntary waiver could be found."
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2985.951,2990.003,Even if he hadn't been sentenced and spent time in jail?
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2990.003,2992.105,--If he has waived the double jeopardy right.
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3008.548,3009.515,"So, you say that--"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3009.515,3010.4,It certainly was not here.
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.4,3019.838,--Didn't he... I guess he did plead... he pled guilty to the lesser offense before there was any trial of these other people?
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3019.838,3022.874,"It was mid-trial, mid-jury selection, Your Honor."
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3022.874,3024.357,He pled guilty?
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3024.357,3024.909,Yes.
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3024.909,3037.317,"He pled guilty and suppose then after pleading guilty to the offense, suppose that he then refused to testify at all, even once?"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3037.317,3038.834,Right at that moment?
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3038.834,3039.502,Right.
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3039.502,3046.323,"Number one, again, of course, it could be construed as a waiver of double jeopardy under the same circumstances and should be."
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.373,3057.38,"Well, he did... from a refusal to perform his contractual duty, you would say, is equivalent, you would say, to a waiver of double jeopardy?"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3057.38,3060.165,--I do not say they are equivalent to.
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3068.669,3072.807,"Suppose we found that, and you would say weren't wrong then?"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3072.807,3077.092,--Found that with regard to a waiver under those--
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3077.092,3077.592,Yes.
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3077.592,3081.496,"--circumstances, I would say you were not wrong."
1986.86-6,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.333,3091.769,"Well, wasn't the conviction when he pled guilty?"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3091.769,3094.22,"Well, that's a good question."
1986.86-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.246,3167.75,"Mr. Ford, can I ask you a question about the agreement because you are getting into the other crimes now which are one of the things that interests me."
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3185.444,3190.598,"There was one case left, Justice Stevens, and that involved this Ashford Plumbing case."
1986.86-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3229.057,3231.592,And also I want to be sure on this.
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3248.868,3249.887,The day after sentencing.
1986.86-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3249.887,3255.005,"The day after sentencing, so it was also before that one bit of testimony, the last one you mentioned, had taken place?"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3255.005,3256.973,The last one never has taken place.
1986.86-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3259.325,3265.979,"You did not contend, I take it, at any time that the transfer of custody violated the agreement?"
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3265.979,3268.662,"No, it was the--"
1986.86-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3268.662,3274.733,Your interpretation was the agreement had been fully performed at the time of the transfer; that's your reading?
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3274.733,3275.418,--I wasn't there.
1986.86-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3306.837,3308.056,That that only pertained to the one case?
1986.86-6,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,3308.056,3310.674,--It pertained to the one case and that's what Mr. Schafer said.
1986.86-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3387.039,3389.022,"Thank you very much, Mr. Ford."
1986.86-6,3,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3390.924,3397.562,The agreement was that Mr. Adamson would testify in four cases.
1986.86-6,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3443.576,3445.745,And this of course waives that.
1986.86-6,3,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3462.171,3466.908,"--Your Honor, I hearken back then to the Arizona Supreme Court findings."
1986.86-6,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3490.29,3492.89,But what did they say about paragraph 18?
1986.86-6,3,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3492.89,3497.778,--They do not discuss paragraph 18.
1986.86-6,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3497.778,3506.467,Because it does say he is to remain in the Sheriff's custody until the conclusion of his testimony in all of the cases in which the defendant agrees to testify as a result of this agreement.
1986.86-6,3,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3506.467,3507.167,Yes.
1986.86-6,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3507.167,3513.437,"So, does not that contemplate his transfer will not occur until he has performed his testimonial obligation?"
1986.86-6,3,46339,william_j_schafer_iii,,3513.437,3522.578,"Well, I think a reasonable reading of that provision is that simply when he is sentenced he is going to go into federal custody."
1986.86-6,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3539.921,3541.505,"Thank you, Mr. Schafer."
