1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,52.036,We’ll hear arguments next in Caban against Mohammed.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,55.322,55.986,Thank you Your Honor.
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,56.48,60.656,"Raise the lectern if you’d like, the lectern itself."
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,69.53,71.052,Thank you.
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,186.485,188.758,And who was this stepfather again?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,188.758,191.478,The stepfather was the husband of the mother.
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,191.478,194.191,"That’s of some significant, isn’t it?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,194.191,204.829,"I think that it is only perhaps of some significance if we have first disposed of the rights and interest of the father himself, of the natural father who had been raising the child."
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,204.829,218.902,"Now, if these children were going to be adopted into either family, that is, the new family, that is that of the natural father and his new wife or that of the natural mother and her new husband."
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,218.902,219.242,Yes.
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,219.242,229.258,"If there was going to be any adoption at all as between those, the rights of one of the natural parents were going to be terminated in the drastic and dramatic way you’ve just described, isn’t it?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,229.258,233.162,I would have to agree with Your Honor that that is what would have happened.
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,233.162,234.827,In the event an adoption --
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,234.827,236.077,By either side.
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,236.077,242.301,"By either side, and the rights one of the natural parents are going to be terminated in just the complete and dramatic way you describe, isn’t that correct?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,242.301,244.031,There is no question about that at all.
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,244.031,261.466,So wouldn’t your -- I think the -- am I correct in understanding that the logical consequence of your argument would be that the only affair and indeed the only constitutional thing to do in a situation such as this one is not to have any adoption at all.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,261.466,263.836,"That is precisely, that is precisely what my argument is."
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,263.836,264.2,That’s right.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,264.2,276.586,I do not see how the father could take the child away from the mother to the point where his wife would become the adoptive mother of the child and the original mother would be left out in the cold and I make no claim of that sir.
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,276.586,288.708,"If the father, the adoptive father, had succeeded and did succeed ultimately, the child would acquire another source of support, would it not?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,288.708,289.476,Well the child would have had that --
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,289.476,291.403,Legally enforceable source of support.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,291.403,303.975,"No, the child already had another source of support under the New York Law, because under New York Law a stepfather is also made responsible for the support of his child whether or not that child is adopted by the stepfather."
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,332.427,335.224,How does it destroy that relationship?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,342.663,345.503,"That is right, but this was not a custody case."
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,346.274,348.017,"No, but they do have the power."
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,348.017,361.448,"They must, they must place the child in terms of custody with whichever parent it is in the best interest of the child to have the custody, but that does not cause the termination of parental rights."
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,374.937,380.334,Is that foreclosed if the child is adopted by the new husband?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,380.334,384.315,The adoption has a different effect from custody.
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,385.423,387.514,My question is does it foreclose?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,387.514,389.284,"Yes, the adoption --"
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,389.284,394.667,Does it mean the Court doesn’t have the power to permit visitation rights for the natural father?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,394.667,395.872,It does not.
1978.77-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,457.886,465.205,Are you suggesting counsel that these children had a very stable relationship before the adoption proceeding?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,465.205,475.5,"Yes, there is no question about that these children had a stable relationship with their father and I would think probably with their mother before the adoption proceedings took place."
1978.77-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,475.5,486.403,Would you call it -- would you think it was something that New York was constitutionally required to say met the minimum standards for raising of children?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,486.403,487.51,I don’t quite understand Your Honor’s question.
1978.77-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,487.51,500.414,"Well, the shifting back and forth and the tensions that obviously existed, didn’t your client take the children back at one time and didn’t your opponent’s client take the children at one time?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,500.414,500.759,Yes.
1978.77-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,544.601,555.55,"Well, it sounds to me like your argument is kind of like a joint tenancy one, that on divorce the husband gets a half right on the children and the wife gets a half right on the children."
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,563.875,570.757,"Well, actually that maybe New York’s interest, if that is what New York says and I don’t believe that it is quite what New York says."
1978.77-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,600.826,606.699,The family broke up when the natural mother and the natural father separated didn’t it for all practical purposes?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,606.699,610.062,"Not the family, between the children and their respective parents --"
1978.77-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,610.062,612.023,But that’s two different families.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,612.023,618.903,"Well, the family that we are concerned with here is the family of the children and the family of the parents and while the parents may separate --"
1978.77-6431,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,618.903,621.789,Mr. Silk this is a strange family.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,632.219,634.222,That is the situation that was created by the mother --
1978.77-6431,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,634.222,636.54,But that’s not a normal family.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,636.54,647.094,"No it wasn’t, and my client did everything he could to make it a normal family by bringing the children back to Puerto Rico and when the children came back to Puerto Rico, the matter went into the Family Court --"
1978.77-6431,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,647.094,649.343,It still wasn’t a normal family.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,649.343,659.835,"Well, once the children came back from Puerto Rico, it was as normal as families of divorced families by the millions are when they have children."
1978.77-6431,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,663.377,669.162,But then maybe I object here saying that a divorced family is a normal family.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,669.162,695.993,"Well, maybe it’s more normal than we think I am afraid, because I agree with Your Honor, that it is not anything that is to be looked for, but there are, on the other hand, millions of divorced families in this country and they have managed sometimes through the aid of family courts to work out custody problem and visitation problems and support problems so that the children are not shuttled back and forth."
1978.77-6431,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,697.568,702.295,I think we all know that; why not get to this case.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,702.295,715.437,Your Honor what happened in this particular case is that the Trial Judge made a determination and he made a determination in his opinion and it has been upheld through all the New York courts.
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,715.437,724.835,And that opinion was that the best interests of the child called for there being with the mother and that this adoption should proceed.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,724.835,742.493,"That was part of it, but part of his opinion was that my client had no right to object to an adoption that, that was not a legal necessity, and the prime objective, and Your Honor is quite right and I may read the opinion at Page 8, the Appendix 28."
1978.77-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,790.628,796.102,Aren’t you reading the word prime as if it were only in that sense?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,800.824,818.276,"It might be but in this case the judge was saying that it was the prime objective but he had no other objective whatsoever to show and he did say that a putative father’s consent to such an adoption is not a legal necessity, at Page 27 of the Appendix."
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,820.012,822.78,"Well, that’s what the statute clearly provides, doesn’t it?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,822.78,823.625,And that’s what under --
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,823.625,828.693,He was accurate in that statement insofar as he was reciting then law of New York.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,828.693,829.968,He certainly was.
1978.77-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,836.834,843.73,Do you contend that the putative father constitutionally has an absolute right to veto an adoption like this?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,843.73,848.454,"A putative father -- no I would not want to call him a putative father, he is the natural father."
1978.77-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,863.242,868.691,But are you saying that all natural fathers have that right or just your client under these particular circumstances?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,868.691,878.039,"I am saying all natural fathers who performed as did my client, and I am saying that all natural fathers have that right who had a relationship with his child."
1978.77-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,950.763,952.18,By the maternal grandparents.
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,952.18,955.059,MThat was not an adoption case at all.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,955.059,959.136,It was a parental termination rights case and in terms of termination of --
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,959.136,961.082,Well the mother was deceased as I remember.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,961.082,962.366,The mother was deceased.
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,962.366,971.19,And it was the matter of the custody rights as the natural father vis-à-vis the custody rights of the state -- institutionalizing him under the agency of the state.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,971.19,972.662,What I believe –-
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,972.662,973.743,Am I wrong in my recollection?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,973.743,989.027,"Well, I believe that it was a little more than that, because I believe that the child was being treated as someone who could be placed, taken by the state and, made award of the State of Illinois, placed for adoption, and the father’s rights were in effect being terminated by the proceedings that was taking place."
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,989.027,991.257,Custodial rights.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,991.257,991.686,Well it was –-
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,991.686,993.809,"It was not an adoption case, you would agree with that."
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,993.809,995.71,"No, it was not an adoption case."
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,998.265,1001.516,And the natural mother was dead.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1001.516,1002.09,"Yes, but part –- well, I would there say that --"
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1002.09,1003.271,That’s also correct.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1004.711,1014.783,-- that I do not see how it can be justifiably maintained that a father’s relationship with his children is any less valuable and important than a mother’s relationships with a child.
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1014.783,1020.058,"Well, the point is in Stanley, you didn’t have a competition between the two because the mother was dead."
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1020.058,1021.699,"Yes, that is true."
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1031.858,1047.037,"But, the competition in Stanley was first of all not for adoption at all, at least at that stage, simply for custody and secondly between the natural father, who had not only sired but raised the children on the hand and the state on the other."
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1047.976,1052.096,"Yes, that is absolutely correct Your Honor."
1978.77-6431,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1115.861,1117.43,May I interrupt you a minute?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1127.531,1129.013,No.
1978.77-6431,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1129.956,1138.066,What would the situation under the statue be if neither parent had any relationship with the child at the time?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1150.394,1158.815,"If it had been found that the mother had abandoned the child, then the mother would have no rights under the New York statute."
1978.77-6431,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1158.815,1160.238,Does the statute say that?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1160.238,1160.751,Yes.
1978.77-6431,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1160.751,1161.088,I think it does.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1161.088,1180.548,"But anything less than abandonment, any skimpy kind of a relationship which might in New York not constitute abandonment, the skimpy kind of relationship that Mr. Quilloin had with his child, if the mother had that sort of relationship with the child in New York, that would not under New York law constitute abandonment, because --"
1978.77-6431,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1180.548,1186.137,"In this case, relationship is really immaterial except a sort of back ground, isn’t it?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1188.335,1193.22,I see the relationship in this case to be the protected interest.
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1213.157,1226.38,"If you prevail here, how will these rights that you’re claiming to be protective, who is going to decide how often he can see the child? Domestic Relations I suppose, is that right?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1226.38,1233.731,"Yes, insofar as custody and insofar as visitation is concerned, we are not asking this Court to make any determination."
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1234.243,1236.574,I am asking you the consequence if you prevailed here.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1236.574,1250.84,"The consequences if we prevail here would be that the matter would go back to the family court and custody would be determined, and visitation would be determined, and support would be determined in the best interest of the child in an equity and fairness to all parties."
1978.77-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1250.84,1253.367,Provided custody would necessarily resolve under your --
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1253.367,1256.272,"No, it would not necessarily resolve at all."
1978.77-6431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1279.819,1281.657,Just like in divorce cases.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1281.657,1284.419,"Yes, it would be exactly like divorce cases."
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1284.419,1309.724,"But it is true Mr. Silk, isn’t it, and I think perhaps I am repeating the question I asked at the outset that if you’re correct, it would follow that at least in the situation that you alleged this situation to be, that the constitution of the United States would absolutely prohibit and prevent the possibility of any adoption of these children, by anybody."
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1309.724,1310.347,Well it would prevent the --
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1310.347,1310.9,"Isn’t that, isn’t that correct?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1310.9,1315.213,It would prevent the adoption unless the parents agree that the children should be adopted.
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1316.846,1329.208,"But if you are correct in your constitutional claim, wouldn’t it follow that the constitution of the United States would prevent the adoption of these children by anybody so long as you and your opponents remain in a litigating posture."
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1338.838,1341.921,An adoption which would cause the replacement of a parent who is fit --
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1341.921,1344.999,And that’s an adoption you’ve told us inevitably does.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1344.999,1351.451,"Well, a parent might consent to it and the other parent might consent to the adoption by the other one, in other words there maybe a reason where they --"
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1351.451,1362.65,"Well, few people had agreed on this matter, this wouldn’t be a -- ever been a lawsuit and this case wouldn’t be here, I am assuming that you are going to be litigating it, and that you are not change your position and that your adversaries not either."
1978.77-6431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.65,1366.262,"That’s where New York leaves divorce parents, isn't it?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1366.262,1367.746,That’s exactly where New York leaves divorce parents.
1978.77-6431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.746,1374.615,-- where either parent can veto absent some finding of unfitness.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1374.615,1385.739,"Well, either parent -- if the parents are divorced, the situation would be the same as it would be here if I should prevail in this case, yes."
1978.77-6431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.543,1405.31,"In divorced parents, as long as they haven’t been found to be unfit, each of them, under New York law, can prevent the adoption."
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1405.31,1408.047,Oh yes without any question whatsoever.
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1408.047,1413.25,But either one of them can control the custody by exercise of any kind of a veto.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1413.25,1417.839,"No, if there is a dispute over custody that will be what Court decides will be in the best interest of the child’s right."
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1417.839,1418.953,If the Court decides it.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1418.953,1419.181,Yes.
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1419.181,1420.257,With visitation rights.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1420.257,1423.855,"With visitation rights, but parental rights preserved."
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1423.855,1429.005,If the Judge thinks visitation rights are good for the child.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1429.005,1436.487,Visitation rights are almost invariably granted to one extent or to another extent in New York depending upon the facts.
1978.77-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.789,1558.981,But that Prince was a case where the mother and father were both united against the state.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1564.56,1580.628,"But again we are not dealing with custody, we are dealing with termination and rupture of parental rights, and it isn't the mother against the father, it’s a stranger against the father because the mother is not replacing the father as a father, it is the stranger who is taking the father’s place."
1978.77-6431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1580.628,1590.099,"All I am saying is that your quote from Prince is in a context where the mother and father were not separated, they were united in opposing an intrusion of the state."
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1592.79,1598.144,"In Quilloin against Walcott, we had very similar situation."
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1636.968,1644.589,"What would be your view if you had an infant, two or three weeks old or two or three months old, just old enough to be put out for adoption?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1655.21,1664.772,"I would say that the natural father, if he had played a role even as brief as it possibly could have been, a parental role, a parental relationship --"
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1664.772,1672.716,"If he’s the natural father and he paid the hospital bills and he objected to the person to whom the mother wants to place the child for adoption, does he have a constitutional right?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1672.716,1678.666,And he was barely able although he tried to establish some sort of connection with the child and shows some concern.
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1678.666,1682.172,He just doesn’t want -- he doesn’t want the adoption to be placed for that particular person.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1682.172,1702.206,"Yes, I would say that he did, because he had an interest in that child which was as young and new as the child was itself and he couldn’t possibly have established a stronger relationship than he did and he tried and if he made the effort, then I think that the child was lucky to have a concerned father who wanted to look after this child’s interest, and if that --"
1978.77-6431,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1702.206,1707.887,"I am not talking about looking after his interest, I just said he have a standing, does he have an absolute constitutional right to object, and your answer is yes."
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1707.887,1713.435,"My answer is yes, again depending on the facts of that particular relationship."
1978.77-6431,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1713.435,1716.913,"Mr. Silk, may I ask you somewhat related question?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1738.465,1739.59,"No, I would not."
1978.77-6431,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1739.59,1741.407,"That would meet your equal protection issue, wouldn’t it?"
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1741.407,1743.541,It would not be meet my due process issue.
1978.77-6431,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1743.541,1745.319,But it would meet your equal protection issue?
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1745.319,1748.316,"Well, if they’re equal, at least they would be equal but it would not --"
1978.77-6431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.316,1751.248,If it applied then to married and divorced.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1751.248,1756.809,"They would have to apply to both, I understood the question to apply to all parents."
1978.77-6431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1756.809,1757.392,Yes.
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1757.392,1758.717,That’s the way I understood it.
1978.77-6431,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1787.076,1800.269,"I didn’t understand the question would be the -- the state went in, and I understood that my brother Powell’s question was the two parties together go into the state and ask for this."
1978.77-6431,0,40425,robert_h_silk,,1800.269,1807.569,"If the state in this particular case has entered it, of course, through its courts and through its laws."
1978.77-6431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1852.955,1856.104,Mr. Schulslaper.
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,1856.104,1863.571,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-6431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1993.004,2000.344,You are telling us that the New York definition of the best interest of the child may include the concern of the natural father.
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2000.344,2004.024,They include all facets.
1978.77-6431,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2026.913,2031.015,In other words you are telling that there is not a just an automatic veto.
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2031.015,2033.09,Absolutely not Your Honor.
1978.77-6431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2067.226,2073.036,"Counsel before you go into the fact, let me just question one statement you made."
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2092.472,2097.189,The use of the word veto troubles me Your Honor.
1978.77-6431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2097.189,2099.975,"Well, an unqualified right to prevent the adoption for taking place."
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2099.975,2103.278,Could he -- could she have prevented the adoption?
1978.77-6431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2133.884,2136.593,"Well, that was -- that would be only under the statute if one of the --"
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2136.593,2136.981,That is correct.
1978.77-6431,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2136.981,2139.267,-- if terms and conditions of Section 6 apply.
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2139.267,2140.188,That is correct.
1978.77-6431,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2140.188,2141.821,It would be a two-step process.
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2141.821,2142.206,Exactly.
1978.77-6431,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2142.206,2145.303,The first step would be one of the dispensing conditions.
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2145.303,2176.911,"Exactly, under low circumstances, and her circumstance, because she has the right or you require her consent, there is little question that you would have produce strong evidence, and there was a little question that under least circumstances, the state, whether it was a State of Georgia under Quilloin or the State of New York has the right to accept what Mr. Justice Burger said in his dissenting opinion in Stanley versus Illinois."
1978.77-6431,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2176.911,2179.763,That won’t help you very much counsel; that was dissenting opinion.
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2179.763,2190.493,"I quite understand it was a dissenting opinion Your Honor, but I point out, as Mr. Justice Marshall pointed out that this was not an adoption proceeding."
1978.77-6431,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2251.728,2258.811,How important are these facts to this statute which we are talking about?
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2292.534,2293.496,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-6431,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2293.496,2298.5,So what’s the difference in this case? We are talking about this statute.
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2298.5,2300.932,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-6431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2366.405,2370.075,Do I understand counsel; we are you now denying paternity here?
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2370.075,2377.181,I am not; I am trying to point out that this man’s interest was not of the great depth that he now describes.
1978.77-6431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.181,2380.012,"Well, a little while ago you used the word putative father."
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2380.012,2385.095,"Yes, reputative, a reputed father."
1978.77-6431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.095,2386.618,You said putative.
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2386.618,2396.397,"That is correct Your Honor, as I understand that the word by definition is reputed."
1978.77-6431,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.397,2412.704,"Counsel if we could get away from the facts of this particular case for a moment, what do you say as to what is the justification for a rule that treats the mother’s power and the attempt by the father, the natural father to adopt differently from the father’s right, to object to the mother’s attempt to adopt?"
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2412.704,2420.457,This Court has so held them Quilloin versus Walcott that the father had less veto power --
1978.77-6431,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2420.457,2423.112,"Counsel, you better stay near the lectern, so that we can all hear."
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2423.112,2441.381,"That this -- that Georgia had the power to give less veto power, to use that word, to the putative father Leon Quilloin than what it was required to give to a father who had been once married, but perhaps divorced."
1978.77-6431,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2441.381,2444.023,In which opinion it was announced?
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2444.023,2447.478,That would be Quilloin versus Walcott.
1978.77-6431,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2592.263,2598.389,"That might have been because they thought that despite their previous dissent, the law of New York was now established."
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2598.389,2603.399,"That might very well have been and it might just as well have been on this record, Your Honor."
1978.77-6431,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2791.288,2824.864,"Mr. Schulslaper do you think the Constitution of the United States requires this Court to go into the all of those facts going to the substantiality of the husband’s interest in his children, maybe under Quilloin it does, but that means that the -- that under the constitution we are required to more or less act as a domestic relations court, which I wonder if many of my colleagues signed on for when they accepted their commissions."
1978.77-6431,1,36636,morris_schulslaper,,2824.864,2826.552,"Your Honor, thank you very much."
1978.77-6431,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2842.384,2847.176,"Mr. Strum, you are going to tell us about the law of this case, the statutes are you?"
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2847.176,2849.479,"Your Honor, I am not going to discuss the facts."
1978.77-6431,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2927.828,2939.322,What do you have to say about the constitutional aspect of a statute which gives a different right to the natural father from the rights given to the natural mother?
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2942.214,2952.95,I believe that the State of New York has the right to make a distinction between a natural mother and a natural father where a child is born out of wedlock.
1978.77-6431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2978.325,2994.098,Well -- are you suggesting that the state can have a law that said that the child could be removed from the care and custody of both parents over their objection as long as the state concluded that it was in the best interests of the child?
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2994.098,2995.697,I would say this Your Honor.
1978.77-6431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2995.697,2997.14,And without some finding of unfitness?
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,2997.14,2998.037,No.
1978.77-6431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.654,3006.981,Well then why -- how -- why doesn’t there have to be some finding unfitness for the father here?
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3006.981,3011.346,Because I don’t believe the father stands in the same shoes as the mother.
1978.77-6431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3014.248,3029.996,"So if he was a, so you think -- if he wanted to adopt, if the father wanted -- the unmarried father wanted to adopt over the objection of the mother, the state could not permit the adoption without some finding of unfitness on the mother."
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3029.996,3034.215,There would have to be some indication or proof.
1978.77-6431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3038.225,3043.339,"It would be the same thing, and I take that the law is where the parents were married but are divorced."
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3043.339,3044.691,"I would say so, yes."
1978.77-6431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.691,3048.285,In that case either parent has --
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3048.285,3054.765,"I wouldn’t use the word veto but either parent, under certain circumstances and under certain statutory --"
1978.77-6431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3054.765,3059.33,"Well, either parent there has more of a right than this father does."
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3059.33,3062.345,"That’s correct Your Honor, and I concede that, but I don’t think that --"
1978.77-6431,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3062.345,3065.963,That gives the wife the veto but -- and denied to the father.
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3065.963,3066.932,Yes.
1978.77-6431,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3066.932,3070.95,"You are going to get the Stanley before you quit, aren’t you?"
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3073.207,3074.275,What was that?
1978.77-6431,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.275,3074.906,The Stanley Case.
1978.77-6431,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3074.906,3076.436,Against Illinois.
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3076.436,3088.212,"I don’t think Stanley versus Illinois has any relationship, has any relationship to the factual situation or the legal situation here."
1978.77-6431,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3102.487,3105.755,"Well, I understood that the mother wasn’t adopting this child."
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3105.755,3108.447,"Yes she was, the mother and her husband."
1978.77-6431,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3108.447,3109.301,Mother and the husband.
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3109.301,3125.578,"Yes, which would be the normal procedure in the case of a natural mother, and I think the Court has a right to say that in order to benefit the child, the child, we will allow such an adoption."
1978.77-6431,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3125.578,3129.432,Are you talking about a statute that applies to any situation?
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3129.432,3132.868,That’s correct Your Honor.
1978.77-6431,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3133.655,3143.09,"And that’s along with the statute that says that strictly on sex and nothing else, you say there’s nothing wrong with that statute."
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3143.09,3150.691,It is not on the basis of sex; it is on the basis of a mother or a father and I think Your Honor --
1978.77-6431,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3150.691,3153.091,Do you know any mothers that are fathers?
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3153.091,3169.706,"No Your Honor, [Laughter] but I think there is a distinction, and I think this Court has recognized it, between natural mothers and natural fathers where they were not married, and I think that’s the important factor here."
1978.77-6431,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3207.664,3217.087,"I am familiar with that case, as I understand, it left this case completely out, didn’t it, didn’t it?"
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3217.087,3219.712,"No, it really didn’t leave this case out."
1978.77-6431,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3222.407,3223.742,(Inaudible)
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3223.742,3226.886,"Well, I think very frankly Your Honor."
1978.77-6431,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3235.97,3242.591,"General Strum, assume a case in which say a child is six years old, spent three years with the father, three years with the mother, no marriage."
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3247.632,3255.83,"I don’t say, I don’t say that their rights are different, I say to you the test will ultimately be the same, the best interest of the child."
1978.77-6431,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.83,3265.844,"Well, I thought everyone had agreed that even if the best interest of child might lie with the father, the mother could still, assumedly she had abandoned all the rest of it, she could still object."
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3269.549,3270.087,"Yes, there is."
1978.77-6431,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3270.087,3277.479,"And assuming that equal time with the child and all the rest of it, six year old child, what's the justification for the difference?"
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3277.479,3295.201,"The difference is that the legislature of the State of New York has determined that a natural mother, absent special circumstances, bears a closer relationship with her child by the very fact of being a mother than a father does."
1978.77-6431,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3306.47,3311.332,You’re saying legislatures determine that but what's the basis for that determination? How do you support that?
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3311.332,3315.807,I think that’s the experience of mankind.
1978.77-6431,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3315.807,3324.373,I see.
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3324.373,3346.928,"As long as a statute bears a reasonable relationship and the object of the legislation is to protect the children, and I don’t think that the father is in a protected class, I don’t think it is for this Court to say that the legislation is improper."
1978.77-6431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3419.748,3423.651,"Well, are you suggesting that there were some findings made that he had abandoned the child?"
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3423.651,3429.551,I am suggesting that the surrogate had before him all of the facts concerning the relationship --
1978.77-6431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3429.551,3432.438,"Yeah, yeah, but are you suggesting that he made any findings about unfitness."
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3432.438,3438.194,"I am not suggesting he made a specific finding of abandonment, no."
1978.77-6431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.194,3439.38,Or unfitness or anything?
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3439.38,3440.212,Or unfitness.
1978.77-6431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3441.508,3445.541,Are you suggesting there should be -- must be facts in the record to warrant such a finding?
1978.77-6431,2,28699,irwin_m_strum,,3445.541,3451.778,I am suggesting that there must be facts in the record to warrant a finding as to the best interest of the child.
1978.77-6431,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3473.479,3474.01,Thank you gentlemen.
