1982.81-1222,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.933,United States against Generix Drug Corporation will be taken up at 1 p.m..
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,34.951,35.294,Thank you.
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,281.868,284.894,May I ask two questions.
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,288.034,290.268,As to what the Government needed to show?
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,290.268,291.363,Yes.
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,291.363,292.096,No.
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.096,293.485,"They were wrong, too?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,293.485,294.565,That's correct.
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,297.221,302.279,"Your position is, even if there's no evidence of dangerousness, that the statute still applies?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,302.279,306.263,"In essence, that's right."
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,306.263,312.057,"And also, your position, if you read the statute literally, would apply to over the counter drugs, too?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,312.057,321.928,"Our position would apply to over the counter drugs, and the FDA treats over the counter drugs in a manner that's consistent with the statute."
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,321.928,327.582,"Well, but it doesn't require a new drug application every time you put a different coating on a piece of aspirin."
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,327.582,328.877,"Well, two things as to over the counter drugs."
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,344.779,346.619,They just don't read the statute literally.
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,348.729,369.205,"They read it literally, but they understand that in looking at what an expert would need as the requisite evidence of safety for an over the counter drug, which, keep in mind, is not as potent, not as toxic, and has a much wider range in which it can be used effectively before you reach overdose situations."
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,369.205,373.783,"Well, some of them can be pretty dangerous, I think, over the counter drugs; can't they?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,373.783,383.527,"They can be, and in fact the FDA does have regulations relating to inactive ingredients of certain over the counter drugs."
1982.81-1222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,397.196,418.328,"Mr. Ganzfried, isn't what the FDA does with over the counter drugs, though, somewhat similar to the test that the district court would have employed, where it said if there is no reasonable possibility that the differences between the excipients will make the product less safe and effective than the recognized product, it would be approved?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,418.328,419.639,"Well, I think they--"
1982.81-1222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,419.639,423.105,"As a practical matter, is that what the FDA--"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,423.105,423.635,--I'm trying to think that through.
1982.81-1222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,448.767,449.266,--Right.
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,456.625,458.013,The Government does not.
1982.81-1222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,461.936,467.948,What is the definitional line between prescription drugs and over the counter drugs?
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,467.948,491.498,"The definitional line is that if the finding is made by the Food and Drug Administration that a particular drug product has sufficient risks or side effects attendant to it that it cannot be sold without a doctor's prescription and under a doctor's care, those drugs require prescriptions."
1982.81-1222,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,511.085,513.99,Do you mean aspirin and bufferin and so forth?
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,513.99,516.505,--Those are over the counter drugs.
1982.81-1222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,516.505,526.343,"Well, supposing I decided I'm going to go ahead and manufacture something called ""Ufferin"", which is just like aspirin only it's buffered a little bit differently than bufferin is."
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,531.655,557.832,"Well, if it complies with an over the counter drug monograph... and I'm assuming in that case that you're describing some kind of an analgesic... you would have to check the over the counter drug monograph which defines in advance what the general expert recognition would be, tells you what active products must be in it, what suitable inactive products must be in it, and what dosages are allowable."
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,577.151,579.51,Does the statute draw a distinction between over the counter drugs and prescription drugs?
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,579.51,581.339,In the definition of drug it does not.
1982.81-1222,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,588.319,595.989,"On some drugs that can be purchased over the counter there is a printed disclaimer or warning,"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,608.373,622.01,"Well, I don't know about the specific case, but ordinarily in the over the counter drug situation the understanding is that information can be provided to the patient that will be understood by a layman."
1982.81-1222,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,643.032,647.185,"But that warning is not something that is required by the FDA, is that right?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,647.185,655.933,"--Some warnings are, and some a manufacturer would add, I assume as a matter of prudence in particular cases."
1982.81-1222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,698.62,714.69,"Counsel, Respondents say that the word ""article"" as used in the definition is a word of art and refers only to items that are the subject of monographs, and would you deal with that in your discussion?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,714.69,715.797,"In a word, it's nonsense."
1982.81-1222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,732.449,734.683,And what about the legislative history?
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,734.683,751.661,"In terms of the legislative history and the use of the word ""article"" in these formularies that are the reference point, the formularies in fact have monographs of drug products, dosage forms, and finished products."
1982.81-1222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,755.517,761.141,"Does it mean something different in the different subsections, in your view?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,761.141,762.045,"--No, it doesn't."
1982.81-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,772.368,782.253,In your view who has the burden of proof in determining whether a drug product is a new drug?
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,782.253,797.792,"As these cases have come along, the Government has assumed the burden, in an injunction action such as this, of proving that a drug is not generally recognized by experts as safe and effective."
1982.81-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,797.792,799.917,Are you willing to adhere to that position?
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,799.917,801.118,Excuse me?
1982.81-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,801.118,805.135,"Are you willing to adhere to that position, or should the burden be on the manufacturer?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,805.135,814.271,"I think there are good arguments as to why the burden should be on the manufacturer, because the statute puts it on the manufacturer in the first instance by requiring him to get the NDA."
1982.81-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,827.971,833.952,I take it the Administration has not been consistent over the years in its position?
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,833.952,849.663,"Well, the fact of the matter is that the Food and Drug Administration has been consistent on the critical issue that's involved in this case, and that is whether the FDA has regarded the words ""drug"" and ""new drug"" as referring to products."
1982.81-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,874.153,876.98,"But for 30 years it issued these ""no new drug"" letters."
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,876.98,879.307,"--""Not new drug"" letters, that's correct."
1982.81-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,879.307,881.242,And you think that's consistent with--
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,881.242,882.555,It stopped in 1968.
1982.81-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1014.972,1020.548,"--Well, if he doesn't know why shouldn't he write his prescription for the pioneer drug?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1020.548,1022.076,"--The fact of the matter is, he will."
1982.81-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1063.388,1065.607,"Well, isn't it up to him to know?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1070.559,1073.043,"--He should know, but he often will not know."
1982.81-1222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1073.043,1077.243,"Well, he can prescribe and on the prescription write ""no substitution""."
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1077.243,1078.116,He can do that.
1982.81-1222,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.116,1079.383,And they often do.
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1079.383,1086.114,"And they often do, and they are doing it more and more as the problems with generic drugs are becoming more apparent."
1982.81-1222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1086.114,1093.672,What is left of the exemption provision if your view prevails?
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1120.145,1120.726,"No, it wouldn't."
1982.81-1222,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1187.604,1192.009,"But it takes what, 13 years to reach that stage?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1192.009,1192.852,"No, no, no."
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.476,1585.942,May I ask one other question.
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1594.408,1596.72,An approved pioneer drug--
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1596.72,1598.674,Must it file an NDA?
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1598.674,1599.969,--It must file.
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.872,1606.34,Say they just change the coating on it.
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1606.34,1610.403,But the fact is that the manufacturer is making a change in the product that's been approved.
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1610.403,1613.167,And he must file a new drug application?
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1613.167,1615.507,Or an amendment or a supplement.
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1615.507,1616.385,"Well, it wouldn't be an amendment."
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1619.977,1621.147,It could be.
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1621.147,1622.944,"Well, it could be or would be, under your view?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1622.944,1624.082,If you change the inactive ingredient--
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1624.082,1624.488,Yes.
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1624.488,1625.927,--he has a new drug.
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1625.927,1631.441,"And so he would be required, the pioneer drug company, would be required to file an NDA?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1631.441,1634.44,It could be an ANDA or one of the other.
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.44,1635.313,But at least he has to--
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1635.313,1641.494,"He would have to file something to notify the FDA, because he's no longer manufacturing the product that had been approved."
1982.81-1222,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1641.494,1644.933,--No matter now minor the change in the inactive ingredient might be?
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1644.933,1646.493,That's correct.
1982.81-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1646.493,1656.398,"Counsel, if the generic is a bioequivalent of an approved pioneer, is the situation any different?"
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1730.212,1743.392,If I can eliminate the word FDA does not.
1982.81-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1748.563,1751.545,"After all, though, aspirin is not harmless."
1982.81-1222,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1751.545,1756.042,"When used properly, it should not be."
1982.81-1222,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1769.585,1787.749,"You may lower the lectern if you'd like, Mrs. Greene."
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,1794.23,1797.337,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2193.914,2208.455,"Mrs. Greene, was the FDA's change of position which you described as having taken place in the mid-70's evidenced by any decision or statement, or was it simply something that those in the industry could tell was happening?"
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2208.455,2218.091,"Well, I think the Government is correct in saying that they always had the regulation on the book, but I think it reflected more in the agency's practice than in anything that was said or done."
1982.81-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.432,2227.274,Whereas previous to 1975 they had never done that?
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2227.274,2231.599,"Not to the best of my knowledge, not in a reported decision."
1982.81-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2242.643,2253.936,"But apart from the time, the year, you say that there was a noticeable and sharp change in policy some time in the late 1960's or 1970's?"
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2253.936,2265.26,I think probably the change occurred between 1968 when the FDA stopped issuing the mid-1970's.
1982.81-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2325.483,2329.421,Is it possible that Congress didn't act because they thought it wasn't necessary to act?
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2329.421,2330.903,That is a possibility.
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.907,2374.356,What do you call the requirement to have a clearance on new drugs?
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2383.883,2384.694,New drugs.
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.694,2385.43,Yes.
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2386.756,2391.396,"Well, I think that what Congress had in mind when it passed the statute--"
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2391.396,2392.176,What is that?
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2402.092,2403.142,--It is not a product licensing system.
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.853,2415.371,And then--
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2415.371,2416.962,And then it will--
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2416.962,2419.446,--Perhaps approve it for marketing.
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2419.446,2431.016,"--Then it will decide whether the product is a good product to sell, and if it thinks it's effective and safe and useful and the company can make money it will then go to the FDA and it will seek a new drug approval for that particular product."
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2431.016,2433.61,"Well, isn't that a kind of licensing?"
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2433.61,2437.455,"Well, it is not really a license."
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.874,2448.867,"Well, what was it you think the Congress was rejecting in the legislative history that you referred to?"
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2448.867,2465.488,"Well, I think what Congress was rejecting was the idea that each and every product had to go for an NDA, because after the product gets on the market in terms of an NDA 99 percent of all products, both in the 1930's and today, are patented."
1982.81-1222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2609.461,2620.317,"Mrs. Greene, your opponent says... I haven't looked, of course, at the original documents... but says that these compendia do also contain some drug products as well as active ingredients."
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2621.222,2624.237,The compendia do not contain any drug products at all.
1982.81-1222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.237,2629.688,"Not by trade name, but is everything in there limited to active ingredients, according to your submission?"
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2629.688,2640.494,"What they do contain... if you go back to the 1935 Pharmacopoeia which Congress had before it, most of the items that are listed in the Pharmacopoeia are drug substances."
1982.81-1222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.494,2643.681,"Well, but ""most"" seems to imply that there are some that are not."
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2643.681,2645.758,"Well, I was getting to that."
1982.81-1222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.394,2662.502,"Well, would some of those preparations include inactive ingredients?"
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2662.502,2667.657,--The recipe that is in the Pharmacopoeia would include inactive ingredients.
1982.81-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2686.273,2691.647,"Is there anything similar to the Pharmacopoeia, any other book similar to that?"
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2691.647,2699.985,"Well, the two works referred to in the statute are the United States Pharmacopoeia and the National Formulary, both of which are similar."
1982.81-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2699.985,2700.8,They're two separate?
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2700.8,2701.985,They used to be.
1982.81-1222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.102,2729.882,"Well, but you said they did list some recipes that the pharmacist might use, which would include both active and inactive ingredients."
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2729.882,2733.193,--With the provision that they could substitute--
1982.81-1222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2733.193,2733.583,That you can substitute the equivalent.
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2737.689,2740.111,"--Well, I don't think it's contrary."
1982.81-1222,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2785.419,2796.384,"Mrs. Greene, in Code Section 321(g)(1)(D) it also says that ""drug"" means"
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2811.893,2826.637,"Well, I think... but the statute still uses the word ""article"", and the Government has claimed that ""article"" should be used in its broad generic sense and not in any way related to its use in the Pharmacopoeia and the Formulary."
1982.81-1222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.764,2984.263,"Mrs. Greene, in the section that requires a new drug application to be filed, doesn't it require that they list the inactive ingredients of the drug?"
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2984.263,2985.245,"Yes, it does."
1982.81-1222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2985.245,2989.714,"So doesn't that have to be broader than the active ingredients, in that section at least?"
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,2989.714,2991.336,In that section of the Act.
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3031.478,3040.271,"--Do I detect that you are about through, Mrs. Greene?"
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,3040.271,3041.285,"Just about, but--"
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3041.285,3049.561,"Well, I have a... I thought I would just ask you if you thought the Court was quite wrong in rejecting your suggestion of mootness."
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,3049.561,3052.184,"--Yes, I did."
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3052.184,3060.23,"And do you think it is even more moot today than before, if that's possible?"
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,3060.23,3075.612,"Well, the government and I are debating on how moot it is, because there was a warehouse full of drugs in Miami, most of which should have been destroyed, but the marshal can't destroy the drugs because he can't burn them, because it would pollute the air, and he can't bury them because it violates the Toxic Waste Disposal Act."
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3076.723,3083.486,"You know that if we had accepted your suggestion, you would have lost your favorable judgment."
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,3084.515,3085.139,Yes.
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3086.22,3086.625,Exactly.
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,3087.53,3103.462,"--What basically happened, and the government has ascribed all manner of bad motives to us, when this issue came to the public forefront, in the media, there were some very unfavorable reports on national television."
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3128.747,3131.216,Are you still of that persuasion?
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,3131.216,3141.776,"Yes, and really the only difference that the government pointed out, it suggested that we had to recall everything that we had sold in the past."
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3150.927,3155.049,And haven't all the drugs that had been distributed expired in there?
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,3155.049,3159.0,We believe that most of them have expired.
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.0,3159.44,Most of them.
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,3159.44,3160.579,We thought that all of them had.
1982.81-1222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3190.27,3201.562,Does this mean that the position of your client and perhaps a substantial segment of the industry is that the approval by the government actually enhances the marketability of the generic drug?
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,3201.562,3206.246,"There is no question about it, and I think that is reflected in the transcript in this case."
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3239.064,3241.42,So your client isn't out of the generic drug business.
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,3245.561,3246.699,"Well, my client will not."
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3280.922,3282.248,Is two different things.
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,3282.248,3283.106,--Correct.
1982.81-1222,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3283.106,3289.325,"Apart from the particular articles in dispute in this case, your client no longer has a financial interest in winning this case."
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,3289.325,3290.058,No.
1982.81-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3294.071,3295.853,Is your lawyer's fee.
1982.81-1222,1,39393,robyn_greene,,3301.741,3304.206,--were the drugs that were in the warehouse.
1982.81-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3397.278,3401.073,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Ganzfried?"
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3401.073,3403.12,"Yes, just briefly."
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3403.12,3412.242,"Could you address the distinction, if there is one, under the Act between over the counter and prescription drugs?"
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3412.242,3418.505,"Yes, there is a statutory provision that does provide the distinction."
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3433.934,3436.34,"Well, does this case involve only prescription drugs?"
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3436.34,3437.354,--It certainly does.
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.481,3440.95,Is that the position of the government all through the case?
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3440.95,3442.603,--That is absolutely correct.
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.067,3457.269,So you think there is a statutory basis for treating the two categories differently?
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3457.269,3460.828,There is a statutory basis for treating them differently.
1982.81-1222,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3460.828,3463.811,"But the definition is the same, is it not?"
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3463.811,3464.736,"The definition is the same, that's correct."
1982.81-1222,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3464.736,3465.625,In the statute.
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3465.625,3483.587,"That's correct, but there is this other provision in Section 353 that does set out a basis for recognizing that prescription drugs used for serious and life-threatening diseases are something other than drugs that can be sold over the counter and used by laymen."
1982.81-1222,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3483.587,3484.507,But just recognizing there is a difference is all.
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3501.328,3508.781,"Well, if that were the case, and I disagree with it, it would be something that we would have to take up at that time."
1982.81-1222,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3511.417,3515.231,"Well, but it might be the consequence of this case, if we read the statute the way you do."
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3515.231,3519.29,"I don't agree, but if there will be another case, then so be it."
1982.81-1222,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3519.29,3520.526,May I ask this?
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3531.629,3541.217,The adverse consequences is that this industry of unapproved generic drugs is in large part a creature of dictum in the Linette decision.
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3569.816,3574.175,You can still... you could just get after somebody else.
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3574.175,3576.047,"--Well, we may not know about them--"
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3576.047,3579.748,"Well, how did you find out about this one?"
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3579.748,3585.122,"--Well, one of the reasons we found out is that there had to be a recall of the pherocemyde that was being distributed."
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3585.122,3585.391,"Well, how will you ever be?"
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3587.512,3590.916,"If people... If there is compliance, we are going to know more--"
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3590.916,3592.745,"Well, I know, but there won't be if there isn't."
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3592.745,3593.681,"--and if there is not compliance, we have a remedy for going after them."
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3593.681,3594.886,If there isn't compliance.
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3594.886,3600.054,"Well, they referred to the adulteration provisions as a substitute for premarket clearancing."
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3601.648,3607.584,I don't blame you for wanting to get off the books a decision you don't want to... that you think is wrong.
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3607.584,3612.754,"--Well, the holding in the Linette case had nothing to do with the issue in this case."
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3613.956,3621.375,"Well, I know, but you would like to get this particular decision off the books that you think was wrong in this case."
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3621.375,3624.233,"In this case, that's one of the reasons why the case is not moot."
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3624.233,3624.841,You want it reversed.
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3624.841,3627.934,The other reason it is not moot is because they did not agree to a recall.
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3657.859,3665.264,Perhaps instead of rejecting the suggestion we should have just vacated and remanded it to the lower courts to consider.
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3665.264,3670.415,"Well, or reversed would have been the preferable course."
1982.81-1222,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3670.415,3671.901,Not if it's moot.
1982.81-1222,2,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,3671.901,3683.615,"Not if it's moots but they haven't established the strong burden that they have of showing mootness, for the reasons that we described in our brief addressed to that subject."
1982.81-1222,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3730.971,3732.375,"Thank you, counsel."
