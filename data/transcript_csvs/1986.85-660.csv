1986.85-660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.82,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-660, Colorado versus Francis Barry Connelly."
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,77.166,78.716,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,141.407,142.573,"Mr. Coats, may I interrupt just a second to get one thing?"
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,142.573,142.723,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,142.723,145.609,Did the officer take the defendant into custody?
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,145.609,148.894,He handcuffed the defendant at that time.
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,148.894,152.096,"Would you agree that was custody, or do you take the position it was not custody?"
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,152.096,153.798,"No, I believe that was custody, Your Honor."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,153.798,158.417,And that was at the time he gave the Miranda warnings or right before he gave the Miranda warning?
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,158.417,162.903,"It is not entirely clear, but it was almost contemporaneously, yes."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,162.903,170.057,"So that you have one statement volunteered before custody, ""I killed someone"", and then you have Miranda warnings, and then some other statements after that."
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,170.057,171.426,"Yes, sir, I believe that's correct."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,171.426,173.176,So they may possibly at least present different issues.
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,173.176,173.961,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,497.935,512.028,"Mr. Coats, do I understand you correctly to say that Colorado as a matter of state law requires a clear and convincing standard of proof for waiver of Miranda rights?"
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,512.028,520.299,"That's true, Your Honor, and Colorado I don't believe has ever said that there is something separate about Colorado law that requires that."
1986.85-660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.989,530.056,"Well, I don't understand."
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,545.066,551.803,"--No, Your Honor, I don't believe there is anything in Colorado law that suggests it is based on a separate state provisions."
1986.85-660,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.355,559.576,They think it is a matter of Federal law then?
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,559.576,559.959,I believe so.
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.143,628.403,"Mr. Coats, may I just so I can follow your argument, are you addressing yourself now just to the first question whether the initial voluntary statement is admissible or are you treating it as though the statements that followed the Miranda warnings and the custody are to be treated all by the same standard?"
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,628.403,632.271,"--No, sir, I was treating only the first statement at this point."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,632.271,632.505,Only the first--
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,632.505,635.557,It seems to me that is the first significant point here.
1986.85-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,688.357,697.879,"--I have trouble finding... when a man walks up and says ""I want to confess"", I have trouble finding Miranda in there."
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,697.879,705.367,"Your Honor, I don't believe the... I think you are entirely right, and I don't think the Miranda issue is--"
1986.85-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,705.367,706.985,You have been arguing Miranda ever since you have been up there.
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,710.121,717.425,--I intended to be arguing the whole due process voluntariness standard with regard to that first statement.
1986.85-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,729.232,741.123,"I don't see what possible constitutional provision or what law in the world can prohibit a man from standing up and saying ""I did it""."
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,750.179,754.633,"I believe that's what the Colorado Supreme Court said in this case, Your Honor."
1986.85-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,754.633,756.668,"Yeah, but why do you have to bring Miranda in?"
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,756.668,768.059,"Well, I don't think Miranda does apply specifically to that part, and I think even Colorado made that distinction then, that the only question there is in some sense would this violate fundamental fairness?"
1986.85-660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,870.674,876.428,"The due process clause, Mr. Coats, of course, says you shan't be denied due process by the state."
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,886.802,896.824,"Your Honor, Colorado's theory was that by using the confession at trial, that was sufficient state action to violate the due process clause."
1986.85-660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,896.824,905.097,"Regardless of the fact there was no police, as you say, no causal connection between the police action and the statement?"
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,905.097,920.19,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor, and may I say very quickly, too, that they took that from a prior holding of the Court in which there was a confession to a private individual or a statement to a private individual, and Colorado had previously held that police action is not at all required."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.645,983.013,"Mr. Coats, now we are on the second question."
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,984.28,984.463,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.463,992.803,"The trial court as I understand it found that the defendant did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his Miranda rights because he was mentally incompetent at the time."
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,995.655,997.94,"Yes, sir, I am."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,999.307,1005.594,"That is what is at issue on the second question, is whether we agree with the finding of fact?"
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1005.594,1005.877,--That is what is at issue.
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.145,1009.83,And that finding of fact was approved by the Colorado Supreme Court?
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1009.83,1031.328,"--I think what the trial judge... well, the trial judge found that the... I think it is clear from his finding that he found the defendant was not capable of making a voluntary confession, and then he said, then the trial judge said, even it we were to get that far, it would be impossible to show that he made a voluntary waiver of Miranda rights since he couldn't make a voluntary confession."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1038.565,1043.551,"No, but he did squarely find that he did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his Miranda rights--"
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1043.551,1044.069,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.536,1046.271,--because he was mentally incompetent.
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1046.271,1047.371,"Well, that's right."
1986.85-660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.026,1063.53,And what you are saying is that the trial court's understanding of mental incompetence was erroneous in that case?
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1063.53,1082.261,"Yes, sir, that's right, and it seems to me because the second dimension here by all of the testimony is taken out of consideration, that is, the cognitive area, whether he knew his Miranda rights which, by the way, in Moran versus Burbine, if it had not been clear before, I think the Court made clear is all that a defendant must know."
1986.85-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1102.174,1107.559,Are you sure that you answered Justice Stevens' question correctly?
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1116.065,1116.398,That's true.
1986.85-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1116.398,1121.886,I thought that your argument is that the District Court's finding was based upon a misperception of the law--
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1121.886,1123.004,That's entirely correct.
1986.85-660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.004,1128.04,--as to what a voluntary waiver of Miranda rights consists of.
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1128.04,1129.408,Yes sir.
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.608,1136.061,And what was the error of law that the District Judge committed?
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1136.061,1146.953,He believed that the notion of... that voluntariness does not require any participation by the state at all in overcoming the defendant's will.
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.953,1147.886,That is on the first point.
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1149.821,1153.69,"With regard to the second question, I believe that the question is exactly the same."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1177.388,1183.542,"You attach no significance to the trial judge's words that he did not knowingly, intelligently as well as--"
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1183.542,1185.328,"I don't believe he ever dealt with that separately, Your Honor."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.494,1186.661,"--Well, he says it."
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1188.211,1191.815,"--I think he said he did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently make a waiver."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1191.815,1194.648,"Well, it is the other order, knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily."
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1194.648,1201.254,"I would like to equate that with... for the reason that he did not voluntarily make a waiver in this case, from all of his prior findings, it seems to me that is what the judge is deciding."
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1204.206,1205.023,May I ask just one other question?
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1205.023,1205.339,--Yes.
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1205.339,1216.096,"In Justice Erickson's partial dissent, I guess he agreed that the procedure... did he agree with your position on the Miranda question or just on the first issue?"
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1216.096,1219.465,He only dissented on the first issue.
1986.85-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1219.465,1219.881,Right.
1986.85-660,0,37030,nathan_b_coats,,1219.881,1224.517,And I may point out as well his theory was actually more narrow even on the first issue.
1986.85-660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1235.808,1237.058,"Thank you, Mr. Coats."
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1239.324,1255.436,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at the outset I would like to address myself to Justice Stevens' question about the trial court's finding."
1986.85-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.997,1353.132,"Mr. Pincus, you say the question in this case."
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1354.632,1358.084,"Yes, Your Honor, I think there are two separate questions, but I think they are related."
1986.85-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1369.106,1370.642,He would like us to decide them both on the basis of the second.
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1372.51,1373.926,"Well, no, Your Honor."
1986.85-660,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1412.551,1419.705,"Mr. Pincus, there was no finding in this case that the defendant was insane, was there?"
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1419.705,1429.244,"No, the trial court specifically said that he was not reaching the question whether respondent was actually incompetent at the time he confessed."
1986.85-660,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1429.244,1437.932,Would your position be different if there had been a finding that the defendant was insane at the time he made the initial statement and thereafter also?
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1437.932,1439.368,"No, Your Honor, it would not be."
1986.85-660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1463.167,1478.759,"Well, I suppose a defendant's competence to the extent that it goes to his cognitive ability at the time is relevant to the Miranda waiver inquiry, is it not?"
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1478.759,1480.195,"Yes, it would be, Your Honor."
1986.85-660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1551.106,1560.563,"Mr. Pincus, what if the defendant at a trial like this claims that a confession being offered was beaten out of him by his brother-in-law, who is a private individual?"
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1565.265,1578.942,"--Yes, Your Honor, we think that that is a question for the jury, and if the confession is admitted into evidence the defendant would have an opportunity to put before the jury all of the relevant circumstances surrounding the confession."
1986.85-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1593.619,1607.259,"Let me ask you, to follow up on that, may I... supposing he... the defendant is given Miranda warnings by a police officer, and he doesn't waive, then his brother comes in and twists his arm and said, by golly, you are going to waive and confess, and his brother forces him to waive his rights."
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1618.9,1623.571,"--Well, Your Honor, we think that the waiver would still be good in this case, because the confession--"
1986.85-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1623.571,1624.904,But would it be good in my hypothetical case?
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1624.904,1625.437,"--No, in both cases--"
1986.85-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1625.437,1626.437,You think it would be good?
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1626.437,1633.01,"--in your hypothetical because the confession still would not have been obtained by government compulsion, and that is what the Fifth Amendment privilege is designed to protect against."
1986.85-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1633.01,1634.743,I couldn't understand why you paused so long.
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1635.879,1636.545,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1986.85-660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1636.545,1637.929,I was sure that was your position.
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1637.929,1645.651,"And if that compulsion isn't present, we just think that there is no problem with admitting into evidence."
1986.85-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.651,1650.02,"In other words, the word ""voluntary"" really means absence of official compulsion."
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1651.139,1656.875,"Yes, Your Honor, because that is the only requirement that is imposed by the self-incrimination privilege."
1986.85-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.718,1674.337,"Of course, that would be true if the police exerted the compulsion, too."
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1675.604,1681.924,"--Well, but it wouldn't be... in this situation... where the police exert the coercion, that is where the privilege is implicated."
1986.85-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1693.613,1697.767,It would be quite peculiar to read Miranda to exclude that class of involuntary confessions.
1986.85-660,1,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1697.767,1699.434,Yes.
1986.85-660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1757.472,1760.174,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
1986.85-660,2,42501,thomas_m_van_cleave_iii,,1762.126,1787.841,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this case the uncontradicted medical evidence at the suppression hearing established that Francis Connelly was afflicted with a chronic paranoid schizophrenia at the time he walked up to Officer Anderson and stated he wanted to confess a murder."
1986.85-660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1832.971,1841.494,"Well, Mr. Van Cleave, when you say he did nothing, he did put cuffs on him and give him Miranda warnings, didn't he, the officer?"
1986.85-660,2,42501,thomas_m_van_cleave_iii,,1841.494,1845.128,"--Oh, yes, Your Honor, but I am speaking now strictly as to the initial statement."
1986.85-660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.513,1960.487,And what... that violates in your view the prohibition in the Fourteenth Amendment that no state shall deprive any person of liberty without due process of law?
1986.85-660,2,42501,thomas_m_van_cleave_iii,,1960.487,1961.471,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1961.471,1967.558,"And how did the state deprive this person of liberty without due process of law, by admitting that first statement?"
1986.85-660,2,42501,thomas_m_van_cleave_iii,,1967.558,1968.942,"Yes, Your Honor, that the--"
1986.85-660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1968.942,1969.426,How?
1986.85-660,2,42501,thomas_m_van_cleave_iii,,1979.382,1999.362,"--The flaw was that that statement under principles of this Court which were developed over the period of years in the area of involuntary... due process involuntariness of confessions, that statement to Officer Anderson, we contend, was an involuntary confession because of Mr. Connelly's deficient mental condition."
1986.85-660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1999.362,2005.933,And which of those cases involved no state or police causal connection that you are relying on?
1986.85-660,2,42501,thomas_m_van_cleave_iii,,2005.933,2011.253,"None of those cases, Your Honor, involve absolutely no state action."
1986.85-660,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.106,2055.364,"Mr. Van Cleave, suppose it wasn't God who had told Mr. Connelly but rather it was his brother-in-law who said, Frank, unless you go back to Denver and confess, I am going to beat the devil out of you."
