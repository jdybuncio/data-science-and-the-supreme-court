1992.91-1958,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.234,"We'll hear argument now in number 91-1958, Donald L. Helling v. William McKinney."
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,8.818,11.55,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.078,128.708,"General Del Papa, has Nevada changed its regulations since the institution of the lawsuit, concerning... insofar as they would affect placement of prisoners for smoking or nonsmoking purposes?"
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,128.708,129.917,"--No, Justice O'Connor."
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,142.436,146.109,And now that's embodied in written policies--
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,146.109,146.67,That's correct.
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,146.67,150.602,--That are consistent with the former informal policies.
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,150.602,151.193,That's correct.
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,151.193,166.231,"And this particular petitioner, I mean plaintiff in the suit below, has been moved since the institution of the lawsuit."
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,166.231,166.832,That's correct.
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.832,171.044,And is he presently being housed in a single cell?
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,171.044,171.645,Yes.
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.645,185.296,Do you think there's some reason to think that he may be moved again during his incarceration and again subjected to secondary smoke?
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,185.296,190.538,"The underlying facts are capable of repetition, yes."
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.881,212.073,Let me ask you another question while I have you interrupted.
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,232.627,233.135,Yes.
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.135,238.359,"And was that issue ever addressed in the courts below, deliberate indifference--"
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,238.359,239.058,The--
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.058,242.511,--In light of the policy of the prisons?
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,242.511,247.744,"--Well, the informal policy, of course, was in place at the time."
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.379,258.632,The magistrate found no deliberate indifference.
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,258.632,259.113,Yes.
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,259.113,261.676,"And was that, then, reviewed?"
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,261.676,263.766,Yes.
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.766,264.467,That finding?
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,264.467,266.528,Yes.
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,266.528,270.601,And what was the finding on review?
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,270.601,283.348,The finding on review... the court of appeals attempted to distinguish between a serious medical need of a present condition and a future condition.
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.348,286.78,"The deliberate indifference finding, was that ever addressed on review?"
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,286.78,287.741,Well--
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.741,289.962,That there was no deliberate indifference.
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,289.962,307.905,"--The court of appeals on... wanted to remand this case because of the... the way that... well, they first, of course, found that they disagreed with... I'm sorry."
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,307.905,317.641,I guess I'm trying to find out whether the court ever addressed the... the finding that there was no deliberate indifference.
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,326.407,336.462,"Well... and we would argue that, yes, they did review the deliberate indifference because they did find no abuse of discretion on... on the part of the magistrate."
1992.91-1958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,348.36,354.946,Is there any need to address the objective question if... if it's clear that there was no deliberate indifference?
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,354.946,355.426,--No.
1992.91-1958,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,355.426,359.338,"Well, didn't the deliberate indifference go to two different issues?"
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,373.76,375.39,I don't... I don't believe so.
1992.91-1958,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,375.39,376.171,I see.
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,420.43,423.152,"There were symptoms, Justice White, that--"
1992.91-1958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.152,423.573,All right.
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,429.917,430.586,--Yes.
1992.91-1958,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,430.586,447.037,"Well, the point is that the deliberate indifference finding of the magistrate was connected with the... with the substantive finding that there's no... that there's no problem so long as you don't have current symptoms."
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,447.037,447.458,Yes.
1992.91-1958,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.458,455.092,That you don't have a right to... so you can't really say that the rest of the case goes away by reason of the deliberate indifference finding.
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,455.092,466.82,"Well, we would argue that the... the exposure to the environmental tobacco smoke in the first instance does not meet with the objective component."
1992.91-1958,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.043,502.063,"No, but... but the problem is if... if this case comes to us with the finding that, in fact, the State was not indifference... was not indifferent to this... to this prisoner's desire to have a nonsmoking roommate and was not indifference to his... was not indifferent deliberately to his desire to... to have clean air, entirely clean, free of cigarette smoke, then, as Justice O'Connor says, we don't have to reach the other issue."
1992.91-1958,0,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,523.756,524.136,Yes.
1992.91-1958,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,1816.093,1826.701,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2059.753,2062.936,"You say it took place in October, 1989."
1992.91-1958,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,2064.967,2069.849,"--The regulation was issued on September 28th, 1989."
1992.91-1958,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2077.766,2081.168,"In your view, do those regulations meet constitutional requirements?"
1992.91-1958,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,2081.168,2101.632,"In our view, if those standards are followed in the prison system, and I... we submit that it would be very difficult for a prisoner to challenge the conditions of confinement to satisfy the subjective prong if the prison official is saying we're doing all that we can consistent with the considerations, with balancing of the interests."
1992.91-1958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.39,2118.112,So there would be no basis for injunction currently.
1992.91-1958,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,2118.112,2121.284,There would be no basis for an injunction under that situation.
1992.91-1958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.284,2124.306,And there's no question about damages in this case.
1992.91-1958,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,2124.306,2127.919,"Well... well, there's no question... but let me... let me answer the question a little more specifically, if I may, Justice White."
1992.91-1958,2,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,3604.698,3616.246,"Justice White, in response to your question to Mr. Roberts, we did note in our petition that the Ninth Circuit erred in the way that it framed the issue at pages 25-29 of our--"
1992.91-1958,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3616.246,3618.266,Thank you very much.
1992.91-1958,2,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,3618.266,3620.587,--I have just a couple of brief points.
1992.91-1958,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3632.546,3634.369,"Well, why didn't you tell the Ninth Circuit about this?"
1992.91-1958,2,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,3634.369,3638.299,--I don't believe there was an opportunity.
1992.91-1958,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3639.6,3641.511,"But the policy change was in 1989, wasn't it?"
1992.91-1958,2,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,3641.511,3652.94,"--But it was... I think, due to the timing and the way the... the policy actually, Your Honor, came out before the magistrate actually... the policy came out before trial."
1992.91-1958,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3652.94,3654.941,But it was inconsistent with the stipulation.
1992.91-1958,2,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,3654.941,3663.016,"We're contending that the... that the policy has not materially changed, particularly with... with reference to the accommodations."
1992.91-1958,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3663.016,3668.28,"But, you must agree, I think, that the written policy is inconsistent with certain parts of the stipulation."
1992.91-1958,2,24462,frankie_sue_del_papa,,3668.28,3671.181,I don't agree with that.
