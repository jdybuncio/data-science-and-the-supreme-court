1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.277,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-7194, Arthur Lajuane Taylor v. United States."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,24.008,27.679,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,180.236,193.926,"I... I take it that something might not qualify as burglary under Roman numeral ii, but might qualify as presenting a serious potential risk of physical injury to another?"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,193.926,195.646,I believe that's correct.
1989.88-7194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,218.762,222.614,"You haven't challenged the statute as being vague, have you?"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,222.614,223.065,No.
1989.88-7194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,239.628,245.294,"There would to be some... some conduct that any fool would know is burglary, wouldn't there?"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,245.294,251.586,"--Well, not... it depends whether any fool was in Maryland, Virginia or Missouri."
1989.88-7194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,251.586,252.136,"Well, I know, I know."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,258.411,258.731,No.
1989.88-7194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,278.686,284.019,"Well, I'm not... I'm not suggesting you take... take right now... take the government's."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,290.503,291.764,--That's right.
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,335.225,339.83,"There... there is a common law definition of burglary, isn't it the--"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,339.83,341.202,There certainly is and that's the--
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,341.202,347.336,--Of breaking and entering in a dwelling place at night with intent to commit a felony?
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,347.336,348.128,--That's right.
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.108,356.573,And you say the second-degree burglary in Missouri would... would not meet that definition?
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,356.573,365.589,--Because there is no requirement under that statute that the breaking and entering had occurred in dwelling house or at night.
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,365.589,370.564,Or that it be... does second-degree burglary in Missouri require the entry be unlawful?
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,370.564,379.119,"It depends on whether you are looking at my... Petitioner's convictions, which under a repealed Federal statute, or the present-day statute."
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,403.906,407.279,"But at the time he was convicted, it required breaking and entering?"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,407.279,408.32,That's correct.
1989.88-7194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.923,420.337,"Excuse me, it was entering or... and it's the government's proposed definition, too, isn't it?"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,423.219,425.72,--Surreptitiously.
1989.88-7194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.72,429.253,"Does the surreptitiously go only with the remaining or does it go with the entering, too?"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,429.253,431.694,I would--
1989.88-7194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.694,432.926,Most shoplifters don't sneak in.
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,436.659,442.443,--I don't believe that the unlawful part needs to be tied to entry.
1989.88-7194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.556,446.977,"--Well, then any... any crime you commit in a building would be burglary?"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,446.977,451.799,"--Essentially that's right and that's the way California, in fact, has it."
1989.88-7194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.084,472.202,xxx.
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,472.202,472.883,--Excuse me.
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,472.883,477.087,Were the parking meters inside a building in Texas?
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,477.087,477.648,No.
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,481.571,484.473,Setting out along the sidewalk or--
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,484.473,485.174,--I think that's right.
1989.88-7194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,511.113,518.587,"--But I thought the government's definition picked up on the definition that was left out in those two or three-year periods, and that requires a building, doesn't it?"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,518.587,534.908,"That's right, which would again... I don't know why it hasn't been raised by other people before, but it seems to me that, again, highlights the problem of a potential fact case-bound inquiry that that test requires, because many of these statutes do not require a building."
1989.88-7194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,538.322,539.003,"Well, but then--"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,539.003,539.694,In many places that's counted as burglary.
1989.88-7194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.694,540.355,--then they wouldn't be covered.
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,541.477,543.828,"Well, that's right, but that... that's just another example."
1989.88-7194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.907,571.977,"Well, excuse me."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,605.281,608.383,"Well, if you--"
1989.88-7194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.383,610.484,"Now, that wouldn't require any case-by-case analysis."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,610.775,611.055,--That's right.
1989.88-7194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.432,620.884,--We would just... we would just look to the state's statute.
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,620.884,625.168,"--You would look to the element of the state, and I think that that is the best way to take it."
1989.88-7194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,625.168,625.466,Right.
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,625.466,626.067,That's my test.
1989.88-7194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.179,638.916,"So under your... your own test, we're not confronting a problem of... of uncertainty here if we... I mean there may be other problems with the government's position, but it's not... it's not the difficulty of doing case-by-case analysis."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,638.916,641.757,"Well, it is if you limit yourself to buildings."
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.597,686.528,Would you tell us once more what your test is?
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,686.528,692.012,My test would be that you take the government's proposed test from the '84 definition--
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,692.012,696.146,"Well, but... I mean, don't incorporate by reference."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,697.955,698.166,--Entering--
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,698.166,699.006,--what your test is.
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,699.006,702.599,--taking crimes that are punishable by a term exceeding one year.
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.287,746.54,"Well, let me interrupt you just a... just a minute, Mr. Livingston."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,754.806,756.188,"Yes, it does."
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.645,758.949,"Well, what... what is the justification for that?"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,760.969,765.951,"--Well, this Court, first of all, does not always rely on something like ""or""."
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,800.519,810.977,"So you say it's in... incorporated in the definition of burglary by the word ""otherwise"" is the requirement that there by a serious potential risk of physical injury to others."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,810.977,811.497,That's right.
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.497,814.449,So you are not really melding it together then in your view.
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,816.079,817.16,That's right.
1989.88-7194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.818,858.519,"Of course, that--"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,872.32,873.432,That's right.
1989.88-7194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,873.432,874.511,--the conduct.
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,878.975,879.445,That's right.
1989.88-7194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.74,891.533,"And it... and it would qualify, if it's conduct, that it might endanger others even if it's not a part of the offense."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,891.533,902.272,"--That's right and if... I think it is within this Court's prerogative, certainly, to construe it that way and examine the underlying conduct in a case-by-case basis."
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,941.959,952.207,Is it... is it your position that one looks to the conduct involved in the particular crime for which the defendant was convicted or in the statutory... to the statutory elements of the crime?
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,952.207,952.357,--No.
1989.88-7194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.582,987.592,"Even... even in that event, we're still going to have to decide, not case by case but certainly element by element, which particular things in burglary statutes create a serious potential risk of physical injury to another."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1016.382,1017.273,--I think you could.
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1045.255,1048.416,Why don't you urge the common law definition of burglary?
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1048.416,1059.273,"Well, I... I think because a common law definition of burglary could still involve places where there is nobody home and there is no risk of injury."
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.273,1071.12,"Well, but I... I think that the common law theory of burglary was that if you broke into a dwelling at the... nighttime, the people could come home while you were there even if they weren't there when you came."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1074.484,1083.71,"Well, I think that the risk of a response or someone returning alone is not enough to find the serious potential risk of injury to another."
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1109.288,1111.438,"Well, how about an attempted robbery with a phoney gun?"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1111.438,1115.932,"--Well, attempted robbery with a phoney gun falls under the first definition."
1989.88-7194,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1145.664,1159.292,"But that seems to me to call into question your definition of burglary, and it's... it's just not clear to me what cases would fall under your definition."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1168.53,1168.819,--That... that's one of them.
1989.88-7194,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1217.827,1232.098,"--Well, Mr. Livingston, in your view I guess these other provisions in the statute for arson and extortion would likewise have to have built into them some other element that one wouldn't usually find."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1246.587,1247.198,That's right.
1989.88-7194,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1247.566,1248.027,--violence.
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1251.78,1252.3,--Uh-huh.
1989.88-7194,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1252.3,1269.274,"I assume that because Congress included those three words that they should have at least their common ordinary meaning so far as we can determine them, and they wouldn't necessarily include, I think, the elements as you've described them."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1269.274,1279.318,"Well, I don't think that that is a... a fair way to go when you consider the language at the end of the statute."
1989.88-7194,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1279.848,1284.413,"Well, I think it's a pretty logical explanation."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1320.347,1331.326,"--I would just have to respectively disagree with respect to that because of the ""otherwise"" clause and the fact that it really states serious potential physical risk of injury to others."
1989.88-7194,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1331.326,1340.094,"Mr. Livingston, the ""otherwise"" clause doesn't necessarily mean... doesn't refer necessarily back to burglary arson or extortion."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1370.645,1377.399,"Well, I suppose I will have to agree that that's a possibility, as is Justice O'Connor's interpretation."
1989.88-7194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1393.138,1397.632,That doesn't mean you construe it like you suggest.
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1401.166,1405.65,"As a fall-back position, we have indicated in our briefs--"
1989.88-7194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.65,1406.17,"Well, that's--"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1406.17,1408.524,"--that that would be an acceptable alternative, although I think--"
1989.88-7194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.524,1411.716,"--Well, you want to win your case on any ground, I suppose."
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1413.356,1415.106,"--We are interested in winning the case, Justice White."
1989.88-7194,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1417.109,1423.892,"--So, the common law definition would win it for you, I take it?"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1423.892,1436.812,"I believe so, although it depends whether or not you then look to the statutes themselves to determine it or whether you look at the underlying conduct."
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1438.705,1439.022,"Well, what... what precisely--"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1439.022,1439.533,--really... pardon?
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.533,1443.426,"--What precisely, again, was the conduct of which your client was convicted?"
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1443.426,1446.56,"Well, that's a big problem in this case because we really don't know."
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.015,1486.198,All you know is that it's second-degree burglary under Missouri law.
1989.88-7194,0,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,1486.198,1496.134,"It's second-degree burglary and we also know that there was $15.25 in restitution ordered to be made to Wilkin's Food Shop, wherever that may be."
1989.88-7194,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1518.601,1521.43,"Very well, Mr. Livingston."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1522.681,1525.854,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-7194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1598.316,1606.083,"Well, you'd have us read into this as the definition the definition that was actually contained in the earlier act, I gather."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1606.083,1607.742,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, and although that--"
1989.88-7194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1607.742,1613.597,"That's a little hard to do, faced with the fact that they didn't reenact it."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1613.597,1615.63,"--Well, it... it strikes you at first--"
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1615.63,1629.9,"You'd use normal principles of... of use of legislative history, or what not... I would assume you would say, whatever it means, one thing we know it doesn't mean... that is, what they defined it as in... in 1984 and took out."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1629.9,1636.515,"--Well, in fact, although at first glance it seems like our position is cockeyed, it turns out to be just the opposite, because even--"
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1636.515,1637.236,xxx.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1637.446,1638.598,--I will explain.
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1678.458,1679.77,That... that was the '84 definition?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1679.77,1679.96,Yes.
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1681.873,1686.745,Well... well wait a minute Mr.... you... you say it does have commonly accepted meaning.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1693.299,1703.908,"--That is the core definition of burglary that is in place in 41 states today and, agreed, there are many states that have a broader definition."
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.837,1721.312,And I take it nine would not punish some of those things as burglaries but--
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1721.312,1728.889,"Well, there are... there are... as we counted and... there are five states that have retained the common law definition of burglary."
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1750.623,1753.856,--Why would it write the burglary part of the thing out?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1753.856,1755.867,Because there are five states that have burglary.
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.059,1766.375,"And if... and if you do not do it case by case, but you look to the elements of the offense rather than to the actual offense that occurred."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1766.375,1766.535,--Yes.
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1766.925,1767.997,It assumes that.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1767.997,1780.416,"--Yes, but... and under subsection... we're not... we're not here to quibble with... we essentially agree with Petitioner, that you have to look at what the man was convicted of and that, by definition, is the... the statutory offense."
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.416,1780.716,I see.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1780.716,1792.176,"And that is the problem with the common law definition, apart from the fact that it doesn't make much sense to presume that Congress intended to adopt a definition that has been discarded for so many years."
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1792.176,1801.221,"Well, if you adopt a common law definition, you're really narrowing the kind of burglary that it was reached by this act."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1801.221,1802.211,"Yes, and the--"
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.211,1807.455,And I... and the... and this... this new act was intended to expand the coverage of the act.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1807.455,1821.014,"--Yes, and that's... and again, back in '84 the generating force of this act was the congressional finding that career offenders are responsible for a grossly disproportionate number of crimes."
1989.88-7194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1832.53,1837.453,"Well, you've left out the definition of breaking and... I mean, in the definition of breaking and--"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1837.453,1837.944,"Well, I'd like to--"
1989.88-7194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1837.944,1838.084,--entering.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1838.325,1838.655,--to return to... to return to--
1989.88-7194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1838.655,1843.638,You just say entering or remaining surreptitiously.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1843.638,1848.332,--I'd like to clarify one point that wasn't as clear in our brief as it should have been.
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.104,1884.201,"Can you just... in your definition, is there any unlawful aspect required for the entry?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1884.201,1894.727,It has to be unauthorized and it would distinguish between the shoplifter and the person who lawfully enters into a store and stays behind after hours and then commits the offense.
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1896.366,1898.049,"Well, which one didn't enter lawfully?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1898.049,1916.479,"--They both entered lawfully, but the... our position is that if you lawfully enter a building and commit an offense inside, you have not committed burglary, except... and the limited exception is if you stay after hours, which then makes your staying unauthorized and then you commit an offense."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1917.19,1925.766,"That is not the literal reading of the definition you propose, though, because the definition you propose is entering with intent to commit a... a felony."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1925.766,1928.968,"--Yes, but the word entering in the context of a burglary provision--"
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1928.968,1930.681,"Well, how do we know this?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1935.333,1935.774,--We get--
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.774,1938.635,It falls squarely within the text of your proposed definition.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1938.635,1939.196,--You get that--
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1939.196,1941.116,We'll have another lawsuit on... on that one.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1941.537,1941.777,--Pardon?
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.777,1943.961,We'll have another lawsuit on that one after we--
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1943.961,1948.14,"Well, it's one of those hypotheticals that, of course, will never come up and if... but--"
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1948.14,1950.123,"--Well, no, but the shoplifting example comes up."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1950.123,1950.394,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1950.394,1953.646,Say somebody goes into the department store lawfully but with an intent to steal something.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1953.646,1961.433,"There's no doubt that those are potential predicate offenses, but not in the government's view and we don't prosecute those people and we would not include those as predicate offenses."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1961.433,1965.347,"I know you don't prosecute them, but... maybe that's what happened to this particular... defendants in Missouri."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1965.347,1965.898,"No, we... we'd--"
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1965.898,1968.85,"I mean, maybe... I don't... I don't know the Missouri definition."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1975.966,1976.116,--Well--
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1976.116,1976.647,--or the shoplifting?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1976.647,1977.636,"--Well, we know it for two reasons."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.447,1993.198,"Well, but--"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1993.198,1993.959,And today--
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1993.959,1994.13,--that may be.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2019.777,2027.314,"--Well, it's one thing to say you don't want to get into the case-by-case, but it's another thing to say you don't... just want to look at the statute which is not our position."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2027.314,2032.727,"Well, the statute as construed by the highest court of the state, but it's never had this particular question."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2032.727,2042.765,"In a particular case, you look at how does the government prove or attempt to prove that this person needs the... deserves the predicate... excuse me... the enhanced sentence."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2047.399,2047.669,Right.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2047.669,2050.493,We'd have the charging documents if... if we could find them.
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.806,2055.759,"Well, let me just make... be sure... I--"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2055.759,2064.945,"And if a judge were concerned that this person were convicted of burglary, although all he did was walk into a store and steal a box of Twinkies--"
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.945,2069.967,"--Well, let me go back if I may because I thought earlier we'd all agreed that it's an elements of the offense test."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2092.404,2095.195,--If the statute could be... if the statute--
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2095.195,2098.779,"The statute is broad enough to cover parking meters, the facts of the case where a home."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2098.779,2099.77,--No doubt about it.
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2099.77,2100.909,No doubt about it?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2101.981,2102.391,You would count it.
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2102.391,2103.433,"Oh, you do count it?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2103.433,2103.643,Yes.
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2103.643,2106.595,"So you don't look at elements of the offense, you look at the actual facts."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2106.595,2109.199,You look at the elements of the offense of which he was convicted.
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2111.139,2118.702,"And if your record shows nothing but conviction, murder two pursuant to statute certain number so and so, that's not enough to answer the question."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2119.503,2119.834,--Yes.
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.829,2131.123,"So it's not an element of the offense test, it's a particular fact in the charging papers?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2131.123,2136.338,--It's elements of what you... it's the elements of the offense as applied to what he was convicted of.
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2152.528,2160.803,"Supposing the charging papers in this case say burglary of department store, Hecht's, at such and such an address, period?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2160.803,2162.275,"--Well, here we know what he did."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.275,2164.846,"Yeah, but lots of times you don't."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2165.086,2168.729,"Well, if we don't know, then that's going to be a problem in a particular case."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2168.729,2169.16,--I see.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2178.736,2178.887,Well--
1989.88-7194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2178.887,2185.212,--except that there was an order for restitution to a store for $15.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2185.212,2187.786,"--There are two answers to that, Justice O'Connor."
1989.88-7194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2224.039,2234.105,"Mr. Lazerwitz, what is the current status of any efforts to get Congress to amend or enact a definition of burglary?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2234.105,2241.961,"As you know, the Senate has passed an amended version last year, and the House is having hearings starting next month."
1989.88-7194,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2243.832,2246.022,And the proposal would do what?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2248.133,2257.219,"It would be to... yes, to insert the definition that was taken out back into the statute to avoid the problems that this Court is seeing."
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.219,2263.935,"Mr. Lazerwitz, I am afraid that in the course of this discussion, we not only have not come closer together, we seemed to have walked further apart."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2299.51,2301.33,That's not the way the statute's written.
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2302.572,2302.732,Why isn't it written--
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2302.732,2304.324,"That's Subsection 1, that's not Subsection 2."
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2315.033,2327.93,"--No, but that... but... but you... you look to the definition of the crime and if the definition of the crime involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of injury, then that's it."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2327.93,2328.41,"Well, that's--"
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.41,2336.017,"And... and if that element has to be found in order to convict of the crime, then... then it's okay."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2338.08,2340.792,"--Well, that... that effectively reads burglary out of the statute."
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.574,2345.855,Why?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2351.721,2360.006,"--No, because Congress specifically inserted the word burglary into the statute as a result of what was the legislative compromise."
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.006,2360.916,--I'm saying--
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2360.916,2363.049,And so now we have to figure out what burglary means.
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.049,2368.471,--I'm not sure you are understanding what I think is a difference between the two of you.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2415.275,2431.308,"It's not a sensible way because, first of all, it's not what Congress had in mind and it effectively would take out of the... would narrow the statute's reach in such a way that would make it ineffective as opposed... with respect to burglaries."
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2457.323,2459.285,What's... what's the provision of Missouri law?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2464.349,2467.991,That's common law burglary.
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2469.253,2471.415,"Yeah... I know, entering... entering to commit a felony--"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2471.415,2472.314,--Yes.
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2472.314,2472.975,--is common law.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2475.475,2482.001,"Well, apparently in this case, the guy wasn't... he wasn't authorized to be in the house and maybe they weren't his clothes."
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2482.001,2483.873,"Anyway, he was... he was--"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2491.428,2495.768,"Well, that's what his story was but obviously the police must have found out it was different and he was convicted of it."
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.768,2499.462,At least he was convicted of burglary under the state law.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2499.462,2500.032,Yes.
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2530.185,2539.05,"But then... part of your argument against using the common law burglary definition, I thought, was you wanted to avoid all these inquiries."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2546.146,2546.875,"Well, there are a couple of reason."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2555.182,2563.818,"--But his reason for not agreeing with it is he wants to avoid... he wants to rely on elements of the offense and he agrees that that wouldn't fit in the common law burglary because most states copy, except five."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2563.818,2574.207,"--Well, under his elements of the offense test, if that were adopted, it would accomplish the same result, in our... in our view, because if you look at most state burglary statutes, they do cover things other than buildings."
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2574.207,2578.38,"Well, why do you say the common law definition makes no sense?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2580.581,2586.194,"Yes, but we are no longer... that's not the way things have been in this country for years."
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.194,2587.853,You say 41 states have rejected it?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2587.853,2588.935,Yes.
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2588.935,2599.243,"Well, but I think the Court has adopted common law definitions at times when perhaps common law had been superseded in places by... by statute."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2599.243,2611.991,"Well, in Parron and Bell and even in the Reagan case from 1895, the Court has said, listen, when common law no longer applies or obtains in society, we are not going to infer that Congress used it."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.598,2651.137,Can you explain to me again why the language of your proposed definition does not cover entering the courthouse with the intent to commit perjury?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2651.137,2658.441,"Because the word entering means, entering without... without authorization, without privilege."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2658.441,2670.528,And... unlawfully entering... you are in effect... you are adding... you have not given us an accurate definition of what your real position is then.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2672.451,2672.791,Well--
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2672.791,2673.96,--unconsented entering.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2673.96,2676.833,"--The... the word ""entering"" is a... is a loaded term."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2677.944,2679.534,"But that's what you're saying, isn't it?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2679.534,2686.399,"--Yes, that... when we say entering... when Congress used the term ""entering"", Congress meant entering without permission, without authorization."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.111,2694.725,It's not startling except it isn't the position I understood your brief to advocate.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2696.007,2698.979,"--Well, I want to make it clear that we are not advocating that the perjurer is a burglar."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2701.45,2702.521,Or the shoplifter then?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2702.521,2703.453,--Or the shoplifter.
1989.88-7194,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2730.903,2741.271,"Have you cited us any cases in which a definition is used in a statute after the Congress has repealed it, or would this be a novel application?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2741.271,2749.565,"We didn't cite any case and I don't know of a particular one, but I don't think this is an example of Congress repealing the definition."
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2802.402,2808.486,"And what's your position on the use of the ending phrase ""or otherwise involves conduct""?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2810.81,2824.819,"The way I have been thinking about it is the ""or otherwise"" modifies the... the verbs ""is"" a crime, ""is"" burglary, ""involves"" use of explosives, or--"
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2824.819,2833.735,"Well, then that suggests that burglary must somehow involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury, don't you think?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2833.735,2837.338,"--No, I don't think so because I don't think the word ""otherwise"" can bear that type of weight."
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2890.195,2894.529,That would also shed some light on what Congress meant by burglary.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2906.377,2913.981,"--Well, I don't think so and frankly, the... the phrasing ""or otherwise"", while we don't even think that it should be given an aggressive reading, is because look what it does."
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.947,2972.701,Is there any other statute besides the '84 statute that defines burglary... I mean Federal statute?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2972.701,2985.4,"One example would be in Section 2118(b) of Title 18, which is the offense of burglarizing a place of business that's licensed to dispense controlled substances."
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2993.767,3004.954,Where do you get the... where do you get the... to what do you refer in saying there are 41 states that have a core meaning to burglary?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3007.316,3007.466,"No, we--"
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3007.466,3009.216,--somewhere or you counted them up?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3009.216,3016.371,"--No, we counted them up and perhaps it would have been wise to give you a statutory appendix, but we looked at each one of them--"
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3016.371,3020.515,But each one of them isn't... isn't the '84 definition.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3020.515,3020.825,--No.
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3021.786,3026.762,Because... because... what... the '84 definition just covered mere entering.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3026.762,3037.157,"Again, Congress' using the term ""entering"" didn't mean the shoplifter and there's been indication... I know of no cases where we prosecuted--"
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3037.157,3040.9,"Well, do the 41 states you talk about cover mere entering or does it require--"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3040.9,3041.341,--Very few.
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3041.341,3042.57,--unlawful entering?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3042.57,3044.093,Very few require mere entering.
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.478,3050.658,xxx.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3050.658,3051.259,"Oh, excuse me."
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3056.014,3058.473,Is the model penal code definition what you're--
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3058.473,3058.884,"--Yes,--"
1989.88-7194,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.884,3059.435,--looking for?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3059.435,3060.405,--it's essentially the same.
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3060.405,3060.855,Yeah.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3069.783,3070.564,Every one of them.
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3070.564,3071.635,Every one of them would?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3079.38,3083.603,"Well, your... but I was concerned with your statement about its got to be a building."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3085.695,3088.646,"Well, your definition has got to be a building."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3088.646,3089.307,"--Right, but in... but in--"
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3089.307,3090.75,"Well, isn't that true of all 41 states?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3090.75,3094.012,--A building plus any other type... lots of other structures are covered.
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3094.661,3097.095,"Oh, so those definitions are broader than this--"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3097.095,3100.094,"--Oh, yes, there are lots of... I don't want to mislead you, Justice--"
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.094,3108.22,--How many... how many... do you know off the top of your head how many states have a crime of burglary that is defined in this way and no more broadly?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3108.22,3111.142,--That would probably be in the minority.
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3111.142,3112.072,Oh.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3114.946,3119.117,"I... again, as I said in the beginning, it is the common denominator."
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3126.153,3126.751,"Well, how do we know that?"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3134.859,3135.019,"Well, again--"
1989.88-7194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3135.019,3135.767,--because they all include it.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3135.767,3141.76,--Congress took this definition from the National Commission of the Reform of the Criminal Laws in the early 1970s.
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3174.704,3195.697,"Mr. Lazerwitz, I... I gather from what you've said that the way... the way the Department interprets this statute to come under the portion that says ""involves use of explosives"", it isn't necessary that the statute be a statute prohibiting a crime with the use of explosives."
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3208.955,3219.554,"If he were convicted of mayhem and the elements of mayhem didn't include the use of explosives, no, I don't think we would... that would... we could charge him with that predicate."
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3219.554,3221.965,"And you would do that for the last clause also,"
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3225.538,3226.119,We--
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3226.119,3231.331,That risk of physical injury must be in the statute... not the exclusive thing in the statute?
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3231.331,3231.471,--No.
1989.88-7194,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3232.85,3233.031,Okay.
1989.88-7194,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3233.031,3243.81,"We don't think, for example, if you're charged with armed robbery and you plead to simple larceny that we can walk into a district judge and say, look, although he is convicted of simple larceny he really used a gun."
1989.88-7194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3252.736,3253.795,"Thank you, Mr. Lazerwitz."
1989.88-7194,2,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,3256.229,3259.1,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-7194,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3308.932,3311.195,May I ask you one question that's very important to me?
1989.88-7194,2,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,3328.459,3331.23,I say you look at the statute.
1989.88-7194,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3331.23,3342.868,"So you would say in all those cases that it doesn't count, even though they can prove without any question that the elements of the offense were present in the particular case, if the statute didn't require them to be in every case?"
1989.88-7194,2,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,3342.868,3349.584,"If the statute didn't require them to be in every case, then, under my interpretation, it would not be an enhancing offense."
1989.88-7194,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3352.203,3352.593,"No, I understand."
1989.88-7194,2,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,3352.593,3353.394,--question of whether he gets the extra time.
1989.88-7194,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3353.394,3356.386,But you... you and the government do differ on this point in--
1989.88-7194,2,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,3356.386,3356.726,That's right.
1989.88-7194,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3356.726,3357.498,--I just want to be sure.
1989.88-7194,2,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,3357.498,3364.412,I also would like to address Justice White's question about expanding the act.
1989.88-7194,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3394.035,3400.327,Your claim is that it narrowed the reach of the burglary predicate offense.
1989.88-7194,2,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,3400.327,3406.713,--Only to those burglars which would be like the first-degree burglary statute in Missouri which really have that serious potential risk of injury.
1989.88-7194,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3453.647,3460.309,"Are arson and extortion defined in this statute, or can we look forward to those cases coming up later?"
1989.88-7194,2,17827,bruce_d_livingston,,3460.309,3462.793,They also are not defined.
1989.88-7194,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3512.777,3513.595,"Thank you, Mr. Livingston."
