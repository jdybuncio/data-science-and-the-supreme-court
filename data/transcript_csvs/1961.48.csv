1961.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,21.586,"Very well, Number 48, Carl Still, Petitioner, versus Norfolk and Western Railway Company."
1961.48,0,41995,sidney_s_sachs,,22.769,24.419,May it please the Court.
1961.48,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,310.61,315.45,Do you mean a spondylolisthesis is visible to external view?
1961.48,0,41995,sidney_s_sachs,,315.45,324.24,"I do not mean sir that that is true in every case, but this record shows that in this case there was evidence of it."
1961.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,592.811,602.877,"In the Rock case, are these facts all conceded by the plaintiff, that he had procured somebody else to take the physical examination for him?"
1961.48,0,41995,sidney_s_sachs,,619.475,619.998,That's correct.
1961.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,619.998,621.417,-- is at least one of your --
1961.48,0,41995,sidney_s_sachs,,621.417,622.403,That's our first point.
1961.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,622.403,623.967,-- positions.
1961.48,0,41995,sidney_s_sachs,,626.291,628.736,"I think there were not, I'm not positive."
1961.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,628.736,654.516,"So that in the Rock case, you would concede, at least argumentatively that in that kind of a case perhaps it was open to the Court to decide as a matter of law, when the facts were not disputed, that the plaintiff in that case had procured somebody else in fact to take his physical examination and maybe in that kind of extreme case, there was nothing for the jury."
1961.48,0,41995,sidney_s_sachs,,654.516,659.188,"I think that is a point, I would certainly not disagree with that point."
1961.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,668.01,672.642,"Do you think that even if the Railroad is right in its version of the facts here, that this case is different from Rock?"
1961.48,0,41995,sidney_s_sachs,,672.642,673.503,"Absolutely, absolutely."
1961.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,673.503,674.462,"Yes, yes."
1961.48,0,41995,sidney_s_sachs,,674.462,678.08,"For the reason, and that is the point that I'm now coming to."
1961.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,879.719,882.505,May I ask you this question Mr. Sachs.
1961.48,0,41995,sidney_s_sachs,,890.432,890.665,That's correct.
1961.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,890.665,897.667,-- and then he was dismissed for some cause having nothing to do with his physical condition.
1961.48,0,41995,sidney_s_sachs,,904.292,904.68,That's --
1961.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,904.68,908.674,"Now, did he have -- did they give him any physical examination?"
1961.48,0,41995,sidney_s_sachs,,914.362,921.621,The precise answer to your question is that they examined his -- that they say they examined his eyes only.
1961.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,921.621,922.171,Exactly.
1961.48,0,41995,sidney_s_sachs,,922.171,924.649,He says they examined him.
1961.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,964.791,970.269,Do you believe that it affects the case in -- as it comes to us in some way or other?
1961.48,0,41995,sidney_s_sachs,,970.269,999.312,"We believe that that affects the case on our first proposition because if he was rehired in 1957, independent of his 1951 application, then it cannot be said that when he was injured in January 1958, his employment existed because the Railroad was relying on his false 1951 statements."
1961.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1001.881,1008.035,Mr. Sanders.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1008.035,1016.298,If the Court please?
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1200.272,1204.834,What did the -- what did the examining physician say about that?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1204.834,1210.603,"The examining physician testified of course, Your Honor, as he should have testified, as anybody."
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1263.9,1287.762,But of course a jury might be able to find that there would be a difference between the doctor remembering and the employee remembering because of the fact that the employee was examined once and the doctor probably examined thousands of people in that regard.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1287.762,1289.705,Your Honor --
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1289.705,1292.592,"I'm not saying its true, but I just say a jury might --"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1292.592,1293.149,Yes.
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1293.992,1295.482,-- couldn't a jury consider that.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1295.482,1300.895,I don't believe that's true under the circumstances of this case.
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1602.099,1609.7,May I ask what his work record was with the comp -- with your company over the eight years between the time he first came (Inaudible) --
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1609.7,1613.324,"Yes, yes, that's very important."
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1615.914,1618.249,"No, I meant his physical condition during the time --"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1618.249,1619.244,"Oh, well --"
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1619.244,1619.89,-- he worked there.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1622.895,1623.162,That's --
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1623.162,1624.208,-- year and a half or so --
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1624.208,1643.534,"He came there, he started in July of 1951, and as a -- and he was -- about 1956, I believe it was in October, he deserted his crew and he was dismissed from service."
1961.48,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1644.556,1652.171,"What's that -- what does that mean in his employment, deserting his crew, sounds like a military offense?"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1652.171,1666.676,"Well, I'm not quite certain Mr. Justice Stewart, but I assume that he had left his crew while they were working without proper justification, I'm not sure."
1961.48,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1666.821,1667.771,"I was just curious, that's not very --"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1667.771,1671.835,That was the -- that was the charge he was dismissed.
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1671.835,1676.307,Did he have any illness record in those five years?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1676.307,1678.411,"Oh, yes."
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1678.608,1679.944,(Inaudible) --
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1679.944,1682.922,And I'll reach that fact --
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1682.922,1684.601,Yes.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1684.601,1694.27,"He deserted his crew and he was dismissed and was off approximately a year, and then he was reinstated."
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1750.866,1750.938,Yes.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1750.938,1753.588,That's our position in the case.
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1753.588,1761.625,"Well what was -- what was the condition of his health and his ability to work during those five years, from 1951 to 1956?"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1761.625,1789.96,"That is shown very graphically if the Court please, in a record which we -- that's Defendant's Exhibit Number 29, record -- page 506 of the record, Defendant's Exhibit 29."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1891.003,1899.767,I suppose the company came to that conclusion long before they entered this record.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1899.767,1913.627,"The evidence is, on that Your Honor, from several of the representatives of the respondent that they had no reason to believe that the petitioner was not physically fit."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1913.627,1917.569,But -- but what's with all this record (Inaudible)?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1921.015,1923.626,"That's -- I say, that's what the record shows --"
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1923.626,1923.939,But (Voice Overlap) --
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1923.939,1925.195,-- that he was off sick --
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1925.195,1927.054,(Inaudible) one thing about this?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1927.054,1927.979,Sir?
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1927.979,1933.294,The records shows the company didn't know anything about this list of (Inaudible)?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1933.294,1943.301,"Several of a -- for instance, Dr. Traft, the medical examiner testified he didn't know it and the terminal train master testified that he didn't know it."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1943.625,1945.177,What was this made out from?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1952.371,1953.968,From the original records of the --
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1953.968,1955.091,Whose records?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1955.091,1956.097,The railway company's records.
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1956.097,1957.642,The railway company's records.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1957.642,1957.911,Yes sir.
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1957.911,1958.765,Day to day?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1958.765,1959.779,"Yes, sir."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1959.779,1962.268,And you say they didn't know about it?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1962.268,1976.707,The witnesses who testified -- who testified at the trial testified that they have no reason to believe that he was not physically fit to perform the duties of a railyard breaker.
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1978.58,1986.87,"Well then, there's no inference that we can draw from this then is it that you would say that the company couldn't draw it."
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,1986.87,1998.731,"I think you can draw this inference, that there was some reason he didn't explain why he was off from work on account of sickness."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2025.756,2034.915,It's conclusively contradicted you say because the company knew about it and had the record of it and has it on file all the time.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2034.915,2035.082,That's right.
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2035.082,2036.554,He kept him in employment.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2040.156,2041.547,That is certainly true --
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2041.547,2047.097,"And they reemployed him after he was off for a year, after that record."
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2047.097,2048.643,They didn't reemploy him --
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2048.643,2050.621,But they put him back to work and --
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2050.621,2051.652,"Well, they put him back to work --"
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2051.652,2053.187,That's (Voice Overlap) -- yes.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2053.187,2056.397,"-- because -- yes, they reinstated him."
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2056.397,2056.71,Yes.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2056.71,2060.324,But I submit he was not rehired as my friend to contends.
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2060.324,2068.099,"Well I didn't -- I didn't used it in that -- in that sense, but I -- but I wonder if this has any bearing on it."
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2103.568,2109.596,"Well, I certainly assume Your Honor has read it correctly."
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2109.872,2110.221,"Well, I -- I've just seen it, it's on the last page --"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2110.221,2111.256,(Inaudible)
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2111.256,2112.961,"-- 509, and it's --"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2112.961,2113.252,Yes.
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2113.252,2119.238,"It's right at the very end, rather at the very end of the exhibit here."
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2122.43,2149.305,"I merely call attention to that and I placed it in evidence in the Circuit Court for the reason that the counsel for petitioner at that time contented that here was a man that was in spite of his spondylolisthesis, and in spite of the fact that he had suffered an injury, and he'd had rheumatism, and had made these misrepresentations, yet he was physically fit."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2167.796,2184.534,"May I ask you, I'm not sure about it, but suppose the railroad has filed an application to remove him from his employment, cancelled the original contract on the ground that its fraud (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2184.534,2185.587,On the grounds --
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2185.587,2190.944,-- five or six years after he had made these alleged fraudulent decisions.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2190.944,2192.99,Yes.
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2192.99,2200.586,Does the statute limitations or the principles of (Inaudible) or negligence is raised had anything to do with this case?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2200.586,2201.889,"Not that I know of, sir."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2201.889,2202.96,(Inaudible)
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2202.96,2216.409,"The application which he signed at the bottom provided in substance that if he did make false answers to the questions, that he could be discharged even without a hearing."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2216.409,2219.519,"Well, you could have discharged him at any time?"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2219.519,2219.781,Well --
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2219.781,2223.625,"They didn't have to discharge him as I gather, because he wasn't employed."
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2223.625,2241.173,"They could have discharged him -- I mean, that's what the application said, but we who know about collective bargaining agreements know that it could not have been done without a hearing and without very considerable difficulty."
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2241.173,2244.056,He was there eight years on the job.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2256.329,2262.935,"Well, that's increasing it --"
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2262.935,2263.32,"Well, it makes him (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2263.32,2265.057,-- in a good many years.
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2268.276,2269.587,Yes.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2269.587,2293.974,"This condition that he had, the spondylolisthesis, many -- good many doctors testified in this case, four or five doctors including the petitioners' own attending physician, and they said that with -- a man in this condition wasn't physically fit for employment as a yard breaker."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2353.564,2355.378,How did he get hurt?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2355.378,2355.956,"Pardon me, sir?"
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2355.956,2359.859,How did he get hurt?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2359.859,2366.607,"I have just a minute, my time is -- I would like to tell the Court that."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2474.059,2480.845,"Whether it was a large or small impact, did his back have anything to do with it?"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2480.845,2481.826,I didn't quite understand that.
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2481.826,2492.125,"Whether it was a large impact or a small impact, did this so-called spendecula or sponocity or whatever it was have anything to do with his accident?"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2492.125,2492.407,Well --
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2492.407,2494.896,Does the evidence show that?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2494.896,2508.917,The evidence shows this that he remained on this car until it stopped and he climbed down off the car unassisted and he remained on the job the all night.
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2508.917,2511.656,Do you mean he wasn't hurt?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2511.656,2523.824,"Your Honor, that -- my opinion is not involved here, but I think others could come to that same opinion, there wasn't any accident at all."
1961.48,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2523.824,2523.919,(Inaudible)
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2523.919,2524.485,I see.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2527.813,2529.74,It's exactly right.

1961.48,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2546.519,2548.306,He was making no complaint of his back?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2548.306,2555.834,"None, whatever to the orthopedic surgeon that examined him the following day, none whatever."
1961.48,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2555.834,2560.934,Did his back -- did he in his suit for damages here complain of an injury to his back?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2560.934,2562.44,"Oh, it is, yes."
1961.48,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2592.141,2593.826,"Now, what is it?"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2598.806,2606.926,It is a displacement forward of the fifth lumbar vertebra over the sacrum.

1961.48,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2608.089,2610.048,-- of the fifth lumbar forward --
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2610.048,2610.147,Yes.
1961.48,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2610.147,2610.716,"-- off the sacrum, is that --"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2610.716,2612.13,About half --

1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2612.766,2613.526,About half --
1961.48,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2613.526,2614.592,I understand it now.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2614.592,2629.007,"-- of the fifth lumbar vertebra, it was pushed forward over the sacrum and in his suit, he contented that that is the condition that he received when he was injured."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2629.007,2630.424,By a certain jury?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2630.424,2631.464,"Yes, sir."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2631.464,2636.331,"And that's what the jury would have to pass on if this case were sent back, isn't it, those facts?"
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2636.331,2658.891,"There is one fact, whether there was any accident, whether there was any injury, because the x-ray reports which we produced taken when he was in the army and by the veteran's administration show that the condition of his spine, when he was in the army was exactly the same condition that it was in at the time of this trial."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2658.891,2662.191,All that would be admissible in evidence if the case was tried?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2662.191,2663.149,"Oh, yes."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2663.329,2665.265,Somebody had to pass on the facts?
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2665.265,2665.921,"Oh, yes, that's true."
1961.48,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2665.921,2667.844,Which they haven't yet done.
1961.48,1,33028,joseph_m_sanders,,2667.844,2668.426,That's right.
1961.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2682.933,2683.699,Very well.
