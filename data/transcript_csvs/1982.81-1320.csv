1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,28.286,30.676,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1320,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,227.517,231.218,In Terry there was a frisk before there was an arrest.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,231.218,233.78,--There was also a request for an--
1982.81-1320,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,233.78,235.827,And in the frisk they found a gun.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,235.827,238.779,--There was a request for identification--
1982.81-1320,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,238.779,239.153,And then there was an arrest.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,239.153,241.293,"--then a frisk, and then an arrest."
1982.81-1320,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,241.293,244.152,But the arrest was after the frisk.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,244.152,245.088,That's true.
1982.81-1320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.569,334.537,Does that require someone to carry and produce identification?
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,334.537,337.973,"--No, ma'am, it does not."
1982.81-1320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.497,354.404,How does one do that without carrying something?
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,354.404,355.824,--It's quite easy.
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,420.189,434.496,"May I ask, following up on that, supposing you stopped the jogger, you asked him his name, he says, my name is John Smith, and then you ask him these additional questions about how he ran to that particular location."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,438.635,446.679,He has not provided the officer the level of identification that 647(e) requires under Solomon.
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,446.679,449.709,And he has committed a crime?
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,449.709,457.363,Solomon says that he must... that you must discern where the man can be contacted at a later date if that's necessary.
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,457.363,460.158,"So he has committed a crime if he says, I would prefer not to tell."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,462.204,463.969,"Well, if he gives his name and address--"
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,463.969,465.485,He has nothing with him.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,470.606,474.714,"--If the officer at that point feels that that, knowing the neighborhood--"
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,474.714,475.885,--Say he thinks he's lying.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,475.885,477.369,"--Sure, he thinks he's lying."
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,478.368,479.431,Then he's committed a crime?
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,490.207,490.739,--Yes.
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,498.455,499.017,Supposing he says--
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,499.017,502.391,"--in an interface with the police not being willing to say, well, I ran down this--"
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,502.391,504.172,"--Well, maybe on the way over he robbed someone."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,516.84,521.011,--If he did not give reliable identification.
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,521.011,521.198,"Well, I told you what he gave."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,521.198,526.977,"If he did not provide reliable identification, because you said that the police officer did not believe him--"
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.977,528.821,Does the police officer have to give him any kind of warning?
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,541.033,548.89,"--There is no requirement that I know, statutory or otherwise, that requires a policeman to inform a person why he is being stopped."
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,560.823,579.267,"As I understand your explanation of the statute, without any Miranda warning or its equivalent, if a man who is in fact suspected of committing a crime is stopped and asked if he was at the location of the crime and he just says, I'd rather not answer, he's now committed the offense."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,579.267,581.845,"--No, not if he responded--"
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,581.845,584.469,"The question was, how did you get from A to B."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,587.281,593.996,"--If he has not provided the officer with reliable identification, he certainly has."
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.996,595.183,"Well, he told him, my name is John Smith--"
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,595.183,598.667,"Now, leapfrogging to the Fifth Amendment issue--"
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.667,600.416,"--Well, your opponents argue that."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,600.416,606.226,"--I realize that, and if you'd like to discuss that, I think it's important to--"
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,606.226,610.553,"Well, you were telling us how the statute is properly construed at this point, as a preliminary to your argument."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,610.553,617.612,"--There might be other ways of getting to the reliability of the data, of the identification."
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,617.612,619.503,But there would be an approved way.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,619.503,626.764,"All we're after with 647(a) is the man's name and address, or the woman's or the person's."
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,626.764,638.541,"But you then said the customary procedure correctly applied under the statute is to follow up with a question of how did you get from A to B, without any warning of the consequences of either answering or not answering."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,638.541,653.098,"The warnings only are given to, can you provide any other reason why I should believe that you live at such and such an address."
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,653.098,654.583,"Well, no."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,657.222,658.065,That's right.
1982.81-1320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,661.58,669.997,In a Terry stop can the officer reach into the pocket of the suspect and pull out his wallet and check for ID?
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,669.997,672.324,--Under Wisconsin law they certainly can.
1982.81-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,679.462,683.227,Was that part of a patdown process in Wisconsin?
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,683.227,687.069,"--No, it was part of asking for an identification."
1982.81-1320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,697.533,701.344,Has this Court ever said that that's all right under a Terry stop?
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,701.344,703.531,"No, not to my knowledge they haven't."
1982.81-1320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,708.028,714.698,"Would the California statute then allow the same information to be obtained, but in a different way?"
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,714.698,733.238,"--We feel that there are certainly ways to ask for a reliable identification without interfering with the person's Fifth Amendment rights, as Justice Stevens raised."
1982.81-1320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,744.374,753.807,The California courts have interpreted this statute to require the person stopped to account for his presence or her presence.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,755.447,758.024,That means that you provide reliable--
1982.81-1320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,758.024,761.023,That's the sort of inquiry you're talking about?
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,761.023,761.039,--That's right.
1982.81-1320,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,767.333,770.144,"You keep saying ""identification""."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,780.952,783.138,"Well, what you're getting to is identification."
1982.81-1320,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,797.743,799.775,"Well, he gave you the name and the address, and you--"
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,799.775,800.306,That's right.
1982.81-1320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,837.4,839.945,--Or suppose the officer--
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,839.945,843.022,I think that's reasonable and I think it's reasonable police action that we're looking for here.
1982.81-1320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,843.022,850.801,"--Suppose the officer is basically on the lookout for the neighborhood rapist, who is believed to drive a blue car."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,858.454,860.579,"Well, if we're talking about a jogger, no."
1982.81-1320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,893.127,896.266,How about right there on the street?
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,896.266,899.765,"No, that isn't authorized."
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.927,926.582,May I ask one other question.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,930.206,951.634,"The ""account for his presence language"" has been interpreted by Solomon to mean only that you provide reliable identification, not that I'm here because I want to stand and watch something, or I'm not here because... I'm here at the corner because I'm supposed to meet someone."
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.493,958.414,Just all it goes to is--
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,958.414,960.147,The Solomon court has said that.
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,960.147,972.314,"--Well, I'm still... if it weren't for that language, I would have been puzzled by your statement that the correct practice under the statute would be to ask a question such as, what are some of the neighboring streets or how did you get from there to here."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,976.125,976.547,That's right.
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,980.905,990.198,"See, you have, I suppose by hypothesis, at the time of the stop the officer suspects him of being engaged in criminal activity."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,990.198,994.055,Already has articulable facts to justify the first intrusion.
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,994.055,994.415,Right.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,996.961,997.289,Right.
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,997.289,999.209,"He says, I want to ask you your name and so forth."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,999.209,999.787,That's right.
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,999.787,1002.693,But he doesn't tell him he thinks he's involved in criminal activity.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1002.693,1004.363,No.
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.528,1031.432,"And you don't have to notify them if you say, how did you get here, even though the purpose of the question is to find out if maybe he's the purse-snatcher?"
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1031.432,1039.131,"--No, the purpose of the question is to find, is to gain the reliability of the information."
1982.81-1320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.131,1040.083,I see.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1040.083,1049.017,"If you suspect him as a purse-snatcher, you're focusing in and your Fifth Amendment comes into play, of course, at that time."
1982.81-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1069.885,1081.816,"This statute provides, would you say, wider latitude to police than the Terry stop?"
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1081.816,1082.332,No.
1982.81-1320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1105.573,1115.584,"But if under Terry you can't compel someone to produce their wallet and their ID, how is this statute not broader than Terry?"
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1115.584,1128.594,Because Terry did not get to the issue of requiring the person to provide his identification.
1982.81-1320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1164.986,1168.501,So it may be broader than Terry if Justice White's view is correct?
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1168.501,1176.326,"If Justice White's view is taken as part of the opinion, it might be a tad broader."
1982.81-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1238.363,1243.376,What do you say are the articulable facts that supported this stop here?
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1243.376,1246.844,There were 15 of them.
1982.81-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1246.844,1249.156,"Well, just take the last one."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1249.156,1268.086,"I think basically, and as I said before, I really didn't come prepared to discuss the facts of the case because they're going to be litigated again, because the Ninth Circuit sent it back for a jury trial on whether or not the person was stopped."
1982.81-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1304.008,1306.914,How much... you haven't got to the appearance yet.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1315.381,1330.061,"As far as... my recollection is that the facts, those facts are what the officer related as connecting the person to criminal activity."
1982.81-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1342.899,1343.649,By that you mean vandalism?
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1343.649,1345.367,"--That's it, yes."
1982.81-1320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1363.329,1368.904,But it won't go to trial on the question of the Respondent's guilt or innocence.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1374.043,1375.668,"That's true, that's true."
1982.81-1320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.946,1393.38,"Did the district court make any finding as to the need for the injunction issue in this case, whether there was a likelihood that the stops would recur?"
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1393.38,1399.674,"He did not, in my reading of his ruling did not."
1982.81-1320,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1525.513,1529.809,"If you asked everybody's name in New York, you'd surely need a whole lot of police."
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1529.809,1555.891,"--I still think it's a valid safeguarding tool, and I think it's important that they be allowed to do that, and I think that the concern of the freedom to move has got to be weighed against the freedom of other people to move also."
1982.81-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1562.53,1563.232,Go ahead.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1563.232,1567.372,"If you had an absolute right to wander, you wouldn't even be able to arrest somebody."
1982.81-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1571.48,1581.085,Your latest hypothetical about a person seemingly lurking around a house late at night prompts this question.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1586.942,1596.89,"I certainly think that the time and the place and the total circumstances, just as in Cortez, the total circumstances play a large role in it."
1982.81-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1600.874,1619.101,"Well then, is your answer that at high noon in the downtown district of Los Angeles, with no indication usually associated with drug transfers, just simply a person walking along, that this statute would not authorize a stop?"
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1619.101,1627.458,"--No, not unless there was... you know, it was in the daytime in an Ohio city where Mr. Terry was stopped, and I think--"
1982.81-1320,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1627.458,1628.597,Cleveland.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1633.547,1633.969,--That's right.
1982.81-1320,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1636.531,1638.171,Absolutely.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1638.171,1643.309,"--because, without any other facts, you know, it's what prompts the stop."
1982.81-1320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1643.309,1647.964,"Are you suggesting some peculiar rule that applies to Cleveland, but not to the rest of the country?"
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1647.964,1649.197,"Oh, no, no, no."
1982.81-1320,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1652.228,1653.462,It's the Statler Hotel.
1982.81-1320,0,16738,a_wells_petersen,,1653.462,1670.58,"My intention was to state that a man at high noon who isn't exhibiting any criminal tendencies certainly wouldn't be stopped, or his walking up and down looking like he's looking for a cab."
1982.81-1320,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1676.437,1684.152,Mr. Rosenbaum.
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1684.152,1687.901,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1930.46,1941.58,"Would you say, then, that a case in which a Terry stop was made is not reviewable by the courts because it's so esoteric they just wouldn't know anything about it?"
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1941.58,1942.002,"No, of course not."
1982.81-1320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1985.203,1990.654,What if the statute spoke in terms of probable cause and not articulable suspicion?
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,1993.887,1995.199,"Well, that's an interesting question."
1982.81-1320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2043.086,2046.755,"But that's true of articulable suspicion, too, isn't it, if you phrase it in those terms?"
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2055.768,2065.921,"Yes, and because of that we will permit the police to make certain intrusions upon individual privacy that we won't permit in the nothing situation."
1982.81-1320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2076.275,2081.382,Do you think that individual has any better basis for making the judgment if it's probable cause?
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2090.41,2092.347,"--Well, let me answer that in two ways."
1982.81-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.33,2213.86,"Is this your... do you think this is your strongest point here, counsel?"
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2213.86,2217.797,"I have two strong points with respect to vagueness, Your Honor."
1982.81-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.109,2222.404,Do you think the vagueness argument is your strongest point?
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2222.404,2228.792,--I think both the vagueness argument and the Fourth Amendment arguments are compelling in this particular case.
1982.81-1320,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2310.369,2316.633,Is it your argument that the statute is vague or that it's overbroad?
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2316.633,2323.832,--It is that the statute is vague because it is not capable of any constitutional application.
1982.81-1320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.531,2339.466,You say it's not capable of being applied in any situation?
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2339.466,2358.786,"That's correct, because whether you look at vagueness or whether you look at the Fourth Amendment argument, what is inherent in this statute is a forfeiture of the rights of privacy and security and mobility that were guaranteed under Brown versus Texas."
1982.81-1320,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2437.568,2457.199,"Would you think if, added to whatever the other facts were, the Respondent here, the Appellee, was wearing a stocking cap over his head with holes for the eyes?"
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2457.199,2462.259,That would also be an unconventional appearance.
1982.81-1320,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2462.259,2462.869,Well--
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2469.382,2473.725,That of course would permit a Terry stop.
1982.81-1320,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2476.973,2478.894,"Well, would it fit under this statute?"
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2488.625,2490.139,"--Yes, the individual--"
1982.81-1320,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2490.139,2490.701,He could be stopped?
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2490.701,2494.466,"--Yes, could be stopped and could be requested for identification."
1982.81-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.9,2508.274,They could also... they could detain him until they asked the questions.
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2508.274,2509.321,That's correct.
1982.81-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.321,2509.899,You agree with that.
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2509.899,2510.68,That's correct.
1982.81-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2510.68,2518.552,But your point is he should not be forced to answer the question at the pain of criminal penalty.
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2518.552,2519.114,That's correct.
1982.81-1320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2595.973,2597.145,May I interrupt with one question?
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2597.145,2597.707,Certainly.
1982.81-1320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.707,2608.764,"Following up on the Chief Justice's hypothetical question, supposing an officer does encounter, 3:00 o'clock in the morning in a residential neighborhood, a person wearing a stocking cap."
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2619.089,2622.885,The officer can ask the questions.
1982.81-1320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2644.187,2649.779,"But can the officer attach evidentiary significance to the failure to answer, if you assume there's a constitutional right not to?"
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2649.779,2658.011,"--If the officer could do that, then what would happen is there would be probable cause to arrest and this statute would not exist."
1982.81-1320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2658.011,2662.961,"You mean it would be all right to stop him and if he doesn't answer say, well, now I've got probable cause?"
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2662.961,2664.632,"No, to the contrary."
1982.81-1320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2719.971,2734.245,"But you're saying that there's no way a state can pass a statute to deal with the hypothetical case I give you, that would enable the officer to elicit the name and address of the person from an unwilling... if he didn't want to give it?"
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2734.245,2734.823,That's correct.
1982.81-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2776.51,2792.268,"Would you suggest that if there is probable cause to arrest and everybody concedes it, the state could then say that once there's probable cause to arrest it is also a crime to refuse to give the name?"
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2792.268,2793.44,"No, because when--"
1982.81-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.44,2794.299,"No, what?"
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2794.299,2796.314,"--No, I think that would be improper."
1982.81-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2801.327,2804.357,"Well, you're making a... it wouldn't be a Fourth Amendment argument?"
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2804.357,2804.545,--No.
1982.81-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2805.982,2807.231,That's where you would--
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2807.231,2808.731,--Right.
1982.81-1320,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.146,2946.486,--It would also authorize a complete search incident to arrest.
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2946.486,2947.143,--That's correct.
1982.81-1320,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2962.762,2967.823,"Where do you get that from, where they can make a full search?"
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2967.823,2970.024,They can make a full search incident to arrest.
1982.81-1320,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2970.024,2971.946,Custodial arrest.
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2971.946,2972.867,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1320,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2972.867,2974.508,On the street?
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2974.508,2977.179,That's what this Court--
1982.81-1320,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2977.179,2978.505,I thought you could make a pat-down.
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2978.505,2980.724,--Perhaps I'm not being clear.
1982.81-1320,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2987.064,2989.579,I'm just wondering whether you're getting too far away from this case.
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2989.579,3008.102,"Well, what I'm saying is that actually your point indicates how the Fourth Amendment can be subverged, because they start with Terry and very limited powers of the frisk, and all of a sudden with 647(e) entering the case it is a full search incident to arrest that is permitted."
1982.81-1320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3011.008,3018.818,"Terry gives you that same sort of acceleration on the facts of Terry, doesn't it?"
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,3026.204,3039.043,"Yes, and that's because society has recognized that the possession of a concealed weapon is a substantive offense that we will punish and permit to have a search incident to afterwards."
1982.81-1320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3060.599,3064.05,"Well, that's what the court approved in Michigan against DeFillippo, though."
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,3064.05,3073.795,"Yes, but in Michigan versus DeFillippo, the court declared that statute there unconstitutional."
1982.81-1320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3075.373,3079.06,"Surely, if the statute had been constitutional it all would have fallen."
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,3079.06,3083.901,"--If the statute is constitutional, my argument obviously falls, but what I'm indicating--"
1982.81-1320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3083.901,3084.385,No.
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,3090.133,3097.286,"--Yes, and... but the question is what happens to the probable cause requirement in those circumstances."
1982.81-1320,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3165.274,3168.257,"But the initial detention is, of course."
1982.81-1320,1,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,3168.257,3168.96,Yes.
1982.81-1320,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3522.039,3528.097,"Mr. Petersen, do you have anything further?"
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3530.176,3533.362,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1320,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3562.459,3564.49,What's dressed like a criminal?
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3564.49,3573.83,"--Well, the police report comes in that a crime has been committed and the criminal was dressed in a certain way, had a certain physical appearance--"
1982.81-1320,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3573.83,3575.797,"Oh, if he corresponds, if he meets a description that's been sent out."
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3575.797,3579.217,"--Meets the description, and is driving a car that was used in a crime."
1982.81-1320,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3607.566,3611.049,"Mr. Petersen, that seems to demonstrate the validity of your opponent's argument."
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3611.049,3611.518,--No.
1982.81-1320,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3612.94,3615.142,The person stopped doesn't know the basis for the stop.
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3615.142,3615.626,That's right.
1982.81-1320,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3619.516,3619.985,I know you did.
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3624.357,3625.013,It's not necessary.
1982.81-1320,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3632.212,3639.444,And so your answer is that the person stopped can never know whether he has an obligation under the law to answer the question.
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3639.444,3642.928,"Once the policeman asks him, he has the obligation to answer him."
1982.81-1320,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3642.928,3645.848,Even if the policeman doesn't have reasonable suspicion?
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3645.848,3647.675,"Probable cause, reasonable suspicion."
1982.81-1320,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3647.675,3652.081,But does he have an obligation to answer if the policeman does not have reasonable suspicion?
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3652.081,3653.517,He's got a good lawsuit afterwards.
1982.81-1320,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3653.517,3656.75,But you didn't answer my question.
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3656.75,3657.422,For the civil suit.
1982.81-1320,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3661.732,3669.698,But then the statute is not confined... then the statute is not confined in its application to cases in which the officer has reasonable suspicion.
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3669.698,3674.649,--Neither are cases of arrest always confined within probable cause to arrest.
1982.81-1320,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3674.649,3678.6,"Well, but that's the way you speaking for the state of... or city of San Diego... interpret this statute."
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3678.6,3679.787,For the state of California.
1982.81-1320,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3684.536,3685.067,"Well, maybe that's the way... what you mean."
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3700.734,3706.154,--The thing is... you're getting down to the practicality.
1982.81-1320,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3722.694,3723.161,Of course.
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3723.724,3726.332,"But certainly, you expect him to have the articulate facts."
1982.81-1320,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3726.332,3728.848,"--We don't need counsel to inform us of that, I don't think."
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3750.041,3750.385,Certainly.
1982.81-1320,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3780.748,3787.668,"--If you really mean what you say, you could make it a crime to refuse to identify yourself whether there's reasonable suspicion or not."
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3804.129,3805.52,"No, not without the articulable fact."
1982.81-1320,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3805.52,3806.722,"Oh, there is a constitutional right, then, to anonymity."
1982.81-1320,2,16738,a_wells_petersen,,3806.722,3807.8,"Well, yes."
1982.81-1320,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3860.404,3861.935,Thank you.
