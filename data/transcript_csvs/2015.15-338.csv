2015.15-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.279,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-338, Sheriff v. Gillie. Mr. Murphy."
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,7.279,22.435,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Given resource constraints, Ohio law has always authorized its attorney general to appoint special counsel to undertake the attorney general's duty of representing the State in the courts."
2015.15-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,114.625,146.75,"May I ask you about the -- the general structure of the Act seems to be in-house collectors are okay, but outside collectors, whether for private or for government, fall under the Act. But do I understand your view correctly that that line doesn't exist for the State; that is, whether it's an in-house or an out-house collector, they're equally exempt?"
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,146.75,151.09,"I agree that -- I -- yes, you understand our position correctly."
2015.15-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,184.725,204.44,"Well, why wouldn't Congress have expressed that more clearly? I mean, that's a big thing that you're saying, that the State debt collectors really ought to be treated very differently, the outside debt collectors from the private. And, on the face of the statute, the private and the State really are treated in exactly the same way."
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,235.355,244.79,"So I disagree that they're perfectly parallel in these ways. First, I think ""officer"" means something different in the government context than it does in the private context."
2015.15-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,259.005,267.095,"Well, I understand the argument that you can read the same term two different ways, but Congress did use the exact same terms."
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,267.095,270.49,But it -- but one is in the private context and one is in the government context.
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,317.61,347.945,"What other -- what other position does the State call someone an independent contractor but we treat them as an officer nevertheless or an employee of someone? We may do it for tax purposes, but we then look at a series of factors to determine whether they're really employees or not. It's hard for you to argue these are employees; correct?"
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,347.945,348.41,Yes.
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,349.12,355.12,They're totally without supervision in their actual debt collection; correct?
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,355.12,357.78,"Well, not totally without supervision."
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,362.59,363.07,Okay.
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,364.66,365.805,We're not claiming they're employees.
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,365.805,387.28,"So what other situation have we ever, in any setting, treated someone whom is called an independent contractor, an officer of a company, government agency, anything? This is a novel sort of idea --"
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,387.28,388.0,I don't think it's a --
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,388.0,395.48,"That you as the state say this is an independent contractor, and now, by law, we're going to deem them an officer."
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,395.48,401.755,I just think independent contractor asks -- the independent contractor employee distinction asks a separate question than the officer --
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,401.755,408.25,"Well, the problem I have is, I certainly understand officers -- like, with corporations."
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,439.785,449.5,"Well, so two points: I think the closest analogy would be -- be a common law analogy that court referenced in Filarsky, which were the special deputy sheriffs."
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,505.09,507.37,I -- I thought that that was just for tax collection.
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,523.62,525.52,"That's -- that's confusing two points, Your Honor."
2015.15-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,555.45,571.3,"Mr. Murphy, can I ask, when -- when you are trying to fill out what it means for somebody to be an officer, are you looking to the Dictionary Act? Are you looking to the common law? Are you looking to our cases? Are you looking to some combination of the three --"
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,571.3,571.6,I think --
2015.15-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,571.6,573.38,-- or how would you prioritize those?
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,573.38,578.88,"As -- as Hobby Lobby suggested, I think the starting point when something is undefined is the Dictionary Act."
2015.15-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,586.99,589.96,"Can I -- can I ask you, then, a question about the Dictionary Act?"
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,589.96,590.315,Uh-huh.
2015.15-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,590.315,601.525,"Which says an officer ""includes any person authorized by law to perform the duties of the office."" And my question to you is -- is just which -- what is the office there?"
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,601.525,604.76,I would -- I would call it the office of special counsel.
2015.15-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,604.76,605.81,The office of special counsel.
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,605.81,613.96,"So just like -- there's no office of -- literally no office of special counsel listed in Ohio law, but there's also no office of solicitor general."
2015.15-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,617.59,621.8,But we know that office exists. (Laughter.)
2015.15-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,621.8,623.08,So -- but -- okay.
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,632.715,646.29,"Usually what the statutes do or what precisely R.C. 109.08 does, it says a superior can appoint -- appoint an inferior officer to engage in certain duties."
2015.15-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,672.345,676.55,I guess the question is whether it needs to more authorize an office.
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,695.97,703.5,"I don't think that matters because, I think, historically, there were plenty of offices that had indefinite numbers."
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,746.83,752.27,So what does your contract require them to comply with the Act?
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,752.27,772.115,"Because we're also the consumer protection branch office, and we want our people complying with the substantive standards of the Act. For instance, everybody agrees that tax debts are not covered by this Act, but we ask them to comply with the substantive standards of the FDCPA for tax debts."
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,779.57,781.6,Are the remedies against the State?
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,781.6,788.23,"Well, the remedies against special counsel. I think we are concerned -- Filarsky goes through various public policies --"
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,788.23,790.455,"No, I'm just talking practical question."
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,792.67,793.38,No.
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,793.38,795.04,You're not indemnifying.
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,817.32,821.925,You want to give them immunity for their contractual violation.
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,821.925,825.99,"Well, it would be immunity from the FDCPA."
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,829.91,831.91,They're State officers. So what other laws?
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,831.91,834.57,"Well, for instance, Section 1983."
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,846.75,855.575,Is there any case that you can point me to where they've been charged with a 1983 violation that you've indemnified them?
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,855.575,864.275,"Well, we wouldn't indemnify them in any circumstances, but there is one case that said they were officers within the meaning of 1983."
2015.15-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,870.065,876.635,You mentioned two categories of outside debt collectors for this scheme.
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,895.58,897.32,You have to remember that these are lawyers.
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1095.78,1100.395,"Could you tell me what the definition is of ""officer."" Give me the definition."
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1100.395,1101.04,I'm sorry.
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1101.04,1102.0,What's your definition?
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1102.0,1102.78,"Oh, my definition."
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1102.78,1106.565,Your definition seems to be tailored to this category.
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1110.84,1114.605,"So the Dictionary Act, authorized by law to perform the duties of the office."
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1125.98,1128.91,Does the law not authorize you to hire special --
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1128.91,1132.79,"Well, just our general ability to contract to perform our services."
2015.15-338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1132.79,1134.24,So how is this different from that?
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1134.24,1142.095,Because there is a specific statute that express the -- delegates the attorney generals' duty of debt collection to special counsel.
2015.15-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1159.345,1165.57,"How do you distinguish Germaine, Mr. Murphy? Because that seems a very similar kind of setup to your own."
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1182.23,1186.845,So I would distinguish Germaine and several other cases both legally and factually.
2015.15-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1219.79,1226.17,"So that's to say that we take these cases, whether it's Germaine or, or your side, Hartwell, and we put them in a different box?"
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1226.17,1227.77,Exactly.
2015.15-338,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1317.25,1320.45,"That seems -- if I understood you correctly, that seems an odd line to draw."
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1324.42,1324.68,No.
2015.15-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1355.17,1358.97,"Could you, Mr. Murphy, address the point, whether this is misleading?"
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1358.97,1359.47,Sure.
2015.15-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1363.52,1370.945,"In the course of that, the statute says that you cannot falsely represent a document to be issued by."
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1373.46,1373.66,Sure.
2015.15-338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1439.5,1455.55,"What about the other provision that is allegedly violated, the one that proscribes use of any business or organization's name other than the true name of the debt collector's business or organization?"
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1455.55,1457.48,It's essentially the same logic.
2015.15-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1474.335,1479.95,"When they signed their name at the bottom and gave their law firm name, was that necessary?"
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1479.95,1480.86,It was.
2015.15-338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1486.07,1488.24,Necessary for compliance with the Act?
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1488.24,1488.27,Oh.
2015.15-338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1509.29,1526.224,"What about only -- the recipient would think, at the least, the letter was authorized by the attorney general? What the statute says is special counsel can use the letterhead stationery only in connection with tax collection."
2015.15-338,0,62682,eric_e_murphy,,1549.4,1551.12,We disagree with that view of the statute.
2015.15-338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1589.99,1595.265,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosencranz."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1595.265,1613.77,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Your Honors, both questions presented really revolve around a single point: Private debt collectors retained as independent counsel for or by a State attorney general are not State officers."
2015.15-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1686.465,1692.365,"If I could clarify, there may be two separate questions that may be part of your answer."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1711.98,1713.815,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2015.15-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1732.08,1735.04,That's not true with respect to qualified immunity.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1739.485,1746.015,"Permanent and continuing office. Yes, Your Honor, you are exactly right. Filarsky is a qualified immunity case."
2015.15-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1792.61,1795.855,But they authorized it -- I'm sorry.
2015.15-338,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1797.16,1826.345,"I think you have recognized -- tell me if I'm wrong about this -- that the special counsel could send out a dunning letter, and the first sentence says, in boldface, ""We write to you as special counsel to the attorney general who has authorized us to collect a debt you owe to X government agency."" That would be perfectly all right."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1843.05,1850.995,"That's correct, Your Honor. So just to be clear, we're shifting ground now to point 2 which is about whether it's a violation of the statute."
2015.15-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1879.655,1883.225,I don't really see the difference between those two situations.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1902.075,1905.4,"Again, so now we're talking about the substantive provisions."
2015.15-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1917.42,1922.24,"It's the seal of the State of Ohio, and it says ""The Program of Special Debt Collection."""
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1922.24,1925.37,"Oh, Your Honor, I think that would be highly misleading."
2015.15-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1928.97,1942.92,Why would it be misleading? What would the recipient of that letter think that the recipient of the letter would not think if that recipient received the letter from the actual office of the attorney general?
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1942.92,1949.16,So I think the recipient of the letter would think the same thing that the recipient of this letter thinks.
2015.15-338,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1968.95,1970.63,I'm not sure what difference it makes.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2012.254,2019.75,"Your Honor, so let's go to the text of the statute, and Congress was very clear about that."
2015.15-338,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2025.2,2032.37,"Well, you can't really be very serious about that, because in Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, they were using the name of the attorney general too."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2032.37,2033.46,"No, Your Honor --"
2015.15-338,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2033.46,2047.92,"One uses name in the text; one uses the name in the letterhead, but both are designed to do the exact same thing, which is to say, ""I'm acting as agent of the Ohio Attorney General in order to collect a sum of money owed to the State."""
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2047.92,2051.73,"Your Honor, they are doing two different things."
2015.15-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2072.8,2078.5,"I thought Justice Kagan asked you a functional question, and you are responding with a formal answer."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2106.71,2117.51,"Well, Your Honor, my answer is the attorney general's answer on pages 416 to 17 and page 334."
2015.15-338,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2143.58,2145.06,"No, you're not answering my question."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2174.61,2175.18,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2189.0,2195.03,"You know, they all the time hire people to do different things who aren't public servants."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2205.625,2208.84,"Your Honor, people react differently and I would react differently --"
2015.15-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2208.84,2209.53,"Well, you might."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2220.63,2221.22,Yes.
2015.15-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2221.22,2228.425,"So if Filene's Basement hires Mr. Smith, who is an independent collector, and Mr. Smith writes a letter -- just what Justice Ginsburg said."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2240.445,2241.37,Of course not.
2015.15-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2241.6,2246.975,"Of course not. Now, in other words, it has to be taken as modified by the first part of this."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2250.83,2251.49,"No, Your Honor --"
2015.15-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2251.49,2257.44,"If you don't interpret it that way, I don't see what it can mean, unless it picks up the -- Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2257.44,2266.06,"Your Honor, the reason I said ""of course not"" is because referring to someone in the body of the letter is not the same as using their -- their --"
2015.15-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2266.06,2268.635,It isn't? I have just used their name.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2268.635,2269.02,Your Honor --
2015.15-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2269.02,2272.66,I said they hired me. Isn't that using their name?
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2272.66,2273.275,It is -- no.
2015.15-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.81,2275.31,In English.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2276.91,2277.47,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.49,2283.07,Of course.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2301.585,2302.32,"Well, so, Your Honor --"
2015.15-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2302.32,2309.13,"And if there is nothing here misleading, and it doesn't mean misleading use and it doesn't mean ordinary English use, what does it mean?"
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2309.13,2318.045,"Your Honor, the -- a central premise of this statute, as I said at the outset, is to distinguish in-house creditors from outside creditors."
2015.15-338,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2353.44,2364.96,"Well, I think -- I would think that that would be a reason for using the -- the heading, because now the -- the Ohio Attorney General is responsible for all the actions that this debt collector is going to take."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2372.235,2379.25,"Well, Your Honor, that may -- in some world, that may be conceivably true. But it's not necessarily true."
2015.15-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2390.48,2417.085,"Why? Why? Why? Filene's Basement hires a service, and they say, here are 500 letters, and they all say ""Filene's Basement."" Now, we want you to send out on these letters -- letterhead so they'll know it's us -- you say -- and you say you're a special representative hired by us to pay the debt. Now, what's wrong with that? I would think it would be -- I mean, what worries me is when you don't have the letterhead."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2425.315,2434.29,"Well, Justice Breyer, the -- it gets back to the -- the question you had when you made originally when General Murfree was up here."
2015.15-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2450.685,2473.82,"So identifying the creditor. My point is, if it's the AG's letterhead or Filene's Basement's letterhead or Macy's letterhead, if they still exist, in -- in -- if -- if it's the official letterhead of the company, the recipient is more likely, not less likely, to understand what's happening."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2477.51,2478.45,I see your point.
2015.15-338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2478.45,2478.61,Okay.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2479.87,2483.13,"And -- and the answer is, Congress made the decision."
2015.15-338,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2509.98,2512.29,I don't think that this is a materiality question.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2522.325,2524.96,"Well, so, first, just a point of clarification."
2015.15-338,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2532.515,2537.44,"Well, they obviously are an agent in all the usual uses of that term."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2548.659,2554.76,"Your Honor, it's totally fine to say I am acting for the attorney general. You can't do it using the --"
2015.15-338,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2554.76,2564.155,"Well, why? If you -- if I use my own letterhead, somebody is likely to throw it out before they get to the text because they've never seen this organization before."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2571.4,2584.5,"Your Honor, the Congress wanted individuals who are unsophisticated to know who they were dealing with, especially when they were dealing with a professional debt collector who gets a cut of the proceeds."
2015.15-338,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2584.5,2586.81,But they're dealing with somebody who is acting for the attorney general.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2586.81,2604.29,"They are -- yes, they are, but they are dealing with someone who is acting for the attorney general in a context in which Congress was deeply concerned about how those individuals have the wrong incentive structures and will do anything to get their third of the proceeds."
2015.15-338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2604.29,2608.295,But -- but you're making the argument somewhat the -- like the argument that you made in the brief.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2630.77,2631.59,"Your Honor, my --"
2015.15-338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2631.59,2637.33,The State has a very strong interest in letting the debtor know that it's the -- that it's its debt.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2637.33,2654.095,"Your Honor, my main point is that Congress wanted people to know -- that is, consumers to know who they're dealing with. But to answer the question, it is simply not true that every debtor is better off paying the State's debt than some other debt."
2015.15-338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2661.9,2665.86,That's -- that's for the debtor's decision to make.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2666.68,2667.03,Exactly.
2015.15-338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2668.27,2674.92,But you -- it -- it seems to me that you -- your -- your solution is almost misleading in -- in another direction.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2674.92,2685.35,"Your Honor, there is nothing wrong with the debt collectors saying everything that you've just described as -- as to what could happen just because the State is involved."
2015.15-338,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2721.23,2733.06,"Basically, this argument, as I understand it -- maybe you can correct me -- is that even a private collector could use the name of Filene's Basement because it's not misleading."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2754.625,2758.68,"I -- I got confused on the question, but under the -- under --"
2015.15-338,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2758.68,2760.96,"Well, the questions have been asked of you."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2761.99,2762.14,Yes.
2015.15-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2763.2,2763.31,No.
2015.15-338,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2763.63,2775.185,"And if I understand you correctly, you're saying we make a different judgment than Congress is about the relative weight of how misleading this is, but Congress made this judgment?"
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2775.185,2777.34,"Congress -- that is exactly correct, Your Honor."
2015.15-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2789.28,2789.65,I'm sorry.
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2803.58,2812.84,"Yes, for exactly the reason that the attorney general conceded below. The concession was about IBM."
2015.15-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2824.16,2825.18,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.15-338,1,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,2825.18,2832.46,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2015.15-338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2832.46,2839.565,Ms. Harrington?
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2839.565,2857.64,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to make a couple of points on the first question presented and then try to answer some questions on the second question presented. The FDCPA applies to Ohio's debt collection special counsel because outside the context of this litigation, Ohio has chosen not to treat them as officers or employees of the State."
2015.15-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2914.845,2935.615,"If you have a special -- I don't know what you call them -- prosecutor, special counsel who's appointed from U.S. Attorney's Office, say, because the other -- the office is recused from a particular matter, just for that one case, does he use -- maybe as factual matter, does he use the letterhead of the U.S. Attorney's office?"
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2935.615,2938.34,I don't know in prosecuting cases.
2015.15-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2947.36,2951.47,What about -- the states often do this.
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2974.705,2981.95,"Well, I think -- you know, this Court, all the time, sees private lawyers who are here representing States, and I don't think that they would be considered officers of the State merely because --"
2015.15-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2981.95,2997.61,"So if Mississippi hires a person to prosecute a murder case and it's called ""special counsel"" for the purpose of prosecuting murder cases for the next year, whatever, they're not officers?"
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2997.61,3000.91,"Well, I guess my real answer is it's really up to the State."
2015.15-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3017.21,3018.2,That's true.
2015.15-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3018.2,3020.185,But he authorizes use of the seal.
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3020.185,3023.16,"He authorizes the use of the letterhead, but --"
2015.15-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3023.16,3029.225,"Well, that's -- you said they've done everything possible to separate them from the attorney general."
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3032.85,3033.24,But as you can --
2015.15-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3033.24,3035.29,"""Here, use our stationery and our letterhead."""
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3035.29,3043.1,"But that -- the use of the letterhead doesn't -- isn't giving them any sort of sovereign authority, doesn't give them any discretion to bind the States."
2015.15-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3060.69,3070.38,I guess my point is simply that authorizing use of the seal does suggest a connection with the individual doing the debt collection work and the attorney general.
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3074.83,3075.15,Well --
2015.15-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3075.15,3081.73,"I can't imagine anything they could do more dramatically to -- to show that there is a connection than say, ""Here, use my letterhead."""
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3081.73,3100.97,"Well, I think if you look at retention agreement, what I meant is they've done everything possible in structuring the relationship between the special counsel and the office of attorney general to make clear that they are not a part of the office. Now, with respect to using the letterhead, I think that's intended to sort of convey a sense of seriousness to debtors who receive the letters. That's the point that -- that the State has made."
2015.15-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3100.97,3110.715,"Well, I expect it's meant to convey that this person is working for us. This person, I, the attorney general, think this is somebody who's acting on my behalf."
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3110.715,3142.06,"Well, it's true that outside debt collectors are acting on behalf of the creditors who hire them, but that does not make them part of the creditor organization. You know, I think if you look at the definition of ""debt collector"" and the exemptions whether, with respect to private creditors or -- or public creditors, it's clear that Congress intended this statute to apply to independent contractors. But it also intended to allow creditors, whether private or public, to use their own in-house people without being subject to the requirements of the Act. And so it's really totally up to the State. If it's going to use its inside people, then it doesn't have to comply with the FDCPA."
2015.15-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3161.87,3167.09,"Well, this isn't that. Nobody thinks this person is the attorney general of the State."
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3167.09,3167.83,"Well, I think --"
2015.15-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3167.83,3190.07,"The reason that's underlying disturbing me is there is a pretty well-known scam where people get phone calls from a person who identifies himself as somehow connected with the IRS, and you better send them $300 or $3,000 immediately to a certain post office box or you might find yourself in jail."
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3192.31,3192.895,Right.
2015.15-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3192.895,3234.69,"And if you get a letter out of the blue by somebody purporting to be an official person and there is nothing on the letterhead that suggests that you are such, you might well think, if you've at least had the experience I'm talking about, that this is a scam. And so what the purpose of this letterhead does is it is some indication to the recipient that it's not a scam, and the rest of the letter makes clear precisely what it is. So what I fail to see is anything at all misleading -- indeed, to the contrary -- in respect to using a letterhead."
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3246.19,3248.3,"Well, sir, I disagree that there's nothing misleading about it."
2015.15-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3262.25,3275.86,"Why is it not sent by the attorney general in the sense that Filene's Basement gives 500 pieces of stationery to a debt collector and says, ""Send them on this stationery."
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3278.2,3282.12,"Well, that would be a violation of the Act, too, if the debt collectors were outside the independent contractor --"
2015.15-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3282.12,3304.49,"My goodness, then what we're going to have is all -- in other words, it's -- in your interpretation of this law, a piece of stationery that tends to indicate that the debt is -- the debt collector is indeed speaking for whom he purports to speak for, anything that indicates that in the view of the government violates this statute."
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3309.785,3311.3,I don't believe that's our view of the statute.
2015.15-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3332.13,3333.02,It's not being taken seriously.
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3343.49,3346.94,"So you could include a separate piece of paper that verifies that, if you're concerned about that."
2015.15-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3346.94,3347.24,"Oh, my goodness."
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3350.79,3352.62,But Congress has made a determination that --
2015.15-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3352.62,3357.97,I don't see anything here that says you cannot send it on a letterhead of the person for whom you owe the debt.
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3359.4,3362.56,"Well, what Congress said is you can't give a misimpression as to who has issued the letter --"
2015.15-338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3362.56,3363.4,Misimpression.
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3364.84,3375.54,"The misimpression is that the attorney general's office has issued the letter. Now, remember, the only reason we're getting to the second question presented is if the special counsel, our officers, are not --"
2015.15-338,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3375.54,3375.88,Suppose --
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3375.88,3376.6,-- officers --
2015.15-338,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3376.6,3382.75,Suppose that the special counsel prepares a letter just like the letter that's -- that was issued in this -- letters issued in this case.
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3395.01,3398.29,"It would, because it would still give the impression that it was issued by the office of the attorney general."
2015.15-338,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3402.43,3408.37,"Even though it's approved -- suppose that they -- they take it to General DeWine, and they say, General, I would like to send this."
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3413.05,3419.86,"Yes, because in section -- Section 9, it talks about authorized, issued, or approved by a State agency."
2015.15-338,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3424.645,3433.36,It's your -- it's your position -- it's the position of the government of the United States that the Attorney General of Ohio is in violation of this law?
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3433.36,3435.35,"No, that the special counsel are in violation --"
2015.15-338,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3435.35,3435.72,No.
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3437.525,3440.11,He's -- he has sanctioned a violation of the law.
2015.15-338,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3440.38,3446.16,"But under your position, the -- the attorney general of the State of Ohio is in violation of the law."
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3449.24,3449.84,"No, sir."
2015.15-338,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3451.36,3451.585,Sure.
2015.15-338,2,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3451.585,3456.025,Our view is that the attorney general has authorized the special counsel to do something that is a violation of the law.
2015.15-338,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3460.035,3468.7,"Well, the next time you come here in a criminal or a civil case and someone has authorized something, I will remind you of your answer. (Laughter.)"
2015.15-338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3468.7,3473.285,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Murphy, you have four minutes remaining."
2015.15-338,3,62682,eric_e_murphy,,3473.285,3482.04,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points. First, going to Justice Kagan's question, I really think they are turning a virtue into a vice here."
2015.15-338,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3509.07,3510.39,How do they know who to call?
2015.15-338,3,62682,eric_e_murphy,,3510.39,3512.21,Precisely because the AG's letterhead --
2015.15-338,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3512.21,3518.1,Does the Act say that the special debt collector has to give them the AG's problem-solving --
2015.15-338,3,62682,eric_e_murphy,,3518.1,3518.36,No.
2015.15-338,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3526.25,3531.28,"But that's quite interesting, because the only number that's in these letters is the net -- number of the debt collector."
2015.15-338,3,62682,eric_e_murphy,,3531.28,3531.79,"Well, that's right."
2015.15-338,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3533.88,3544.31,"Is there any obligation in the contract for the debt collector, when he receives a customer complaint, to give them the number of the AG's customer service --"
2015.15-338,3,62682,eric_e_murphy,,3544.31,3561.29,"There's not an obligation in the contract, but there certainly is an obligation in the contract for them to report that complaint to the AG. And I -- I -- I think that the AG has interpreted these problem resolution officers more broadly to allow it to handle all sorts of complaints."
2015.15-338,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3571.17,3575.0,"It also uses the word ""issued."" And so what about ""issued""?"
2015.15-338,3,62682,eric_e_murphy,,3575.0,3595.6,"Well, I think that -- just look at the -- we're the only party that has actually cited the dictionary definition of ""issue.""
