1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,13.824,22.913,The issue in this case involves the deductibility of the unrelated non-member business expenses of an exempt social club.
1989.89-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.577,197.577,"Mr. Henzke, where will we find these sections?"
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,199.112,200.897,--The Section 512(a)(3)?
1989.89-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,201.881,202.331,"Well, in the--"
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,202.331,202.781,--appendix to the--
1989.89-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,202.781,204.766,--the one you... the appendix to your petition?
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,204.766,205.299,--Yes.
1989.89-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.516,207.585,The appendix to the brief.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,207.585,208.018,Yes.
1989.89-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,212.27,213.539,The... the blue brief?
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,213.539,214.839,"The blue brief, yes."
1989.89-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,215.991,221.995,"Oh, I've got the wrong case."
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,221.995,236.654,"As I was saying, Section 512(a)(3)(a) defines all the remaining activities, all the activities except the exempt category, as fitting into the unrelated business category."
1989.89-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,340.222,357.183,"So are you... are you saying that there's a presumption in... in this section of the statute that any deduction is for a profit motive and that any unrelated business is also for a profit motive, or that profit motive is simply irrelevant?"
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,357.183,380.53,"--Well, profit motive is simply irrelevant for a... to determine whether an activity goes on the unrelated business side... category under Section 512(a)(3) because Section 512(a)(3) does not contain any profit motive requirement and it sets forth specifically what the requirements are for being an unrelated business under Section 512(a)(3)."
1989.89-530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,440.003,449.026,"Well, doesn't the statute refer to deductions allowed by this chapter?"
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,460.667,467.488,"Your Honor, it does incorporate many requirements of provisions other than Section 512(a)(3)."
1989.89-530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,467.488,468.055,All right.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,474.824,478.462,And we agreed with that... with that contention.
1989.89-530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,478.462,485.949,And that section has been interpreted as incorporating a profit motive.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,485.949,491.52,I would... I don't think it's been interpreted as incorporating a profit motive in the--
1989.89-530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.52,493.555,For a trade or business.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,493.555,496.09,--For a... it incorporates a trade or business.
1989.89-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,529.311,533.113,xxx the profit motive in this case?
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,533.113,540.084,Because Section 512(a)(3) itself decides what is a business and--
1989.89-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,540.084,541.536,And once you've got a business you've got a business?
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,541.536,542.419,"--You've got a business, right."
1989.89-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.049,611.465,"Well, you want to--"
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,611.465,611.932,--be one or the other.
1989.89-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.932,618.786,--You want to explain it... get down to what the government's contention really is.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,618.786,620.155,"Well, I--"
1989.89-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,620.155,621.005,How it works out.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,621.005,632.378,--I think the... the government's... the government confuses the preconditions for a Section 162 business with what happens after it's determined you have a business.
1989.89-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,632.378,640.984,"Yeah, but the problem here is whether... is whether certain deductions can be taken against investment income."
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,642.318,642.918,That's right.
1989.89-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,644.103,652.376,And... but it isn't for the purpose of determining whether or not you've got a gain or loss on your non-member activities.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,658.363,658.83,That's right.
1989.89-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,660.513,660.946,Yes.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,660.946,665.6,Nor does the government disagree that we properly computed the direct and the indirect expenses.
1989.89-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,665.6,670.088,But the only issue is whether that loss can be taken against other unrelated income?
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,670.088,670.554,That's right.
1989.89-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.632,728.79,"If it was... if there was a precondition of a profit motive for a trade or business under this section, I don't suppose you'd allow any deductions, because it wouldn't be a trade or business at all."
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,728.79,730.659,Not in... not in this particular case.
1989.89-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,746.469,757.293,"Well, if you had... if you had made money on these member... non-member transactions, you would have been required to report any gain from it?"
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,757.293,760.078,If we had made money in the sense that we had taxable income--
1989.89-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,760.078,760.561,Yes.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,760.561,763.447,--we would then have to pay tax on that taxable income.
1989.89-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,763.847,767.299,Whether or not you had a profit motive?
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,767.299,769.251,"Well, I... whether or not we had a profit motive, right."
1989.89-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,850.821,851.388,"Well, they don't refer to--"
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,851.388,851.988,--a profit motive.
1989.89-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,851.988,852.855,"--They don't really say that, do they?"
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,852.855,857.142,"Well, that's what they're doing, I think, Your Honor, because they are saying that after--"
1989.89-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,857.142,866.765,"Well, it is certainly logical to say that running the restaurant and all the other non-member activities is one major function of the club and the interest on their investments is another one."
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,871.619,880.007,"--But, Your Honor, I think that what they're saying is that we will... we agree that this is an unrelated business under Section 512(a)(3) of the Code."
1989.89-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.482,896.517,"They're doing it for purposes of deductions, not for purposes of including the gross income."
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,896.517,897.886,"Well, the gross--"
1989.89-530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,897.886,898.752,To the extent you'd include--
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,898.752,901.602,"--Of course, you don't include the gross income just as gross income."
1989.89-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,919.112,928.968,--But you seem to be interpreting this section as saying that anything goes so far as the deduction of the related expenses so long as it's related.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,928.968,929.518,"Well,--"
1989.89-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,929.518,934.538,"It seems to me there has to be some control, as Justice O'Connor points out, initially under Section 162."
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,934.538,936.405,"--Well, there is... there is a great deal of control."
1989.89-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,982.685,987.672,"Well, you have to allocate some fixed costs to the unrelated income, don't you?"
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,987.672,990.124,"Oh, there's no question about that."
1989.89-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,998.145,1003.432,Was that stipulated for purposes of this case or is there a revenue ruling that covers this area generally?
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1007.384,1010.52,--It's stipulated in this case that this was a reasonable allocation.
1989.89-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1048.645,1076.314,"May I ask you, what... what do you say about the government's main argument that... that the theory you urge would frustrate the whole purpose of the provision, which is not to let people who are spending money on their own entertainment in... in effect to get tax deductions for it by allowing their investment income that is used for that activity to be tax-free."
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1076.314,1081.801,"In... in our view, Your Honor, the statute does not tax gross investment income."
1989.89-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1233.799,1236.984,How does this gross-to-gross allocation method work?
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1265.487,1266.403,All right.
1989.89-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1276.961,1277.478,Right.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1277.478,1278.078,All right.
1989.89-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.064,1306.897,On the non-member business?
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1306.897,1308.447,"On the non-member business, yes."
1989.89-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1310.516,1314.92,And the government has stipulated that that's an appropriate allocation in this case?
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1314.92,1316.636,"That's right, Your Honor."
1989.89-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1316.636,1318.205,That... that seems to me very strange.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1322.157,1322.64,"Well, it really--"
1989.89-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1322.64,1328.411,--doesn't seem to me that one... that one member uses one percent of the fixed costs.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1331.78,1332.465,"--Well, the reason--"
1989.89-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1332.465,1333.682,But that seems to be what the government seems to have done.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1333.682,1337.667,--There is a reason for using this gross-to-gross method even if it's not perfectly accurate.
1989.89-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1358.08,1366.119,"So all of the clubs in the country are, therefore, understating... or, overstating the costs that are allocated to non-member activity?"
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1366.119,1370.055,"--Well, they're under... some of them may be... the gross-to-gross method may be accurate."
1989.89-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.366,1390.484,"But when you say non-member business, you mean income from non-members."
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1390.484,1390.851,Right.
1989.89-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.851,1393.336,You would count member dues as part of the member business?
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1393.336,1395.372,That's... that's correct.
1989.89-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1400.276,1409.382,"And... and you count expenses... income received from guests of members as member expenses and not non-member expenses, do you not?"
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1409.382,1411.082,That... that will vary.
1989.89-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1427.176,1431.711,"Well, can a non-member pay a bill?"
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1437.282,1445.221,"Well, the mechanics of it will differ, but the non-member can bear the economic... burden of the bill, yes."
1989.89-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.103,1536.148,xxx you want to claim these... you want to claim these overhead expenses as... as deductible and yet you want to disregard them to show that you have a profit motive.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1536.148,1544.819,"Well, because the definition of... of profit, for purposes of computing your tax, is different from the definition of profit for purposes of profit--"
1989.89-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.819,1545.321,It's cash flow.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1545.321,1545.671,--motive.
1989.89-530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.671,1546.187,It's cash flow.
1989.89-530,0,34583,leonard_j_henzke_jr,,1546.187,1547.154,"It's cash flow, right."
1989.89-530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.574,1554.609,"Thank you, Mr. Henzke."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1563.298,1566.667,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.725,1747.568,"Well, Mr. Sloan, do you... do you agree that... that these sort of indirect expenses are deductible for the purpose of determining whether there's a profit or loss on non-member activities?"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1747.568,1749.02,"For it... well, let's see."
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.539,1756.69,I'm talking about the overhead items.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1756.69,1757.123,Right.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.459,1758.992,Right.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1758.992,1769.433,"Yes, we think that those costs that are allocated should be considered in evaluating whether the club had a profit or not."
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.017,1772.802,On the... on the non-member activity?
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1772.802,1773.819,On the non-member activity.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.435,1778.456,"And if it's... and if there's a profit, there's a tax?"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1778.456,1779.806,Yes.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.806,1788.162,"And if there's a loss, there's no tax but you say that can't be set off against other non-member income?"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1788.162,1789.645,That's right.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.645,1791.264,Because?
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1791.264,1793.799,Because the activity was not engaged in for profit.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1793.799,1795.834,Is there a regulation to this effect?
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1795.834,1798.786,There's a revenue ruling to this effect in 1981.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.786,1799.669,I didn't ask that.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1801.169,1802.504,"No, there is not a regulation to this effect."
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.504,1804.94,Has there ever... has there been a proposed regulation?
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1804.94,1805.34,No.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.86,1816.664,How long... how long has the Service taken this position that you're urging?
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1816.664,1822.985,"--Well, the revenue ruling was issued in 1981, and certainly since 1981."
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.985,1824.368,Consistently?
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1824.368,1825.302,Yes.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.302,1827.97,And before that?
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1827.97,1832.524,Before that the issue doesn't appear to have been firmly resolved.
1989.89-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.385,1851.785,And the act was passed in 1969?
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1851.785,1852.787,That's right.
1989.89-530,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1852.787,1856.123,And with what tax years are we concerned here?
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1856.123,1858.158,The tax years are 1980 and '81.
1989.89-530,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1858.158,1863.729,So that the rev. rule came down just about the time of these tax years?
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1863.729,1866.681,"Well, that's... that's correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-530,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1887.51,1903.437,"Mr. Sloan, do you accept the Ninth Circuit's definition of profit explained in that North Ridge case, which is that the production of gains in excess of all direct and indirect costs--"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1903.437,1903.954,--Yes.
1989.89-530,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1903.954,1905.056,--indicates a profit?
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1905.056,1906.089,"Yes, we do."
1989.89-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.589,1909.858,"Well, you accept it for one purpose but not for the other."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1916.178,1918.696,"Well, for what purpose do we not accept it?"
1989.89-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.696,1929.921,You accept it for... for purposes of deciding whether it's a profit-motivated business but you reject it for purposes of deciding whether it's a... it's a proper deduction from the business.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1941.062,1941.829,"Well, that--"
1989.89-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.829,1942.962,"Now, isn't that a fair characterization?"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1984.139,1990.043,"--No, we're not saying that they're... that they're entirely separate in terms of the profit motive."
1989.89-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.04,2048.746,"When you compute if they're making a profit from their... sandwich business, they wouldn't be making a profit if... if they're simply getting back more than marginal costs."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2050.848,2052.3,Than the combination of the direct costs--
1989.89-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.3,2053.916,--the combination of the marginal and direct?
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2053.916,2062.42,"--and indirect costs, which is exactly the test that Justice O'Connor was mentioning that the Ninth Circuit said in the North Ridge case, which we completely agree with."
1989.89-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2065.357,2068.059,"That's very generous of you, of course, because that never happens, does it?"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2071.094,2084.152,"--Well, it... it doesn't happen in the way that they have been allocated and so... it may be that the Commissioner is unduly generous in allowing... in stipulating to this allocation method."
1989.89-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2101.263,2104.665,"Well... well, but I... I wonder if there isn't an inconsistency there."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2119.225,2140.94,"We have accepted this method of allocation, Your Honor, and in the record... not only for these tax years in... not only for the specific tax years in question, but for 1975 to 1984 there is regularly nothing but losses which are shown by Petitioner for this activity and for this allocation method."
1989.89-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2206.466,2208.918,"Well, I don't know why that's... why that's confined to social clubs."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2210.602,2216.489,"--Well, it is... it is not like any business because any business has a profit motive."
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2295.374,2307.665,"I don't... see, where is there room under the Section 512(a)(3) for insisting on this profit motive?"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2332.899,2333.533,We take--
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2333.533,2339.803,And it doesn't separate out investment income from other kind of income.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2342.172,2348.075,"--Well, because of the phrase ""deductions allowed by this chapter"", Justice White."
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.591,2406.079,"--Well, yeah, but it... this doesn't require a trade or business, (3)(a)."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2406.079,2410.316,"--No, it... it doesn't require a trade or business because, again, Congress, consciously broadened--"
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.316,2410.733,Exactly.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2410.733,2411.833,--the tax and it includes--
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.833,2412.268,Exactly.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2412.268,2412.685,--gross income--
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2412.685,2413.185,Exactly.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2413.185,2415.387,--which isn't limited to a trade or business.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2434.014,2438.233,"Well, there's just nothing... there's no necessity to have a trade or business in (3)(a)."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2438.233,2441.704,--There's no necessity to have a trade or business to be taxed.
1989.89-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2516.602,2522.656,"Well, they do... Section 512(a)(1) does refer to unrelated business taxable income."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2522.656,2523.056,--That's--
1989.89-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2523.056,2526.691,"And so what we're saying in that section, we're dealing with a business."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2526.691,2533.214,"--Well, it... it uses the term... Chief Justice Rehnquist, it uses the term ""unrelated business taxable income""."
1989.89-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2547.838,2550.689,"Well, it uses the same thing in 512(a)(3)(A)."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2550.689,2551.258,That's right.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.932,2712.495,"It sounds like you're really relying on a general rule that... that if you have more expenses than you have income from a nonprofit activity, you can't apply that... those excess expenses to any income from any other source."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2712.495,2715.531,"That's correct, Justice White, because there's no--"
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2715.531,2718.083,"Now, what authority do you have for that?"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2718.083,2718.599,--Well--
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2718.599,2727.189,I say you... you cite... you cite Boris Bitker and you cite two court of appeals cases.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2727.189,2727.722,"--Well, that--"
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.722,2733.259,"Do you have anything from a... you have no regulation for it, no regulation for it."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2739.397,2746.753,"--Well, I think, for example, the Five Lakes Outing Club that is cited in our brief at footnote 6 would be--"
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2746.753,2747.086,Yes.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2748.053,2749.205,--That's right.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.428,2766.749,"Well, there's no... no... there's no provision in the Code preventing it either."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2766.749,2767.549,"Well, it--"
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.549,2769.368,You put the... you say that--
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2769.368,2770.168,--It's... it is a--
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2770.168,2771.634,--That's just bootstrapping.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2771.634,2772.051,--No.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2781.526,2782.826,"Well, he says that--"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2782.826,2783.576,--and that requirement--
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2783.576,2787.43,"--He says, I'm trying to figure out what my... what my taxable income is."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2792.532,2795.399,"--He should... well, he doesn't have to pay tax on that activity."
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2796.101,2805.541,"Well, I know, but he... he says, I've got some other income, but if I... but I'm still out of pocket because I've had more expenses than I've had income."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2805.541,2823.669,Because the... the reason that that principle is allowed with respect to a profit-making activity is because in that circumstance there is a reasonable expectation that at some point... the theory is that at some point the taxpayer is going to turn it around and there's going to be a profit on it.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2854.974,2869.734,So you... so you say that it's... there's just this general principle that we ought to accept that you can only... in a nonprofit activity you can only apply expenses to that income?
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2869.734,2870.634,--That's correct.
1989.89-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2870.634,2878.137,"Well, it seems to me you're relying on a... on a broader principle, and that is that the burden is on the taxpayer to justify any deduction."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2878.137,2880.605,"That's... that's exactly right, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1989.89-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2886.076,2890.83,You have a defense to each of their arguments as to why they could get a deduction.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2890.83,2891.613,--That's right.
1989.89-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2892.68,2902.371,Except that you come... you come here having stipulated that the deductions are proper as to the non-member income.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2903.088,2910.209,"--Not that the deductions are proper as to the non-member income, but the allocation of costs as to the non-member income are proper."
1989.89-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2912.977,2915.595,"Well, all deductions other than the one in question."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2915.595,2919.916,"--Well, that's... that's correct."
1989.89-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2938.044,2948.984,"But why if they're not engaged in a business for profit they... they... to offset, don't they have to point to some section that authorizes a deduction?"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2948.984,2968.563,"--Well, as... as we had suggested, and as the Five Lakes Outing Club suggests, there is a well-recognized interpretation that the Commissioner has given that is consistent with the intent of the Code not to tax gross income but to tax net income, of allowing an offset of expenses up to... up to the level of the receipts."
1989.89-530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2968.563,2970.182,"But that's not a deduction, you're saying?"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,2970.182,2970.665,That's right.
1989.89-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3015.644,3020.532,"Well, I suppose they'd say it's a matter of consistency, not generosity."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3020.532,3034.356,"Well, but I... respectfully, I think that our position is entirely consistent here because what we are allowing... and it is... has been applied in numerous other situations... is an offset of expenses up to the level of the receipts."
1989.89-530,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3052.234,3069.363,"But, Mr. Sloan, under your reading of the Code it would be open to the Commissioner to take the position that, absent a profit motive, no expenses are deductible and you might be back here next year with that position."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3069.363,3070.179,"Well, it--"
1989.89-530,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3070.179,3076.868,Apparently you would defend that as a proper reading of the statute.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3076.868,3080.403,"--I... let me answer it in this way, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-530,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3087.324,3091.894,"I know, but your legal position would leave open that position--"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3091.894,3092.478,--That's correct.
1989.89-530,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3092.478,3096.346,--to be taken by the Commissioner in another case on another day.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3096.346,3097.882,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3183.554,3186.423,"Mr. Sloan, will you just clear up one thing to be sure I have it straight?"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3207.419,3208.353,That's correct.
1989.89-530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3227.898,3233.069,And that's really the big distinction between the two definitions of unrelated business taxable income.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3235.254,3240.491,"Well, that certainly is the primary distinction and it's one that Congress was focusing on in 1969."
1989.89-530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3245.043,3245.36,Yeah.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3245.36,3246.478,--except for the exempt function income.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3249.68,3259.202,"Well, if you didn't allow... there wouldn't be much of a problem if you didn't allow these... not only the direct costs but the overhead deduction?"
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3259.202,3260.988,"Well, there... there wouldn't be--"
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3260.988,3265.206,But (a)... (a)(3) says directly connected with the production--
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3265.206,3265.973,--And as recent--
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3265.973,3269.51,--and yet you seem to allow indirect deductions.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3269.51,3277.014,--We stipulated to it in this case that those indirect costs were properly allocated and that they were directly connected.
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3285.937,3286.187,Yeah.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3286.187,3286.72,--to it to--
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3286.72,3294.142,"But if you lose this case, you won't be out much money if you... if you don't allow these deductions."
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3294.142,3302.315,"--Well, if... as applied to social clubs across the country, we would be out a lot of money and we would be in a situation where--"
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3302.315,3304.381,Not if you didn't allow these--
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3304.381,3305.433,"--Oh, I see."
1989.89-530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.533,3307.133,--Yes.
1989.89-530,1,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3307.133,3316.991,"Well, if you change the allocation method and, for example, didn't allow any costs to be allocated altogether, then that... that suggests that Petitioner should have been taxed on that income."
