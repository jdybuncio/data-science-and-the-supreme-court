1998.97-1536,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.808,"We'll hear argument next in No. 97-1536, Arizona Department of Revenue v. the Blaze Construction Company."
1998.97-1536,0,38026,patrick_irvine,,77.0,78.883,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.493,122.612,Let me ask you a question.
1998.97-1536,0,38026,patrick_irvine,,157.135,157.702,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.97-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,167.058,171.378,"So, it was open to the tribe to protect itself had it wanted to do so--"
1998.97-1536,0,38026,patrick_irvine,,171.378,172.112,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,172.578,174.112,--and its... and its contractors.
1998.97-1536,0,38026,patrick_irvine,,174.112,181.516,"--None of the contracts at issue were... were taken over by tribes pursuant to self-determination, but each and every one of them could have been."
1998.97-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,181.516,182.516,Thank you.
1998.97-1536,0,38026,patrick_irvine,,182.516,188.17,"In fact, if Congress decides that a different rule, a different preemption rule, should apply, it can certainly enact one."
1998.97-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.907,200.644,"The... the tax here amounts to quite a bit of money all told, doesn't it?"
1998.97-1536,0,38026,patrick_irvine,,202.596,207.297,"The assessment, including interest, was approximately 1.2 million dollars."
1998.97-1536,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.487,223.343,"And yet, in fact, the State has provided very little in the nature of services, I guess, in connection with this contractor."
1998.97-1536,0,38026,patrick_irvine,,223.343,229.413,We don't argue that there are any direct services directly to these contracts or the particular geographic location.
1998.97-1536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,258.682,278.728,"Well, but I thought that we had made a special inquiry into the extent the State has provided services when Indian sovereignty is at stake, as opposed to whether or not the State can just tax a Federal contractor without added complication of an Indian reservation."
1998.97-1536,0,38026,patrick_irvine,,278.728,279.763,"--That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
1998.97-1536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.763,284.232,"In other words, the Cotton Petroleum case requires us to make this sort of inquiry."
1998.97-1536,0,38026,patrick_irvine,,284.232,289.718,"That's correct, Your Honor, but this issue of Federal contractors has never been addressed by the Court."
1998.97-1536,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,318.221,324.392,And... and you would say the Cotton Petroleum inquiry then is... is not necessary when there's a Federal contractor involved?
1998.97-1536,0,38026,patrick_irvine,,324.392,325.741,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1536,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,353.978,373.807,"What about the argument that it will reduce the total amount available for road building if some money has to be spent in paying State taxes, that that money that could be spared would otherwise be available to build more roads inside the reservation?"
1998.97-1536,0,38026,patrick_irvine,,373.807,385.449,"Your Honor, I think the... this Court has consistently held, both in the context of Federal contractors and even contracts on reservations, that the very fact that there may be economic effects are not sufficient to preempt the tax."
1998.97-1536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.788,455.573,Are these contracts subject to Federal wage laws?
1998.97-1536,0,38026,patrick_irvine,,455.573,456.775,I believe they would be.
1998.97-1536,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,458.977,475.819,"So, there may be no economic impact at all if indeed the wages are... happen to be set according to what the rest of the industry is doing in that area no matter... and the rest of the... and the rest of the industry is paying taxes if the market is operating properly anyway."
1998.97-1536,0,38026,patrick_irvine,,480.807,482.425,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-1536,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,846.244,856.016,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1536,2,18056,bruce_c_smith,,1249.622,1256.359,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1536,3,38026,patrick_irvine,,2654.36,2659.33,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.97-1536,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2801.755,2802.505,"Thank you, Mr. Irvine."
