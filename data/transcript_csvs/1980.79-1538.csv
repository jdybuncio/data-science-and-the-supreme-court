1980.79-1538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.369,We will hear arguments next in Secretary of Interior v. The Surface Mining Company and the related case.
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,68.456,75.126,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.313,311.877,"Mr. Buscemi, supposing that that statute at the phase you now describe didn't talk about coal at all, it simply talked about the desirability of zoning on a national level, and Congress passed a law saying that for any state that doesn't zone land and keep a certain amount of prime farm land in existence that is now in existence, we will supersede that state's regulatory power with our own zoning act."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,314.049,327.576,"Well, I'm not sure that I completely appreciate the question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because I'm not sure that I understand the factual underpinning that Congress would have for that sort of regulation."
1980.79-1538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,365.983,376.556,"Well, in Chief Justice Hughes' opinion in Jones & Laughlin v. NLRB, when he was upholding the National Labor Relations statute, he said that, regarding the Commerce Clause,"
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,403.827,428.738,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that the Court's decision in National League of Cities v. Usery establishes that there is some impact of the federal system of government, our state system, the Tenth Amendment, or the federal system of government generally, however you want to characterize that decision, on the exercise of the commerce power."
1980.79-1538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,437.361,466.755,"Then, do you think that Congress after reciting the history of surface farm lands in Oklahoma being blown over into Kansas and other places, back in the '30s, could require under the Commerce Clause that all farmers plough their land with contour plowing as distinguished from straight line plowing?"
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,466.755,475.033,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, again, my answer to that question is essentially the same as it was to Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,475.033,480.046,"My question gives you a concrete, specific statute, though."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,480.046,490.73,"Well, I have to confess ignorance as to the situation in the Dust Bowl in the '30s, and as to the impact of contour plowing as opposed to some other kind of plowing--"
1980.79-1538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,490.73,503.442,"Well, assuming... add to it the congressional recital that scientific research and practice has demonstrated that contour plowing will preserve the soil for future generations."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,503.442,544.005,"--I assume, Mr. Chief Justice, that if Congress rationally found that the failure to adopt a particular method of plowing or a particular method of cultivating farmlands had an adverse effect on interstate commerce and if Congress further rationally concluded that regulation of the method of plowing would help to alleviate that effect, that Congress could regulate that sort of agricultural activity, just as Congress has in fact regulated agricultural cultivation, for example, with the pricing regulations and also with the farm subsidy laws."
1980.79-1538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,544.005,554.157,"Well, but they've done that by use of the power of the purse, granting subsidies if farmers complied with certain regulations."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,563.95,574.398,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the findings are critical."
1980.79-1538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,601.403,605.027,"The word necessary presupposes the answer a little bit, doesn't it?"
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,605.027,609.4,"--That's essentially what I'm trying to say, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,619.146,629.83,"The basis would be that the United States Department of Agriculture says it knows more about farming and soil conservation than the states do, and Congress accepts that."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,629.83,634.031,"--But, Mr. Chief Justice, that's not the situation we have here."
1980.79-1538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.038,673.14,"Mr. Buscemi, what does that investigation show the effect on commerce is or may be if there is surface mining of coal without restoring the... say, the high wall?"
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,673.14,676.296,"--Well, I think, Mr. Justice White--"
1980.79-1538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,676.296,689.259,"I can understand why surface mining might be said to affect commerce, but that wouldn't mean that anything that Congress said, ordered with respect to surface mining would have an effect on commerce."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,689.259,704.331,"--I think that's correct, Mr. Justice White, but I think in particular the high wall regulation that you, or the high wall statutory provision that you refer to is very closely connected to preventing adverse environmental effects from surface mining."
1980.79-1538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.424,709.376,"Well, you mean anything that affects the environment affects commerce?"
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,713.406,728.323,"--Well, I think that that is one of the kinds of effects on commerce that Congress can consider, and I think that in this case that Congress has found that there is substantial environmental damage caused by surface mining."
1980.79-1538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.323,737.333,"Well, what if... what if Virginia had a law that required, when you surface mine on these steep areas, that when you're through mining you flatten them and cover them."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,753.046,757.685,"Subject, of course, to the test that it would have to bear a rational relationship."
1980.79-1538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.685,759.683,"Well, I'm asking you what that is."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,767.461,777.88,"I understand, Mr. Justice White, but in point of fact, in this statute, under Section 615, it is permissible to flatten the land."
1980.79-1538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.095,794.825,"So you suggest that if miners want to not restore its original contour in these steep places, they need not?"
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,794.825,795.856,That's correct.
1980.79-1538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,805.259,808.913,"Well, so you're not answering my question, again."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,829.25,852.552,"I'm not sure specifically what you mean by flattening it and covering it, but in fact, again with respect to the strip mining, the surface mining on the side of the mountain, the steep slope provisions do provide variances that will allow the maintenance of flat benchland if that is necessary for public use or a higher economic use."
1980.79-1538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,852.552,859.003,"Well, you still haven't suggested to me what the effect on commerce is."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,859.003,862.111,What the effect on commerce is of strip mining?
1980.79-1538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,862.111,867.547,"No, of not restoring the contour but flattening it and covering it some other way."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,867.547,874.498,"Well, Mr. Justice White, I refer you to the findings that Congress made in Section 101 of the statute."
1980.79-1538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,874.498,877.011,"Well, don't refer me, I want to ask... you can tell me what--"
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,881.416,885.212,"Well, that's precisely my point, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.785,898.331,"Well, you go ahead and tell me what impact on commerce it has."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,900.285,943.985,"In Section 101 of the statute Congress has found that coal mining operations contribute significantly to the nation's energy requirements, that surface mining results in disturbance of surface areas, that burden and adversely affect commerce by destroying and diminishing the utility of land for commercial, industrial, residential, recreational, agricultural, and forestry purposes by causing erosion and landslides, by contributing to floods, by polluting the water, by destroying fish and wildlife habitats, by impairing natural beauty, by damaging the property of citizens, by creating hazards dangerous to life and property--"
1980.79-1538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.985,959.416,I can understand all of that but I still don't identify in that listing any specific impact on commerce by a failure to restore the original contour when these steep places are mined.
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,959.416,976.221,"--Well, I think, Mr. Justice White, the question is not whether every individual failure to restore a particular surface mine to its approximate original contour has a substantial effect on commerce."
1980.79-1538,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.189,995.652,"So your answer to me is that it doesn't make any difference whether this particular phase that's regulated has any effect on commerce, as long as strip mining is subject to regulation, that's the end of the?"
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,995.652,1005.1,"Well, it certainly doesn't make any difference whether you can point to a particular mine and identify the particular effect on commerce from that mine."
1980.79-1538,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.069,1008.88,"Well, I'm still a little puzzled."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1026.483,1026.67,Yes.
1980.79-1538,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1026.67,1035.167,"Or are you taking the more extreme position that you don't even have to have that as long as the activity is regulated, is subject to regulation?"
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1035.167,1044.773,"Well, I think that with respect to the form of regulation that Congress chooses, there must be a rational relationship between that regulation and the protection and the regulation of commerce."
1980.79-1538,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1051.004,1060.141,"What your answer to Mr. Justice White, then, is, is that some of the things that you read are in fact, looking at the class of activity as a whole, related to commerce."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1060.141,1061.985,--Yes.
1980.79-1538,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.985,1065.983,Which is different from the... all right.
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1065.983,1070.997,"Now, I want to make the point--"
1980.79-1538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1070.997,1074.542,Can you give us an example or two of what would be the negative impact on commerce?
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1076.495,1087.209,"--I really don't know how to respond to that except by saying that the list that I just read, I think, indicates that there is a substantial effect on commerce."
1980.79-1538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1087.661,1091.832,"Well, because Congress says so doesn't make it true, necessarily."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1097.175,1117.15,"--Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, for example, the Buffalo Creek flood disaster, which we've cited or mentioned in one of the briefs and which is mentioned in the congressional reports, is the kind of disaster that Congress is trying to avert through regulating surface mining, and I think that where hundreds of lives are lost, there's no question of the--"
1980.79-1538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1117.15,1118.603,"That's not a Commerce Clause issue, is it?"
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1120.133,1138.095,"--I think, for example, that if you look at the child labor legislation that this Court upheld under the Commerce Clause in Darby, there's no question that Congress can try to pursue other ends in the exercise of its Commerce Clause power."
1980.79-1538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1190.684,1209.271,"But if there is no rigid separation, then it seems to me you're just pushing it to the outer edge and saying that Congress can supersede any state authority by simply a set of findings which are unreviewable in this Court, or any other court."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1209.271,1246.802,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that, for example, in your dissent in this Court in Fry v. United States, you make the point that there is a very broad discretion in Congress to make findings, and that's part of what Congress is entitled to do, and you made that point, I believe, in the connection of United States v. California, which you specifically said you thought was a correct decision because Congress had made certain findings about the impact of railroad hazards on public safety and on commerce."
1980.79-1538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1328.661,1337.189,"There was something about powers not expressly granted having been reserved, isn't there somewhere?"
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1337.189,1344.015,"That's true, Mr. Chief Justice, but here the Commerce Clause power is expressly granted."
1980.79-1538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1344.529,1352.386,"Well, we've been trying, I think, several of us to get a specific focus on just how it affects interstate commerce."
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1352.386,1357.79,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think I've given my best answer to that question."
1980.79-1538,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1402.647,1404.677,"On this issue, you're the respondent, aren't you?"
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1404.677,1405.568,--That's exactly right.
1980.79-1538,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1407.644,1410.174,The Court of Appeals held in your favor on this issue?
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1410.174,1410.815,--the district court ruled in our favor.
1980.79-1538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.184,1592.477,But a state is not free to decide that it will have no program?
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1592.477,1601.24,"Well, a state, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is free to decide that it will not regulate surface mining at all, but in that event the Federal Government will regulate surface mining."
1980.79-1538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.24,1602.599,Under the Commerce Clause?
1980.79-1538,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1602.599,1603.926,Under the Commerce Clause.
1980.79-1538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1647.456,1648.206,Very well.
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1652.143,1653.924,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1704.824,1722.068,"Is this, then, a matter of the extent of the commerce power, or is it a matter of an impediment, in this case a constitutional impediment, erected by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, perhaps, to the exercise by Congress of the commerce power?"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1722.068,1728.814,"Well, you know, the district court found that it was not the first, that the commerce power was sufficient."
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1739.373,1755.725,"As I understand the National League of Cities, which is a case cited a good deal by both sides, at least in their briefs and relied on considerably by you, as I understand that case, it didn't go to the scope of the commerce power--"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1755.725,1756.069,--That's right.
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1756.069,1757.913,--But rather to an impediment to the exercise of the commerce power.
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1757.913,1758.193,That's right.
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1761.489,1762.129,In this case.
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1762.129,1763.036,--in this case.
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1764.315,1769.095,"I mean, in other words, nobody could quarrel with the scope of the commerce power."
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1780.06,1786.823,"--Well, that's right, and I'm not going to concede that the commerce power can be stretched this far."
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1789.883,1790.383,As the Court of Appeals did find.
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1790.383,1791.18,--As the court has said--
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1791.18,1791.836,The district court.
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1791.836,1798.801,"--it still collides with the idea of federalism, which is the essence of American democracy."
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1869.649,1878.099,"Of course at the time the Constitution was adopted, I suppose there would have been a considerable doubt about the power of a state to regulate or determine that."
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1878.099,1895.294,"That may be true; in the last 80 years, I suppose, it's become a traditional function of state government, recognized time and time again by this Court as recently as last term that the state does have considerable authority in community planning."
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1902.777,1903.228,There were no zoning laws.
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1903.228,1903.885,--There were no zoning laws.
1980.79-1538,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1918.005,1928.016,"Well, are you saying that whatever may have been the rights at that time, they were not granted to the federal government?"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1928.016,1933.372,They were not.
1980.79-1538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.685,1934.45,I think that's a different argument.
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1940.229,1940.854,Right.
1980.79-1538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1940.854,1948.82,"If there weren't this independent doctrine that you could identify for us, there would be ample federal power, you don't concede, under the district court's reasoning--"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1948.82,1949.476,"Well, I don't concede that--"
1980.79-1538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1949.476,1949.976,"--Arguendo, you say?"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1950.538,1958.348,"--Arguendo, and I think that... I understood the Chief Justice to talk about whether or not this power had been given rise to by the states, or exercised by the states themselves."
1980.79-1538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1987.976,2006.578,"Well, wasn't the theory at any rate of people who framed the Constitution the idea that the powers of government resided in the states to innovate as they would or would not and they delegated certain powers to Congress?"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2006.578,2008.64,That was; yes.
1980.79-1538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.64,2017.964,"The Federal Government, although perhaps somewhat fictionally in the last 30 or 40 years, has been referred to as a government of limited powers."
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2017.964,2036.223,"Well, that's one of the happy by-products of the Tenth Amendment and the entire structure that one state, as Justice Brandeis says, is free to experiment and not put the whole nation in peril, that legislation that is novel can be tried in one state."
1980.79-1538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2138.838,2152.49,"Mr. Attorney General, may I just ask, to be sure I understand your contention, supposing Congress expressly found that the failure to restore the slope to the original contour would result in numerous floods of interstate waterways."
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2160.44,2164.0,"--Well, I'd say, first, that the findings of Congress are not conclusive."
1980.79-1538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2164.0,2167.092,"No, but assume that there was adequate support for such a finding."
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2169.951,2188.037,"If there was such a finding, I would believe that the law should be in that case that if the means for effectuating the end of an abating clause is so intrusive of state powers, that the Usery opinion would come into effect and would prohibit the means."
1980.79-1538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2190.458,2191.755,"In other words, this law would still be unconstitutional?"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2191.755,2192.13,That's right.
1980.79-1538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2192.13,2198.392,Because you say that requiring the restoration of the slopes is intrusive of some inherent state power?
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2198.392,2204.999,"It's intrusive, and of course, as the Court knows, the district court found as a matter of law that these slopes did not themselves cause floods."
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2243.467,2245.904,And the enforcement of local criminal law.
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2245.904,2247.342,And taxation.
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2247.342,2250.34,"And yet, how do you reconcile a case like Perez v. the United States?"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2250.34,2254.322,Is it necessary for me to reconcile that too?
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2254.322,2258.837,"Well, I'd succeed... as you know, I dissented in that case, but I was alone."
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2258.837,2269.973,"Well, I think you were on the right track in your... It's clear, Mr. Chief Justice, and the state and its people--"
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2269.973,2272.222,"No, I'm serious in my question."
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2278.782,2292.308,"--Well, I think it does too; and I've been before the Court on previous occasions to urge that much of our criminal law is being usurped by the writ of the habeas corpus, but you've told me about that and I won't raise it again."
1980.79-1538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.246,2333.543,"One other question, Mr. Attorney General."
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2360.579,2370.232,"Well, I think... I can say this about it, that it has no benefit to Virginia, first of all, factually, because the high wall must still be filled back in; there still must be backfilling."
1980.79-1538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.118,2420.946,I must have misunderstood.
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2428.66,2428.942,That's right.
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2452.435,2458.854,I don't understand those terms and I can't visualize that.
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2458.854,2463.821,Contour mining is involved in these counties in the following manner.
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2483.407,2485.329,High wall is a vertical wall?
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2485.329,2485.75,--It's like a cliff.
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2530.825,2535.793,"Well, the requirement of filling up the high wall completely cancels out the variance?"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2535.793,2536.106,That's right.
1980.79-1538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2536.106,2537.65,As a practical matter?
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2537.65,2538.291,That's right.
1980.79-1538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.361,2692.558,"Well, Mr. Attorney General, I take it, I think I did read something in the brief or in the papers somewhere that if the land could be flattened instead of recontoured and restored, it might well be of considerable value."
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2692.558,2693.76,That's correct.
1980.79-1538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.76,2699.617,"Now, I suppose that even if you didn't mine it and flattened it, it would be of considerable value?"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2699.617,2700.054,That's right.
1980.79-1538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.707,2724.514,"Well, I take it the Federal Government, this law wouldn't forbid the next day after you've restored all these contours and all these high... and covered all the high walls, if for some other reason you decided to flatten the land?"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2724.514,2730.138,"Not tomorrow, because the regulations that have been promulgated say that the bond has to remain in effect for five years."
1980.79-1538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2730.138,2731.12,Five years.
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2731.12,2734.65,So you sit there and wait for five years and then you can come back and remove the overburden all over--
1980.79-1538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2734.65,2736.181,What happens if you didn't mine it in the first place?
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2737.367,2738.57,--Exactly.
1980.79-1538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2738.57,2740.648,--take the whole mountain away and since... and have it--
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2740.648,2741.96,Dump it down the hill.
1980.79-1538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2741.96,2745.77,--And develop your land that way?
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2748.301,2749.534,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.249,2770.261,"Well, what... the only taking there can possibly be, then, I suppose, is in the sense that it forbids you from taking the coal?"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2776.477,2782.568,It would be very expensive to do that if you weren't going to get paid for getting the coal out first.
1980.79-1538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2782.568,2787.753,"Oh, I know, but if you believe your allegation that if you flatten the land it's of great value?"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2787.753,2788.503,That's right.
1980.79-1538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2788.503,2792.752,Which you do say so.
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2792.752,2793.469,That's right.
1980.79-1538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.469,2797.531,I suppose you wouldn't need to mine it to have it be of value if you flattened it?
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2797.531,2804.06,But I think that the Court recognizes still that one of the important factors in taking is the diminution of value.
1980.79-1538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2811.744,2818.569,"Well, I take it that you would say that either under the Tenth Amendment or under the Fifth or both, the Federal Government could not forbid--"
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2818.569,2819.616,--That's right.
1980.79-1538,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.616,2821.865,"--The strip mining of this land, just flat."
1980.79-1538,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2824.755,2831.269,I would guess that it could.
1980.79-1538,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2838.405,2843.591,You have four minutes remaining.
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2847.714,2853.946,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to say just a couple of things in connection with this Tenth Amendment Commerce Clause argument."
1980.79-1538,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2868.503,2872.595,What about the prime farmland regulation?
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2872.595,2891.931,"Well, that is in the next case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I will say that, again, there is nothing in the prime farmland regulations that attempts to tell a local community how to use its land or what areas are to be used for residential purposes or commercial purpose or anything."
1980.79-1538,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2905.598,2921.046,"Yes, but it does say that if a state wants to permit, or private owners want to strip mine and then use it for something besides farmland, the Federal Government says you may not do that, at least without first making it back into farmland."
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2921.046,2922.171,"That's correct, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-1538,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2926.559,2932.462,"And is it, as the Attorney General suggested, is there a five year hiatus?"
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2932.462,2948.862,"Well, the bond, the full amount of the bond, and if I understand Section 519 of the Act, is not released until after five years, but 60 percent of the bond is released in a much shorter time, as soon as the approximate original contour is restored."
1980.79-1538,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2958.047,2958.858,What's the consequence?
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2958.858,2969.479,"--Oh, well, the consequence is that there's only a small amount of the bond is retained for that full five-year period, and if the mine operator or the owner of the land believes that the financial--"
1980.79-1538,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2969.479,2972.712,What may the owner do within the five years?
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2972.712,2986.503,"--Oh, within the five years the owner may put the land back into a flattened state if necessary, if he wishes to do so, if the financial rewards are as great as they are supposed to be on the basis of--"
1980.79-1538,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2986.503,2987.972,"Well, he puts it into a flattened state."
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2990.033,2990.252,--Yes.
1980.79-1538,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2990.83,2992.408,By sacrificing his bond.
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2992.408,2996.125,"Perhaps, Mr. Justice White, by sacrificing part of the bond."
1980.79-1538,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3029.549,3030.643,What's benchland?
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3030.643,3034.796,"--Oh, benchland is the horizontal portion."
1980.79-1538,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3034.796,3036.296,So why not just call it flat land?
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3036.296,3044.809,"The word bench is designed to indicate that it's up above, it's on the mountainside."
1980.79-1538,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3044.809,3045.356,It's a plateau?
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3045.356,3052.305,"Well, it's the horizontal portion of the cut into the side of the mountain."
1980.79-1538,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3059.788,3061.006,I get you.
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3067.58,3078.669,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, I think that if you look at the pictures, for example, here in the committee reports, you will see that it has been done."
1980.79-1538,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3085.808,3091.274,"This argument, would you just respond to this for me, because I'm still a little puzzled."
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3099.521,3108.688,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I think that that may well be his argument, but I think that Congress has found that that is not so, and I think that many of these benches are wide enough--"
1980.79-1538,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3108.688,3110.5,But didn't the district court findings support what he says?
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3110.5,3117.873,--The district court also said that compliance with the approximate original contour requirement was physically impossible.
1980.79-1538,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3124.698,3128.743,"It's been done in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and presumably the mountains there are just as steep as they are?"
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3128.743,3135.132,"--Well, the State of West Virginia has had no problem in complying with this statute."
1980.79-1538,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3143.423,3148.61,"Well, where... are the rocks in Pennsylvania different from the rocks in Virginia?"
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3148.61,3148.859,--I don't think they are.
1980.79-1538,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3148.859,3151.609,I don't think we're going to be able to solve this problem.
1980.79-1538,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3157.873,3163.401,"I would say not, Mr. Justice Stevens, but it is in the statute, and so we're telling you about it."
1980.79-1538,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3168.305,3169.616,"Thank you, gentlemen."
