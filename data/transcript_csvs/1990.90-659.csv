1990.90-659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.327,"We'll hear argument now in Number 90-659, Keith R. Gollust v. Ira L. Mendell."
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,10.709,14.871,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,93.503,96.477,But you really don't think that matters anyway?
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,103.763,106.193,"Justice Scalia, that is correct."
1990.90-659,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.959,178.457,"Well, Mr. Mishkin, in this case wasn't the plaintiff an owner at the time the suit was initiated?"
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,178.457,180.6,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-659,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.6,185.933,So all we have to resolve is whether it's now moot or he has lost standing?
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,187.404,198.922,"What the Court is... must resolve is whether a former shareholder, having commenced an action, loses standing when he ceases to be an owner of the securities of the issuer."
1990.90-659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,231.724,232.002,Mr. Mishkin--
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,251.268,251.899,That's correct.
1990.90-659,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.171,292.246,"Well, wouldn't ordinary principles of mootness come into play there?"
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,299.022,308.289,"I think, Your Honor, the question of mootness might come into play in appropriate cases, but what we're dealing with is a question of statutory construction."
1990.90-659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,377.287,378.619,"No, but Mr. Mishkin, the question... you're right."
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,390.808,392.841,"--Well, Your Honor, I think as I was--"
1990.90-659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,392.841,396.501,"You're worried about a lot of other cases, not this one."
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,396.501,400.804,"--No, what I think I'm saying is that if a shareholder turns around and sells his--"
1990.90-659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,400.804,402.498,But he didn't do that.
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,402.498,403.215,--He didn't do that.
1990.90-659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,404.437,409.139,What in the statute defeats his right to continue an action that was properly instituted?
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,409.139,430.924,"--I think it's inherently in the concept of a section 16(b) and a derivative action, because the courts have said in both contexts, in section 16(b) and in shareholder derivative actions generally, of which this is a variation, that a shareholder must be a shareholder of the issuer corporation, and not a shareholder of some parent or indirect subsidiary."
1990.90-659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,430.924,432.296,"Well, that's what's in the 16(b) context."
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,436.63,437.341,That's correct.
1990.90-659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,437.341,439.274,And the statutory language doesn't say that.
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,439.274,441.524,The Seventh Circuit has said that.
1990.90-659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,445.277,445.626,And the statute doesn't say that.
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,445.626,449.169,"Your Honor, the statute uses the term ""issuer""."
1990.90-659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,449.169,451.88,Referring to the point of instituting the suit.
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,451.88,465.912,"Well, if the... I don't think what the Congress intended to do was to state that a shareholder need... his standing may be tested or need be tested only at the instant the suit is filed."
1990.90-659,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,472.997,487.779,"Well, Mr. Mishkin, in diversity cases do we look at diversity of the parties as of the initiation of the lawsuit, and if it disappears later do we say there is no standing?"
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,487.779,489.368,"No, Justice O'Connor, you look at it--"
1990.90-659,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,489.368,492.27,Or the amount in controversy cases?
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,492.27,500.057,"--No, those are questions that go to when a court's jurisdiction hatches to a lawsuit and it doesn't reinvestigate its jurisdiction as a case proceeds."
1990.90-659,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,514.616,523.842,"Well, it's entirely, it's entirely possible that a case filed under this 16(b) section could later become moot, I suppose."
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,530.708,535.079,"--Well, I think this case is mooted out insofar as the statutory words are concerned."
1990.90-659,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,660.553,664.386,I wish you had given us some examples of other Federal statutes.
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,677.166,701.842,"--Well, I think that the Commission actually identified a statute which, somehow, inexplicably to me, they cited it in their favor which indicated the statute provided that a lawsuit could be instituted against a certain... Secretary of a Government agency, and went on to provide that even if that, the identity of that Secretary changed, the action could be maintained."
1990.90-659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,735.295,745.072,Is the plaintiff's only motive in a case like this to increase the... increase indirectly and incrementally the value of his own shares?
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,745.072,752.698,That was the intention that the Congress had in mind by vesting a plaintiff with standing to bring an action.
1990.90-659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,788.014,789.224,But what's the incentive?
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,795.07,806.067,"The way I think the statute has operated or worked out over the years in practice, most shareholders indeed have the interest of their lawyers."
1990.90-659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,829.044,833.438,But how does the lawyer benefit if the statute doesn't provide for attorneys' fees?
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,833.438,838.614,"Well, the courts regularly award lawyers... plaintiffs' lawyers attorneys' fees in these circumstances."
1990.90-659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,838.614,839.853,Under the common fund theory?
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,839.853,840.934,Yes.
1990.90-659,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.565,1102.562,"But Mr. Mishkin, isn't it true that all those cases... I'm not sure the words narrow and broad are correct... all those cases gave a very technical, literal reading to the statute."
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,1107.066,1116.813,"--Well, I think if you read this statute literally you also... I mean, look, every statute drawn by Congress requires some degree of interpretation."
1990.90-659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.207,1326.571,"Well, how long would you say he had to keep the shares, as you read the word instituted in the statute?"
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,1326.571,1327.782,"Throughout the litigation, Your Honor."
1990.90-659,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1494.408,1511.761,"Well, my question was really whether you thought that under ordinary principles of mootness it could be said that someone who ends up at the end of the day with stock in the parent can be said to have no financial interest."
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,1511.761,1518.634,"I think that that is arguable, Justice O'Connor, but I am not urging that as the rule for this case."
1990.90-659,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1604.034,1612.172,Would you be making the same argument if the corporation had been merged into the other?
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,1612.172,1642.459,"If Viacom International had not been... I'm sorry, if the securities of Viacom International were used in exchange so that the plaintiff in this case received securities in Viacom International, it was the succeeding corporation if you will rather than the subsidiary, I would not be making this argument because the statute would not permit me to make this argument, because the shares would then be owned by a shareholder of the issuer, Viacom International."
1990.90-659,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.202,1691.588,"But you say if Viacom had been merged into the acquirer, you say you wouldn't be making this argument?"
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,1691.588,1701.987,"--What I'm saying, Your Honor, is if Viacom were the corporation resulting from the merger, Viacom International, the issuer for whom Mr. Mendell's client is suing."
1990.90-659,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.987,1702.157,No.
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,1704.267,1704.578,Right.
1990.90-659,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.578,1708.892,And the succeeding corporation is no longer Viacom International.
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,1708.892,1713.825,And Viacom International has disappeared in that merger into--
1990.90-659,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.825,1713.985,Yes.
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,1714.466,1717.669,"--No, Your Honor, I would not be making the argument because the successor--"
1990.90-659,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1717.669,1727.596,"Well, the issuer is no longer in existence, and the stockholder can't possibly be holding stock in Viacom."
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,1729.007,1731.999,--The question then becomes who is the issuer.
1990.90-659,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.999,1732.761,Exactly.
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,1734.801,1747.5,"And I think the courts have stated that where the issuer has disappeared in the merger into another company, the company that survives that merger has become the issuer, has succeeded to the rights of the issuer."
1990.90-659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1762.043,1764.577,"I think you have adequately answered the question, Mr. Mishkin."
1990.90-659,0,22764,edwin_b_mishkin,,1764.577,1765.236,Thank you.
1990.90-659,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1765.236,1766.618,Thank you.
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,1768.858,1777.633,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-659,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.746,1820.272,Even though the stockholders of the XYZ Company are holding stock in a company that was never the issuer?
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,1820.272,1823.975,"--That is correct, Your Honor, and there are two... there are decisions to that effect."
1990.90-659,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.637,1827.128,"Well, they may not be right."
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,1827.128,1833.612,"--No, we were in the court of last resort, but I'm trying to answer your question."
1990.90-659,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.057,1866.855,And your colleague on the other side seems to agree that he wouldn't be making an argument... his argument up here if that were the situation.
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,1866.855,1868.214,"That's the way I heard it, Your Honor."
1990.90-659,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.214,1868.745,Um hum.
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,1868.745,1886.297,"Now, the next thing I would like to say out of order or out of sequence is that my opponent mentioned at least five or more times congressional intent."
1990.90-659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1939.794,1948.341,"Yes, but it doesn't say any owner of any security of a parent of the issuer, which could have been a little broader."
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,1948.341,1952.263,"--If they thought of it they may have said it, Your Honor."
1990.90-659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1952.263,1952.834,They might have thought it.
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,1954.377,1954.817,I beg your pardon?
1990.90-659,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1954.817,1957.308,Well... never mind.
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,1957.308,1977.163,"So, as I said, it's palpable that the intent of Congress was to cast standing in as broad a compass as possible, and I gave the example that Congress didn't confine standing to stock owners."
1990.90-659,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.266,2145.295,"Well, if a financial interest in the parent company is all you need, I don't suppose... I suppose you would be making the same argument if he didn't bring... begin his suit until after the merger?"
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,2145.295,2154.25,"--No, I wouldn't, Your Honor, but financial interest in the parent... financial interest is just one-half of the situation."
1990.90-659,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.124,2168.431,"Of course, some of the arguments in brief would permit any holder of stock in the parent company to sue."
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,2168.431,2171.544,"--I certainly don't, didn't intend to imply that, Your Honor."
1990.90-659,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.544,2174.866,A double derivative suit?
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,2174.866,2176.808,"Well, if I may, I'm going to come to that."
1990.90-659,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.808,2177.249,That's all right.
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,2177.249,2178.039,All right.
1990.90-659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.917,2443.278,Why does the statute mention the single derivative action explicitly?
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,2462.722,2462.993,Well--
1990.90-659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.993,2469.828,"Congress felt it necessary not to stop by just saying suit may be instituted by the issuer, which it could have said."
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,2491.915,2499.82,"--Mr. Justice Scalia, when one writes a statute one can't think of every possible situation--"
1990.90-659,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.82,2500.912,That's my point.
1990.90-659,1,28633,irving_malchman,,2511.512,2511.813,--But they said both.
1990.90-659,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2527.113,2529.584,"Thank you, Mr. Malchman."
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2532.516,2545.175,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-659,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.222,2602.245,"Mr. Doty, do you speak just for the SEC here or do you speak for the Government more generally?"
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2615.023,2626.222,"Justice Scalia, I believe that in the context of this statute my statement as to the breadth of the grant of standing in this statutory context is one which the Government shares."
1990.90-659,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2658.292,2661.616,I'm not talking about the sufficiency of... I'm not talking about the article III point.
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2664.09,2664.628,Yes.
1990.90-659,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2664.628,2691.837,"For example, is the Government willing to accept that under the judicial review provision of the Federal Labor Management Relations Act, when it says any person aggrieved by any final order of the authority may institute an action for judicial review, that that person, even if the person later does not meet the aggrieved by any final order requirement which is somewhat above the article III minimum, that person may continue to maintain the suit nonetheless?"
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2691.837,2696.85,"Justice Scalia, the Commission would not want to speak for the Government in these other contexts."
1990.90-659,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2700.253,2701.665,But plain language is plain language.
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2701.665,2712.992,"Plain language being plain language here, we rest strongly on the notion, or on the clear language of the statute that one who institutes the suit need only be a security holder."
1990.90-659,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2720.567,2722.429,I expect that's a very common statute.
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2746.526,2749.208,"--Well, Your Honor, let me say this."
1990.90-659,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2785.855,2804.449,"But you do agree, Mr. Doty, I guess, with Mr. Mishkin... I mean with his statement of your position that it would be enough if the plaintiff had bought a share of stock the day before he filed his lawsuit and sold it the day afterwards, so far as what Congress demands in the way of standing?"
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2804.449,2810.723,"We believe that as statutory standing for the purposes of 16(b), Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct."
1990.90-659,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2835.47,2840.752,And Congress was indifferent to what the plaintiff did with the security after he instituted the suit?
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2840.752,2853.723,"--I think certainly Congress recognized that the policing power, the enforcement policy of the statute overcame what Mr. Mishkin has attempted to characterize as a common sense concern here."
1990.90-659,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2880.32,2888.477,"Well, would you at least concede that in the situation the Chief Justice inquired about that the cases become moot?"
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2888.477,2895.921,"Justice O'Connor, we can easily see that cases may come before the Federal courts in which--"
1990.90-659,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2895.921,2904.987,"Well, I'm talking about the case where the plaintiff buys a share of stock on day 1, files suit on day 2, sells it on day 3."
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2904.987,2910.149,--We think that serious questions of an interest in the outcome and mootness would be--
1990.90-659,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2910.149,2911.561,Just serious questions?
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2911.561,2911.932,--would be addressed there.
1990.90-659,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2924.711,2927.513,"Well, I just wondered what the position of the SEC was."
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2928.905,2936.589,"--Justice O'Connor, we do not have a position in the abstract on whether that case would necessarily be moot."
1990.90-659,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2936.589,2940.382,What's your position as General Counsel of the SEC on that question.
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2940.382,2950.358,"Your Honor, my own view of the statutory standing here is that the statutory standing in that case is clear that issues would be--"
1990.90-659,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2950.358,2955.702,"Has it become moot or not become moot when the stock is sold, in your view?"
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2955.702,2958.093,--It is possible that it is not moot.
1990.90-659,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2965.549,2972.813,We would have to presumably go through a brainstorming session on article III standing.
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,2999.042,3020.146,"But, Justice Scalia, Congress has in fact made clear that it in fact intends to deal with the potential, the possibility for abuse in the misuse of inside information, and that to do that it has sought to confer standing on security holders to bring the lawsuits."
1990.90-659,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3229.362,3245.771,"Mr. Doty, I suppose wisdom is to be welcomed whenever it comes, but this plain language point did not occur to the Commission when it issued its proposed rules on this area, right, and did not even occur to the Commission when litigating this case below."
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,3252.265,3264.093,"Well, with all respect, Justice Scalia, we believe our brief to the Second Circuit in fact makes the plain language argument, and we believe also that the Second Circuit opinion reaches the right result and contains the right reasons--"
1990.90-659,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.093,3265.095,Did it make this plain language argument?
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,3279.317,3287.341,"--It is true... I believe it is fair, Your Honor, that we have refined our argument in this Court, and we believe that is something which the appellate process permits--"
1990.90-659,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3287.341,3288.342,I'll accept that.
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,3290.242,3298.109,"--With respect to our rules, however, I would only note that our rules were not an attempt to exhaust the area of standing."
1990.90-659,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3310.668,3328.248,"Mr. Doty, can I ask you how your plain language argument would work if the plaintiff was a shareholder when he gave notice to the... he made a demand, and then before the 60-day period when the directors have a chance to respond to the demand the merger took place, and then he filed suit after the merger took place and was no longer a shareholder."
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,3328.979,3336.595,"--Our footnote 11 in our brief, Justice Stevens, recognizes the problems with that factual hypothetical."
1990.90-659,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3347.524,3351.936,My question was what does your plain language argument do with that hypothetical?
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,3356.059,3364.495,"--That is... that, we believe, is a case in which the security holder had, as I understand your hypothetical, he had standing."
1990.90-659,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3367.487,3367.727,Not at the time he instituted--
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,3367.727,3368.959,--but the merger intervened.
1990.90-659,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3368.959,3372.078,--The merger intervened between the demand and the filing of the suit.
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,3372.078,3382.366,"Candidly, Your Honor, we believe that that is an area where the Commission's rulemaking authority could provide clarification and certainty, and it would be entitled to deference by this Court."
1990.90-659,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3382.366,3383.167,But you don't know what your point--
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,3383.167,3389.231,That was in fact the area of concern addressed by the rule of proposals.
1990.90-659,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3391.004,3395.616,--Are you sure the Commission can issue rules as to when suits are bringable in court?
1990.90-659,2,30008,james_r_doty,,3399.068,3404.371,"--Your Honor, this Court has... to this General Counsel's knowledge this Court has not considered that issue."
1990.90-659,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3409.316,3411.148,"Thank you, Mr. Doty."
