1975.75-552,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,62.856,"We will hear arguments next in 75-552, Secretary of Interior against Sierra Club and the consolidated case."
1975.75-552,0,38517,randolph,,66.097,70.049,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,1908.034,1910.721,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.75-552,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2038.002,2044.239,"Mr. Attorney General, the neighboring State of Utah has not joined you in your briefs has it?"
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2044.239,2044.646,No sir.
1975.75-552,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2044.646,2046.87,"As matter of fact, it is one of the brief from the other  probably from the other side?"
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2046.87,2047.671,"Yes sir, it has."
1975.75-552,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2047.671,2052.487,Is that because their experience is somewhat different than yours?
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2052.487,2070.281,"I believe that one of the reasons and I really cannot, I really perhaps can't answer that but I think that they have a facility which it sensed gone by the boards your honor that may have played a part in their decision not to join in the brief, that is really the only reason that I can give you for that."
1975.75-552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.478,2108.003,What will you do with the language of the statute?
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2113.497,2115.25,We do not know your Honor.
1975.75-552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.131,2120.238,"Well, I know but if they say there is not?"
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2120.238,2122.051,"We believe, we believe very strongly--"
1975.75-552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.051,2137.256,"No, the only time you submit an impact statement is when the Federal Government makes a report on a proposal and there has not been a report on a proposal on a regional basis?"
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2137.256,2139.728,"Your Honor, we would differ with that."
1975.75-552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.728,2140.716,Where is it?
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2145.288,2160.251,What we are saying in this case your Honor is that in the Department of Interior they do in fact have plans for an area larger in scope to the project by project basis or even larger than Easter Powder River Basin.
1975.75-552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.91,2181.338,How would you suggest the case go forward?
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2188.299,2194.913,I think that the first thing that has to be done is a result of the decision in this Court.
1975.75-552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2217.281,2229.014,"Well, do you not think before under the statute would you not have to find that there was a proposal somewhere for a regional plan?"
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2229.014,2230.238,"Yes sir, I certainly do."
1975.75-552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.715,2241.299,"Well I know, but until you find that, is it not the requirement for an impact state limited to the project that has been proposed?"
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2241.299,2246.186,"Not, if there is a plan."
1975.75-552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.89,2273.57,Would it be sufficient if all I have in mind or if the only proposal that ever has been made is for a project?
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2273.57,2286.592,"If, if the only proposal that they have made but we say that the facts and the pronouncements from the Department clearly demonstrate that their plan goes much further than that."
1975.75-552,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2291.24,2314.453,"As far as statute is concerned at least a few, just limit consideration to the words on their face, before they trigger an impact statement there has to be a recommendation or report on something, and it goes on the say -- there are enough proposals for legislation in other major Federal actions."
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2329.635,2337.045,"Well, I have got to confess your Honor that I have got to rely on Mr. Terris for that portion of the argument."
1975.75-552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.045,2347.968,"What is finding of the District Court quite to the contrary, that there was no -- that the only proposal there was, was a project proposal?"
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2347.968,2349.225,"Yes, that was right."
1975.75-552,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2349.225,2353.677,"Or did the Court of Appeals set that aside, find it was erroneous?"
1975.75-552,1,43644,v_frank_mendocino,,2353.677,2369.575,"In the way that I read, contrary again to my brother's interpretation, the way that I read that is that Court of Appeals sent that back to determine whether or not there was a program that was larger in scope in than the project, specific project."
1975.75-552,2,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2733.636,2739.231,We rely expressly on the proposal language and let me be very clear about that.
1975.75-552,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2739.231,2740.195,Legislation for major federal action?
1975.75-552,2,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2740.195,2742.891,"No, no, for major Federal action."
1975.75-552,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2800.97,2808.521,"Well, the keyword Mr. Terris, at least literally and I go back to Justice Brennan's question here, to your associates."
1975.75-552,2,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2812.981,2813.294,Exactly.
1975.75-552,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2813.294,2815.428,That must be accompanied by an impact statements.
1975.75-552,2,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2815.428,2816.39,Exactly your Honor.
1975.75-552,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2835.501,2837.365,(Inaudible)
1975.75-552,2,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2837.365,2844.337,They are among I hesitate trying to tell you which of those numbers in the Eastern Powder River Basin they are but they are among those numbers.
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,4746.402,4757.077,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.75-552,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4866.905,4883.829,"Is it possible Mr. Shea, that even having completed which they have not done apparently, even having completed the study of the whole area and concluded that the development of the coal resources was in the public interest."
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,4900.24,4925.985,"Well, of course if the Court please, there has been no change of position on the part of the Interior, initial affidavit which was put in by Secretary Morgan set out that we completed this coal programmatic and we have the information from the Northern Great Plains Resources Program."
1975.75-552,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5524.923,5539.58,"Mr. Shea, before you leave that point that Judge McKinnon in his dissent made the point that the commitment of the granting of approval in one area does not necessarily involved in commitment to grant approval in other areas."
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5574.53,5590.531,"Well, I am not sure that I really fully understand your question, the findings of the District Court is that there is no planned program or other major Federal action, indeed."
1975.75-552,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5590.531,5591.865,(Inaudible)
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5591.865,5596.229,"Yes, and this was conceded by opposing counsel."
1975.75-552,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5596.229,5597.496,We agree with that then we do not have --
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5597.496,5602.838,I do not see what is left and I do not see how that is gotten around.
1975.75-552,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5602.838,5618.888,"Well, it maybe that if one project necessarily determines the shape or form or outcome of another that having a plan for this project necessarily means you have a plan for the other one."
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5618.888,5621.377,"If they are integrated, certain."
1975.75-552,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5621.377,5622.859,What is exactly the question?
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5622.859,5627.231,Is that the question?
1975.75-552,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5627.231,5633.254,Do we have to decide whether or not they are integrated?
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5633.254,5637.135,"Well, I think that, you know this in the first place --"
1975.75-552,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5637.135,5640.507,"Certainly no, but Judge McKinnon apparently thought that he had to decide if you want you can do it."
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5640.507,5668.929,"In the first place you know, there is a finding that so far as these proposals of the private companies are concerned that they are not being constructed or carried out pursuant to any integrated plan, and also that the plans that these projects of the individual companies are not integrated or interrelated."
1975.75-552,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5752.746,5754.186,Necessarily (Inaudible)
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5754.186,5754.588,Right.
1975.75-552,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5754.588,5756.734,It is possible but not necessarily so?
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5756.734,5763.071,"Well, really not on 90,000 square miles is not even possible."
1975.75-552,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5763.071,5765.817,"Well, it is possible that some of them near to each other?"
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5765.817,5770.099,"Oh, but that is a very different manner, that is a very different manner."
1975.75-552,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5791.25,5804.77,"On the other hand (Inaudible) a series of projects were wholly unrelated, if the Interior Department actually had a plan for the development or proposal of the whole area, there would have to have an area impact statement?"
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5804.77,5810.316,That raises I think somewhat difficult questions.
1975.75-552,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5814.86,5815.797,It is a proposal.
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5815.797,5827.795,"If they have such a plan with that to remember, it is not just there must be a proposal from major Federal action but it must significantly effect the environment."
1975.75-552,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5839.524,5843.409,But at least there would be something that was not there before if you got a proposal?
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5843.409,5844.419,Yes.
1975.75-552,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5844.419,5845.186,Before in your area—
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5845.186,5848.642,"But we do not have this, obviously."
1975.75-552,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5852.243,5854.551,The Court of Appeals is against on you on that.
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5854.551,5855.521,On what?
1975.75-552,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5855.521,5868.659,"On they say over, they say that they apparently they think the possibility is that the Interior Department has gone far enough along the line and towards a proposal to trigger the need for an instance."
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5868.659,5887.598,"Well, what they say is all the actions have taken place in the past and all of the pending applications which may or may not be approved that, this in our view accept the Court constitutes major Federal action and thus it goes on to say."
1975.75-552,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5891.014,5901.074,"For the purposes of the statute, a proposal whether you call it a program, a plan or I think the language was or nothing at all."
1975.75-552,3,24581,francis_m_shea,,5901.074,5902.234,"Yes, that is right."
1975.75-552,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5930.315,5931.147,Thank you gentleman.
