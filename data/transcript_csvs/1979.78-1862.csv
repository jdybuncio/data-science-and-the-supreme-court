1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,54.201,We will hear arguments this afternoon in Fred N. Walker against ARMCO Steel Corporation.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,56.895,62.163,Mr. Chief Justice and Members of This Honorable Court.
1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,103.309,105.111,In your filing cabinet?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,105.111,105.693,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,153.854,157.911,"The Ragan Case was decided somewhat before your lawsuit, wasn't it?"
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,157.911,160.936,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,168.302,173.233,There are only nine of us up here too.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,173.233,192.904,"Anyway, Judge Doyle of the Tenth Circuit, when he wrote his opinion, the last paragraph states, ""The Supreme Court would perform a great service if it were to clear away the dilemma which exists as a result of the conflict between Ragan and Hanna."""
1979.78-1862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,218.954,221.289,"You come not to praise Ragan, but to bury it, I take it?"
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,221.289,224.362,"I come to bury Ragan, if possible."
1979.78-1862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,236.123,238.103,And carefully saved Ragan.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,238.103,239.903,And carefully saved Ragan.
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,239.903,240.767,Well thought out.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,240.767,243.417,Well thought out; carefully saved Ragan.
1979.78-1862,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,319.172,322.07,I don't see why you put all that weight on distance.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,328.888,334.232,We've got more brush down there in our country for them to hide in.
1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,355.145,362.113,"You wouldn't be arguing this to any Oklahoma Court, would you, that you didn't like the law the legislature had enacted?"
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,362.113,367.181,"No, sir, because Oklahoma Courts are not covered by Rule 3."
1979.78-1862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,367.181,368.304,This is a Federal question.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,368.304,370.091,"A Federal question, right."
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.091,373.316,What is the principle you want us to adopt?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,373.316,377.905,I want you to adopt the principles elucidated in Hanna.
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.905,379.323,And what are those?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,379.323,386.897,"Those are for uniformity, the Federal Rules should govern service."
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,404.591,411.375,What if the Federal Rules had no provision which was a counterpart to Oklahoma's provision here?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,411.375,412.083,What would I do?
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,416.584,421.414,You say that there must be an affirmative Federal Rule of Civil Procedure covering this point?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,421.414,426.124,"Without Federal Rule 3 and Federal Rule 4, I have no standing."
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,426.124,432.28,"You don't urge us to go back to Swift against Tyson, or the days of the Federal common law?"
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,432.28,433.66,"No, sir."
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,479.317,481.978,"Does Federal Rule 3 say ""told""?"
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,481.978,489.508,"Let me get it exactly, Your Honor."
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,513.666,526.417,What is there in the Rule though that says that the beginning of an action is just the filing of the complaint satisfies the State's statute of limitations?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,529.431,533.895,"It says, ""A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the Court."""
1979.78-1862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,533.895,553.838,"I know a civil action is commenced, but what makes -- why is that -- would that necessarily -- what if a State law said just specifically that, and by the way, we mean what we say, just the starting of an action does not satisfy our statute of limitations."
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,553.838,555.187,Your Honor --
1979.78-1862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.187,559.783,It has to be some other event that happened before the statute of limitations is satisfied.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,559.783,580.064,"Oklahoma State law does provide that an action is commenced by the filing of the petition, but it has an additional statute, two sections down, that says if you can't get service with due diligence within 60 days that you're just through."
1979.78-1862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,580.064,586.843,What is there in Rule 3 to prevent the State from having such a provision?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,589.79,591.063,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,609.225,611.127,I understand.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,612.718,615.172,"No, but a lot of people thought it was."
1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,620.088,621.173,"Yes, I know."
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,621.173,624.219,And Judge Doyle says he prefers the Federal Rules.
1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,628.839,632.244,You don't have uniformity under substantive law in diversity cases.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,632.244,634.755,"I don't believe that it's substantive, Your Honor."
1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,634.755,636.493,I say you don't under the substantive law.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,636.493,637.575,"No, Sir."
1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,637.575,643.514,"What you want is the traditional, the Erie rule under substantive law but the Federal law on the procedural."
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,643.514,644.244,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,644.244,659.863,"What's the virtue of uniformity, as you put it, on the procedural side when basically you are dealing with practitioners in Oklahoma City or Tulsa who practice in both the Federal and State Courts?"
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,659.863,676.359,"Well, it would make it a lot easier on the Circuit Courts, for one thing, because they would not have the higgledy-piggledly mess of each State having a different set of semi or quasi substantive or procedural law."
1979.78-1862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,687.526,704.231,What if the statute of limitations in Oklahoma said that the statute of limitations will run until a complaint is served?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,713.681,716.556,"Well, Rule 4 did in the Hanna Case."
1979.78-1862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,716.556,717.457,Why?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,720.832,723.892,"Your Honor, they served the executor by leaving it with his wife."
1979.78-1862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,752.395,767.17,"But Hanna didn't say -- Hanna certainly didn't say that if the State law required service to toll the statute, that just the filing of the complaint will toll the statute too."
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,774.354,783.089,"No, sir, I am saying if you extend the Hanna rule to cover Rule 3, like the Second Circuit thinks it should be--"
1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,783.089,788.917,"Does the Second Circuit think it should be, or do they think that's what Hanna did?"
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,788.917,794.532,They think that Hanna overruled Ragan.
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,794.532,803.862,What's the virtue of uniformity on the procedural side if you're not going to have it on the substantive side?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,803.862,812.95,"Well, I guess the virtue would be that under the Federal Rules and under the Federal system to make them the same."
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,816.867,834.225,"Well, that was the same justification that Justice Storey advanced for Swift against Tyson IN 1842, that the law does not lay down one rule in Athens and another rule in Rome; that the law should be uniform throughout the Federal Court System substantively."
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,835.615,836.224,"No, sir."
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,836.224,837.925,Why not?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,837.925,842.732,That's the way life is.
1979.78-1862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.732,848.737,"That's your answer to Brother Rehnquist's question whether or not you agree or don't agree, that is the law."
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,848.737,848.907,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,848.907,858.712,"That under Erie Railroad against Tompkins, Federal Courts and diversity actions are required to apply State substantive law."
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,873.249,873.696,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,873.696,879.155,"Whether that's good or bad or philosophically supportable or not, you don't need to say."
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,880.645,889.286,"Sir, I do feel very strongly that service of summons and the Rules about commencing an action are procedural."
1979.78-1862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,889.286,908.109,"Well, let's assume that Rule 3 does cover when an action is commenced for Federal purposes, and that there is nothing that the State can say that will change that, that if you file the complaint, the action is commenced, the State doesn't argue with you about that."
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,928.277,938.456,"No, sir, it says commenced upon filing a complaint, but you must obtain service within 60 days."
1979.78-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.456,941.461,What was the statute of limitations in this case?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,954.638,955.604,That's correct.
1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,960.054,963.745,Let's go back a step.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,973.351,976.676,Stop forum shopping.
1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,976.676,996.218,"Now, how does uniformity advance the idea of getting a neutral forum, one where citizens of another State were at least thought to have a better chance to get fair treatment in a Federal Court than a local court?"
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,1003.755,1020.3,"It would advance, each person would know from whence they hailed that the same rules applied insofar as procedure in their courthouse in Milwaukee would apply so far as procedures are concerned in the courthouse in Oklahoma City."
1979.78-1862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1020.3,1021.713,"Isn't it more than that, Mr. Manners?"
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,1036.102,1036.958,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1036.958,1039.316,And man cases are a mixture of both.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,1039.316,1039.931,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1039.931,1041.616,Isn't there another question here?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,1048.272,1048.488,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1048.488,1050.497,Delivering the summons to the marshal.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,1054.557,1067.806,"You go up to the Clerk's office and you file it, and there is a big basket there, and they pitch it in the big basket, and if you don't want it three or four days getting to the Sheriff, you say, ""Let me have that"" and you take it back and give it to the deputy."
1979.78-1862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1067.806,1070.449,Are you talking about the Federal Court or the State Court?
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,1070.449,1071.061,State.
1979.78-1862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.061,1080.065,"In the State Court, in other words, there is a responsibility of the plaintiff and his counsel to cause the marshal to be delivered -- to cause the summons to be delivered to the marshal?"
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,1080.065,1080.436,"No, sir."
1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1089.582,1090.615,I see.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,1095.319,1097.269,I thought we got it into the basket.
1979.78-1862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1097.269,1098.685,But you weren't in State Court.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,1098.685,1100.49,"No, sir, I was in Federal Court."
1979.78-1862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1100.49,1104.089,"In the Federal Court, it is not your to put it in the basket as I read the Rules."
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,1104.089,1107.351,Rule 4 says it's not.
1979.78-1862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1134.996,1139.19,Somebody thought he was in the State Courts.
1979.78-1862,0,21177,don_manners,,1139.19,1142.08,"Gentlemen, I think I have used a lot of my time."
1979.78-1862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1173.769,1174.432,Very well.
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1181.717,1184.881,"MR. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1355.936,1370.675,"How can we -- How is a Federal matter, when you say that for State law purposes, the statute of limitations is tolled?"
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1370.675,1371.576,I don't think you can.
1979.78-1862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1385.778,1389.765,And that the State is incompetent to require another step.
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1389.765,1391.96,That's correct.
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1503.401,1505.612,He had probably better get another lawyer if he does that.
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1505.612,1508.099,"Well, I would think so."
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.099,1511.758,"He is just waiving a perfectly good defense, but that is hardly a legal argument."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1511.758,1523.53,I think it is because isn't the object of Erie and Tompkins to avoid forum shopping and to avoid inequitable --
1979.78-1862,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1523.53,1525.358,There wouldn't be any need for forum shopping there.
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1530.663,1531.467,"I agree, Your Honor."
1979.78-1862,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1531.467,1537.321,"And we have to presume people are going to act in their best interest, I would assume."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1537.321,1538.454,Yes.
1979.78-1862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1538.454,1571.442,"So far as you know, Counsel, is there any provision in the Federal Rules that sets a time limit on actual service on the part of the Defendant once the complaint is filed? Suppose this complaint or summons hadn't been filed for six years after the complaint had been filed in Court, would the Federal Rules have nonetheless have held it to be a good complaint?"
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1571.442,1592.152,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the procedure in that case would be that had the summons not been issued for six years, we had no similar statute, the Defendant would most likely file a motion under Rule 41 to have the case dismissed for lack of diligent prosecution."
1979.78-1862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1594.488,1597.628,How would he ever know there was a case if he hadn't been served?
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1597.628,1603.492,"He would not know that there was a case until at some point in time, six years later--"
1979.78-1862,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1603.492,1611.948,I am sure he would say -- I assume he would say one of the functions of the pleadings is to give him notice.
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1611.948,1613.404,But he would never have that until he was served.
1979.78-1862,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1613.404,1617.182,He can assemble his evidence and get ready to protect.
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1617.182,1629.073,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but I thought Mr. Justice Rehnquist questioned what if the summons was not served for six years."
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.177,1638.811,"Mr. Galt, can I ask you a question?"
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1638.811,1639.069,Sure.
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.069,1643.22,"About the Oklahoma practice, because I have been a little confused."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1665.427,1671.263,That is what (Inaudible)
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1694.245,1698.669,It was commenced at that time if service was made within 60 days?
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1698.669,1699.818,Yes.
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.387,1714.959,That's not what the statute says.
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1719.785,1721.115,I agree with what Your Honor --
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1721.115,1723.403,Isn't that the way it's construed in Oklahoma?
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1723.403,1725.072,The Taylor Case --
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1725.072,1726.55,Is the Taylor Case a -- I don't recall --
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1726.55,1727.557,It is a State Case.
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.648,1755.258,"The second step is required for what to have occurred, for the action to have been commenced?"
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1755.258,1760.744,"Yes, to give the Court jurisdiction to toll the statute of limitations."
1979.78-1862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1760.744,1763.602,What does the statute of limitations say?
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1763.602,1769.176,The statute of limitations says that there should be two years from the time the injury occurs to file the action.
1979.78-1862,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1769.176,1771.286,To file the action or commence the action?
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1773.358,1775.402,"Your Honor, I can't --"
1979.78-1862,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1775.402,1781.834,Because I think that's rather important what the statute of limitations requires to toll the statute.
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1790.259,1799.209,Our statute says you have two years for bringing personal injury action.
1979.78-1862,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1799.209,1800.801,Bringing it?
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1806.743,1807.854,It has never come up.
1979.78-1862,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1810.104,1813.942,"Well, why wouldn't it come up, because that's the question."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1826.041,1826.469,No.
1979.78-1862,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1826.469,1836.121,"And if it says, if the statute of limitations says the statute runs until you serve the complaining, is that what it says?"
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1836.121,1837.25,"No, no."
1979.78-1862,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1840.715,1843.835,"Well, we've got it in the statute."
1979.78-1862,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1843.835,1858.921,"Counsel, does it help any, the District Court said an action is commenced in State Court when process issues, provided process is actually served within 60 days."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1858.921,1863.758,I think that's 12 OS 97.
1979.78-1862,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1864.624,1867.827,I want to know what --
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1867.827,1871.187,"That I can't answer, Your Honor."
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1904.711,1911.664,"What about page 3 of the Opinion of the Tenth Circuit, in the Petition for Writ Certiorari?"
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1931.91,1939.454,That is not a statute of limitations.
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.433,1972.324,"Since we don't have the statute of limitations before us, assume for a moment it provides that it runs until -- I mean, an action must be commenced, what is your position as to the time, if ever, when the action against your client was commenced?"
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1972.324,1985.584,The action against my client was not commenced until we were served with summons some 101 days after the statute of limitations had run --
1979.78-1862,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1985.584,1999.315,"Again, if you had been served, say 35 days after the complaint was filed, you would say the action was commenced on that 35th day; is that right?"
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,1999.315,2008.124,I would think for the purposes of filing my answer that I would calculate from the 35th day.
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.124,2012.257,"In other words, your view is that the action is commenced upon the date of service."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2035.499,2049.525,"Because our Legislature in whatever wisdom has said, ""We are going to give you two years to file a lawsuit and you must effect service within 60 days from that date."""
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2057.433,2066.241,"All that means is that your statute of limitations, instead of being 24 months long is 26 months long, but you have still got to commence the action within the 26 months."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2066.241,2067.291,That's correct.
1979.78-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.291,2072.589,It is commenced for your purposes being served.
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2073.591,2074.17,That's correct.
1979.78-1862,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2074.17,2079.994,"On the other hand, if commenced in a Federal lawsuit means filing the complaint, we don't have to worry about the 60 days either."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2082.398,2097.443,"Well, if this Court were to hold that the mere filing of the complaint tolled the statute of limitations, then we are going to have different results obtaining in the State Court and a Federal Court."
1979.78-1862,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2097.443,2107.3,"Mr. Galt, it is not a question of tolling the statute of limitations; the action would have been commenced within the statutory period, if that is an adequate commencement of the action."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2113.075,2116.63,"I suppose the question is what does the word ""commence"" mean?"
1979.78-1862,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2116.63,2117.595,That is the issue.
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2117.595,2123.868,Yes. And Rule 3 does not say that commencement --
1979.78-1862,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2123.868,2127.108,Rule 3 is perfectly clear it says it is commenced when you file a complaint.
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2128.469,2129.223,That's correct.
1979.78-1862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2129.223,2148.534,"If you say Rule 3 doesn't say that commencing an action stops the statute of limitations, or means that after that time, if it was filed within the statute of limitations, the statute of limitations has no more applicability."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2148.534,2149.884,I think that's what I am saying.
1979.78-1862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2149.884,2154.262,"I am not sure, the question certainly wasn't too clear."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2169.624,2171.006,That's correct.
1979.78-1862,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2171.006,2184.289,"I understood in your response to one of the questions where you said that for purposes of filing an answer, you would compute from the date of service."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2191.363,2192.825,Well --
1979.78-1862,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2192.825,2208.601,"I can see where, for purposes of filing a responsive pleading, that you would compute from the date of service, as distinguished from the date of commencement of the action, if it relates back under Oklahoma practice."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2219.144,2244.639,"I don't believe so, Mr. Justice Blackmun, but in doing the research and preparation for this argument, it appeared to me that the drafters of the Rule, when they looked at Rule 3, thought about putting a proviso in there that filing the complaint would toll any statute of limitations problem."
1979.78-1862,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2283.647,2292.982,"Conceivably, it might commence for one purpose under the statute of limitations and another purpose in terms of tolling your time, in determining your time to respond."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2292.982,2293.867,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1862,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2293.867,2305.753,"On the matter of supplying this information, while it's true we have the statutes available, you are both Oklahoma lawyers, you submit whatever you wish to submit on it as promptly as possible."
1979.78-1862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2305.753,2310.03,"That section is Section 95, two sections ahead of this."
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2310.03,2311.411,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1862,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2311.411,2314.108,You perhaps can do that before you leave the building.
1979.78-1862,1,30523,jay_m_galt,,2314.108,2315.261,"Yes, sir, we will."
1979.78-1862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2325.113,2334.067,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
