1994.94-6187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.138,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-6187, Steven Kurt Witte v. United States."
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,58.212,64.177,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-6187,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.683,139.915,May I just ask you a preliminary question about that?
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,157.939,159.314,--That is correct.
1994.94-6187,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.22,165.64,He hasn't been convicted in the second proceeding?
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,165.64,167.39,"He has not been convicted, that is correct."
1994.94-6187,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,167.39,169.843,"And why, then, is that claim ripe?"
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,169.843,185.197,"The reason the claim is ripe is because under the Federal Drug Guideline and the other language of the guidelines, all offenses were merged for purposes of punishment in the first prosecution, and Mr. Witte has received all punishment that he can receive."
1994.94-6187,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.629,206.391,"Well, I'm not sure that gives you a claim at this juncture."
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,237.785,243.235,"--It is not close at all, Your Honor, and here's why."
1994.94-6187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,277.192,281.769,Did the term... did the opinion in Williams v. Oklahoma use the term merger?
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,285.018,291.219,"--It does not use that term, but it does look specifically for a cross-reference between the two statutes."
1994.94-6187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,306.432,319.677,"What do you do with a case like Williams v. New York, another Williams case, which says that courts have traditionally taken into consideration all sorts of conduct in deciding what sentence shall be imposed?"
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,319.677,329.017,"Courts have traditionally done that, and the only thing courts have had to look at prior to the sentencing guidelines was what was in the statute."
1994.94-6187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.888,339.982,"What do you mean by the term ""merge""?"
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,339.982,343.699,"--Well, for... let's forget the term merged."
1994.94-6187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,343.699,344.542,I think that's a good idea.
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,344.542,346.572,Let's look at 2D1.1.
1994.94-6187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,417.483,420.467,"I thought you weren't going to use the term ""merged""."
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,420.467,441.536,"--Let us lop off one of the grouped offenses that was punished, let us go back to the Federal Criminal Code, let us charge another one of the offenses that was grouped, and let us run Mr. Witte through the sentencing guidelines again, where all offenses will be grouped, and he will receive a second punishment on the group offenses."
1994.94-6187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,441.536,449.565,"He was not convicted the first time of the same thing that he will be convicted of if a jury comes in against him the second time, is that right?"
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,449.565,460.171,"That is correct, but the guidelines, the Commission expressly made the decision to minimize the significance of the charging system."
1994.94-6187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,460.171,472.401,"So are you saying basically that the guidelines prevent his being sentenced a second time, or tried, or that because of what the guidelines do, the Double Jeopardy Clause prevents it?"
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,472.401,486.208,"Because of what the guidelines do, and the way they group offenses for punishment, the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits Mr. Witte being punished again in the same exact way."
1994.94-6187,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,486.208,490.237,"And in punishment, what is his exposure?"
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,508.402,516.462,"In the first prosecution, the guideline range was 292 to 365 months, based on the grouping of all offenses."
1994.94-6187,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.935,546.482,But if the sentences are concurrent--
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,546.482,560.133,"If the sentences are concurrent, he's still... he is looking at an additional... because the Government made the motion for the downward departure, and--"
1994.94-6187,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,560.133,561.43,--Let's forget the downward departure.
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,599.821,613.643,"--I believe what the Government says and what the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit says should happen in the second prosecution is that, let's assume Mr. Witte had gotten 292 months, a minimum under the guideline range."
1994.94-6187,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,635.134,639.476,Do the guidelines require that the sentences be concurrent?
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,639.476,663.53,"Section 5G1.3(b) says that the sentences should be concurrent, but that doesn't mean that the second sentence will not add a significant amount to the... in other words, they're not going to be strictly concurrent with the exact same amount of time."
1994.94-6187,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,663.53,674.618,"I understand that, but there will be substantial concurrency, and the district court has no authority to alter that result and impose a consecutive sentence?"
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,674.618,688.457,"As the Fifth Circuit read it, and as I read it, I do not believe the district court is going to have any authority to allow Mr. Witte to walk out of prison at the same time he would have after the first--"
1994.94-6187,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,688.457,689.315,Why not?
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,775.922,778.047,"--No, it's not, and here's why."
1994.94-6187,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,784.187,790.106,"No, no, it's not the Fifth Circuit trial, it will be up to the sentencing judge in the future, in a trial we've never even had yet."
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,790.106,793.059,--But we know that the sentencing judge is going to follow the guidelines.
1994.94-6187,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,793.511,796.339,"But the guidelines permit departure, is my point."
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,796.339,796.635,--They--
1994.94-6187,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,796.635,808.647,"And isn't this exactly the kind of situation that if, in fact, your client is being badly treated in the way you suggest, the judge ought to listen to your argument and follow it, otherwise not."
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,808.647,829.106,"--I don't see... I understand that you're talking about 5K2.0, where it wasn't considered by the Sentencing Commission, but I don't see how a judge could reduce the sentence and make it run strictly concurrently."
1994.94-6187,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,829.481,832.34,Why not?
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,832.34,850.66,"--The argument on the other side would be... if the Government prevails in this case, the argument on the other side is, well, judge, clearly the Commission considered this under 5G1.3(b), and clearly this is the way it's supposed to work."
1994.94-6187,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,877.652,881.26,"This is the argument you would make, I guess, in the future."
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,919.387,922.247,It is an unusual circumstance.
1994.94-6187,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1018.491,1021.958,There wouldn't be any problem if they were all tried in the same proceeding.
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1027.954,1029.142,That is correct.
1994.94-6187,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1029.142,1033.938,So I... there's nothing that seems so obvious to me about the injustice of doing it one way or the other.
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1046.761,1054.258,"It's not bringing them all in one proceeding, because he's forced to be put in jeopardy again for the same guideline range and additional punishment."
1994.94-6187,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1054.258,1057.102,"You're not worried about the jeopardy, you're complaining about the punishment."
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1057.102,1058.164,That's correct.
1994.94-6187,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1058.164,1060.569,"And you say that's perfectly okay, so long as they all did it in one proceeding?"
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1072.579,1074.766,Yes.
1994.94-6187,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1102.458,1105.878,Then that's a different answer than the one I thought you gave.
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1109.175,1109.738,Okay.
1994.94-6187,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1109.738,1114.469,"One trial, two charges, guilty of both, sentenced."
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1143.208,1165.559,"There... if I understand the hypothetical correctly, the danger of having the second prosecution and trial is that a second trial judge gets to impose a sentence anywhere within the guideline range."
1994.94-6187,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1165.559,1166.605,Is the range any different?
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1166.605,1168.621,The range... the range is not different.
1994.94-6187,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1168.621,1178.79,So the exposure is the same whether it's one trial on two charges or consecutive trials each on one of the charges.
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1178.79,1194.455,"The exposure under the range is the same, yes, but the way the Fifth Circuit calculated it, you only get credit for time that you've served, so if the same sentence is imposed--"
1994.94-6187,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1194.455,1201.234,"Isn't the answer... I mean, the answer is, it's supposed to work out the same."
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1269.457,1270.519,--The serious--
1994.94-6187,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1270.519,1272.611,--with their application if you apply them intelligently.
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1272.611,1285.309,"--Well, the Fifth Circuit has already told us if you apply them as they see it Mr. Witte is facing an additional... at a minimum, an additional 118 months, and that is a serious problem."
1994.94-6187,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1289.105,1293.151,That's only because of the departure for... because of cooperation in the first case.
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1293.151,1293.916,--That's correct.
1994.94-6187,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1293.916,1296.351,But there was no cooperation as to the second charge.
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1296.351,1298.976,That's right.
1994.94-6187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1371.776,1395.282,"Well now, Mr. Sokolow, earlier I thought you said your claim here was a double jeopardy claim, that given the way that the guidelines operated, the necessary sentence would be imposed after the forthcoming trial, would be a violation of double jeopardy, but now you seem to be arguing that if you interpret the guidelines properly that would satisfy your client's interest."
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1396.265,1399.374,No.
1994.94-6187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1431.674,1434.751,"Well, ordinarily we would take those up in reverse order."
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1441.092,1467.723,"Well, if the Court decides, of course, that it would violate the intent of Congress under the Sentencing Reform Act and it would violate the intent of the Commission and the express language of the guidelines to prosecute and to punish him again, then the Court... you're correct, the Court need not reach the double jeopardy decision."
1994.94-6187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.723,1473.706,"Well, I simply wanted to inquire about what you were urging upon the Court."
1994.94-6187,0,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,1476.003,1476.188,No.
1994.94-6187,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1505.395,1506.895,"Very well, Mr. Sokolow."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1508.613,1516.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-6187,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1536.476,1560.388,"Will you tell us, in response to the question Justice O'Connor asked of the petitioner's counsel, if in your view there is no prematurity here, that we have the issue squarely before us, and subsidiary to that, why are you prosecuting this person a second time if you don't intend to enhance his punishment?"
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1560.388,1571.244,"In response to the first question, we think that, although there is some slight doubt on it, we think the issues are squarely presented."
1994.94-6187,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1605.589,1606.12,Yes.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1616.117,1616.632,"Well, I--"
1994.94-6187,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1616.632,1617.398,Or is that correct?
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1617.398,1624.349,--I think there are a variety of interesting and difficult questions raised by the notion of what the proper sentence would be at the second proceeding.
1994.94-6187,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1631.472,1651.919,"Well, what if, at the second proceeding, if the conviction were obtained and if the sentence imposed were identical to the one previously imposed, credit given for time served, run concurrently, could there be a double jeopardy violation, if that were the case?"
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1651.919,1655.509,Assuming no special assessments?
1994.94-6187,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1655.509,1656.165,Right.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1656.165,1660.805,That's an interesting and difficult question that has not been reached.
1994.94-6187,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1662.211,1667.631,And I just wonder if we aren't jumping the gun a little bit here to assume it's going to be different.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1667.631,1682.358,"--I think my position on behalf of the Government ought to be that it is not necessarily punishment for the second offense to be convicted for, but I think in all candidness that would be a very difficult position to maintain if we were forced to maintain it, so--"
1994.94-6187,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1682.358,1688.887,Have you explained yet what the Government's purpose might be in having a second prosecution?
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1697.182,1699.604,--The reason--
1994.94-6187,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1699.604,1700.603,Is that a possibility?
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1700.603,1703.836,--I suppose there are many possibilities.
1994.94-6187,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1705.477,1708.242,Or a three-times-you're-out sort of a statute?
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1721.55,1733.874,"--I think in general we might be entitled to the benefits of a three-time-loser statute even if we brought one prosecution, but what happened here is that we had two different... what the Government viewed and still views as two very different offenses."
1994.94-6187,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1762.988,1765.518,Then I didn't understand the answer to Justice O'Connor's question.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1775.64,1777.999,"Oh, certainly, if it's only in the first prosecution as relevant conduct."
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1813.048,1818.328,"Before you get into that, could I ask you one question about your explanation of why the second prosecution was appropriate?"
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1830.761,1834.025,--I think it might have been possible to proceed in this trial.
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1842.508,1844.381,"No, I'm assuming this case went just as it did."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1860.844,1863.484,"And somewhat more, yes."
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1863.484,1872.574,"And then, tell me again, why is it you need the second trial against this particular defendant, if it's not to get additional punishment?"
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1872.574,1879.368,"First of all, the investigation had not been completed, so it was not at the time a foregone conclusion that there would not have been additional conduct discovered--"
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1879.368,1881.07,"No, but by the time you brought the second trial it was."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1881.07,1882.32,--Correct.
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1882.32,1889.067,Why did you have to bring the second trial against this defendant if it was not for the purpose of getting more punishment?
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1889.067,1893.753,You mean having had the judge already impose the sentence that he did?
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1893.753,1894.472,Yes.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1894.472,1900.579,"The Government is entitled, it always has been entitled to bring those two prosecutions."
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1902.017,1902.892,"Well, that may be."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1905.297,1913.076,"--Because the Government was going to prosecute the other coconspirator in any event, we were entitled to seek a second conviction against Mr. Witte on the--"
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.076,1914.263,I'm not arguing about what you're entitled to do.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1919.715,1923.681,--I believe the Government felt that we were entitled to get the conviction on the record as a conviction.
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1923.681,1926.742,"Oh, the reason was simply to get another conviction on his record."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1926.742,1933.022,"I believe that was a reason, and a legitimate reason for... and a sufficient reason for bringing the second prosecution."
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.022,1936.489,Sort of like a declaratory judgment proceeding.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1936.489,1948.984,"Well, as I said, the issues of what punishment will be imposed at the second trial are not ripe here, and involve a lot of things, including what version of the guidelines will be applied, and so on."
1994.94-6187,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1948.984,1952.53,"I thought the Government was busy, that it had a heavy criminal case load."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1952.53,1974.599,"We do, and I think if you read the transcript of the dismissal hearing on the second charge you will find the judge was very concerned about that, but I don't think it has ever been considered to take away our right to bring a second charge on a different offense, no matter what punishment may or may not... no matter whether that conduct may or may not have been taken into account in a prior separate offense prosecution at sentencing."
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1974.599,1989.436,"But the difference in this case from the Williams and the other cases is that the conduct may have been taken into, or in fact was taken into, but under the guideline system, the trial judge at the first trial was required by law to take into account the relevant conduct."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1991.81,1992.31,No.
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.31,1993.06,"No, okay."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1993.06,1994.371,"First of all, of course--"
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1994.371,1995.059,Why not?
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1995.059,2017.597,"--Assuming that he was required, because assuming that it was relevant conduct, which of course we didn't believe at the time and don't believe now, the Court has made quite clear that what counts as mandatory for sentencing purposes is the statutory maximum and minimum prescribed by Congress for the offense, which in the case of his marijuana conduct was 5 to 40 years."
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2083.382,2089.303,"No, but none of those statutes require consideration at the first trial of the conduct for which he is indicted in the second trial."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2098.331,2099.8,--If it's known?
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2099.8,2103.268,And that distinguishes all of the recidivist statutes that you refer to.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2103.268,2117.342,"Well, with respect, I don't think so, because in both cases what we are talking about is consideration at sentencing on a preponderance standard of certain uncharged conduct, conduct that was not required to be proven to the court that's doing the sentencing beyond a reasonable doubt after an indictment, and so on and so forth."
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.342,2123.34,"No, but it was required to be proved, and it was proven, and was relied on just as if it had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2123.34,2140.585,"That's right, but if it is punishment in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause to consider at sentencing conduct that has previously been proved, then it is a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause to enhance someone's sentence at a subsequent prosecution on the basis of criminal conduct that was previously proved to another jury in another charge."
1994.94-6187,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.585,2148.223,Your point is it doesn't matter whether it was required to be previously proved or was previously proved and considered as a discretionary matter.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2154.315,2156.877,"That's absolutely right, and in our view it cannot possibly make a difference."
1994.94-6187,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.814,2158.611,"No, what--"
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2158.611,2159.658,--part of the fabric of sentencing law.
1994.94-6187,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2159.658,2178.557,"--What the problem, I think, was... I mean, I don't want to put words in other people's mouths, but I thought that Justice Stevens was driving at the different problem of a later prosecution, and what you are prosecuting this person for is the thing for which he was punished previously, required by law."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2238.456,2240.94,"Well, let me make two responses, if I may."
1994.94-6187,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2245.765,2246.594,Yes.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2246.594,2251.606,"--posed the problem, which is to say that it is conduct for which he has previously been punished."
1994.94-6187,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2254.715,2255.432,That's right.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2255.432,2256.916,--in punishing him previously--
1994.94-6187,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.916,2257.291,Yes.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2257.291,2261.369,"--for a different offense, and that has never been considered to be a problem--"
1994.94-6187,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2261.369,2261.758,"Yes, that's right, up till now."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2262.711,2264.382,--under the Double Jeopardy Clause or the Due Process Clause or anything else.
1994.94-6187,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2264.382,2265.273,Right.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2265.273,2266.007,"Now, the second point you make--"
1994.94-6187,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2266.007,2266.46,That's true.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2266.46,2274.068,"--is an excellent one and you made it before, which is, there are really two possible arguments the petitioner can be making here, and he conflates them, but I think it's necessary to separate them out."
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2421.742,2424.258,"Yes, but that's not this case, and you don't have a statutory maximum."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2424.258,2425.022,It's not this case.
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2425.022,2440.25,"Supposing just the opposite, supposing that that would have required a 20-year sentence, say there was no statutory maximum, and then... but they only indicted him for the lesser amount, and you're saying they could impose that sentence and then subsequently indict him for the larger amount and then impose an additional sentence."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2442.079,2446.482,"As a constitutional matter, if the two offenses are separate, that's absolutely right."
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.482,2447.279,Yes.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2447.279,2448.232,"Now, as a guidelines matter--"
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2448.232,2448.668,And there's no precedent--
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2448.668,2449.653,--it's unlikely that that--
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2449.653,2467.943,"--Do you have a precedent for that ever having been done by any court, where at the first trial there was a requirement by statute or rule or whatever it might be that certain relevant conduct aggravate the sentence, and it was imposed, and then subsequently the person was indicted and convicted of the aggravating offense?"
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2467.943,2471.894,--I have no case where there was a statute that required it as a matter of guidelines.
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2475.44,2476.331,But in the Williams case the--
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2476.331,2480.658,--and Williams v. the State of New York that the Court has an obligation to consider all conduct that comes before it.
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.658,2481.438,--But in the Williams case--
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2481.438,2482.5,"In fact, there's a statutory obligation in this case--"
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2482.5,2489.67,"--when he was indicted for kidnapping, at the prior proceeding for murder there was no indication that the kidnapping aggravated his offense."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2492.809,2497.558,"--Well, he got a... he was sentenced to life for murder and then to capital--"
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2497.558,2498.527,And for the kidnapping he got death.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2498.527,2501.698,"--That's right, explicitly on the basis of having committed the murder."
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2501.698,2510.165,"That's right, but at the murder trial... the point is that at the murder trial there was no reliance on the kidnapping as relevant conduct that would aggravate the offense, and that's what you've got here."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2510.165,2511.117,"Well, that's--"
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2511.117,2521.629,"All of your cases, I don't think you can cite a single case where the relevant conduct at the first offendment aggravated the sentence and then was the subject matter of a second indictment."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2525.675,2528.19,"--Well, not that I can think of."
1994.94-6187,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2528.19,2529.001,"Yes, but there should be."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2530.266,2531.953,I can also say there's no case holding to the contrary.
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2547.822,2566.252,"--No, but it seems somewhat counterintuitive to me to say that a man could be punished for relevant conduct in proceeding A, yet have that aggravate a sentence that would not otherwise have been imposed, then say in proceeding B, we can go ahead and punish him again for the same relevant conduct, and all I'm suggesting is, your position is without any precedent."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2566.252,2580.278,"Well, I would say that my position is I think with a great deal of precedent, although I can't cite you a specific case where, as you say, the judge was required in the first case to take account of the same conduct, although I suspect that there are such cases."
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.327,2620.702,Would you take the same position if in the first trial--
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2620.702,2621.326,"--one way, it's constitutional every--"
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2621.326,2625.872,--the guidelines or some procedure required proof beyond a reasonable doubt before they could take into account relevant conduct?
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2627.651,2630.994,--I don't see why we wouldn't.
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2630.994,2633.353,"I wouldn't think you would, either, right, actually."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2633.353,2644.506,That's entirely a matter of... it goes to the fact that the Court has always said that it is Congress or the legislature in any given case that is entitled to choose what is an element of the offense and what is a sentencing factor.
1994.94-6187,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2686.693,2691.645,"You probably agree with this, so don't let me go down the wrong track though if it's not."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2743.986,2747.844,"Unfortunately, it doesn't jog my recollection on the point of having found another case."
1994.94-6187,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2751.093,2753.264,"--You would agree with that because it's favorable to you, but--"
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2753.264,2776.349,"I agree with it entirely, and I think it points up that the relevant conduct provisions of the guidelines talk, as you say, in terms of conduct, not in terms of offenses, and petitioner's argument requires courts, would require courts to go through an analysis where you take that conduct and try to figure out what offense it constituted and then compare it under the Blockburger test, the elements of offense of a new prosecution."
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.379,2781.239,--But you'd only have to do it--
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2781.239,2781.754,--in places where--
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2781.754,2787.142,--But you'd only have to do it when the Government sought to indict somebody for the same conduct which had already enhanced punishment.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2792.999,2794.171,--I think it's unusual.
1994.94-6187,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2794.171,2812.227,"But the guidelines do seem to expressly provide that if the offense has been fully taken into account in the determination of the sentence already given, that the new sentence will run concurrently."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2812.227,2813.227,That's absolutely right.
1994.94-6187,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2813.227,2818.505,"I mean, the guidelines seem to contemplate this very occurrence on occasion."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2818.505,2819.458,That's absolutely right.
1994.94-6187,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2819.458,2823.003,And accommodate it by requiring a concurrent sentence.
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2823.003,2835.092,"That's quite right, and I would point out again that the... as respondents, or as petitioners have pointed out, the Sentencing Commission has not been notably satisfied with the way that 5G1.3 works."
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2853.57,2868.128,"But doesn't it boil down the fact that if the sentences have to run concurrently, that... and the Government thinks the first judge was too lenient and too much of a downward departure or something, it gets a second bite at the apple, says well, maybe the second judge, even though it will run concurrently, will give a longer sentence the second time."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2874.608,2885.307,"It gives the opportunity... it gives the Government the opportunity to do what the Government has always had the opportunity to do, which is to charge and convict for separate offenses at separate trials at separate times, and allows the judge--"
1994.94-6187,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2885.307,2888.275,"It's always had this opportunity, but you haven't been able to find a case where they've ever done it before."
1994.94-6187,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2888.275,2898.022,--And allow the judge in each case to impose the sentence that he or she thinks fit within the statutory maximum and minimum for the offense of conviction at every trial.
1994.94-6187,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2900.786,2903.8,"Thank you, Mr. DuMont."

1994.94-6187,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2965.558,2967.995,We're talking about now the first prosecution?
1994.94-6187,2,28010,h_michael_sokolow,,2967.995,2981.347,"--The first prosecution started out with a criminal complaint, and the affidavit alleged all of the facts and transactions in both the cocaine offenses and the marijuana offenses."
