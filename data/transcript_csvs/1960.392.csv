1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,15.817,18.814,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.392,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,192.014,195.776,Did the Government at any time ask the bank --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,195.776,196.04,"No, we do not."
1960.392,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,196.04,196.75,(Voice Overlap)
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,196.75,199.123,We do not.
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,247.807,251.269,"Do I understand (Inaudible) that you were, therefore, looking for volunteer?"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,251.269,251.743,Yes.
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,277.807,282.673,"Mr. Barnett, your pack -- our position is -- is not here and I -- I --"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,282.673,283.531,Yes.
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,283.531,292.407,I -- do you understand that they agree that if you were liable to the bank then you have a claim against the respondent or I -- I --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,292.407,293.187,"No, no, (Voice Overlap) but they contest that."
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,293.187,293.346,They make an argument that even at those --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,293.346,294.384,They contest that.
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,294.384,296.094,-- even if you were liable to that.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,296.094,297.016,"Yes, that's right."
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,297.308,298.181,They're not liable to you.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,298.181,303.318,The Court of Appeals' decision was based solely on the lack of our liability --
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.318,303.574,Yes.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,303.574,304.402,-- to the bank.
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,309.206,309.364,But the respondent --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,309.364,312.099,"Now, the respondent -- respondent does not agree with that."
1960.392,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,312.838,315.571,You asked us to hold that you are liable to the bank.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,315.571,316.454,That is right.
1960.392,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,345.247,351.017,"But maybe good for the policy, though it wouldn't be enough the question (Inaudible)"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,351.017,351.572,"Yes, yes."
1960.392,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,351.572,353.608,-- to authorize (Inaudible)
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,353.608,355.054,Yes.
1960.392,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,424.587,432.235,Was there any claim by your opponents that the regulation has construed to say that should be authorized?
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,432.235,441.589,"There is such a claim on the indemnity regulation, his liability over to us which is the second question."
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,533.94,535.884,"That's the ratio of $4000 to $13,000?"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,535.884,537.597,"Yes, yes."
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,538.706,539.087,Yes.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,542.719,544.619,That's right.
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,794.307,799.521,"Mr. Barnett, this is seemed quite complicated at least to me --"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,799.521,799.805,Yes.
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,799.805,812.151,"-- it might be at the end of the day, but it's a -- as I understand it, the bank subsequently sold this property for $10,500."
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,813.018,813.383,That -- that is correct.
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,813.383,815.712,-- play -- doesn't play any part in -- in --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,815.712,815.869,Well --
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,815.869,817.312,-- computing the amount of the guarantee.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,817.312,818.654,I --
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,818.654,819.895,"And if it doesn't, doesn't this give --"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,819.895,820.051,Yes.
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,820.051,821.598,-- the bank a windfall?
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,821.598,827.849,"Well, the answer -- first of all, I haven't gotten to the point at which the proceeds of foreclosure are taken into account."
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,848.292,850.985,"I don't know what you mean by business, they don't affect that."
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,850.985,851.524,The -- they copied --
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,851.524,853.043,Protect the liability for --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,853.043,853.079,They --
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,853.079,853.944,-- for the amount.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,853.944,855.564,Yes.
1960.392,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,857.369,863.066,"You read Section subparagraph B on this regulation, that coverage is not a suit."
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,863.066,863.877,"Yes, that does."
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,878.052,880.1,"Up to guarantee, up to (Voice Overlap)"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,880.1,881.53,"Up to, yes."
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,881.53,883.604,That's a very different thing.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,883.604,886.562,"Well, you would normally state the guarantee is $4000."
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,926.719,927.057,But does it --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,927.057,933.943,-- that's why it's important to compute the -- the amount of the guarantee before you take into account the foreclosure proceeds.
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,934.046,940.484,"But this isn't the gain -- this is the gain -- you may state the question your way, but why don't you state it Justice Stewart's way --"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,940.484,940.76,Well --
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,940.76,942.41,-- that the guaran -- guarantee --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,942.41,944.332,Yes.
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,944.332,948.866,-- the beneficiary of the guarantee did not entirely have a windfall suppose you start that way --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,948.866,949.548,The -- the --
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,949.548,950.91,-- then you might end up (Voice Overlap) --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,950.91,952.273,Yes.
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,953.817,954.726,You finish your way --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,954.726,954.873,Alright.
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,954.873,957.386,-- I just want to suggest this isn't the gain.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,957.386,972.268,The -- as I say that the -- the fact that we haven't considered the proceeds of foreclosure in determining the principal amount of the guarantee does not mean that we don't take them into account.
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1007.793,1009.678,Let me ask you this question of that side.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1023.024,1024.089,"No, I would not, sir."
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1024.089,1024.858,Alright.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1024.858,1033.237,"As I understand it, we don't question the interpretation of the Pennsylvania law as relieving a private guarantor."
1960.392,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1036.025,1040.065,Can the bank -- can the bank get a windfall here?
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1040.065,1049.484,The bank cannot get a windfall depending upon how one makes evaluation of what the bank gets.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1072.698,1075.998,You mean they paid $250 and they brought it in.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1075.998,1076.207,Yes.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1076.207,1079.5,"Therefore, this $4000 do -- do -- (Inaudible) guarantee."
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1084.298,1085.18,That -- that is right.
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1094.749,1095.893,You can guarantee --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1095.893,1097.546,-- at the date of the sheriff's sale?
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1099.454,1103.832,"You can guarantee anything to the third party, is it guaranteed to with the -- with the mortgages?"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1103.832,1105.743,"Yes, yes."
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1192.26,1193.192,We're talking in figures.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1193.192,1195.3,-- i.e. the loss -- the loss.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1195.954,1197.124,But we have figures here.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1200.518,1202.185,"$13,000 it was over that actually at this time."
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1202.185,1204.78,"And now, the proceeds to the sale were $250."
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1204.78,1206.622,"Well, that's the question."
1960.392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1278.291,1282.586,"How is the-- in -- under Pennsylvania law, how is this fair market of value determined?"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1286.449,1292.536,I don't really know of how likely in practice that is to be contested.
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1340.022,1345.17,"(Voice Overlap) what statutory provision, what regulations was made?"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1345.17,1346.221,I think -- I think Mr. --
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1346.221,1346.663,(Voice Overlap)
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1346.663,1353.931,If I may -- if I may -- if I can tell you first what they do then I -- I can -- I can tell you how I justify it in terms of the statute.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1498.618,1505.865,"Let me see if I get this clearly Mr. Barnett, having instead about $250."
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1507.157,1508.958,"Yes, yes."
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1508.958,1517.604,"Then the -- that that had not been the proceeds, but there had in fact when the sheriff's sale in a price of, say $11,000 had been realized."
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1517.604,1518.211,Yes.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1518.211,1521.226,"And the mortgagee would have to credit that $11,000 because --"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1521.226,1521.985,Yes.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1521.985,1523.547,"-- the indebtedness of $13,000."
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1523.547,1524.14,Yes.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1524.14,1527.785,And then the Government's obligation would have been reduced at two.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1527.785,1528.261,That's right.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1528.261,1528.701,Is that right?
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1528.701,1529.275,That's right.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1529.275,1535.88,"But since in this instance, the Government couldn't fix an upset, that didn't happen --"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1535.88,1536.069,That's right.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1536.069,1537.749,-- $250.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1541.55,1541.646,Yes.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1541.646,1543.162,-- it would've been the same result.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1543.162,1543.732,That's right.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1543.732,1549.355,"But since it couldn't fix one, an excess of $9000 will fix none."
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1549.355,1551.098,"This -- since we were unwilling to, we could have."
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1551.098,1551.556,Unwilling about --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1551.556,1552.007,"Yes, yes."
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1552.007,1552.682,Unwilling to.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1552.682,1553.444,"Yes, that -- that is correct."
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1553.444,1553.725,Is that?
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1556.371,1557.162,That -- that is right.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1557.162,1562.522,"And independently, the fact that the bank later in fact sold the property for $10,500."
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1562.522,1565.388,"Oh no, think -- we get the benefit of the actual proceeds."
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1565.388,1567.256,"Now, didn't the bank actually sell --"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1567.256,1568.244,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1569.75,1570.261,That's what I thought.
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1570.261,1570.931,-- the sheriff's sale.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1570.931,1571.35,So that --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1571.35,1571.791,Yes.
1960.392,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1571.791,1576.494,"-- the $10,500 ultimate sale has nothing to do with it."
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1576.494,1577.126,That is correct.
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1727.859,1736.148,"Are you saying -- are you saying that in Pennsylvania, down payment of your 30% make your figures --"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1736.148,1737.296,Yes.
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1737.296,1740.389,-- for the guarantee by private guarantors --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1740.389,1743.762,We -- you -- you probably wouldn't have both the down payment and the guarantor.
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1745.264,1745.799,"Well, if you have --"
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1745.799,1745.927,Yes.
1960.392,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1745.927,1747.68,-- exactly the same situation --
1960.392,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,1747.68,1748.931,"Well here, we have no down payment."
