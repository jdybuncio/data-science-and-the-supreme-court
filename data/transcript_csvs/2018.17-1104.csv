2018.17-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.84,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1104, Air and Liquid Systems versus DeVries. Mr. Dvoretzky."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,7.84,17.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners had no duty to warn about asbestos added to their equipment years or even decades after its sale."
2018.17-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,26.64,35.16,"Counsel, their product would not be salable absent the addition of the asbestos insulation, whatever it is."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,46.08,58.48,"No, it doesn't, Justice Ginsburg. First, the -- the Respondent -- the Petitioners, of course, knew that the Navy was going to use asbestos because the Navy determined that asbestos met its specifications."
2018.17-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,67.24,70.88,Why is that? Did they discover something new that's better than asbestos?
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,70.88,79.04,"They did, in fact. Technology advanced and there were different forms of insulation, and the Navy eventually transitioned to those forms."
2018.17-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,83.44,96.48,"But at least at the time of these sales in question, the manufacturers have a product that, to be used, requires the addition of asbestos."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,109.0,122.8,"They -- they do know that asbestos will be incorporated by the Navy. However, when the Navy chooses to use a third-party's asbestos with our product, our products are not the cause of the injury."
2018.17-1104,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,123.88,124.32,I'm sorry --
2018.17-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,124.32,124.64,What about this --
2018.17-1104,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,124.64,133.0,-- how is your product not the cause of the injury? The asbestos as sold is perfectly safe.
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,176.24,178.36,"Two responses to that, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.17-1104,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,199.12,220.32,"In -- in normal tort law, if you create a car that has a spark in the tank, and the gasoline, which is what explodes the car, explodes, the consumer is not going to sue the gasoline company."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,239.48,249.96,"Because, in that situation, the consumer might well sue both the car manufacturer and the gasoline manufacturer because both products contributed together to the harm, where -- whereas in --"
2018.17-1104,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,249.96,250.68,That's the fault --
2018.17-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,250.68,265.52,"No, that's not -- he wouldn't see the gasoline manufacturer. I mean, normally -- you normally run a car with gasoline and it's normally perfectly safe. Here, you normally run your product with asbestos and it's not perfectly safe."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,265.52,269.84,"Well, here, you run our product and our product is safe."
2018.17-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,291.0,291.72,If -- if --
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,291.72,292.6,The other --
2018.17-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,292.6,301.6,"I'm sorry. But if -- are you arguing that this is a special rule in admiralty, or are you arguing that this is the normal tort rule?"
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,301.6,317.32,"We're arguing that it's the normal tort rule that ought to be adopted as a matter of general admiralty law. As a matter of ordinary tort law, product liability defendants, of course, may be liable for injuries that their products cause, so the defective car that causes a spark is causing an injury."
2018.17-1104,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,358.52,361.64,"But in those -- in those situations, it wasn't foreseeable."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,414.52,417.0,"So, Justice Sotomayor, I think there are a few questions embedded in there."
2018.17-1104,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,455.92,457.28,So --
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,457.28,467.68,"Sorry, Justice Breyer. Well, the second question, Justice Sotomayor, that I think you asked is about the state of tort law. If you look only at asbestos-specific cases, then there's a split of authority."
2018.17-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,495.6,495.84,"No, but there's no -- no one --"
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,495.84,497.08,-- for warning about leaking batteries.
2018.17-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,497.08,509.0,This is different from those in that no one would buy your product but for the use of asbestos with it.
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,509.0,509.28,Well --
2018.17-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,509.28,522.68,"And that's not true of the other examples that you've given. I mean, what makes the product desirable is when the asbestos is incorporated, it works in a certain way."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,526.52,543.64,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that is true of the other examples. Nobody would buy a commercial passenger jet without the availability of seats to be installed in it later by a third-party. Nobody would buy drywall without the availability of paint or -- or wallpaper in order to cover it."
2018.17-1104,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,547.68,549.12,It is somewhat.
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,661.92,664.08,"So let's take A, B, and C."
2018.17-1104,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,676.44,685.8,"No, it doesn't. Required means you tell the person that he better use this product, which is very dangerous, by the way, and you know it, or it won't work."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,714.52,719.96,"First, we did not specifically direct the Navy to do anything, nor -- nor -- nor could we have."
2018.17-1104,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,719.96,720.6,"Oh, well, that's what you say."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,738.32,740.08,You don't need to read the whole record.
2018.17-1104,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,745.24,745.6,Okay.
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,746.12,746.32,But --
2018.17-1104,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,746.32,748.92,Then the jury will decide in favor of you.
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,761.52,763.56,So -- yes. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,763.56,773.68,"Even -- even if a manufacturer ""directs"" somebody else to do something, the manufacturer doesn't control the Navy."
2018.17-1104,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,780.72,782.04,That's a separate defense.
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,785.88,786.24,So any --
2018.17-1104,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,786.24,788.16,It was a private -- any private person.
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,788.16,796.48,"-- any third -- any third-party, even if you're talking about a private user of ship components, the manufacturers don't have the power to direct them to do anything."
2018.17-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,805.08,816.92,"And, by the way, and what is the Navy's -- what is the Navy's liability? What is the Navy's exposure to these widows to seamen who died of cancer?"
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,816.92,825.6,"The Navy is immune under Feres, but there is a worker's compensation system that the Navy administers that can provide some form of compensation."
2018.17-1104,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,825.6,827.08,Very little.
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,827.08,828.72,Going back to Justice Breyer --
2018.17-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,828.72,849.84,"Mr. Dvoretzky -- and this follows on Justice Breyer's -- when you say that even when this manufacturer is -- or the Navy or whoever else it is, is directed to use asbestos, you are not liable, are you making a fairness argument? Are you making an efficiency argument? What kind of argument is that?"
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,849.84,853.52,It's -- it's both a doctrinal argument and a policy argument.
2018.17-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,859.48,859.8,Okay.
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,888.88,908.92,"Because tort law places the duty to warn and also places liability on the party that is in the best position to control or avoid the harm. And it is the -- well, the subsequent manufacturer of asbestos or of the Chief Justice's alternative to asbestos that is in the best position to control the harm in this situation. That party is also in the best position --"
2018.17-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,908.92,911.12,But why is that?
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,911.12,917.88,"Once we put our product out there, we don't control what some third-party develops or sells as insulation."
2018.17-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,917.88,921.32,"You've directed it to use asbestos, so they're going to use asbestos."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,921.32,929.52,"The fact that we -- if we had directed something, that still doesn't obligate the insulation manufacturer to sell asbestos."
2018.17-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,936.28,936.4,What --
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,936.4,940.84,"-- into R&D in order to come up with an alternative, that's all within their control, not ours."
2018.17-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,941.52,955.48,"What if -- what if you are the only one who knows about it? I mean, the asbestos manufacturer, their -- their scientists haven't discovered yet that it's going to kill you, but you have, and it's the same case, you still don't have a duty to warn?"
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,955.48,959.4,"I don't think you have a duty to warn in that situation, but that's also far from this case."
2018.17-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,959.84,961.04,"No, no, I know it's not this case."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,972.0,1029.12,"Perhaps you might in that situation on a different theory have some sort of a fraud claim, but that's not what's alleged here. There's no question here that the Navy knew about the dangers of asbestos and that, over time, asbestos manufacturers knew about the dangers of asbestos and, again, companies came up with alternatives. So the policy rationale here is to place the burden on the party that has the ability to control the harm, and, moreover, the asbestos component manufacturers are the ones that are in the best position to warn. If we had put some sort of a plate on our equipment, first, who knows if it would have been seen down the road as opposed to the package of new insulation that has to be opened and applied. And, second, as technology changes, our warning from 1945 might well have become outdated and inconsistent with a state-of-the-art warning provided later. And so that's why tort law puts the liability on the party that actually has the ability to control the harm."
2018.17-1104,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1029.6,1039.48,"Besides -- besides the costs of having an additional warning, do you see any other downsides to expanding the scope of the duty to warn in this way?"
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1039.48,1040.6,"Well, I think --"
2018.17-1104,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1040.6,1044.56,I'm really not interested in asbestos and bare metal.
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1078.52,1094.56,"So, again, outside the asbestos context, I don't think it has been. But, to answer your -- your policy question, it's bad, first, because, if you believe that the incentive ought to be placed on the -- the party that can avoid the harm, you dilute that -- that incentive by spreading the liability around and you lead to over --"
2018.17-1104,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1094.56,1095.88,"No, that incentive remains."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1103.72,1108.32,"You lead to over-warning, which will lead people just to be deluged with warnings and to ignore them."
2018.17-1104,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1159.16,1160.2,"I'm sorry, why --"
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1160.2,1162.8,-- about what warnings they need to provide.
2018.17-1104,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1162.8,1163.92,I'm sorry.
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1206.84,1220.28,"Well, I -- it increases costs if you're looking after the fact at a party that didn't think that the law required it to provide a warning and imposing liability. It dilutes the effectiveness of warnings to have too many of them."
2018.17-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1239.0,1242.24,"Well, but that's -- I don't understand your -- your technology argument."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1256.28,1257.2,"Well, no."
2018.17-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1295.88,1296.36,"No, but the warning --"
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1296.36,1297.76,And it may be counter-productive.
2018.17-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1297.76,1303.0,"-- presumably would say when this product is used with asbestos, it creates the following dangers."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1313.52,1315.12,That -- not necessarily.
2018.17-1104,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1321.16,1322.68,Then they're not negligent.
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1426.0,1469.56,"Well, I think the problem with all of those standards is that they don't give manufacturers clear guidance about what they need to warn about. Does a manufacturer of a device that takes batteries -- and batteries can leak, does the manufacturer in that situation have to include a warning? Just in case the battery manufacturer doesn't tell you that its battery can leak, I'm going to tell you this battery can leak because I'm telling you to use batteries in my product. Does the manufacturer need to do that? Has it directed the use of batteries? The -- there's no tort case in which, in that situation, people have gone beyond suing the battery manufacturer and actually sued the electronic products manufacturer because, again, tort law places the burden on the battery manufacturer."
2018.17-1104,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1495.48,1498.2,Why are too many warnings bad?
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1498.2,1499.04,Why are too many --
2018.17-1104,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1499.04,1501.76,Why is that bad? You said too many warnings.
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1504.84,1506.28,For a couple of reasons.
2018.17-1104,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1517.32,1518.96,"Well, at most, you have two warnings here."
2018.17-1104,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1528.88,1536.96,"Well, but, if you follow this rule to its logical conclusion, you would have multiple warnings essentially on every part that's connected to every other part within the ship."
2018.17-1104,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1580.44,1583.44,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1583.44,1592.72,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a failure to warn case under Section 388 of the Second Restatement."
2018.17-1104,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1835.12,1849.48,"Well, what if they did know? What if -- how far up the supply chain does this go? And suppose that the manufacturers of these component parts knew this was a custom-made part for the -- the equipment that the -- these manufacturers were going to supply."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1851.12,1876.0,"Likely not because -- and this is a question in the common law that is dealt with by the Integrated Product Doctrine, and that is, if the component manufacturer advises the manufacturer of the product and it's being used as intended, then the duty to warn is taken on by the manufacturer of the integrated product here, which is what makes this case quite different from a lot of the hypotheticals that we can get to. I did want to just, if we could --"
2018.17-1104,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1876.0,1880.76,What is the reason for drawing the line there? What is the policy reason for drawing the line at that point?
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1880.76,1906.92,"Along the lines of what I've just described, and that is the manufacturer of the integrated product knows how its product is operating, knows what effect will happen on the parts, and it centralizes the warnings there. And so I could probably put it in very precise terms for you, and that is if we could stop talking about putting signs on things for just a moment and talk about how this actually operates. They provide a manual on how to maintain their machine, okay? It has pages in it."
2018.17-1104,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1938.88,1939.24,I'm sorry.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1941.0,1941.32,Sorry.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1943.8,1944.16,My friend says --
2018.17-1104,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1944.16,1944.76,That's a gasket?
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1944.76,1945.04,Yes.
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1999.32,2005.52,"Well, Mr. Goldstein, that's where I guess I'm having trouble figuring out where the line is."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2014.84,2015.04,Okay.
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2016.28,2019.72,"Well, at the end of the question you may do with it what you wish. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2019.72,2022.64,You can answer it. You can choose not to answer it.
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2028.32,2061.48,"But a foreseeability analysis might be a 10 or a 30 percent, we can quibble, okay, but some chance. Then there is in the case law a suggestion of inevitability, okay, certitude, we know it's going to be used. And then there is the third possible rule, which seems to be the traditional products liability rule, which is you warn for your own thing and not for someone else's, okay? Those are the three choices between us. And I think we've been aligning the first two a little bit here in this discussion. And I'm just curious, which is it that you are asking this Court to adopt?"
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2061.48,2061.84,It is the --
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2061.84,2062.36,And why?
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2062.36,2062.72,Okay.
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2068.36,2068.44,Right.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2068.44,2074.12,-- what the court of appeals did is it said the common law recognizes reasonable foreseeability.
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2112.6,2116.0,I'm not talking about the replacement parts portion of the opinion right now.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2116.0,2116.12,Yes.
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2116.12,2119.4,I'm just talking about the bare-metal portion of the opinion.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2119.4,2119.8,Yes.
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2119.8,2121.56,Put aside the replacement parts.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2127.84,2130.16,And that is it is inevitable.
2018.17-1104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2194.16,2199.84,But let's -- can I go back for a second? Because now I -- I did have this kind of question.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2215.6,2216.2,Yes.
2018.17-1104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2216.2,2217.64,Then it gives three examples.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2217.64,2218.4,Yes.
2018.17-1104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2218.4,2222.48,"Well, I don't have any problem -- or I probably don't have a problem with the three examples."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2222.48,2222.84,Yes.
2018.17-1104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2222.84,2224.64,But it doesn't say they're exclusive.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2224.64,2225.04,Oh.
2018.17-1104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2225.04,2237.0,"And so I think perhaps one of the other things that the other side is worried about is, if you read that sentence without limiting it to the three examples, it would create the horribles that they show -- that they agree with."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2237.0,2237.52,I understand.
2018.17-1104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.52,2237.6,Yes.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2237.6,2255.2,"And I think you can take some comfort from my reading from the first operative sentence of the court of appeals' opinion that it's talking about only parts that have to be there for the machine to operate. When the court of appeals -- and this is going to be at 16A of the Petition Appendix -- says we've given you three, we're not saying these are, you know, all of the possible examples."
2018.17-1104,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2258.76,2258.8,But where we --
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2258.8,2272.0,"If I could just be precise about one thing it was excluding, and it didn't, and so you would know what the actual consequences of this are. There is a leading district court opinion that gets cited here by the court of appeals, and it had a fourth, and that is knowledge."
2018.17-1104,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2286.16,2294.44,One of the horribles that Mr. Dvoretzky threw out at the end of his argument was like a flashlight with batteries. What -- how should that come out?
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2294.44,2305.28,"If the flashlight is designed in a way that it punctures the battery, okay, in the same way that maintaining this machine causes the asbestos to turn into dust --"
2018.17-1104,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2305.28,2308.92,"No, you just put the batteries in, a normal flashlight, but it doesn't work."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2311.68,2319.6,"No, I think that, in that situation, the mere fact that batteries are intrinsically dangerous doesn't create the duty to warn."
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2334.68,2339.76,"Well, I guess I'm confused then, because I -- I haven't used a flashlight without a battery very often."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2346.32,2346.6,Yeah.
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2346.6,2353.28,"-- who inevitably knows that it's going to be used with some sort of tobacco product, hopefully."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2372.6,2372.84,Sure.
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2373.12,2375.0,I'm -- I'm stuck where Justice Kagan is.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2375.0,2375.24,Okay.
2018.17-1104,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2413.0,2414.04,So you just changed the answer.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2414.04,2414.24,I did.
2018.17-1104,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2414.24,2414.4,Okay.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2414.4,2414.84,So --
2018.17-1104,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2414.84,2415.84,Just making sure. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2415.84,2416.32,Absolutely.
2018.17-1104,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2434.04,2434.76,Mr. Goldstein --
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2434.76,2435.44,I would want to know --
2018.17-1104,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2435.44,2438.12,-- I -- I -- having just recently bought a battery --
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2438.12,2438.44,Yes.
2018.17-1104,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2438.44,2441.68,-- the flashlight told me to not store it with the battery.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2441.68,2442.16,Okay.
2018.17-1104,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2442.16,2442.56,So now --
2018.17-1104,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2442.56,2444.96,Did you feel overwarned?
2018.17-1104,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2444.96,2447.36,-- can you show me why they -- (Laughter.)
2018.17-1104,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2447.36,2451.64,Can you show me a case that would have suggested --
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2451.64,2452.08,Sure.
2018.17-1104,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2454.0,2461.72,"-- that would have come out to the -- to that conclusion? I always assume that when manufacturers do things, it's because somebody sued them. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2461.72,2464.24,Somebody told them to. And sometimes they are over-protective.
2018.17-1104,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2464.68,2465.88,Occasionally.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2465.88,2478.36,"So I -- the two I think that are -- are quite on point are the Huynh case and the Macias case that I gave, so the California Court of Appeals and the Washington Supreme Court. And I -- I do think I should, you know, to be fair to my friend, address the other examples."
2018.17-1104,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2539.12,2541.28,What about the ashtray? You didn't answer the question.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2541.28,2541.84,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2018.17-1104,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2545.04,2555.2,"That's -- I mean, that's -- your answer is, well, you know, the manufacturer of the ashtray is off the hook because it's possible somebody might use it for some purpose other than -- than smoking?"
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2555.2,2559.04,"No, I -- I just tried to give -- among the distinctions is certainly that."
2018.17-1104,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2560.56,2562.52,What if I don't think that's much of a distinction?
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2562.52,2562.92,Okay.
2018.17-1104,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2612.84,2618.76,"No, but that's different because then your product, the actual product that you're manufacturing, is dangerous."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2618.76,2620.28,"Well, Your -- Your Honor, none of this is about the product --"
2018.17-1104,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2620.28,2621.4,In and of itself.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2621.4,2625.48,"I don't -- I don't -- I mean, kids make paper ashtrays, and we all -- the world goes on."
2018.17-1104,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2630.92,2631.28,Well --
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2631.28,2632.52,-- I'm just saying I could.
2018.17-1104,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2632.52,2633.28,The difference -- the difference --
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2633.28,2634.6,It may not be as good as my gasket.
2018.17-1104,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2634.6,2639.24,"Just so I can follow, the difference between the flashlight and ashtray example?"
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2639.24,2648.08,"The -- the difference between the flashlight and the ashtray example is that in the course -- in the necessary course of using it, if you are going to be exposed to harm."
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2677.36,2679.76,What if -- what if -- let's just take a hypothetical.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2679.76,2680.28,Sure.
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2680.28,2680.72,Okay.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2694.76,2698.52,"So there are a lot of different defenses as well, including the sophistication --"
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2698.52,2700.92,"Well, just stick with the -- the hypothetical."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2700.92,2702.12,I am sticking with the hypothetical.
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2702.12,2702.56,All right.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2703.48,2706.36,"I mean, I took the hypothetical to be, you know, will the ashtray maker be liable --"
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2706.36,2708.08,"I know there are defenses, and there are going to be defenses --"
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2708.08,2708.16,Yeah.
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2708.16,2710.6,-- for General Electric or whomever in this case too.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2716.32,2717.0,Yeah.
2018.17-1104,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2717.0,2718.92,That's my question.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2718.92,2722.32,The ashtray -- I think that there is not a duty.
2018.17-1104,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2783.36,2800.84,"But, if the question is who is the -- the best party to warn, in this case, why isn't that the Navy? Now I know the Navy isn't liable because of the separate doctrine, but why isn't the Navy -- why wasn't the Navy the best party to -- to warn? The Navy was aware of the hazards long before the ships were built."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2810.6,2810.92,Yeah.
2018.17-1104,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2890.4,2893.56,"Counsel, I -- I've been thinking about your plane and the Rolls Royce engine."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2893.56,2893.76,Yes.
2018.17-1104,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2893.76,2896.04,I want to make sure I understand it.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2899.08,2899.36,Yes.
2018.17-1104,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2899.36,2906.16,And your theory was that the plane manufacturer is liable to the -- when those dangers injure someone?
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2906.16,2930.36,"Your Honor, what I was -- the example I was giving is if you are doing maintenance on the engine, okay, under the integrated product doctrine, the responsibility there is of the airline manufacturer. It may provide another manual from the Rolls Royce company, but if the airline is providing a manual on how to maintain the machine and it includes the engines, we want it to warn about the dangers of --"
2018.17-1104,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2930.36,2947.16,"I would have thought in that case -- it's a point your friend on the other side made -- it does seem to me that it would make a lot more sense for the engine manufacturer to be the one giving warnings about how its product works. Now I'm not quite sure why that's different than the case before us, but it does strike me as -- as a different situation."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2947.16,2962.6,"Well, I do think that the -- the way the integrated product doctrine has worked, and I think we can also cut through the ambiguities and what the marginal cases are, because they concede liability as to the gaskets that shipped with it originally. So we know we're dealing with an integrated product there."
2018.17-1104,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2977.48,2981.2,Is the -- is a flashlight an integrated product then with the batteries? Is it --
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2981.2,2984.08,I -- I think it's probably --
2018.17-1104,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2984.08,2984.84,Or what's the theory?
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2984.84,2987.6,I -- I think it is because we're talking about wear parts here --
2018.17-1104,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2987.6,2989.92,And the ashtray is not an integrated product with the --
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2989.92,2990.0,With the --
2018.17-1104,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2990.0,2990.28,-- tobacco?
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2990.28,2990.64,Exactly.
2018.17-1104,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2990.64,2994.16,"Is that the -- I just want to make sure -- is that the distinction, so I understand?"
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2994.16,2995.76,"That is among the distinctions, that's right."
2018.17-1104,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3016.64,3019.28,"So shipped with, not inevitably used with?"
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3019.28,3020.72,No.
2018.17-1104,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3028.6,3030.96,"Well, but here -- here, they -- they didn't ship the asbestos with it."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3030.96,3031.16,That is --
2018.17-1104,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3031.16,3032.4,Other than your gasket part.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3034.8,3042.96,"That is -- so just to be clear, our -- our case rests quite heavily on the internal gasket that turns to dust and the internal packing that turns to dust."
2018.17-1104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3104.2,3134.92,"The part there that I started off, whatever my track was, is -- is in the restatement where it says on -- you're talking about this case that you're talking about, I think, right now. ""The law itself must take care to avoid requiring excessive precautions of actors relating to harms that are immediately due to the improper conduct of third-parties, even when that improper conduct can be regarded as somewhat foreseeable."" So that says, oh, well, we have to figure it out."
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3151.76,3151.96,All right.
2018.17-1104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3153.0,3154.56,And you all can argue about whether that's true.
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3154.56,3155.12,Sorry.
2018.17-1104,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3159.8,3160.48,What would you say?
2018.17-1104,1,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3160.48,3172.28,"It is -- in the passive voice, because I just -- if they are making a machine to a Navy specification and the machine will only operate with asbestos, I don't think that gets rid of the duty to warn unless the Navy tells them not to warn."
2018.17-1104,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3219.6,3223.32,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Dvoretzky."
2018.17-1104,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3223.32,3258.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think that one of the challenges -- one of the challenges of this argument is creating an administrable rule based on these terms like required, directed, inevitable. And I think the back and forth shows that those terms, when you actually try to apply them, are very difficult to apply and will not lead to predictable rules that will tell manufacturers what they need to do and that will promote the interests of maritime commerce. When you talk about the machine not operating without it, in our case, the machines would operate without asbestos."
2018.17-1104,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3339.16,3354.48,"And what you just said, it sounds to me like -- that those would be an issue -- issues for trial, but you say you should have summary judgment and no trial based on the, what is it, the bare something doctrine?"
2018.17-1104,2,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3354.48,3422.76,"Well, if -- if the theory -- if it were argued in this case that there was a genuine issue of fact about whether our equipment contributed to the harm in the way that a flashlight punctures a battery, that might well be a fact question, but that's not been pled or argued, and there's no genuine issue of fact on this record because that's simply not what's been argued below. Moreover, if you look at our system, while the system as a whole generates heat, not all equipment in the system even does that. The -- the turbine, for example, spins around but isn't generating any appreciable amount of heat. And so the idea that every manufacturer in this integrated system is liable for warning would just -- would, again, lead to over-warning and excessive liability. With respect to the cases that Mr. Goldstein cited, the Huynh case is one in which the grinder caused the wheel to explode because the particular wheel was incompatible with the grinder. And so, in that situation, there, of course, might well be a duty on the part of the grinder manufacturer to say: Don't use this wheel. The Macias case did not involve later added components."
2018.17-1104,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3456.48,3457.48,"Thank you, counsel."
