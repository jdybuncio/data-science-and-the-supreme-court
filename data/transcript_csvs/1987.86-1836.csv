1987.86-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.959,"We will hear argument first this morning in Number 86-1836, New York State Club Association versus the City of New York."
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,13.262,37.796,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents a classic conflict between competing American values, the fundamental right of our citizens to associate, elect who their friends will be in places which are private social settings and the state's interest in providing equal opportunities for people in places which are public."
1987.86-1836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.991,124.704,"Mr. Mansfield, it isn't clear to me from the opinion below of the New York Court of Appeals that that court necessarily viewed the three factors as an irrebuttable presumption."
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,154.375,160.319,The Corporation Counsel's brief in fact takes that position now for the first time.
1987.86-1836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,269.463,276.679,In the sense of creating a presumption so that it shifts the burden of proof to the club?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,276.679,277.717,--It becomes irrebuttable.
1987.86-1836,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,280.41,287.795,But that is exactly what your opponent says is not the effect of the New York Court of Appeals opinion.
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,294.781,296.841,I don't think that would be necessary.
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,347.12,349.67,What about the ordinance itself?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,365.87,371.103,"It does not, and to the contrary the language of the statute could not be more clear."
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,381.481,388.824,So the effect of the ordinance is that case by case determination of constitutionality in application is precluded.
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,388.824,389.906,It is precluded.
1987.86-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,418.394,432.735,"When you say irrebuttable presumption you really mean that the law means what it says, I guess, that when these three factors are present the law shall be such and such."
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,432.735,433.925,That is exactly correct.
1987.86-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,433.925,436.105,And there are an awful lot of laws like that.
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,436.105,437.778,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.16,500.774,But neither of those opinions purported to be drafting manuals for statutes.
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,500.774,502.473,"I agree, Your Honor."
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.308,557.77,How did this case get started?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,557.77,562.102,--This case was started in the State Court in New York City.
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.863,563.865,By your client?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,563.865,566.576,"--By my client, the New York State Club Association."
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.576,568.827,"And you mounted a facial attack, didn't you?"
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,568.827,570.507,It was a pre-enforcement facial attack.
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,570.507,576.882,And so your claim was that the law could not be constitutionally applied in any way?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,576.882,582.498,"That it could not be constitutionally applied in any case, and that it was overbroad on its face, yes."
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,582.498,585.868,And you think overbreadth applies in this context?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,585.868,589.181,I think overbreadth does apply in this context because there are--
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.181,591.861,"Well, this is sort of a commercial regulation, isn't it?"
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,591.861,598.106,--The provision may have intended to be a commercial regulation.
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.998,604.24,"Well, let's assume for a moment that the overbreadth analysis does not apply."
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,608.023,609.884,"--I think we would win, Your Honor."
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,609.884,616.9,Because in any single case... there is no case you can imagine where this law could be constitutionally applied?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,616.9,655.345,"That's correct, because the law employs a fundamentally incorrect analysis of the freedom to associate, whereas the Court in Roberts and Rotary thought that factors again such as selectivity in beginning and maintenance of a relationship, the exclusion of others from critical aspects of the relationship, that those should be the factors which would determine whether a club's members can decide whether they can have their own friends free from government intrusion, but that is a constitutional standard."
1987.86-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,661.589,664.973,Under the JC and Roberts case is size ever relevant?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,664.973,668.305,"Size is relevant, and in fact, Justice--"
1987.86-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,668.305,671.246,Do you think the fact that regular meals are served is relevant?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,671.917,677.28,"--It wasn't mentioned, although we believe it is a relevant factor, perhaps not the most probative."
1987.86-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,677.28,678.492,Is a relevant factor?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,678.492,679.35,A relevant factor.
1987.86-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,679.35,683.714,Is receipt of payments on behalf of nonmembers relevant?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,683.714,685.975,"It, too, would be a relevant factor."
1987.86-1836,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.975,701.586,Can you imagine no case in which those three relevant factors would combine to result in a non-private status for a club?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,701.586,723.421,"Well, it is conceivable that there is a class of cases in which a club, for example, like the Rotaries or the JCs under any test, even if one employs a fundamentally wrong premise, would have the same result, that doesn't make the test any more constitutional, much like in the Court's decisions in Munson and Schaumburg."
1987.86-1836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,747.708,749.869,We are assuming no overbreadth here.
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,758.917,781.862,"--The Court has used overbreadth in two distinct contexts, as Justice Brockman pointed out in the Munson case, both that the law is unconstitutional with respect to the facts that are set forth by the plaintiff and also in the classic sense of overbreadth where even if the law properly regulates the conduct of plaintiff, nevertheless there are others whose rights will be chilled."
1987.86-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.346,822.88,"If overbreadth doesn't apply here, then, as Justice Kennedy points out, under any conceivable circumstances a club in which these three factors are present would not be subject to constitutional protection."
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,824.871,827.292,"Again, it is an irrebuttable presumption."
1987.86-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,836.588,842.862,I don't think your irrebuttable presumption argument really does you much good.
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,866.438,881.849,"What is wrong with this particular law is not that it draws lines, but that the three prongs that it has chosen to look at are demonstrably different from the constitutional analysis the Court set forth in Roberts and Rotary."
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.982,924.507,Can you imagine any club that... where any such a claim would be... would just always fail?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,924.507,930.963,--Not a club which would otherwise be protected by Roberts and Rotary.
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,930.963,945.071,"Well, I know, but you are saying that every club that you can imagine would have... this law would, if it were applied, would be unconstitutional?"
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,945.071,959.283,"I am saying that the law is premised on a fundamentally misguided and wrong test, and just as Your Honor's decision in Schaumburg pointed out, the 75 percent rule was a fundamentally misguided test."
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,965.918,977.194,"Well, I know, but let's suppose that we agreed with you they applied the wrong test, and we said, well, the right test is so and so but this law is perfectly constitutional under the right test."
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,981.608,994.796,"--The judgment below should be reversed because the test is fundamentally in error, and in error with respect to the constitutional analysis that is required by Roberts and Rotary."
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,995.707,1007.274,"Well, suppose we thought that applying the right test, if this... if the test below was wrong, if we applied the right test, suppose we thought the ordinance passed constitutional muster?"
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1008.556,1022.945,"--If in fact the test was a right test, if in fact the three prongs met all of the constitutional concerns set forth in Roberts and Rotary, then in fact the Court would affirm on that part of the argument."
1987.86-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1069.386,1074.339,"Mr. Mansfield, can I ask you a question about the group that your client represents?"
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1105.62,1118.288,"The clubs represented by NYSCA are primarily those which are social clubs, clubs which are organized four purposes of social intercourse and recreational pursuits."
1987.86-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.288,1128.916,Do you think the same standard applies to that kind of a first amendment claim as one... as the standard applies in the NAACP context?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1128.916,1130.765,"I think it is, Your Honor."
1987.86-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.765,1136.839,You think there is the same... there is an equal importance in protecting that kind of association?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1136.839,1153.161,I think the Court has in the past talked about the freedom of association protecting not only the direct advancement of beliefs but in Coats versus City of Cincinnati the Court mentioned that social expression was equally protected.
1987.86-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1160.615,1165.85,"Isn't it a difference where some people were killed, which is true in the Alabama one?"
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1165.85,1167.911,"Well, I understand that in--"
1987.86-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1167.911,1169.331,Isn't there a little difference?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1169.331,1170.974,--I think that--
1987.86-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1170.974,1172.356,Isn't there a little difference?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1172.356,1182.403,"--I think that the facts are very much different, but I think the principle is very much the same, and that the freedom of association is in fact a fundamentally protected right."
1987.86-1836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.403,1215.445,"Mr. Mansfield, you have to acknowledge at least this difference, that where what is being defended is association on the basis of furthering ideas, it doesn't matter how large the organization is, it could be the American Civil Liberties Union or any nationwide organization with thousands of members, whereas we have made it clear that the associational right that we have referred to where such political or ideological purposes do not exist only applies to intimate association."
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1219.766,1221.208,"Well, that is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1836,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.949,1249.952,And we give more protection to one than to the other.
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1249.952,1266.611,"Once an association, an organization a couple is protected by the right of private association, indeed, I believe that is given more protection than expressive association."
1987.86-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1289.516,1297.102,"Yes, but would you not agree that the size factor is quite different in the political context than in the intimate association context?"
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1303.096,1312.122,"Well, I think that's correct, and I think certainly as Justice Brennan pointed out in Roberts, relative smallness is one of the factors that should be considered."
1987.86-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.122,1318.109,"And your position is, 400 is, as a matter of constitutional law, it has got to be bigger than that."
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1324.0,1326.925,I don't have a guideline to offer the Court.
1987.86-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1326.925,1329.095,"Your position is, there can be no flat guideline?"
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1329.095,1335.189,"I think there shouldn't be, and I think that's what Justice Brennan meant when he said relative smallness, not just smallness."
1987.86-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1393.638,1409.53,"May I ask you if you would make the same argument about the New York statute if one of the prongs instead of a substantial amount of business activity said, and 100 percent of the members regularly, that is, at least once a week or once a month, transact some kind of business in this place."
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1409.53,1413.063,"I think that would be a much closer case, and certainly a trier--"
1987.86-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1413.063,1414.575,"Do you think that would also be invalid, though, do you?"
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1414.575,1417.807,"--If it were, again, an irrebuttable presumption."
1987.86-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1417.807,1418.017,Yes.
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1418.017,1427.423,"If it made it so that in determination of whether you have constitutional rights or not, was not three prongs and you are out."
1987.86-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1437.982,1441.455,"Well, maybe the reason is that businessmen like to do business with men."
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1443.198,1452.016,"--That may not be, but the third prong of Local Law 63 nowhere on its face requires that the business activity be substantial."
1987.86-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1481.668,1501.093,"Wouldn't, on trivial, if you turned it on whether it was trivial or not, the business of the club presented to this Court, wouldn't you get nine different points on the word ""trivial"" as applied to a club?"
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1501.093,1502.342,You might very well.
1987.86-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1502.342,1504.285,So why bother with it?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1504.285,1516.722,"Because I believe, Your Honor, that the analysis in Roberts and Rotary at bottom said that a club should be able to at least try to prove before a trier of fact every probative factor."
1987.86-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1519.485,1523.896,As to whether it is 400 or 402.
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1523.896,1527.029,--And if the 400 people are the same 400 people--
1987.86-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1527.029,1527.189,Or 401.
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1527.189,1530.592,"--or others, and with respect to the third prong--"
1987.86-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1530.592,1539.13,Do you agree that the experience in New York of enforcing its other civil rights law is far from perfect today?
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1539.13,1541.491,"--I would agree with that, Your Honor."
1987.86-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1541.491,1543.381,So this was an effort to straighten it out.
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1543.381,1544.352,It was an effort.
1987.86-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1544.352,1545.583,And you want to torpedo it.
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1545.583,1549.618,We don't challenge the legislative purpose.
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1642.408,1660.669,"Well, your Court of Appeals said it is not unreasonable to determine that a large club which received substantial business-related income from nonmembers, that the law can reach, constitutionally reach clubs like that."
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1663.751,1666.483,--I believe it is not a construction of the ordinance.
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.6,1741.385,"Well, it just isn't what the Court of Appeals said."
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1741.385,1753.573,The Court of Appeals said that large numbers and substantial business would in fact be relevant factors under the Roberts rationale.
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1771.566,1793.519,"Well, would you say that... I suppose you would say that even if the club received what you would agree is substantial income from nonmembers connected with business, you would say that this law is unconstitutional with respect to those clubs, I guess."
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1793.519,1795.011,I would say that it might be.
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1799.044,1805.669,"Well, can you think of a club that the ordinance could constitutionally be applied to?"
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1805.669,1809.031,--I can't because it is a fundamentally misguided test.
1987.86-1836,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.142,1814.946,No matter how substantial the return from nonmembers is.
1987.86-1836,0,16552,alan_mansfield,,1814.946,1821.281,"--If it is substantial enough, then that club would not be protected by Rotaries or Roberts in the first instance."
1987.86-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1864.153,1865.195,"Thank you, Mr. Mansfield."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,1867.646,1903.53,"May it please the Court, if I might just begin by addressing a question that Mr. Justice White addressed to Mr. Mansfield in which I think you asked whether or not this law precludes on a case by case application the constitutionality, that is, that the court or the administrative agency in New York is precluded somehow by this statute from considering whether or not the application of the statute is constitutional or not."
1987.86-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1935.052,1968.605,"Well, Mr. Zimroth, is it open to a particular club in the City of New York faced with a challenge before the Human Rights Commission to come in and offer evidence that it believes demonstrates the business activities are not substantial even though they would technically meet the third prong of the ordinance?"
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,1968.605,1969.306,--If the--
1987.86-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1969.306,1971.636,Does the club have a right--
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,1971.636,1971.837,--Absolutely.
1987.86-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1971.837,1973.668,--to have that evidence--
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,1973.668,1973.818,Absolutely.
1987.86-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1973.818,1974.199,--considered?
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,1974.199,1982.206,"Absolutely, in the context of the club saying that this statute is unconstitutional as applied to me, to my club."
1987.86-1836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.115,1985.078,You can't find that provision in the ordinance.
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,1985.078,1985.429,"No, you can't."
1987.86-1836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.424,1999.28,"Well, I know, but you can't find it in the... as I read the Court of Appeals' opinion, it just seems to say that when the three prongs are proved, that is the end of the ball game."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,1999.28,2001.31,That is the end of the statutory ball game.
1987.86-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.852,2026.999,"Of course, but Mr. Zimroth, if that is enough to prevent a facial challenge, then there can never be a facial challenge because every statute is always subject to a constitutional challenge as applied."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2026.999,2028.04,"No, that is not correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2028.04,2028.851,It is not?
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2028.851,2029.53,No.
1987.86-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2059.081,2060.831,"You are switching to overbreadth... I am sorry, go ahead."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2060.831,2062.402,You asked a question about overbreadth.
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2090.494,2101.721,"Yes, but that is very different, because here you have construed your own statute, and if I understand your argument now, you are saying, well, maybe it is unconstitutional as to some of these clubs, but they can raise that in due course."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2102.573,2110.631,"No, I am saying that even if the Court of Appeals said nothing on the subject, they would be open, the club would be open to make this argument."
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.309,2128.111,"Let me interrupt you again if I may, please."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2128.111,2128.262,Sure.
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2128.262,2144.273,"Do you agree that if these three prongs of this test are met, I don't care whether it is irrebuttable or not, assume that those are met, could they be met and could a club still have a constitutional right to deny membership to a minority group?"
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2144.273,2145.554,Let me say this.
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2146.093,2147.075,It is a simple question.
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2147.075,2148.126,"--Yes, I am going to answer."
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2173.727,2175.047,"Well, I can give you a hypothetical."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2196.511,2210.262,"I think that it would be a hard case, but even if I would assume, or even if you would assume that in that particular application it would be unconstitutional because of the particular advocacy purpose, what does that have to do with this statute?"
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.677,2233.496,"What is such a club supposed to do in its day to day operations if they see this statute, they say we understand the city is going to prosecute everybody that violates it, we are in violation."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2235.918,2236.919,"--No, it does not have a duty to change."
1987.86-1836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2277.747,2290.274,"What you are really saying is that this statute can be applied certainly to some clubs that come within its definition constitutionally if perhaps it can't some other clubs, and we will just have to find out as we go along."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2290.274,2290.955,That is precisely right.
1987.86-1836,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2314.662,2317.725,That certainly isn't the way the Court of Appeals read the statute.
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2351.435,2369.107,"--Well, I mean, they are talking about permissive factors there, and also on the previous page, I believe Page 9A, it says Local Law 63 does not prohibit the city factfinder from considering the test of selectivity or indeed any of the Power Squadron factors."
1987.86-1836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.775,2439.716,"Well, Mr. Zimroth, even if your agency that enforces this law would never permit any claimed defense of unconstitutionality as applied, I suppose that you wouldn't necessarily lose this case."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2451.126,2453.156,I think that's correct.
1987.86-1836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.732,2504.651,"Yes, but suppose we don't have all this trouble that you do of imagining a club that would have a good defense on a constitutional basis."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2508.795,2510.805,"Well, I agree with you."
1987.86-1836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2515.4,2526.997,"Well, because if there are some clubs that this law couldn't be constitutionally applied to, a substantial number of them, and if overbreadth applies, I suppose--"
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2526.997,2528.499,"--Well, that's the point."
1987.86-1836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2529.038,2531.652,"--this whole statute, ordinance is unconstitutional on its face."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2531.652,2532.921,--It has to be a substantial number of them.
1987.86-1836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.953,2537.215,"Well, suppose we think there are a substantial number."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2539.526,2539.857,--I don't because--
1987.86-1836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.857,2540.736,Why not?
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2540.736,2541.126,--Because--
1987.86-1836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2541.126,2541.497,Why not?
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2541.497,2542.739,--there is not a substantial number of them.
1987.86-1836,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.818,2562.553,"But doesn't this ordinance, at the bottom line it talks about business purposes."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2562.553,2566.677,"--That is, the money has to be received in furtherance of a business purpose."
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2575.162,2579.577,"Mr. Zimroth, you referred to the University Club, I guess it was, that over half of its members are engaged in business."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2580.846,2583.299,--It is in the record before the City Council.
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.299,2584.66,"Well, what is in the record in this lawsuit?"
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2586.112,2586.753,Virtually nothing.
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2586.753,2588.053,Why not?
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2588.053,2589.665,They are the plaintiffs.
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.335,2605.916,Do we even have a list of the members of this organization?
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2605.916,2607.446,--There is no list in the case.
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.157,2611.089,Do we know how many of them are in New York City?
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2611.089,2611.249,Excuse me?
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.249,2613.142,Do we know how many of the 125 are--
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2613.142,2617.265,"No, and you don't know how many actually fall within the statute."
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2629.582,2629.903,--Yes.
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2632.116,2633.115,It wasn't our burden.
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2633.115,2635.578,"Well, if you asked for it you sort of assumed a little burden."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2635.578,2639.051,"No, we asked for it to try to prove that--"
1987.86-1836,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2639.051,2641.461,"Well, if you didn't get answers you didn't try very hard."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2641.461,2643.973,"--Okay, we didn't try very hard."
1987.86-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2645.312,2647.045,"Mr. Zimroth, could I ask--"
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2647.045,2657.391,But they are the plaintiffs in this case and it seems to me if they are going to show substantial overbreadth it is their burden to show that there are real clubs out there that could be hurt and they haven't.
1987.86-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2657.391,2667.459,"--Mr. Zimroth, if there is a private right of association in clubs it is not very explicitly set forth in the Constitution anyway."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2693.646,2698.908,There was no such... there was a claim made by the plaintiffs in this case.
1987.86-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2698.908,2701.16,What is the basis for that exclusion?
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2705.383,2717.313,"We had basically a ten-year history of legislative findings, began in 1973, with the City Human Rights Commission hearings."
1987.86-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.446,2771.469,Let's take a criminal statute.
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2799.191,2808.616,"Well, I am not sure that the same standards would apply if you are talking about depriving people of liberty, where you are talking about a fundamental right."
1987.86-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2814.33,2819.785,"It seems to me if there is no problem for Elks or the Mystic Order or what-not, then they have nothing to worry about."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2830.293,2838.689,The rational basis is that... it seems to me it is appropriate for the legislature after it goes to a hearing to legislate about what the problem is.
1987.86-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2875.274,2883.699,"To make sure the legislators are not legislating against my club but not against their own clubs, which is the whole purpose of the equal protection clause."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2883.699,2887.65,"Well, I don't know that there is any evidence of that."
1987.86-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.958,2914.841,They don't take bribes.
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2918.15,2919.883,We are not putting them in jail either.
1987.86-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2919.883,2929.708,"Counsel, could this statute have excluded a group that discusses literary works?"
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2929.708,2930.78,Could... excuse me?
1987.86-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2930.78,2934.683,Could this statute have excluded a group that discusses literary works?
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2946.343,2949.335,I don't know the answer to that.
1987.86-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2949.335,2951.258,"Well, why is the American Legion exempt?"
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2951.258,2962.316,I said the reason the American Legion is exempt is that in the City of New York there was no evidence that came forth from the City Council that presented the same kind of problem.
1987.86-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2963.616,2966.958,"Would you speak into the microphone, please, counsel?"
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2966.958,2970.08,--Maybe it is a similar problem somewhere else in the country.
1987.86-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2971.883,2974.765,We have held that labor picketing cannot be exempted.
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2979.179,2979.79,Yes.
1987.86-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2979.79,2986.435,"Speech concerns are implicated in this statute, are they not?"
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,2986.435,2996.021,Only if you find that the clubs that are included have a First Amendment right which really begs the question.
1987.86-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3018.528,3020.828,No heightened scrutiny applies when you are using speech--
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,3020.828,3021.399,"I am sorry, I am having--"
1987.86-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3021.399,3024.993,--No heightened scrutiny applies when you are using speech classifications?
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,3024.993,3027.947,"--Well, there are no speech classifications in this statute."
1987.86-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3027.947,3032.109,There are no First Amendment... are there First Amendment implications in this statute?
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,3032.109,3040.213,Only if you find that the clubs that are included in this statute have a First Amendment right.
1987.86-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3040.213,3042.356,Is there a First Amendment right to associate?
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,3042.356,3052.061,"In some circumstances, either if the association is intimate or if it has a predominantly expressive purpose."
1987.86-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3052.061,3057.226,"Well, the city itself found that it was balancing associational rights versus other compelling needs did it not?"
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,3057.226,3061.157,That is why it picked the standard of 400 members.
1987.86-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3123.46,3128.672,"Is there a First Amendment right to discuss business, do you suppose?"
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,3128.672,3136.607,--If there is it is commercial seed and it is much lesser protected.
1987.86-1836,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3166.829,3169.38,Unless you are a member of the American Legion or the Elks.
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,3169.38,3172.931,I don't know.
1987.86-1836,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3172.931,3175.134,"That's what the statute says, counsel."
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,3175.134,3189.263,"There is no evidence... there is no evidence in the record that that kind of thing happens in those kinds of clubs in the City of New York, the point being that these clubs can simply, they can get out of this regulation altogether."
1987.86-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3194.619,3201.163,May I ask about that prong a little bit so that I better understand what the ordinance means?
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,3229.931,3232.903,Theoretically but not practically.
1987.86-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3232.903,3236.496,The ordinance would make that--
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,3236.496,3241.009,"No, not the ordinance, the regulation, which has not been applied or tested."
1987.86-1836,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3242.488,3256.468,--The ordinance as interpreted by the regulation would make that club then for all members a place of public accommodation regardless of reimbursement as I understand it.
1987.86-1836,1,38472,peter_l_zimroth,,3256.468,3256.608,--I'm sorry.
