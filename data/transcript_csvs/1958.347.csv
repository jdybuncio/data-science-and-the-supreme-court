1958.347,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,15.75,"No 347, County of Allegheny, Petitioner, versus Frank Mashuda Company."
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,19.891,22.975,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1958.347,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,322.459,329.45,"Is it in the record what, what purpose it was for, what private purpose it was claimed it was?"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,329.45,331.117,Yes it is Mr. Chief Justice.
1958.347,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,331.117,332.371,What it is –-
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,332.371,359.573,"What happened was that they added as a defendant, in the District Court proceedings, a contractor who the county had issued a contract to for construction of part of the airport paving and the county had also licensed the contractor to use a certain portion of the Mashuda property temporarily for storage purposes for his materials during his construction contract."
1958.347,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,396.579,408.187,"Was that the only non public purpose that is alleged, just a temporary use of it by the contractor for the construction of the airport?"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,408.187,412.37,"Well, as far as we conceive from the complaint that's all that there is."
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,443.188,489.98,"May I ask before you go into the procedural detail as given, according to it the law as annunciated by the people of Pennsylvania, if the county or the state came before – can before the People of Pennsylvania and said yes Your Honor we want to condemn, we want to condemn land solely to a private purpose in the sense this will advantage some private enterprise because they apparently think it will add to the economy of the county or the state, is the law of your state court is so clear (Inaudible) in such a case?"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,489.98,491.554,Yes I think it is your Honor.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,491.554,492.382,What is it?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,492.382,497.329,I think the law is that we cannot take property for a private purpose.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,497.329,517.207,That is the doctrine or the principle (Inaudible) the power to condemn and declare by your court is that it must be for public purpose so that I suppose the controversies have been contemplated before your court as well as before this Court whether the purpose as arisen public in the context of a particular case.
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,517.207,518.279,That is correct Your Honor.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,524.041,529.988,Who determines the validity of the claim that it is for public purpose?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,529.988,538.862,"Well we say that under law of Pennsylvania that's determined in the Board of Viewers proceedings, in other words condemnation proceeding as such."
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,538.862,539.891,Are you going to deal with that?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,539.891,542.99,I'm going to deal with it right now.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,610.623,620.371,"Would you mind giving me (Inaudible) just by way of date, the date when the state proceedings were initiated, where they were when the federal proceedings began?"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,620.371,622.563,Yes sir.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,642.003,648.236,Was the public versus private purpose of the taking an issue before the viewers?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,648.236,649.37,It was not raised.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,649.533,650.028,(Inaudible)
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,650.028,666.602,"No what happened Your Honor was this, that in a petition which was subsequently filed from the award of the viewers, the plaintiff themselves avert that the condemnation resolution was duly adopted in conformity with the Second Class County Code."
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,666.602,667.594,Before the common pleas' review.
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,667.594,679.448,"Before the common pleas review, in other words after the award of the viewers which was in March of 1956, within 30 days there were appeals filed by the county and the property owners."
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,700.631,710.187,"When in the ordinary course of business, would you say the appeal was taken -- or the award it was in 1956 and within 30 days after --"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,710.187,715.193,"The award was in March of 1956, so within 30 days there was an appeal filed."
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,754.329,755.958,How about the –-
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,755.958,756.546,And that was in --
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,756.546,766.257,"(Inaudible) In March 1956 the appeal was filed in the common plea within 30 days, it brings us to April."
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,766.257,767.03,That's correct.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,767.03,770.548,"Then there was pre-trial, was there a pre-trial step taken?"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,770.548,771.344,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,771.344,773.699,And were they motioned?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,773.699,781.495,There was a pre-trial postponed until November 1956.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,807.834,815.518,The postponement of the hearing in common pleas was not out of deference or by agreement that the federal proceeding to be initiated and go on.
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,815.518,819.292,"Oh no, we never agreed with that Your Honor."
1958.347,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,819.651,835.07,"Instead of filing the suit in the Federal Court, the defendants in the common law -- Common Pleas court had moved to remove it to the Federal Court on grounds of the first, could have they have done that?"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,835.07,837.785,Well I think Mr. Chief Justice they might --
1958.347,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,837.785,839.5,This is simply a diversity case.
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,839.5,859.961,"Yes, they might have been able to do it had they done it properly, that is within the 30 days after the appeal was filed with the Court of Common Pleas, but this case was filed in a District Court almost a year after the appeal was taken to the Court of Common Pleas and I think there is no question that the removal of jurisdiction would be lacking."
1958.347,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,859.961,864.417,As I understand it this issue could not have been litigated in the common pleas action.
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,864.417,869.384,"Well, Mr. Justice Douglas that's the crux of this case."
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,887.02,890.963,(Inaudible) nobody raised it?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,890.963,892.746,That's correct Your Honor.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,923.449,926.826,That's the only thing that is contested before the viewers?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,926.826,931.166,"Just the damages in this case, in this case, but what we are saying is --"
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,931.166,932.498,"I understand, but in this case."
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,932.498,937.154,"That's correct, but what we are saying they could have raised --"
1958.347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,937.154,939.438,They could have raised it before the Board of Viewers?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,939.438,946.823,"Well, we say that they could have and we say that the Pennsylvania Law says that it is must be raised in that proceeding."
1958.347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,946.823,953.252,"But would the Board of Viewers determine this particular question, whether this was taking for a public use?"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,953.252,954.838,"We believe they would have, yes."
1958.347,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,971.437,974.078,(Inaudible)
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,974.078,982.069,Well it's -- we say that it's a determination which is inherent in the award when nobody raises the question.
1958.347,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,982.069,983.964,(Inaudible)
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,983.964,994.009,"It's a quasi judicial body Your Honor in Pennsylvania, it's an arm of the Court of Common Pleas, it's appointed by the Court of Common Pleas."
1958.347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1004.561,1008.33,(Inaudible) Court of Common Pleas?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1008.33,1009.872,When it comes to the Court of Common Pleas --
1958.347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1009.872,1018.894,"Suppose this question had not been raised before the viewers, but on the appeal, put it on the appeal then be raised in the trial de nevo in Court of Common Pleas."
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1018.894,1020.056,"We believe so, yes sir."
1958.347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1020.056,1022.019,So you get two cracks at it.
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1022.019,1032.018,"Well, we believe that it's jurisdictional because if there hasn't been a proper taking then there is no power to making an award and we say --"
1958.347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1032.018,1039.434,But it is clear that even if you don't raise it before the Board of Viewers you may still have an opportunity to raise it in the Court of Common Pleas?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1039.434,1040.328,Yes sir.
1958.347,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1040.328,1044.953,(Inaudible)
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1044.953,1047.683,"Well, no we do not admit that Your Honor."
1958.347,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1082.166,1083.783,How about the Spann case?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1083.783,1094.214,"Well, the Spann case, Your Honor was a District Court -- a case of a school district in which that question was not raised."
1958.347,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1111.125,1112.155,But they entertained the suit.
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1112.155,1119.079,"They entertained the suit, but that was also before the Gardener case which we refer to in our brief."
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1119.824,1167.169,"(Inaudible) must interrupt you there for asking whether you can -- whether Pennsylvania can foreclose bringing the question, raising the question in a diversity suit in the Federal Court, although the state law may limit it to local Pennsylvania court, is the question that I should think has been Wholly clear in the light of the Madisonville case, but the point here is, that in fact it wasn't raised either before the viewers whether they had been granted quasi judicial or not and it was certainly not raised before the Common Pleas which is an indubitable judicial tribunal, is that right?"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1167.169,1168.191,That's correct.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1168.607,1187.856,"And that being endeavor to raise it by independent action, not through removal of the Federal Court, of the cause on diversity ground, but to raise it by independent action after the state proceedings in the state courts had been in process it is perfectly clear on the fact of this case."
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1187.856,1188.785,That's correct.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1260.314,1264.813,(Inaudible) not here because the state proceeding didn't go to adjudication?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1264.813,1268.459,Well but it may and the very --
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1268.459,1272.98,(Inaudible) res judicata until you have adjudication.
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1272.98,1291.44,"Well a very interesting question would arise it seems to me Mr. Justice Frankfurter is when it goes to adjudication and not having been raised, will it then be res judicata and what will be its effect against any decision that the District Court might make concerning the invalidity of the taking."
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1293.954,1313.437,"No, does this is in your, is your attack against the action of the Court of Appeals in reversing the District Court resting on claims, this is res judicata because if the state proceedings are allowed to be completed, it would be adjudicated that's the ground of your argument?"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1313.437,1314.906,"No, no, that is not the ground."
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1314.906,1315.278,Alright.
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1315.278,1325.093,We are only suggesting that is one of the questions which will be raised subsequently if we permit this District Court proceeding to go on.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1546.016,1557.871,"Let me ask you this in this case is there any such question as that (Inaudible) controversy in the last case, namely the so called irreparable damages?"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1557.871,1570.329,"No, Your Honor there is no question of irreparable damages here because we have admitted that they are entitled to damages if there is a taking and no matter how long the trial may proceed --"
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1570.329,1582.842,But they claim that that the state procedure is such that undue delay will embarrass them in such a way that no damages can compensate to it?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1582.842,1583.87,You mean in the preceding case?
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1583.87,1585.107,"No, no, in this case?"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1585.107,1586.164,"Oh no, no sir I don't --"
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1586.164,1587.116,That's out of the question --
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1587.116,1588.029,I don't think --
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1588.029,1604.742,"This is merely a question whether the Federal Court should entertain a diversity proceeding brought a year after the matter was in submission or in claim of decision by the state, the Common Pleas Court in the state condemnation proceeding, is that right?"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1604.742,1615.695,"That's correct, Your Honor and I might point out that they cannot be hurt by delay in this case, because if they are entitled the damages for a taking then they are entitled to what we call the pension money which was in effect interest on the award."
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1615.695,1637.122,"Now let me ask you -- I meant to ask the Attorney General, I rather was thinking of asking the Attorney General, in the other case the Attorney General Alpern said that, when asked about these Pennsylvania judges, he said they get us (Inaudible) knowledge of Pennsylvania law."
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1653.45,1659.182,Well I should that what Attorney Alpern said about them I could very charitable he say about them --
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1659.182,1659.825,Well I know.
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1664.159,1666.279,Well I think Your Honor --
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1666.279,1677.324,"Is there some, is there something below the surface that makes the condemnation process of Pennsylvania ruthless, or severe, or difficult, or obscure or --"
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1677.324,1683.989,"No, but there are very, there are some very obscure questions concerning procedure."
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1684.434,1686.737,They think they can do it better than the State Courts?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1686.737,1688.36,Well I'll use your language.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1688.36,1689.719,If they're more interested in it.
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1689.719,1695.865,Your language at best it's a forecast rather than a determination of what the state Supreme Court would say.
1958.347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1729.118,1733.464,Are we hearing that Circuit Court said in the Gardner case?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1733.464,1741.013,"Well that's what the Circuit Court said, but what I am suggesting here is let's assume that we don't know who is right, the Circuit --"
1958.347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1741.013,1746.262,(Inaudible)
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1746.262,1747.164,Well --
1958.347,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1747.164,1750.016,(Inaudible)
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1750.016,1755.417,All Circuit Court judges are very good Your Honor.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1756.683,1758.292,Are they fungible?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1758.292,1774.709,"What we are suggesting here, what this Court has repeatedly said that no matter how learned they are in the law that when it's a question of state law that only the Supreme Court of that state can adjudicate at best as a forecast rather than a determination."
1958.347,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1816.209,1827.891,(Inaudible)
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1827.891,1830.106,"We believe that there is, Your Honor."
1958.347,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1866.949,1869.728,I suppose we can take it from your statement.
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1880.75,1886.974,Well the Attorney General has nothing to do with this proceeding Your Honor.
1958.347,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1891.033,1891.393,And you control that litigation?
1958.347,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1891.393,1892.602,Do you control that litigation?
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1892.602,1900.445,Now we control that litigation and there is no question in our minds that we would have no objection for that proceeding.
1958.347,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1900.445,1904.914,No question in your mind but in fact if you would not raise any such objection.
1958.347,0,37668,philip_baskin,,1904.914,1908.665,No we certainly would not.
1958.347,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1908.665,1910.432,Mr. Schmidt.
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,1910.432,1913.822,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1958.347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2012.504,2021.743,(Inaudible) proceeding in the Federal District at the time (Inaudible)
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2021.743,2022.772,An action of ejectment?
1958.347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2022.772,2023.244,Yes.
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2023.244,2046.175,"Yes Mr. Justice Brennan, very clearly we have a right under the unquestioned Pennsylvania law to do that, now we feel that in as much as we are representing Wisconsin residents, Wisconsin citizens who own land in Pennsylvania which was as we contend tortiously taken from them, they have a right to bring it under the diversity jurisdiction in the Federal Courts."
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2089.905,2093.388,Is that any controversy?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2093.388,2095.259,I believe it is the position of --
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2095.259,2108.21,"Is there any controversy that whatever right you may have in an ejectment proceeding, you could have asserted in the Common Pleas on appeal on de novo review of the Board of Viewers?"
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2108.21,2128.359,"Well I would not want to put words in the mouth of counsel for the county, but I would certainly disagree with any contention that we can engraft an ejectment proceeding against Martin Wise, one of the defendants in this case, into a condemnation proceeding between the County of Allegheny and the Mashudas as to how much money the Mashudas will get for the land which was taken from them."
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2128.359,2139.166,"But if in the Common Pleas proceeding if state condemnation efforts are frustrated then you have already won, haven't you?"
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2139.166,2139.866,No sir.
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2139.866,2140.444,Why not?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2140.444,2146.403,"We want a remedy, we want a writ, that a sheriff or a marshall can execute by return --"
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2146.403,2153.726,"But if the Common Pleas says that this is a taking for private not public purposes, nobody can touch your land?"
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2153.726,2156.669,They have taken it already Your Honor and they are on it.
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2156.669,2157.243,What?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2157.243,2159.899,"They are there, we want them out."
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2159.899,2170.357,Now what would -- what would be the remedy in the Common Pleas court if the question of what private versus public purpose is raisable in that court?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2170.357,2190.719,"Well I don't mean by inadvertence to agree with your basic proposition Mr. Justice Frankfurter, but caveating that proposition, if we can get in before they take it, we have a remedy of bill in, bill in equity to stop it, the Spann case and many other cases relied upon by the Court of Appeals make that perfectly plain."
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2190.719,2195.905,Must the viewers – must the viewers approve the taking under Pennsylvania law?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2195.905,2204.009,Under Pennsylvania law the Viewers' proceedings are much different than I believe Viewers' proceedings in any other jurisdiction of which I have knowledge.
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2204.009,2215.323,Well is the question of -- is the objection that the taking is for private purposes raisable in the federal -- in the State Court other than for an ejectment proceeding.
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2215.323,2220.342,"It's raised bill in equity, action and ejectment or trespass --"
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2220.342,2227.3,"And if not raisable in the condemnation proceeding itself, resisting it on the ground that it's not for a public purpose?"
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2227.3,2230.289,"I submit that it is not, but I do not believe --"
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2230.289,2231.662,They know nothing about it.
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2231.662,2240.485,But I do not believe that it is necessary for our success in this case to establish that proposition because --
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2240.485,2249.081,It is very important for me to determine whether the condemnation sought by the state maybe denied on the ground that it is for private purpose?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2249.081,2249.262,Oh!
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2259.179,2266.375,"And therefore the condemnation can be arrested by the Common Pleas on (Inaudible), is that right?"
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2266.375,2268.464,"I disagree with that, but I –-"
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2268.464,2269.576,I don't understand –-
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2269.576,2274.338,But I believe -- well may I explain my answer just a little bit.
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2336.535,2352.276,"I don't think that follows necessarily at all, because you can go to the Pennsylvania court, presumably you get justice there and it doesn't follow because you may go into the Federal Court, but the Federal Court must allow you to go there."
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2352.276,2353.298,In a diversity case?
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2353.298,2354.386,In a diversity case.
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2354.386,2355.744,"Well I, if --"
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2355.744,2361.85,Well we have several decisions of this Court over my dissent in some cases --
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2361.85,2384.946,"But, Your Honor dissented in the Stoody case which reached exactly the opposite conclusion and I believe joined Mr. Justice Black in the conclusion there that because all of all of the other requisites for diversity jurisdiction were present and it was and there were no reasons whatsoever to delay the disposition of the matter in the Federal Court that the diversity jurisdiction should have applied."
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2392.311,2395.262,Well my mind has come to rest on important questions?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2395.262,2402.11,Well if I may be of assistance I would like to argue that point just a little further?
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2402.11,2406.19,I want the defendant in a case where the case is sent back --
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2406.19,2407.129,I did not hear Your Honor.
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2407.129,2417.958,I dissented in a case in which Justice Black wrote fro the court in a diversity case on the ground of the Federal Court is just as well equipped as a State Court.
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2417.958,2441.551,"I think -- well, my own feeling would be about that area of the law, that in all of the cases where Your Honors have indicated that the matter is to be sent to the State Court, that there has been something other than a straight lawsuit based on the diversity jurisdiction."
1958.347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2441.551,2476.1,"Now isn't this something other than that too Mr. Schmidt, I'm directing your attention to page seven of the record which is the prayer of your complaint and you ask for ouster and damages then you say in addition or in the alternative, that means that you want it either way, either in addition, but at least you want this, plaintiff's demand an injunction restraining the County of Alleghany from proceeding further against the plaintiffs in the Court of Common Pleas, regard as (Inaudible)."
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2481.29,2539.238,"It engrafts on it as an alternative request, something more than would be asked for in an ordinary action of law, but may I call Your Honor's attention to this, that Section 2283 of the judicial code which we contend is not applicable here, because this is an action at law within its own framework, provides for the issuance of an injunction to protect the jurisdiction of the District Court, and we believe that by the filing of an action of the ejectment, the District Court will have obtained and I believe properly has obtained jurisdiction over this particular piece of land, and I wound not want to suggest that, that court under certain circumstances which might come up, if the facts of this case are ever permitted to be proved in the District Court, might want to issue an injunction in order to protect its jurisdiction within the framework of Section 2283."
1958.347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2629.753,2631.523,Now may I have just one moment with you?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2631.523,2631.999,Yes sir.
1958.347,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2631.999,2636.62,Is there a provision for answering pleading to that petition?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2636.62,2657.992,"No, not to my knowledge, and its not filed, if -- what happens in a case of that kind is that you appear, as a matter of fact the Board of Viewers by statute in Pennsylvania is not even required to take testimony, they can go out on the land and make their own determination of the value, it's only more or less as a matter of custom and courtesy that the --"
1958.347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2657.992,2661.188,(Inaudible)
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2661.188,2672.483,"Well generally speaking, yes, although as Attorney General Albern pointed out, our Common Pleas Court has two or three Boards of Views, they sit in groups of threes and cases are customarily assigned to --"
1958.347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2672.483,2678.722,But are they experts in property evaluation or something like that?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2678.722,2681.088,Yeah they purport to be.
1958.347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2693.424,2699.056,"Well what kind of people are appointed to it, what's the background, are they real estate people, insurance men, lawyers or what?"
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2699.056,2719.864,"Sometimes lawyers, sometimes from a background that I would have to disclaim personal knowledge of Your Honor without really knowing in the case in which this was heard, the Chairman of the Board was a -- was and is a lawyer, a member the Alleghany County Bar."
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2752.649,2756.765,Would you have raised any other question except damages for the Common Pleas?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2758.549,2760.319,"In my view, not Your Honor."
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2760.319,2760.988,You couldn't?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2760.988,2764.468,"But in my view even if we could have, we were not required to --"
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2764.468,2777.653,"I understand that, but I just wanted to know whether you -- whether the issue before the Court of Common Pleas and view of the Viewers is clearly, whether it's 52,000 or 83,000."
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2777.653,2791.089,"That in my opinion Your Honor is the only question before the Common Pleas, the only case that we were able to find in the federal courts that passed on that question at least rising out of Pennsylvania, because our law and procedure is different."
1958.347,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2934.539,2936.965,"For what purpose, (Inaudible)"
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,2936.965,2955.639,"We say that the -- and I believe Mr. Justice Black, that in this record the allegations of the complaint must be taken as true because there was never a trial, that it was leased to the defended Martin W. Wise Incorporated for the benefit of said lessee and for no public use."
1958.347,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3004.294,3008.859,Well was that the only purpose and nothing else in the record showed differently?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3008.859,3019.028,"Correct, Your Honor, correct sir, there is nothing in the record that in anyway negates this because at least before this court the county filed a motion to dismiss."
1958.347,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3039.358,3043.033,Was he constructing an airport there for use?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3043.982,3091.502,"Well, the county, the resolution of the board of county commissioners, if the Court please, stated that it was going to be used for that purpose but as far as I don't want to go outside the record on the basis of my own personal knowledge, but according to the record, according to the record not that I am afraid to answer the question, I'll be glad to answer if I am not trespassing on the proprieties, but the matter first came to our attention when Martin W. Wise appeared in possession and according to the compliant and I think the fair inference to be drawn from the complaint which is admitted here is that it was not known prior to and could not be known prior to May 22nd, 1956 that its going to be used for anything other than the construction of an airport."
1958.347,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3095.998,3112.785,"I am reading from the brief of the other side, I am wondering if we time take that as they cite pages on the record that they were to be used for an airport Wise was going to build it and it was necessary to have this place to store his tools and so forth in order to build the airport."
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3112.785,3121.825,"Well Mr. Justice Black you are exactly 100% right, that's what they say and that's point is up for a reason if I may say so, why we are entitled to try this case in the District Court."
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3158.249,3163.96,I believe that there is nothing to try from your point of view if all that's admitted there is nothing to try.
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3163.96,3173.755,"Well it's admitted for the purpose of this argument on the -- since the case was thrown out on the motion to dismiss Your Honor but we want the right to prove those, those facts."
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3173.755,3175.803,But there maybe a contest on the facts?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3175.803,3175.977,Oh!
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3179.928,3193.997,"Starting point is, the sovereign position by Pennsylvania that the county has alligated that he wants to condemn this and every (Inaudible) position is the basis of condemnation is a lawful constitutional basis, isn't it?"
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3214.664,3216.991,That is the claim we are making Your Honor.
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3414.182,3419.074,"Where is the Jury going from the federal court, what Jury I mean you are going to get?"
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3419.074,3423.451,"Jurymen are drawn in western districts, from all over the western district."
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3426.651,3431.105,"They are Pennsylvania folk aren't they, not Wisconsin folks."
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3431.105,3436.654,That's correct but that's the best we can do with the diversity citizenship with the diversity rule as it is.
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3436.654,3452.672,"I suggest, I suggest that since you invoked Hamilton he merely explained, he gave a reason for that, he wasn't asked for this, neither was Madison neither were any of the plaintiffs, very hot with the federal -- for the diversity ground."
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3452.672,3476.833,"Well as a practical matter, Your Honor I was looking at it from the standpoint of a trial lawyer who is used to operating down on that level I must say that it weighs rather heavily in my determination in any particular case as to which jurisdiction I invoke in this case was one of the reason why I chose on behalf of Mashudas to attempt to get the case into the Federal Court."
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3476.833,3481.209,"No need to say that trial lawyers like, they don't think that, I know they do."
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3481.209,3484.744,Well I am willing to admit that on the record and I think it's --
1958.347,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3484.744,3488.331,(Inaudible)
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3488.331,3505.243,"Well I was going to say was this the, I think I am perhaps jumping the gun just a bit but the next question I had in my mind if we ever do due get back and get a chance to prove these facts was whether or not I'd be able to challenge any Allegheny County resident for cause that's another question."
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3560.726,3564.118,There certainly isn't if you are right.
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3564.118,3566.114,Only in the diversity sense Your Honor.
1958.347,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3566.114,3571.897,"There is no, if you are right, and there is certainly an unconstitutional exercise of eminent domain."
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3571.897,3579.511,"Well the state admits, the state admits that if our facts are true the exercise is invalid and I might say this."
1958.347,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3609.675,3643.838,"Mind I ask you this, how could you (Inaudible)"
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3643.838,3657.826,"Well I urge Your Honors to do what the Court had done in other cases that we've referred to in our brief, and that is to rely on the judicial experience and expertness of the three judges, two of whom were Pennsylvania lawyers, have decided that."
1958.347,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3678.406,3685.812,And was Dickinson who sat in the Colgate Case of Pennsylvania lawyers --
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3685.812,3701.817,"It was an Eastern District of Pennsylvania Case Your Honor and I would assume it would be, because the Eastern District of Pennsylvania is completely within Pennsylvania and I don't know of any federal judge, district judge that is appointed from a state other than that, in which the district is located."
1958.347,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3701.817,3707.78,"He came from the -- it was a three judge court, I thought he might have been brought in."
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3707.78,3709.055,In the Colgate Case?
1958.347,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3709.055,3712.432,"Yeah he was the Pennsylvania Judge, wasn't he?"
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3712.432,3724.817,"Oh I would -- allow me to retract what I said, I thought it was a decision by a single judge, if it's a three judge court, it's conceivable he could have been brought in from other district, although I don't think that's very customary."
1958.347,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3730.178,3735.19,I want to ask you one question about Page 10 page of the record.
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3764.239,3776.641,That went in because the county simply appended it as an exhibit to their motion to dismiss and have -- it was filed in the District Court and ever since that time it's been printed as a part of --
1958.347,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3776.641,3779.34,Is there anything wrong with it?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3779.34,3783.514,"Oh no it's perfectly accurate Your Honor, although --"
1958.347,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3783.514,3795.32,"And your people say that this was -- the result could be used or acquired for the purpose of establishing, maintaining their own air navigation and terminal facilities."
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3795.32,3820.326,"Well the only thing that's wrong with it is Your Honor that it wasn't until approximately a month later that we found out that it was leased to Martin Wise which the record also shows uncontradictedly occurred on or about May 22, 1956, approximately one month after the (Inaudible) was taken, the affidavit was sponsored by Mr. Mashuda to this appeal."
1958.347,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3820.326,3825.584,Did that show that he had a contract with the County of Allegheny?
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3832.651,3838.899,"We would object strenuously to any incorporation of that fact in the record, we did not allege it."
1958.347,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3848.112,3852.317,"But it's in the motion to dismiss, isn't it?"
1958.347,1,28156,harold_r_schmidt,,3852.317,3852.576,No Your Honor --
