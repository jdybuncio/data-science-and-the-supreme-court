1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,40.81,47.032,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.198,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,206.978,210.028,We would like to have them Mr. Wright.
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,213.395,217.075,I'm sure that they can be made available and I will see that that happens Mr. Chief Justice.
1968.198,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,217.075,218.887,Thank you.
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,218.887,223.531,There is an issue between my friends and myself.
1968.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,568.78,581.067,"Mr. Wright, the record, fit as it is does seem to show that your client was told that he could be tried within two weeks anytime he made himself available that --"
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,581.067,582.514,The record certainly shows that.
1968.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,582.514,593.94,And as I read the response of this case from the Solicitor General appearing on pages 32 and 33 of your brief.
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,621.029,621.069,Yes.
1968.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,621.069,622.401,Is that all correct?
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,622.401,626.319,"That's -- to the best of my knowledge, it's correct, Justice Stewart."
1968.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,626.319,639.907,"And then it's indicated -- that would seem to indicate that he could have at least try to make himself available and probably would've succeeded and then the Texas Court has said, “If you do make yourself available, you'll be tried.”"
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,639.907,651.629,I would read it somewhat different with respect Your Honor it seems to me that what General Griswold has said there is that occasionally this has happen to the instance of the prisoner.
1968.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,705.008,716.761,"I have one other question about page 33, it's the final sentence of the Solicitor General's letter, is there are “not” omitted there?"
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,716.761,718.106,There is “not” omitted there.
1968.198,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,729.735,731.689,So that you'd say it does not appear?
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,731.689,736.515,"That is what I should say, yes, it's what the original file says."
1968.198,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.515,747.023,What was the -- as the -- do the federal authorities mean to indicate that if the prisoner himself requested they not only would make him available but make him available at their expense?
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,747.023,755.05,I do not -- do not gather that though I don't think that what is said here is definitive one way or the other.
1968.198,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,788.366,795.625,"Well, what if such a writ is issued the instance of the state authorities, what happens then?"
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,795.625,805.55,Then the practice is that the writ ordinary would be honored the state is required to pay the expenses of transporting him and guards --
1968.198,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,805.55,811.052,And this is precisely what Texas is not interested in doing I gather the one thing.
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,811.052,813.413,"I gather its one thing they're not interested in doing, yes."
1968.198,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,813.413,823.809,Is it also true that the federal officials first transfer him to the nearest federal facility at their own expense?
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,825.915,833.567,"It says in some instances to mitigate because of the state, the Bureau of Prison has removed an inmate to a facility close to the site of prosecution."
1968.198,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,833.567,834.282,"Mr. Wright, is this --"
1968.198,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,834.282,835.269,That's what it had done.
1968.198,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,835.269,838.904,-- is this federal procedure formalized in anyway?
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,838.904,850.413,"Well, there is a statutory procedure for it Section 4085 and there are also rules of the Board of Prisons that are issued from time to time."
1968.198,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,861.554,865.488,"That contemplates the state will make the application, does it not?"
1968.198,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,865.488,869.757,Yes.
1968.198,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,870.228,873.148,Very well.
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,874.685,878.735,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1107.48,1113.15,What was the writ -- what was the action of law -- in the -- this was a petition for writ of mandamus?
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1113.15,1128.71,"Yes sir, to mandamus to trial judge to dismiss the indictment because he have not a speedy trial after seven years which he in truth and in fact have not had it and which he in truth and in fact was entitled to if he had not waived it."
1968.198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1379.44,1380.967,Is Texas broke?
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1380.967,1381.33,Sir?
1968.198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1381.33,1382.529,Texas is broke?
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1382.529,1385.499,"Not Texas, Your Honor it's the county under our Harris County."
1968.198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1385.499,1388.629,Harris County broke with all of those skyscrapers?
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1388.629,1395.764,"Absolutely, it went up the movement Texas 4.7 last Friday and I think now there's a movement on to get that rescinding."
1968.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1403.848,1404.036,But Mr. Moss --
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1404.036,1404.779,Now --
1968.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1404.779,1413.908,"I suppose if you -- if you needed a witness or two from the same state to convict him, you would find the money, would you not to bring on there?"
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1413.908,1415.654,Very rarely.
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1424.149,1431.52,"If you want to -- and if you want to expedite a rich prisoner from New York (Voice Overlap), then you pay his expenses?"
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1431.52,1431.675,"Yes, sir."
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.675,1432.847,"Even if he's got $42,000.00."
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1432.847,1436.31,"Oh, Your Honor, we wouldn't (Inaudible) other thing in that (Inaudible)."
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1436.31,1437.746,It's what I thought.
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1437.746,1439.743,"Yes sir, we get him when we want him."
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1568.328,1580.49,"Oh, I take that his petition for mandamus in the court below in the Texas Supreme Court asked in the alternative for a trial for a prompt trial or dismissal of the indictment."
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1580.49,1581.516,"Yes, sir."
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1581.516,1585.076,"Made no allegations that as of that time, he had never been denied his speech?"
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1585.076,1586.393,That is true.
1968.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1701.695,1712.83,"What do you have to say about Professor Wight's argument that he'd been entitled to this remedy, whether he is with some millionaire or whether he is a pauper?"
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1712.83,1715.02,I agree with him a 100%.
1968.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1715.02,1722.113,"Well, then what is the relevance here, the argument you're just making about he has made no affidavit of indigency?"
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1722.113,1733.799,The relevancy of the argument is that the sovereign State of Texas still has control of her courts and the amount of time that her judges and so on operate and work and perform their duties.
1968.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1774.348,1781.726,"Well, suppose he admittedly, he was a wealthy man and he made the demand for speedy trial and --"
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1781.726,1787.762,"Then we would say, don't spend your money, get out of here, goes to prison authorities would say, ""We have a benevolent attitude towards you."""
1968.198,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1834.217,1848.706,"Mr. Moss, may I ask, I'm looking at the prayer of -- at which you close your brief and says that, since the record is insufficient to permit decision that we should do one of three things as I read it."
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1848.706,1849.346,"Yes, sir."
1968.198,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1849.346,1859.48,"Dismiss the writ of certiorari and probably be granted, hold it to all relief prayed for the petitioner to be denied."
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1870.952,1871.467,"Yes, sir."
1968.198,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1871.467,1873.848,"Now, what are the facts that we should be develop?"
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1873.848,1880.134,Facts developed was whether or not he has been deprived of these asserted constitutional rights --
1968.198,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1880.134,1897.5,"I mean, if we're going to bring him in for that kind of hearing and as Mr. Justice White pointed out his petition was either for a trial or for dismissal of the indictment, why not send them back to you and let it be brought there for the trial on the new merits?"
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1897.5,1904.064,"Oh, I'm sure it be done if Your Honor so ordered, but you bear in mind, we don't have the United States Government of the party to this suit."
1968.198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1909.573,1923.725,"A Government has made it clear that if you go to the U.S. District Court in Houston and get a writ a habeas corpus, it will be honored and he will be delivered, the only question you picking up the bill."
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1923.725,1931.051,"I might do a one step beyond Your Honor, agree with you and go on to step further that they leave manner one from a state judge."
1968.198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1932.441,1933.317,It's alright.
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1933.317,1933.8,Yes.
1968.198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1933.8,1935.521,"Well, why not do that?"
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1935.521,1937.3,I'm perfectly willing to.
1968.198,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1937.3,1939.333,"Well, that's the end of this lawsuit."
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1939.333,1940.39,Except for the bill?
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1940.39,1942.055,"No, we'll do that now."
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.055,1942.839,But you will pay the --
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1942.839,1944.004,"Oh, yes, sir."
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1953.839,1958.643,Suppose -- I suppose his first offense would be that he's been denied a speedy trial.
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1958.643,1971.611,"Well, he will be entitled to a hearing, all of his motion to dismiss which he filed in the trial court, which counsel says we ignored and he's wrong, we're waiting to hear it because this says he hasn't been present in front of the witnesses."
1968.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1978.623,1979.402,Do you have any idea --
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1979.402,1981.09,Two weeks ago in the Summer case --
1968.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1981.09,1986.508,Do you have any idea how many other are similarly situated --
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1986.508,1990.057,"I believe counsel -- I agreed, it's 15,000 and with counsel, I don't remember exactly --"
1968.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1990.057,1991.462,"15,000?"
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,1991.734,1995.185,"Well, I think that's right, I'm not going to commit here but it's the way I remembered."
1968.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1995.185,2001.8,"Now, you say that you would bring this man back immediately and afford him of speedy trial?"
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,2001.8,2002.762,"Yes, sir."
1968.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2002.762,2007.96,"Does that mean that principle would you apply it also to all the 15,000?"
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,2007.96,2008.183,Oh!
1968.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2009.917,2033.352,"Well, I'm -- let's say all of those that are under your jurisdiction, can you say to us that the fact that you will agree to bring him back and try and give him a speedy trial and pay the expenses incurred by it, would leave to the same kind of treatment to other people who are similarly situated from the State of Texas?"
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,2033.352,2037.326,"To the best of my ability, the answer is yes and yes, Your Honor."
1968.198,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2044.227,2045.017,That's right.
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,2045.017,2052.34,"And subject to their approval which they have always given, as far as I know, not the association with them."
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.253,2090.96,"Well, then there's no issue have left here for adjudication."
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,2090.96,2092.292,"As far as I see it, no sir."
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2092.292,2093.687,And that of --
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,2093.687,2103.664,"Subject to that qualification now, if they don't give us the money, we have properly notify this clerk in this Court and you can issue the writ whatever you want to order him to do because they're not part of the suit."
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2113.57,2121.951,"Now, if we just -- based on your representation here in open court, we just remanded the case for further proceedings."
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,2121.951,2123.764,"Not inconsistent, I believe --"
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.764,2127.252,Without any opinion or anything else.
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,2129.602,2130.471,Indeed.
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.597,2132.17,Then what would you do?
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,2132.17,2134.038,-- you see that could very well be dismissed.
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2145.037,2147.301,Dismiss on the grounds of the delay?
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,2147.301,2161.698,"In other matters, we have a pretrial stuff down there, there's roughly equivalent to the federal criminal rules and we got from search matters and whatnot timely supressions of what (Inaudible) other than go out on that ground but if not on the constitutional ground."
1968.198,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2165.706,2170.504,"But Mr. Moss, I wonder if they aren't some further complications here."
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,2240.978,2243.141,"I'm going to agree with you, Your Honor."
1968.198,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2243.141,2243.821,I beg your pardon?
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,2243.821,2263.156,"I agree, it does affect this treatment in the prison based on what I'm told, I've never had the connections with the mother and just through my official position, but I know from the talking to other prisoners that it does, and I know that it has a bearing from actual experience, don't have a bearing with the party attorney."
1968.198,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2274.595,2284.959,"And in any event, you're going to get to the trial, you've given him one of the prayers, one of the alternative prayers of his petition in the state court."
1968.198,1,31942,joe_s_moss,,2286.889,2290.54,"Well, I believe here, he just asked for dismissal if I remembered it correctly."
1968.198,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2387.903,2388.875,May it please the Court.
