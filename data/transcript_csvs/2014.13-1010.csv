2014.13-1010,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.904,"We will hear argument next in Case 131010, M&G Polymers v. Tackett."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,6.82,10.222,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1010,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,32.971,39.391,But the -- we're dealing with a case where there isn't silence.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,56.353,66.808,"Your Honor, respectfully, it is silent with respect to the duration of the full company contribution toward benefits."
2014.13-1010,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,82.602,86.522,"That's what you say, but there was a hearing by the district court."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,91.008,91.858,--Yes.
2014.13-1010,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,96.076,101.211,"Assume assume that I find those words ambiguous, you have a hearing."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,132.265,138.669,"Justice Sotomayor, I want to go back to -- to the first part of your question which said, well, wasn't -- wasn't there a trial here?"
2014.13-1010,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,190.352,193.487,"Ms. Ho, I'm wondering if you would agree with this."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,208.08,208.48,Correct.
2014.13-1010,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,208.48,208.93,Okay.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,223.673,224.173,That's correct.
2014.13-1010,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,224.173,233.797,"And if the agreement was ambiguous, we could take extrinsic evidence to clarify the terms of the agreement; is that correct?"
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,233.797,235.581,"Objective extrinsic evidence, yes, that's correct."
2014.13-1010,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,235.581,236.833,"Okay, so--"
2014.13-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,236.833,237.949,You acknowledge that?
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,241.051,242.335,"Well, Your Honor, I'm--"
2014.13-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,242.335,244.77,You don't believe in the parol evidence rule?
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,244.77,253.793,"--Objective objective -- extrinsic evidence, Your Honor, would be in other words, admissible -- admissible on a finding of ambiguity."
2014.13-1010,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,253.793,254.627,"--Custom, practice."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,254.627,274.705,"But I -- but I think it's important, Justice Kagan, if I may, to point out that in the Sixth Circuit, and I think this is one way in which what happened here departs from ordinary contract determination, is that in the Sixth Circuit, the inference applies of vesting based either on text or--"
2014.13-1010,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,274.705,275.291,"Yes, I hear you."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,275.291,277.007,--or extrinsic evidence.
2014.13-1010,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,277.007,277.441,"Yes, I hear you."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,281.945,282.495,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2014.13-1010,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,282.495,282.978,Yes.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,303.291,334.996,"Well, I -- I would agree with you up to a point, and I think where -- where I might part company or maybe add to that discussion would be to say that ordinary contract interpretation does say, I think, in McCutchen this Court referred to that, in Stolt-Nielsen this Court applied the principle that where a contract is silent, courts apply the relevant default principles; in other words, silence I just want to make clear that silence doesn't always equal ambiguity."
2014.13-1010,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,335.78,343.535,"Well, but then you get to Justice Ginsburg's question, don't you, which is that this is a case where actually the parties are disputing language."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,367.717,383.926,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, at a minimum, that's why we're entitled to reversal and a remand, if this Court declines to require a clear statement as -- as part of -- as part of ordinary contract interpretation."
2014.13-1010,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,388.564,389.38,Where does--
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,389.38,391.516,--at the language without the Yard-Man inference.
2014.13-1010,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,391.516,395.068,--Where does -- where does ordinary contract interpretation require a clear statement?
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,395.068,425.77,"Certainly, Your Honor, we think -- we think ordinary contract interpretation says where there is -- where there is silence here, and there is no durational term, there's no indication of vesting, there's no indication of how long the full company contribution should last, that where there is silence, as this Court did in McCutchen, this Court looks to see, well, what are the operative default rules that -- that we assume that if the parties didn't contract around--"
2014.13-1010,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,425.77,433.693,"Well, you keep saying when there is silence, and as Justice Kagan pointed out and as I pointed out, one side is not silent."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,437.328,448.134,"--I think there -- there is silence -- there is no question that there is silence in the operative term of the promise, which is a full company contribution toward healthcare benefits."
2014.13-1010,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,466.414,474.601,But I thought your position here was that what the contract says under ordinary principles of contract interpretation is not the point.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,484.642,485.392,--Yes.
2014.13-1010,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,485.392,496.367,"And the question -- the principal question here is whether the YardMan presumption should have a play a significant part in the interpretation of this contract, and you say no."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,496.367,497.1,Correct.
2014.13-1010,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,497.1,513.145,And there would be -- and presumably there would be -- we could make that decision in remand so that we don't interpret this contract initially without -- without the benefit of what the district court and -- and the court of appeals would say without the Yard-Man presumption if you prevail.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,513.145,513.978,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2014.13-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.978,519.715,"Unless, of course, the Yard-Man presumption is normal contract interpretation."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,575.3,587.942,"Justice Scalia, I think there's -- I think you're right that the Sixth Circuit would and has said that all it's doing in these cases is applying ordinary contract interpretation."
2014.13-1010,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,667.474,675.83,"Well, we know that contracts have certain assumptions about them, about what continues."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,681.651,682.251,Correct.
2014.13-1010,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,684.367,699.461,And Justice Scalia just said to you something that talks about retirement and the surviving spouse and her right to get things would -- I think could reasonably be viewed as a vesting provision.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,699.461,728.644,"--I would respectfully disagree with that, Justice Sotomayor, for two primary reasons: I think the first reason is that all of these other textual cues are reasonably read in conjunction with the contract, both with the contract expiration clause, which says that the benefits are for the duration of the agreement; but even without that clause, are read in the context of the background rule--"
2014.13-1010,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,728.644,729.063,"See, that's--"
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,729.063,730.963,--with respect to the terms expiring with the agreement.
2014.13-1010,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,730.963,732.348,--the question for the following reason.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,776.627,779.329,We--
2014.13-1010,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,779.329,784.231,So long as the health -- as long as the company is providing health insurance.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,784.231,799.424,"--Our position is the full company contribution language, as the district judge in this case initially held when looking at that language, does not have a durational term that's not sufficient to imply vesting."
2014.13-1010,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,819.821,841.653,"But could you have -- if the collective bargaining agreement has expired, you have your duration clause, and the company instead of saying, retirees, we're going to make you contribute something to the health care, says: Well, the contract expired; no health coverage at all for retirees."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,845.538,859.712,"--Well, under ERISA, where Congress said, unlike pension benefits, we're not going to require health care benefits to vest, the only way--"
2014.13-1010,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,859.712,860.798,But the fact--
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,860.798,862.481,--the only way the benefits vest is by contract.
2014.13-1010,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,862.481,874.121,"--Is it your position that once the contract expires, the employer is free to say no health coverage for retirees, period?"
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,874.121,877.007,"If there has been no vesting, yes."
2014.13-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.746,885.829,But you answered the question.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,897.404,907.027,"--Our position -- I'm just trying to be consistent with the record in this case, Your Honor -- is as a general matter, yes, the terms don't outlast the terms of the agreement, but there is a difference in this case."
2014.13-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,907.027,919.669,"What I would like to hear, earlier you said there were two reasons: One was the termination clause and second that the contract had to be read in light of the background rule -- then you got cut off."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,924.571,926.423,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2014.13-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.161,964.029,"What's the second one -- before you get cut off again, what's the second one?"
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,964.029,964.763,--Certainly.
2014.13-1010,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,987.911,992.13,"Ms. Ho, Congress has said, yes, in pension benefits, there's vesting."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,995.165,995.834,That's correct.
2014.13-1010,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,995.834,1002.154,"So it doesn't have any implication for health care benefits other than we leave it to the parties, isn't that right?"
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1002.154,1007.475,I would respectfully -- maybe I would not so much disagree as take that a step further.
2014.13-1010,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1029.071,1035.309,"Well, but then you're back to your first background rule, which is that we would expect to see this if it were there."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1076.302,1086.175,"Well, and I think -- I think your question raises two issues, one of which goes back to our previous discussion about the role that ERISA has to play here."
2014.13-1010,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1099.902,1100.468,Congress has said we don't care.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1102.286,1105.738,"--Right, but there's no obligation to do it."
2014.13-1010,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1128.671,1131.337,This is an important benefit and an expensive one.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1142.412,1145.463,I think--
2014.13-1010,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1145.463,1150.517,This certainly can't be something that didn't occur to the employer or to the union.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1155.154,1174.9,"--I think one could consider that they didn't express it directly or one could read the contract as saying there simply is no -- silence says there is no promise of vesting here, because that is an extraordinary obligation for a company to take on."
2014.13-1010,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1174.9,1175.283,How about
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1186.79,1189.159,"No, Your Honor."
2014.13-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.821,1233.204,"Well, I don't think it's reversing that."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1258.054,1260.156,--The vesting.
2014.13-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.156,1264.46,It seems to suggest that -- that health benefits continue as long as retirement benefits do.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1272.313,1273.581,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2014.13-1010,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1293.812,1295.479,Why do you have to -- why do you have to do that?
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1303.351,1318.444,"Well, Your Honor, I think the practical reason for -- for linking those two is not to indicate vesting, but to ensure that the recipient is -- is actually retired for purposes of receiving the benefits."
2014.13-1010,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1318.444,1334.12,"Well, I thought it was your position that whatever might be the outcome of these questions, the Sixth Circuit didn't think that that was the right analysis, that the Sixth Circuit didn't think the result could be reached without imposing the presumption of your argument, and so instructed the district court."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1335.22,1335.353,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-1010,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1352.248,1357.566,I thought that the district court on remand said it would have come out the same way anyway.
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1363.553,1364.072,"Correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.043,1403.364,"You know, the nice thing about a contract case of this sort is you can't feel bad about it."
2014.13-1010,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1426.663,1436.502,"Well, you know, the workers who discover they've been retired for five years and don't have any health benefits might feel a little bad about it."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1436.502,1439.637,"And -- and Your Honor, I -- I agree."
2014.13-1010,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1439.637,1442.839,"I'm taking sides, but I want to--"
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1468.473,1469.207,And -- and--
2014.13-1010,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1469.207,1470.409,"He agrees with you, doesn't he?"
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1471.875,1473.277,"--No, Your Honor."
2014.13-1010,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1473.277,1479.03,"So you say just have us decide it, and in this case, I've read an awful lot that you may well lose."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1479.03,1483.066,"Well, I would -- I would -- I would say this -- this, Your Honor."
2014.13-1010,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1529.778,1530.395,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1010,0,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1530.395,1531.13,Thank you.
2014.13-1010,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1531.13,1539.251,Ms. Clark?
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,1539.251,1542.019,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1010,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1563.784,1566.736,Isn't that what Justice Scalia believes?
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,1579.211,1581.396,"--That's music to my ears, Your Honor."
2014.13-1010,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1581.396,1602.326,"Well, it may be music, but -- it Yard-Man says that retiree healthcare benefits are not subject to the stricture of ordinary contract interpretation and -- I mean, that's what Yard-Man says, and so I think you would have to vacate if we're going to say apply the normal principles of contract interpretation."
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,1602.326,1604.761,I have two answers to that.
2014.13-1010,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1692.986,1701.09,"Well, I know you're saying that you win without YardMan, but -- but it still seemed to mean something to the Sixth Circuit."
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,1712.565,1719.987,"And, Your Honor, that was where I was getting to the second piece of my argument -- the second piece of my answer to your question."
2014.13-1010,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1745.286,1766.365,"Now, the only point of this that I'm unsure of is that almost all of the other circuits require either a clear statement of vesting or at least words clearly susceptible to vesting."
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,1774.721,1779.009,"Number one well, number two."
2014.13-1010,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1782.561,1784.913,"--I'm saying what other -- I think other courts have done this, correct?"
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,1787.798,1790.483,Some may.
2014.13-1010,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1846.817,1853.405,Is that -- is that the Second and Seventh -- are you saying essentially you agree with the position of the Second and Seventh Circuits?
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,1853.405,1864.196,"--The Second Circuit, Justice Ginsburg, in the opinion in Joyce v. Curtiss-Wright, articulated that precise standard."
2014.13-1010,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1884.609,1897.267,"Is it a traditional principle of contract interpretation that if you're dealing with something as big a deal as health benefits for life, you might expect that to be addressed -- addressed more specifically?"
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,1897.267,1901.304,"Mr. Chief Justice, no."
2014.13-1010,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1929.721,1940.946,You want us to write an opinion saying that whether or not health care benefits survive in a collective bargaining agreement is not a big deal?
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,1940.946,1943.481,"No, Justice Kennedy, that's not what I'm saying."
2014.13-1010,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1943.481,1945.75,"Well, then I'm thinking -- I don't understand your answer to the question--"
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,1945.75,1946.25,I'm simply--
2014.13-1010,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1946.25,1946.933,--posed by the Chief Justice.
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,1946.933,1953.67,--I am saying that there are many contract issues that come before the courts that are a big deal.
2014.13-1010,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1975.786,1979.504,But that's exactly contrary to what your argument instructs.
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,1979.504,1983.54,"Justice Kennedy, I think not."
2014.13-1010,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2135.604,2146.828,"That's the general principle of what custom or practice in the industry or something like that, which I guess I guess that's an ordinary principle of contract interpretation that could be applied."
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2146.828,2156.6,"--Mr. Chief Justice, it certainly is one of the principles that this Court has said must be considered in the case of all collective bargaining agreements."
2014.13-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.492,2171.71,Is there a practice on this -- on this subject?
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2171.71,2176.764,"Yes, there is evidence of a practice on this subject, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.838,2190.757,"Okay, I'm not talking -- I'm talking--"
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2190.757,2191.173,--Okay.
2014.13-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.173,2192.257,--about in the industry.
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2192.257,2192.792,Okay.
2014.13-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2228.215,2231.667,"Yeah, but Sixth Circuit we can't rely on because of YardMan."
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2231.667,2243.575,"--Well, Your Honor, I would say, number one, that those two provisions combined certainly do say a lot about the duration of the promise that the employer was making."
2014.13-1010,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2261.37,2280.265,"This may be an unfair question, but following up on what Justice Scalia is getting at, I don't know how many others of those rubber companies are requiring contributions of active employees that are different than the contributions of retired employees."
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2282.617,2285.235,"I do not, and it's certainly not in this record."
2014.13-1010,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2287.521,2288.904,Please.
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2288.904,2304.547,"--The second point of practice that I want to point out is this: The 1997 collective bargaining agreement omitted all reference to retiree health benefits for people who had retired before January 1, 1996."
2014.13-1010,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2355.731,2366.287,"And is it right that Petitioners' original arguments were not that they didn't have to pay these at all, but only that these benefits were capped at a certain level; is that right?"
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2366.287,2367.039,That is correct.
2014.13-1010,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2407.448,2409.55,I'll give you a question about retirees.
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2421.774,2422.96,--They are not.
2014.13-1010,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2422.96,2423.76,They are not.
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2426.162,2439.569,"Generally, that is true because they are not members of the bargaining unit once they retire, and only members of the bargaining unit are represented in bargaining or have any right to vote on the ratification of an agreement."
2014.13-1010,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2439.569,2451.227,"And do they -- does the union represent them in any other disputes they may have as retirees with -- because generally, the union represents employees, active employees?"
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2451.227,2452.027,"Yes, it does."
2014.13-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2471.723,2483.014,"So -- so in a way, you would expect the union to give this away so -- so it can get higher benefits for the people that are still in its bargaining unit, wouldn't you?"
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2483.014,2484.331,That is one of the concerns.
2014.13-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2484.331,2484.814,"Well, that's a cynical--"
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2484.814,2485.416,No.
2014.13-1010,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2494.872,2495.155,"--Right, right."
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2495.155,2510.798,"And -- and, in fact, you know, to -- to be clear, there are agreements in which the union and the employer agree in advance that the retirees will have these benefits until and unless the union and the employer bargain something else."
2014.13-1010,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2607.811,2625.422,"Is -- is one of -- is one of the ingredients that goes into this mix the background rule that I -- I thought your friend would bring up, and that is it is the normal rule in contract interpretation that when the contract expires, so do its terms."
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2633.628,2634.962,This Court addressed that in Litton.
2014.13-1010,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2649.553,2652.84,"Well, what about the arbitration context of Litton?"
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2667.699,2676.722,"Certainly, to the extent that Litton says we're going to presume that the arbitration promise continues, that does not apply here."
2014.13-1010,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2738.88,2740.396,"So is this the language you're referring to,"
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2749.668,2753.205,That is one of the passages that we're referring to.
2014.13-1010,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2773.953,2779.105,Go back to something that you said earlier that I wasn't sure I understood from reading the briefs.
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2786.26,2787.676,That's close.
2014.13-1010,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2844.047,2847.501,And did these contracts arise before or after YardMan?
2014.13-1010,1,29637,julia_p_clark,,2847.501,2853.153,--These -- the initial contracts were pre-Yard-Man.
2014.13-1010,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2966.259,2967.694,"Thank you, Ms. Clark."
2014.13-1010,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2970.563,2972.546,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-1010,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3040.823,3042.675,I'm not sure that's true.
2014.13-1010,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,3044.611,3046.544,Respectfully--
2014.13-1010,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3046.544,3051.529,--The language of vesting has to be reasonably susceptible from something in the contract.
2014.13-1010,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,3051.529,3052.698,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-1010,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3062.904,3065.356,But the contract as a whole.
2014.13-1010,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,3065.356,3078.096,"In other words, a full company contribution toward healthcare benefits, when read in conjunction with the contract's expiration clause, it says for the duration of this agreement."
2014.13-1010,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3078.096,3079.098,How about the spouses?
2014.13-1010,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,3079.098,3089.654,"We believe that those those provisions indicate when the benefits would would would cease; in other words, until death, until remarriage."
2014.13-1010,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3105.331,3108.366,Are you saying it does continue as to the spouse?
2014.13-1010,2,56044,allyson_n_ho,,3110.951,3111.653,"No, Your Honor."
2014.13-1010,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3149.274,3150.624,"Thank you, counsel."
