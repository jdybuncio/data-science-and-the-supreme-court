1987.85-1910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.939,"We'll hear argument next in No. 85-1910, Business Electronics Corporation versus Sharp Electronics Corporation."
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,13.641,16.759,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.85-1910,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,171.509,173.378,That depends on what you mean.
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,190.137,202.029,"It was established here, Your Honor, that the terminated dealer was continually discounting and it was established that the non-terminated dealer wanted to avoid that discounting."
1987.85-1910,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,202.029,204.064,But sometimes discounted himself.
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,208.266,211.717,"There is evidence that he sometimes discounted himself, Your Honor, but--"
1987.85-1910,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,211.717,226.06,"So you really can't say for sure that by terminating the other one for discounting, what you were establishing is in effect the manufacturer's suggested retail price, or at least we don't know that for certain."
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,226.06,238.737,"--What we can say for certain is that a price cutter, a firm that was clearly charging lower than the manufacturer's suggested resale prices was taken out of the marketplace in order to get rid of that price cutting."
1987.85-1910,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.676,267.387,"Well, Mr. McGowan, why couldn't an agreement to eliminate a price cutter reflect an agreement to maintain the conditions necessary for the continuation of some presale promotional practices, instead?"
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,267.387,278.093,"Well, Your Honor, that contention was raised in this case, and the so-called free riding concern, promotion services."
1987.85-1910,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,291.502,300.774,"Well, the facts may show that, but it would seem to me that it speaks to whether there should be the application of a per se rule, or not."
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,300.774,317.736,"Well, the free riding rationale would in effect as used here, Your Honor, as a thinly distinguished attack on the per se rule in general, the same free rider arguments are made with respect to the per se rule itself."
1987.85-1910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,349.922,356.545,"Well, I don't think you've, at least not to my satisfaction, completely answered Justice O'Connor's question."
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,371.287,374.572,"It depends on what you mean by free rider, Your Honor."
1987.85-1910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,387.964,394.82,"But why must we look for the least restrictive alternative in a statutory case, and it's not a First Amendment case--"
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,394.82,403.14,Because free riding is a ready label which can always be used to excuse what amounts to a conspiracy to eliminate price cutting.
1987.85-1910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.68,449.555,"--Then your argument is not how much that it doesn't deserve consideration and evaluation of the legal principles, but just that whatever consideration it should get shouldn't apply here because this really wasn't a case of free riding?"
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,449.555,462.964,"--This wasn't really a case of free riding, and as to vertical price restraints as opposed to non-price restraints, free riding should not be a rationale for undermining the per se rule itself."
1987.85-1910,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.903,472.953,But why not?
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,472.953,482.961,"If you look in the literature, Your Honor, on the subject of free riding, you can look high and low in that literature, and there is almost no empirical basis for it."
1987.85-1910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.518,509.861,"You know, some of us... I dare say all of us... have had some experience of going to some very full line dealer and you know, getting the stuff demonstrated and that sort of thing, and then you go to some discount house and buy it there."
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,509.861,517.782,"--Your Honor, another problem with free riding is that it prevents consumers from exercising their freedom of choice."
1987.85-1910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.243,546.95,"Well, doesn't the manufacturer have an interest in protecting, to a certain extent, dealers that do provide full service and provide advertising and that sort of thing?"
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,546.95,562.127,"The manufacturer can achieve that interest through contractually requiring those dealers to provide a minimum level of service, to provide a minimum number of salesmen, to provide a minimum showroom floor, and he can terminate those dealers for refusing to comply with those contractual requirements."
1987.85-1910,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.146,600.335,"It isn't the respondents who are urging a broad rule, a prophylactic rule, if you will, it's you."
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,623.535,634.925,"Your Honor, the rationale for the per se rule is based on a judgment that certain practices are likely to be predominantly anticompetitive."
1987.85-1910,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.922,699.949,"Why would the manufacturer want to cause his products to be sold at a higher price, unless he had something to gain such as better promotion and all of these other things that eliminate the free rider prospect?"
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,699.949,701.883,"For at least two reasons, Your Honor."
1987.85-1910,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,751.531,754.266,I have the impression you expected that question.
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,754.266,755.602,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.85-1910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,841.872,843.691,"Where are you reading from, Mr. McGowan?"
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,843.691,846.91,--I'm reading now from page 37 of the Petitioner's Brief.
1987.85-1910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,879.381,881.583,This was a sense of Congress resolution?
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,881.583,882.466,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.85-1910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,905.782,926.628,"Just what weight ought this Court to give I mean, this isn't the Congress that enacted the Sherman Act, or enacted the Clayton Act or any of the basic Acts upon which you know, the various per se rules have been based."
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,926.628,945.359,"Your Honor, in Sylvania in distinguishing price from non-price restraints, and in reaffirming the application of the per se rule to price restraints, Justice Powell took pains to note that among other things, Congress had expressly approved the per se rule repeatedly over the years."
1987.85-1910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,955.631,959.183,And was he referring to sense of Congress resolutions such as this one?
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,959.183,973.176,"--He was referring to repeal of the Miller-Tydings Act, he was referring to Congress as in the Square D case, Congress having enacted legislation in the antitrust field without being aware of the per se rule, without altering the per se rule, for example."
1987.85-1910,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1087.468,1094.872,"Mr. McGowan, what do you expect a manufacturer to do when he's confronted with this situation."
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1124.474,1135.449,"The manufacturer can say we cannot agree to terminate this man because of his discounting, and I'm not going to terminate him just because you don't like his discounting."
1987.85-1910,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.177,1161.349,"And I have to police those and only if he violates them and I can prove in a lawsuit that he's violated them, can I get out of it."
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1163.582,1164.134,"Well,--"
1987.85-1910,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.134,1167.253,That's a rather expensive way to get rid of a distributor.
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1167.253,1172.288,--But the manufacturer is always free to unilaterally terminate a distributor.
1987.85-1910,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.081,1250.924,"Mr. McGowan, is there any evidence in this case that the manufacturer, Sharp, did request your client to add additional salesmen or additional services or anything else as a condition of retaining his dealership?"
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1250.924,1259.096,There is no evidence that they complained to him about failure to provide requisite number of services.
1987.85-1910,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1287.747,1291.067,Is the dealership agreement in the record?
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1298.555,1310.195,"There is no dealership agreement in the record for Hartwell, I don't believe, and I don't think there's a dealership agreement in the record for Business Electronics, either."
1987.85-1910,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.314,1321.503,"Well, does the record show whether Hartwell had all these additional services because he thought it was a good way to run his business, or because Sharp required it?"
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1321.503,1336.93,"--The record shows as a matter of fact, Your Honor, that Sharp never went to Hartwell before the termination and said, we're glad you're providing these services, or you should be providing these services, or Hartwell said, I can't provide these services."
1987.85-1910,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1358.276,1362.747,"Did Hartwell handle other products, too?"
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1365.032,1365.965,It was not his only line.
1987.85-1910,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.564,1391.432,And what percent of his total business was this line?
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1394.568,1399.17,I would say I don't believe there was evidence as to what percentage it was.
1987.85-1910,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1399.17,1400.705,And what about your client?
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1403.074,1405.99,"This was the only product my client carried, Sharp calculators."
1987.85-1910,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1442.246,1467.646,"What would be the rule if a dealer came to his supplier and said, this fellow's too close to me, I want a bigger area, or I can make more money if you'll eliminate that competitor of mine across town."
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1474.767,1477.086,"The rule of reason would apply there, Your Honor."
1987.85-1910,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1477.086,1480.204,You can conspire to eliminate a competitor?
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1480.204,1482.74,"Well, subject to the rule of reason."
1987.85-1910,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.74,1483.69,Yes.
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1485.275,1486.042,Not per se.
1987.85-1910,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.166,1501.118,"Well, I know, but it's aimed at stopping competition."
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1501.118,1504.569,"It is aimed at stopping competition, but--"
1987.85-1910,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1504.569,1508.89,And it's aimed at giving the favorite dealer more business.
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1508.89,1510.89,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.85-1910,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.89,1512.459,So is the price cutting conspiracy.
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1512.459,1514.127,"That's correct, Your Honor, but--"
1987.85-1910,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1514.127,1518.663,"Same result economically, isn't it?"
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1518.663,1520.698,"--Not quite, Your Honor, because--"
1987.85-1910,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.698,1532.339,"Well, in this case, he's complaining because the fellow's cutting price and taking a lot of business, right?"
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1532.339,1533.473,--Yes.
1987.85-1910,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1576.868,1587.889,"Well, if it would have an adverse effect on interbrand competition, you have to assume a pretty stupid manufacturer, since I assume he's getting the same amount from the distributor, no matter how much the distributor sells."
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1595.329,1597.281,"I'm not sure I understand your question, Your Honor."
1987.85-1910,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.093,1632.787,"This assumes that he can get a different amount from the distributor, but there's no indication in this case, nor do I think it's normal, that you charge the distributor a certain percentage of what he sells it for."
1987.85-1910,0,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,1632.787,1640.774,"I think it is common, Your Honor, for manufacturers' wholesale prices to rise and fall with retail prices."
1987.85-1910,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1693.057,1694.824,"Thank you, Mr. McGowan."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,1696.774,1707.399,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1845.288,1853.709,"Mr. Tyler, I wonder if that's fair to your opponent's case, because he's not saying terminations are always bad."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,1860.363,1863.149,"We may have a difficulty there, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1897.072,1901.857,"Yes, I know, but it would be quite a different case if there'd been no ultimatum and no agreement."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,1901.857,1902.559,"No, no."
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1995.402,2000.39,Isn't that exactly what the Judge instructed the jury?
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2002.456,2004.858,"Respectfully, Justice Stevens, I don't agree."
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.079,2090.714,"Well, as I read the charge, the Judge did distinguish between an agreement and a unilateral termination."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2100.755,2101.738,"Well, then I'd be in a little trouble."
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2101.738,2102.957,"Well, why isn't that the same case?"
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2107.409,2118.733,"Because in the cases such as Sylvania and Monsanto, as I read them, this Court has recognized that you have to be a little less wooden than that."
1987.85-1910,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2396.031,2402.602,"Mr. Tyler, the Fifth Circuit majority sent this case back for a new trial to a properly instructed jury, didn't they?"
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2402.602,2403.268,Exactly.
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2572.814,2606.801,"Mr. Tyler, your Bloomingdales example makes me wonder with respect to this particular case, if you say that the plaintiff is the fire sale store, he's always got fire sale signs up and the surviving dealer, that Hartwell, is the one the Bloomingdales in the pattern, and that Bloomingdales said, we want to have no more fire sales, and if you terminate him, we won't necessarily agree to sell at your suggested price, but we at least won't do this fire sale business, we won't cut 30, 40 percent off the list price."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2611.855,2615.974,"--If I heard you rightly, Justice Stevens, you threw in a number of parties."
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2617.426,2618.576,"No, just three parties."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2631.852,2632.252,Right.
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2632.252,2647.862,"Now, if the real discounter is terminated pursuant to an agreement with Bloomingdales in this case, and the agreement is well, you don't have to sell at list, but you certainly are not going to behave like this other fellow did and have fire sales all the time."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2648.612,2649.564,Yes.
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2715.839,2721.076,I'm just wondering what the Fifth Circuit requires the plaintiff to prove on the retrial.
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2730.349,2745.442,"Forgive me, sir, I'm betraying my past and where I was a professional jury watcher for many years, but from a jury's point of view, or a fact finder's point of view, we can almost forecast what's going to happen."
1987.85-1910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2808.468,2818.49,"Would it be enough, Mr. Tyler, if it were just understood that look, the reason I'm terminating B.E. is because they were charging too little."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2826.845,2829.547,That's getting close to the line.
1987.85-1910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.547,2833.166,"Well, you see, I understand the Government's position very well."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2839.153,2843.772,"You've confused me, excuse me, Justice Scalia."
1987.85-1910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2847.259,2848.509,"--Right, right."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2857.382,2858.365,"No, no, no."
1987.85-1910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2861.484,2862.917,--I hope not.
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2862.917,2884.73,"All we're arguing here is look, what happened below was the judge said flatly, look, Section 1 lays it down as a matter of law that all this plaintiff, petitioner here, has to prove is, one, he was terminated."
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2891.753,2898.423,"No, that isn't what he said, not that there was some talk about it, but rather he was terminated pursuant to an agreement."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2902.275,2903.811,"Yes, but that's, if I may say so--"
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2903.811,2906.513,"Maybe you say that's a lot of nonsense, but that's what the jury found."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2906.513,2907.963,--It is a lot of nonsense in this sense.
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2907.963,2913.0,You suggest there's no distinction between unilateral action and conspiratorial action.
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2913.0,2913.417,"No, no."
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2913.417,2917.571,"Which is exactly what the Judge, that was what the Judge asked the jury to decide."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2917.571,2928.192,"The trouble with this is, once you've used labels like, conspiracy and agreement, they can be freighted with more meaning than the law or common sense should allow."
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2928.192,2929.711,Congress picked the words.
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2929.711,2937.532,"I don't mind saying to you, Justice Stevens, that there was an agreement in a sense here."
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2997.356,2999.539,"Yes, Mr. Tyler, but--"
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,2999.539,3005.093,"Therefore, I don't understand this play on words, of agreement or not agreement or ultimatum or not ultimatum."
1987.85-1910,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3005.093,3016.234,--Because it's settled as a matter of jury determination that there was an agreement between the surviving dealer and the manufacturer to have it cause the termination of the plaintiff.
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3048.371,3050.99,I don't think there's any real difference between us.
1987.85-1910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3087.096,3090.032,You've been telling us that that can exist.
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3107.327,3107.994,"--No, no."
1987.85-1910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3107.994,3116.1,It can't even be part of his understanding that the non-terminated dealer will at least charge more than the discounter was charging.
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3117.166,3120.068,"Well, I'm sorry."
1987.85-1910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3185.51,3187.946,Let me be clear what your position is.
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3223.452,3225.487,"Now, that raises another problem."
1987.85-1910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3225.487,3229.939,"Well, is that the instruction you want, or isn't it?"
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3229.939,3230.406,No.
1987.85-1910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3274.385,3279.206,"Is the minimal assurance that I just gave you, would that be enough?"
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3296.85,3298.702,"Well,--"
1987.85-1910,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3298.702,3305.356,"You can answer that question, yes, or no, can't you, Mr. Tyler."
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3305.356,3310.51,"--If you're asking the point or raising the point again which we don't like, let me take it this way."
1987.85-1910,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3368.53,3370.132,We agree it can't be inferred.
1987.85-1910,1,28273,harold_r_tyler_jr,,3394.497,3399.234,"--I'd prefer to phrase it a little better, if I may say so, but I'll accept it."
1987.85-1910,2,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,3420.664,3427.134,I think we first of all need to be clear on the full instructions given by Judge Seals below.
1987.85-1910,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3495.695,3499.849,"Mr. McGowan, can I ask you the question Justice Scalia and I were asking your opponent."
1987.85-1910,2,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,3517.978,3519.561,The latter is the way I understand it.
1987.85-1910,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3521.263,3521.73,That's funny.
1987.85-1910,2,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,3524.832,3530.786,"--I will confess to you that the terms, agreement on price at some level, has always mystified me, exactly what it means."
1987.85-1910,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3548.413,3550.299,But it's really a different question.
1987.85-1910,2,25795,gary_v_mcgowan,,3567.994,3589.907,"But if the jury is instructed that in order to find a conspiracy, they have to find a mutual purpose to achieve an unlawful objective, and the jury finds that there was a mutual purpose, a conspiracy to eliminate price cutting, that is a purpose shared by both the supplier and the dealer, and the evidence supports that finding, then it has to be a form of vertical price fixing."
1987.85-1910,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3602.917,3605.1,"Thank you, Mr. McGowan."
