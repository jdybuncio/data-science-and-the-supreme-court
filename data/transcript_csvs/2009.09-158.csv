2009.09-158,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.118,"We will hear argument next in Case 09-158, Magwood v. Patterson."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,5.987,8.637,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.09-158,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,74.798,82.368,"2244 doesn't make any reference to judgment, 2244(b)."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,157.766,163.42,"But, Justice Alito, let me make clear how we get to incorporating judgment and then answer your question."
2009.09-158,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,175.145,175.812,I understand that.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,175.812,177.014,--defines it as
2009.09-158,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,217.889,228.779,"Well, if a -- if someone has a -- a judgment of conviction, but is no longer in custody, that -- that person cannot bring habeas petition, isn't that right?"
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,228.779,229.412,--That's right.
2009.09-158,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,229.412,236.683,So it -- it is the judgment pursuant to which the person then is held in custody to which the habeas petition goes.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,236.683,237.468,That's right.
2009.09-158,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,281.061,289.317,"What if the sentence is -- he is convicted, sentenced to 10 years, and raises an argument, and only an argument, that cuts off 2 years of his sentence."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,316.051,333.763,"--Well, I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice, that that question could actually arise in a section 2254 case, where the only thing a Federal court has power to do is to declare one way or the other whether the sentence is constitutional or not and then leave it to the State to decide in further proceedings how to -- how to go forward."
2009.09-158,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,355.025,355.959,"Well, I don't want to belabor--"
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,355.959,356.592,If he's challenging--
2009.09-158,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,356.592,372.352,"--I don't want to belabor this point, but once you get beyond the formal argument that you just look to whether it's a new judgment -- if you -- if you take a step beyond that, and if you -- if you don't take a step beyond that, then footnote 8 is wrong."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,389.064,391.014,"--No, Justice Alito."
2009.09-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.172,406.672,Excuse me.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,414.009,414.542,--Correct.
2009.09-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,414.542,418.163,"And that -- even if you divide it, that judgment hasn't changed."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,418.163,419.796,"Well, certainly it has--"
2009.09-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.796,428.418,"He is still -- even -- his sentence has been altered and it's sent back for resentencing, but he is still being held in custody under the same judgment."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,428.418,434.155,"--He is being held in custody until he is executed, certainly, under his conviction."
2009.09-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.445,443.211,That's true.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,443.828,452.867,"--So I think the death sentence here is most easily thought of as the terms of the custody, which is a separate thing that he challenged and won on the first time and is challenging again now."
2009.09-158,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,452.867,453.486,"Well, I -- I'm not sure."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,472.845,481.301,"Well, I think that because -- what we're we are really talking about here when we talk about death eligibility is the need to find an aggravating circumstance."
2009.09-158,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,492.509,495.477,That followed from the first conviction.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,495.477,513.005,"--The first conviction enabled him -- if we put aside for the moment our substantive fight over whether or not the crime itself constitutes an aggravating circumstance, but the conviction itself carries a life sentence unless an aggravating circumstance is found."
2009.09-158,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,550.527,551.211,Mr. Fisher--
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,551.211,551.861,And so--
2009.09-158,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,551.861,567.221,--you -- you say -- you present this argument that it is a second petition and you say that's the only issue before us and there is no other way that the new proceeding would be cut off under AEDPA.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,618.421,623.408,"--Because that order was entered in one case, and now we have an entirely different case, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.09-158,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.379,632.764,"Yes, but what he's bringing up now was a conceivable claim that he could have brought up then."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,632.764,637.584,"Well, it's not -- it was not claim he could have brought, and this is an important point, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.09-158,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,647.923,648.875,But the issue is the same.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,662.199,663.066,--That's right.
2009.09-158,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,668.284,677.04,So why doesn't preclusion result from the court's order that says: Bring up all conceivable claims?
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,677.04,681.943,Because you can't waive something by failing to raise it in a different case.
2009.09-158,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,684.895,699.386,"Then -- then you get to -- you get to Justice Alito's question, because in fact what we have here is we have piece of paper issued in 1981, and on that piece of paper it says: You, Billy Joe Magwood, are guilty and sentenced to death by electrocution."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,756.492,762.911,--So let me answer that in practical terms and then get back to Justice Alito by giving a -- giving statutory hook for it.
2009.09-158,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,779.187,781.27,It is something new in respect to the sentence.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,781.27,782.053,Pardon me?
2009.09-158,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,782.053,783.955,It is something new in respect to the sentence.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,783.955,785.256,"It is new because of the brandnew sentence, Your Honor."
2009.09-158,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,785.256,785.656,Ah !
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,788.292,788.825,"Well, it's--"
2009.09-158,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,788.825,789.492,All that happened--
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,789.492,790.192,--they imposed--
2009.09-158,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.192,791.927,--is the sentence was reimposed.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,806.587,807.704,"--No, it doesn't."
2009.09-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.77,857.32,--Excuse me.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,885.086,887.538,"--With all due respect, I think Lawlor does apply."
2009.09-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,908.452,910.136,Not the identical thing.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,916.039,916.472,Fair enough.
2009.09-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.395,926.247,The same act of his.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,929.782,930.982,"But remember, the act--"
2009.09-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,930.982,932.317,It's the very same act.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,932.317,934.501,--But all we are talking about here is not the same act.
2009.09-158,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,942.44,949.862,"Well, I -- I -- I want you to get -- on the assessment of the evidence, I just want to ask -- I probably should know this, and you can get back to Justice Alito's question as well."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,964.122,965.855,"--Well, the trial judge--"
2009.09-158,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,965.855,967.24,"Is there new witnesses, et cetera?"
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,967.24,971.025,"--As it turns out, the parties did not put new witnesses on the stand."
2009.09-158,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,979.048,979.514,But then it's--
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,979.514,980.248,They had every right--
2009.09-158,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,980.248,984.683,--not clear to me why death eligibility wasn't a part of the first conviction.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,984.683,989.254,--Because death eligibility hinges on the finding of an aggravating circumstance.
2009.09-158,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1066.653,1070.271,"Mr. Fisher -- Mr. Fisher, to get -- I get your"
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1139.165,1141.617,"Justice Ginsburg, I'm going to tell you two things."
2009.09-158,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1268.8,1278.656,"Well, how -- how does the State's definition at page 17 of the red brief not comport with the whole idea of second or successive?"
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1278.656,1287.31,--Because the only way to get the idea of second or successive into the State's definition is where it says prior habeas petition.
2009.09-158,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1317.995,1321.114,"No, but that's not -- that's not something that could have been or was raised."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1321.114,1321.914,"That's right, Justice Kennedy."
2009.09-158,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1329.22,1332.671,But that's an issue that we look at all the time under AEDPA.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1347.514,1349.031,"--I disagree, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.09-158,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1358.72,1363.522,"It's an -- I thought your point -- I thought your point was, oh, this is going to be hard to do, impossible, as you say."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1363.522,1365.807,"Well, I can tell you lots of reasons why that would be the case."
2009.09-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.159,1367.626,"Well, wait."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1384.954,1385.587,The word--
2009.09-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.587,1388.072,Why doesn't that fit -- fit the statutory language?
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1388.072,1392.124,"--Because the word the statute used, Justice Scalia, is ""claim"", not issue."
2009.09-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1394.06,1394.826,It doesn't use--
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1394.826,1395.626,"Lawlor tells you that, and res judicata."
2009.09-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1395.626,1399.464,"--it doesn't use ""judgment"", either, and -- and -- and you are -- you are dragging in judgment as the -- as the--"
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1399.464,1404.916,"Well, it refers to section 2254, and section 2254 uses the word ""judgment"", so it's our belief it is by incorporation."
2009.09-158,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.204,1415.621,--Okay.
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1425.393,1428.179,"But, Justice Scalia, this is not the second time this claim could have been presented."
2009.09-158,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1484.349,1489.253,"It seems to me -- it seems to me those are the exact same problems that would arise, do arise, under AEDPA."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1493.205,1497.323,"But that's not the State's rule, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.09-158,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1589.749,1591.066,"Well, if it's the second -- I see your light's on."
2009.09-158,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1594.986,1597.819,"Well, it -- well, it shouldn't be barred."
2009.09-158,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1658.926,1660.009,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
2009.09-158,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1670.134,1673.002,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.09-158,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1809.466,1812.97,"No, I think what you would have to do -- it's a dilemma here."
2009.09-158,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1812.97,1813.47,Right.
2009.09-158,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1813.47,1820.124,"What you would have to say to follow his approach, is you would say: Judge, here is what you would do."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,1849.81,1850.276,--Right.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1850.276,1858.098,"--or left open or told the lower court: Do this over; to that extent, it is a new judgment."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,1860.867,1863.25,And you just answered Justice Kennedy's question.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.595,1880.795,Wait.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,1899.987,1900.806,--Right.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1900.806,1903.507,Insofar as that habeas didn't tinker with it.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,1924.969,1926.486,Because it's one of two things.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.15,2030.571,"This argument -- I am making it up, but I mean, he doesn't have to apply these arguments -- but it seems to me that the argument against this is: What you are proposing is too complicated."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2044.748,2045.248,Right.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.248,2046.998,"Not look into the reasons for it, et cetera."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2051.502,2052.085,Right.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.085,2056.723,"And -- and, you know, you have this new witness but not that new witness, et cetera."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2071.046,2075.348,"There is a simple answer to why the Federal courts can deal with this, and we know they can deal with it."
2009.09-158,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2224.905,2229.626,"And Mr. Fisher uses the word ""claim"" as -- differently."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2229.626,2230.309,--Yes.
2009.09-158,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2230.309,2234.677,"He makes a distinction between ""issue"" and ""claim""."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2244.716,2247.901,"I have two answers to that, if I can, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.09-158,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.378,2330.804,"What -- what would happen if it had been sent back on this ground, but there was another ground that he had appealed on which the Court never reached?"
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2330.804,2331.304,--Right.
2009.09-158,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2331.304,2332.104,Okay.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2335.256,2335.806,Yes.
2009.09-158,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2354.017,2356.969,"I think you are right, but McCleskey was pre-AEDPA."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2356.969,2357.602,It was.
2009.09-158,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2357.602,2360.337,What was the answer under AEDPA to Justice Scalia's problem?
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2360.337,2366.658,"I think it's the same, and the reason I say that because in Slack, you had a first petition that raised an exhausted claim."
2009.09-158,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2377.633,2380.585,But we just found that to be successive under the words of the statute?
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2380.585,2381.168,Right.
2009.09-158,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2406.016,2410.937,I thought your answer to Justice Scalia's point: Suppose it was raised but the Court didn't decide it.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2410.937,2411.404,--Right.
2009.09-158,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2411.404,2425.279,"Your test, I take it, is that he must have one full and fair opportunity to litigate the question; that means to raise it, to have it aired, and to have it decided."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2425.279,2425.929,Absolutely.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2439.623,2444.675,"That's what they raised -- your view is a simple rule, no matter how many judgments there are."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2444.675,2445.208,Right.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2445.208,2451.079,"If this claim could have been raised and would have been fully adjudicated had it been, it's barred."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2451.079,2451.681,Yes.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2451.681,2461.87,"But if either it couldn't have been raised, or if it could have been raised and wouldn't have been fully adjudicated or was not fully adjudicated, not barred."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2461.87,2463.12,"Yes, that's it."
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2465.386,2465.803,And applied to everything.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2467.821,2480.129,"--What this Court has done since AEDPA came out on two different occasions, has said the second or successive petition is a term of art, which would give substance in our previous habeas corpus cases, the abuse of the writ doctrine cases."
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2493.32,2494.053,One judgment.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2511.279,2513.798,Can you repeat?
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2514.848,2517.767,It -- it's there in the case.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2517.767,2518.285,Okay.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2518.952,2519.802,It's one judgment.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2519.802,2520.419,Okay.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2520.419,2522.587,He makes five claims.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2522.587,2523.354,Right.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2523.354,2529.591,"The district court doesn't decide, for some reason, I don't know, number 3 or 4."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2535.661,2536.127,Okay.
2009.09-158,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2538.21,2540.329,"Well, now, just to follow up: It's very realistic."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2548.101,2548.551,Right.
2009.09-158,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2549.368,2550.118,Yes.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2558.041,2558.474,"Yes, that's right."
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2561.659,2568.599,"Full -- see, he filed his petition -- this would get rid of -- I think there are -- I am worried about that there are cases out there that say the opposite."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2578.637,2579.037,--Right.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2579.037,2583.441,"Or if he couldn't have raised it, it doesn't matter if there was one judgment forever."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2593.797,2596.582,That seems to be what the Court said in Martinez-Villareal.
2009.09-158,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.582,2598.868,"Well, he'd have to bring them all in petition, too."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2606.755,2607.14,Right.
2009.09-158,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2684.372,2685.122,--It's not the whole case.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2688.24,2688.94,--Right.
2009.09-158,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2688.94,2690.74,It's just the sentencing aspect.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2690.74,2696.578,"As the point we have been making with Justice Alito, I just don't see where he can make that distinction between conviction and sentence."
2009.09-158,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2720.759,2721.292,I'm sorry.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2731.9,2739.304,"--No, Justice Sotomayor, and the reason is collateral estoppel is a res judicata principle that doesn't apply to Federal habeas proceedings."
2009.09-158,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2746.41,2749.028,What -- what case do I read that supports that proposition?
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2749.028,2749.661,--Salinger.
2009.09-158,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2749.661,2755.265,I -- I had thought that law of the case issue preclusion would apply.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2755.265,2755.782,No.
2009.09-158,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2803.06,2811.047,"I guess if res judicata applied, you wouldn't bring habeas in the first place on an issue that was wrongly decided, right?"
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2814.499,2815.118,--Yes.
2009.09-158,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2815.751,2817.903,And so your -- your habeas claim would be barred.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2817.903,2818.436,Right.
2009.09-158,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2824.557,2829.878,"Well, the old -- the former rule of course, was that you could bring writ after writ after writ."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2829.878,2830.444,--Yes.
2009.09-158,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2830.444,2835.345,Was it -- was McCleskey the first time that that -- that that was foreclosed?
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2835.781,2836.264,No.
2009.09-158,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2836.264,2841.435,"That -- that just -- that just incorporated a whole body of law which was very much like issue preclusion, was it not?"
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2841.435,2841.785,Yes.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2861.178,2868.951,"What happens if in the first trial, the lawyer thinks, you know, I have two claims here; one is mediocre and one is great."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2881.241,2881.858,No.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2897.453,2898.903,So he better put in everything.
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2898.903,2899.42,Right.
2009.09-158,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2899.42,2904.29,"And if he puts in everything and they don't reach the other ones, he's okay, because he can raise it again."
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2904.29,2904.724,Right.
2009.09-158,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.178,2916.414,"Let me just ask, is this the cases in which the claim is he's ineligible for the death penalty?"
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2916.414,2918.033,The underlying claim itself.
2009.09-158,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2918.033,2920.316,And is that -- is that a meritorious claim?
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2920.316,2928.722,"The first -- the first answer is, the claim itself is that I have did I have fair notice in 1978 that I could get the death penalty?"
2009.09-158,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2945.701,2947.719,The merits of the claims have never been decided?
2009.09-158,3,19551,corey_l_maze,,2947.719,2951.855,--Not -- not by the State courts because it wasn't fairly presented to them.
2009.09-158,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2992.998,2994.081,"Thank you, Mr. Maze."
2009.09-158,4,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3000.437,3001.187,Thank you.
2009.09-158,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3040.125,3046.213,Can we go back to Justice -- to the Chief Justice's example to you at the very beginning of your argument?
2009.09-158,4,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3046.213,3047.029,--Pardon me?
2009.09-158,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3047.029,3049.565,To the Chief Justice's argument.
2009.09-158,4,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3049.565,3050.298,Yes.
2009.09-158,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3050.298,3055.552,"There is an order to resentence, to reduce a sentence from 10 to 8 years."
2009.09-158,4,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3100.248,3103.533,Probably not.
2009.09-158,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3177.181,3178.033,"Thank you, counsel."
