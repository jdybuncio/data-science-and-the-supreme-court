2003.02-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.024,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-626, the South Florida Water Management District v. the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,58.95,63.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-626,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,135.233,145.059,"The obvious question on your thing is you have one of these rivers that's so filthy that you can set fire to it, and next to it is the most pristine, beautiful trout lake ever."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,160.291,160.579,No.
2003.02-626,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,161.627,162.975,--I mean it doesn't require a permit.
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,162.975,166.978,It... it would not require a section 402 permit.
2003.02-626,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,173.089,176.555,"Well, as far as this statute is concerned, EPA, it wouldn't."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,178.579,178.95,--No.
2003.02-626,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,180.353,181.635,"--I mean, EPA through the permit."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,182.378,187.951,"Through the 402, but this... this is a complex statute with many, many layers of protections for the Nation's waters."
2003.02-626,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,187.951,188.694,And it would protect--
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,188.694,192.985,"To begin with, there is always a layer of State protection."
2003.02-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,229.272,232.654,--I... I suppose it's beyond the purview of this case.
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,239.053,241.821,"No, it does not."
2003.02-626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.639,299.172,"Mr. Bishop, the Eleventh Circuit said that moving water within a single, distinct body of water could never result in the addition of pollutants to that body of water."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,302.872,314.1,"--Well, I agree with that, but we and the United States go further here in arguing that the statute... what the statute prohibits is the addition of pollutants to navigable waters."
2003.02-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,337.317,350.592,"So in... in Justice Breyer's example, if the pristine trout pond is waters of the United States, then there would not be an addition of the pollutant to waters of the United States when the filthy river was pumped into the pond."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,350.592,351.252,--No.
2003.02-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,353.481,354.02,No.
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,358.106,360.457,"--It would not require a section 402 permit, Justice Souter."
2003.02-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.457,366.651,And... and it would not do so because it would not be the addition of a pollutant to waters of the United States.
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,366.651,367.039,That is right.
2003.02-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.039,369.456,"Assuming the river is navigable, the filthy river."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,370.116,372.678,Assuming that it's a navigable water under the Clean Water Act--
2003.02-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.678,372.85,Right.
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,372.85,376.682,--and that... which is a broader concept than waters that one can run--
2003.02-626,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,376.682,378.827,"Well, what I'm driving at here is... is the following."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,446.527,447.37,--Your premise--
2003.02-626,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,447.37,453.936,"So that's what I say moves me at the second for hypothetical purposes towards their side, but I'm asking you to move me back."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,453.936,456.165,"--Your premise is incorrect, Justice Breyer."
2003.02-626,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,514.698,518.042,"Mr. Bishop, can we see... take this concrete case?"
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,539.097,547.763,"Well, this has... this has been the focus of not only our attention but of the Corps and EPA's attention for a long time through the... the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project."
2003.02-626,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,579.964,580.336,Yes.
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,587.683,590.284,"--Well, my understanding is that it is seepage."
2003.02-626,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,591.481,592.884,You think that's the principal source?
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,595.196,596.311,--That is my... that is my understanding.
2003.02-626,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.252,605.599,But where does the water that the people in the western part of Broward County use to water their lawns and bathe and so... where does that water come from?
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,605.599,607.706,--From... from the aquifer.
2003.02-626,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.11,611.915,There's an aquifer to the east of the... of the levees?
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,611.915,619.817,--There is an aquifer that... an unconfined aquifer that is really indistinguishable from the surface water that underlies the levee.
2003.02-626,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,625.828,627.702,Are you telling me there's an aquifer to the east of the levee?
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,627.702,629.748,--To the east of the levees and to the... it's--
2003.02-626,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.748,637.816,Which is a separate source of water than the source that feeds the large... the WCA-3--
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,637.816,638.171,"--No, no."
2003.02-626,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,650.736,651.918,--But the seepage can't--
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,651.918,652.661,--There is other--
2003.02-626,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,652.661,655.261,--But the seepage can't contain any of the pollution--
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,655.261,655.683,--No.
2003.02-626,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,655.683,658.149,--because the water on the west side of the levee is... is clean.
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,658.149,660.296,"Well, it's not clean."
2003.02-626,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,664.465,666.528,"Well, it's certainly cleaner than the water on the east side or you wouldn't have a lawsuit."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,666.528,673.937,There is a substantial amount of water in the C-11 canal that comes from a... a wide array of sources within the basin.
2003.02-626,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,673.937,677.014,But the water... the seepage clearly is not what causes the problem.
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,677.014,686.385,"And that is... just to go back to Justice Ginsburg's question, one way that we are addressing the phosphorus here is with the Corps."
2003.02-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.471,708.842,Which... which means--
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,708.842,709.791,Those pumps are--
2003.02-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.791,717.221,"--Which means that the water to the east will be even more polluted and when you pump that back in, you'll be pumping more polluted water back in."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,717.221,726.387,"--And the solution to that problem is that with the Corps and the task force and the EPA, a number of huge storage basins are being built."
2003.02-626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,816.666,824.84,"This is all very important, but on the legal question that we have, do you take the position that it's a single body of water--"
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,824.84,826.037,--We take--
2003.02-626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,826.037,827.995,--and therefore no permit is required?
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,827.995,836.523,"--We take the position, first of all, that all of the navigable waters of the United States are unitary for purposes of determining whether they are--"
2003.02-626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,836.523,841.558,"That's an extreme position, and you probably have a fall-back position."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,841.558,842.301,--And the alternative--
2003.02-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.294,844.409,You... you go--
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,844.409,845.152,We do argue--
2003.02-626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,845.152,846.721,--What... what's the fall-back?
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,846.721,852.544,"--The fall-back is precisely the one that you have described, Justice O'Connor, which is that these were... these were unitary waters."
2003.02-626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,856.769,863.151,"Well, they have been altered by manmade structures so that they perhaps are no longer a single body."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,865.936,866.929,"Yes, I think the--"
2003.02-626,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,866.929,871.47,That the manmade structures have separated them and they're no longer unitary.
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,871.47,875.018,"--It... it did, but in doing that, it ignored a number of important considerations."
2003.02-626,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,880.674,883.086,Does the record describe that aquifer?
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,883.086,886.514,--The... yes.
2003.02-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.076,905.733,"While you're looking for that, I... I find it hard to understand how you can interpret... I can understand how you can interpret the phrase, navigable waters, to mean all navigable waters."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,921.624,926.082,"No, I agree, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.082,930.829,"Which is... which is why you took the extreme position, that is really textually not very extreme at all."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,930.829,931.3,No.
2003.02-626,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,947.836,948.95,"Mr. Bishop, as I--"
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,948.95,949.572,--the concept of an addition--
2003.02-626,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,949.572,954.318,"--as I understand, that was the Government's brief and it was spelled out very clearly."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,962.697,965.752,"--Well, we think that there is more to it than just the term, navigable water."
2003.02-626,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,972.728,988.786,"Mr. Bishop, isn't the problem with the unitary concept idea that given the purposes of the Clean Water Act, it makes great sense if there is a way of distinguishing between bodies of water to distinguish them in terms of their... their pollution?"
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1015.618,1017.681,The act does distinguish.
2003.02-626,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1027.424,1034.211,Are... are you talking about a... a distinction based on the... the quality of the water as polluted or clean or relatively polluted/relatively clean?
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1034.211,1051.74,"The statute specifies that water quality standards which identify what the goal is for the level of pollutants in the water and the TMDL's, the total maximum daily loads, that are used to achieve those water quality standards are set for specific portions or parts of the navigable water."
2003.02-626,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1064.333,1075.229,So you're saying... you're saying that the problem that I'm raising is a problem that is dealt with solely by water quality standards and cannot be dealt with by... by point source emission regulation.
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1075.229,1079.975,"Well, I mean, that's... that's... I mean, because of the complexities of the act, that's not quite right."
2003.02-626,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1101.568,1110.894,"All right, but assuming a State may do that, why does it follow that in defining bodies of water for point source purposes, we may not do that?"
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1110.894,1113.289,"--Well, just let me run through, if I may."
2003.02-626,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1115.081,1120.265,"No, but answer my question before you run through because I... I tend to lose the answers in the... in the run-throughs."
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1152.094,1159.357,--Because Congress recognized that this is a cooperative federalism statute where the Federal Government and the State government has their role--
2003.02-626,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1159.357,1160.1,As I understood you--
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1160.1,1160.76,--and in the plain language--
2003.02-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1160.76,1161.875,--you didn't say it cannot be made.
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1163.322,1163.644,"--Well, it hasn't--"
2003.02-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.644,1164.266,--in the statute.
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1164.266,1165.631,--It has been made in the statute.
2003.02-626,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.631,1169.429,It has not been made and you're saying it would be illegitimate to make it as a matter of interpretation.
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1173.637,1174.563,"Well, that's my run-through."
2003.02-626,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1221.191,1232.42,"Then what did... what did the tribe mean when it said that there are, I think... major components of the Everglades construction project are already under NPDES programs?"
2003.02-626,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,1232.42,1233.535,Those are the STA's.
2003.02-626,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1246.909,1247.569,"Very well, Mr. Bishop."
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1268.913,1272.257,"I'm not sure the record is clear on this, Your Honor."
2003.02-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1272.257,1275.516,Because the part that Mr. Bishop brought my attention to does not answer the question.
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1275.516,1277.745,I'm... I cannot give you assurance.
2003.02-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1277.745,1278.488,You don't... you don't know the answer.
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1278.488,1279.808,"I do not know the answer to that, Your Honor."
2003.02-626,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1352.133,1364.143,"But if in fact an industrialist adds quite... something quite filthy out of a pipe into a clean body of water, there is no addition if, at the same time, in some other body of water, he's taking out an equivalent amount."
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1364.143,1371.74,I think that the... the text precludes that understanding because it states any addition of any pollutant.
2003.02-626,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1377.124,1377.85,So a single body of water is--
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1377.85,1378.676,--indicates you can't rule it out.
2003.02-626,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1378.676,1384.637,"--A single body of water, which seems to have been a concept that the EPA has used for years and years... that's irrelevant."
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1384.637,1388.586,That is... that's not the case that EPA has used a single body of water.
2003.02-626,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1388.586,1388.907,They haven't.
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1389.45,1389.905,No.
2003.02-626,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1473.019,1477.189,--What about... C-11 doesn't come within that because it's not polluted enough?
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1477.189,1488.501,"--C-11, when it was first constructed at that... at the time that the C-11 canal was built back in the 1950's, most likely... well, it was in fact constructed by the Corps of Engineers."
2003.02-626,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1505.796,1524.333,"What about the other half of what I said, that I'm thinking if you were to be wrong on that, if I thought you were wrong on what you've said... assumption... then it's not so bad for you because EPA can handle what I call the California central river valley project by the Costle... you know what I'm thinking of."
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1530.195,1531.142,I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that.
2003.02-626,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1531.885,1550.933,"He lists... in that opinion there, he lists... he lists a set of things that EPA could do under the permit requirement that would, in fact, alleviate the administrative burden and would make sure that all these pipes and things in California don't really have an administrative problem or other problem by having to go to EPA to get the permit."
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1550.933,1557.62,--EPA has substantial discretion to minimize the types of regulatory burdens that might be imposed here.
2003.02-626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1571.988,1582.019,Don't you think there would be another lawsuit quite promptly if... if EPA simply said you automatically get a permit for this type of operation?
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1582.019,1582.884,I think that's correct.
2003.02-626,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1650.462,1665.815,"Well, what do we make of information such as that provided by the State of Pennsylvania, talking about the application of the permit system to interbasin transfers in that State and saying how beneficial it has been?"
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1665.815,1675.103,"Well, the State of... the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania can, of course, adopt that type of program on its own under its State law to deal with those types of programs."
2003.02-626,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1676.401,1683.36,It tells us that it's been getting permits under this Federal scheme and that it's been helpful.
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1683.36,1688.728,"That might very well be, and it is allowed to supplement the Federal scheme with its own State additions."
2003.02-626,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1691.367,1691.905,I don't understand that.
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1696.447,1696.94,--No.
2003.02-626,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1709.655,1711.141,It's done the same thing in Florida.
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1714.773,1715.395,--That's true.
2003.02-626,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1777.188,1779.046,Is that the view that EPA takes?
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1779.046,1780.986,"Yes, that is the view."
2003.02-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1819.996,1828.419,But I notice that there's a brief filed by former administrators and general counsel which says that the position of the EPA back in '75 was that of your opponent.
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1828.419,1837.168,They're relying on a 1975 general counsel opinion that addressed the question of irrigation return flows.
2003.02-626,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1858.262,1859.338,Can I make one thing clear?
2003.02-626,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1867.8,1868.747,That is correct.
2003.02-626,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1872.008,1873.206,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,1877.004,1881.834,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-626,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.166,1936.075,What... what says that?
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,1955.123,1955.683,Yes.
2003.02-626,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.599,1977.398,You... it could... it could say to a particular navigable water.
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,1981.772,1991.637,"It could, Your Honor, but since the permitting system is from a point source, it would not make sense to say to any other navigable water that the point source is not discharging to."
2003.02-626,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.317,1999.893,"No, it doesn't."
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2029.986,2046.705,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, but if that were the meaning of that text and the lack of an adjective, any navigable waters were to mean that once in navigable waters, that pollutant could be spread to any navigable water with any different designated use or any different water quality--"
2003.02-626,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.705,2048.069,As far as this provision is concerned.
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2048.069,2049.222,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-626,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2130.053,2151.162,"Is it just First Circuit case or is there any history in the EPA over the years, I guess 30 years, where they did make clear that the navigable waters of the United States... the discharge is not just like one big water where the Sacramento River and Hudson are part of the same big water?"
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2151.162,2172.861,"Yes, the United States, Justice Breyer, on many occasions... starting in 1975 EPA general counsel issued the opinion that surface water runoff and return flows from irrigation, even when in navigable waters, that is to say an agricultural canal, when then discharged to other navigable waters, would require a permit."
2003.02-626,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.329,2183.923,Return flow from... from irrigation seems to me quite different.
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2198.124,2198.988,--But the question--
2003.02-626,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.988,2202.332,That's quite different from just transferring from one navigable water to another.
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2202.332,2206.214,"--Well, those elements of it are, Justice Scalia, but what the EPA opinion--"
2003.02-626,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.214,2206.707,But why are they different?
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2220.787,2223.426,"--Well, it is not different when it gets into the canal."
2003.02-626,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.564,2247.453,"Well, apart from the... what... 1972--"
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2247.453,2248.112,Yes.
2003.02-626,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2248.112,2266.605,"--general counsel opinion, which... which applied to... to return from... from cultivated land, do you... do you deny that... that the EPA has never sought to require permitting of this kind of a facility for 30 years?"
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2267.681,2268.796,Yes.
2003.02-626,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2286.09,2289.268,So that States have been violating the Federal law for 30 years and nobody knew about it?
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2289.268,2290.648,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2003.02-626,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2290.648,2293.316,The States have been violating the Federal law for 30 years.
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2293.316,2294.552,"Well, in most cases--"
2003.02-626,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2294.552,2296.327,That's kind of an extraordinary interpretation.
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2296.327,2305.121,"--In most cases, Your Honor, the simple movement of water does not end up, even under Miccosukee... this case, requiring a permit."
2003.02-626,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2314.037,2319.239,You don't... you think the dam cases are correctly decided and you don't need to distinguish them?
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2319.239,2337.422,"--We distinguish them, Your Honor, because the dam cases dealt with the condition... the D.C. Circuit made it clear in the Gorsuch case in '82 that dam-induced changes in condition such as super-saturation and so forth, and that that was not a pollutant."
2003.02-626,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2341.037,2343.47,I thought same water body made no difference to you.
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2356.928,2357.96,"No, Your Honor, because--"
2003.02-626,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2357.96,2358.581,I thought so.
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2360.289,2376.536,"--Neither side takes the position, but it is true that the phrase, water body, because it's used in so much of the EPA regulations, is a shorthand for saying that the pollutant is added to a navigable water that wouldn't otherwise receive it."
2003.02-626,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.601,2401.056,The dam--
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2455.175,2466.116,"Well, Your Honor, first with respect to the same body of water, if you were referring to the Everglades, this is a... C-11 is a canal that has gas stations, urban shopping malls, industrial parks around it."
2003.02-626,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2478.126,2480.605,That's why I think we need a separate body of water requirement there.
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2482.424,2494.146,"Well, with respect to these larger water projects, Your Honor, first of all, if they're withdrawing water, they're not going to come under our condition, withdrawing and then being used for a consumptive use and so forth."
2003.02-626,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2569.11,2571.627,"May I ask you two questions that I... I think you may have answered, but I'm just not sure?"
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2589.52,2591.955,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-626,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2600.932,2601.387,I understand that.
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2601.387,2606.422,And it does not have the ecology of the Everglades.
2003.02-626,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2623.307,2624.383,Then what about the second question?
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2624.383,2632.595,"With respect to the second, the record shows the trial court found that substantial surface water runoff goes into the C-11, and--"
2003.02-626,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2632.595,2635.074,"That's right, but why does the... what is the source of the runoff?"
2003.02-626,2,21160,dexter_w_lehtinen,,2635.074,2637.675,"--Well, the source of the runoff is sometimes rainfall."
