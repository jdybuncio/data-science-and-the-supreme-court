1968.376,0,33284,j_edward_thornton,,0.0,3.296,Now push the Drummer case.
1968.376,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,27.867,38.768,Well it seems to me that the complicating factor here is that this could be regarded as a J.C. Penny operation.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,529.477,553.405,"Gentlemen, in biased instanced here, it seems that the appellant rather accuses the State of Alabama and the City of Mobile of entering into some kind of evil conspiracy to put this company out of business."
1968.376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.636,788.556,Does your court characterize this license tax is a privilege tax?
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,796.556,797.757,Your honor.
1968.376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.757,803.017,"I mean it’s not an -- for inspection or for, it just for the privilege of doing business."
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,803.017,806.541,"It’s clearly a license task, it’s a task."
1968.376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.097,819.963,Without that they can’t do business in Alabama.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,819.963,821.121,"Right, right that’s right."
1968.376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.121,822.882,It is for the privilege you are doing business in Alabama.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,822.882,828.147,It’s for the privilege of doing this business in the State of Alabama and districts.
1968.376,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,828.147,832.11,"Which business, what sector?"
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,832.11,838.563,"This business is, business as a transit or travelling photographer."
1968.376,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,838.563,841.929,So what’s the business for transit?
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,841.929,847.009,Well our court has to find that in this Graves case.
1968.376,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,848.802,849.844,As being.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,849.844,860.287,"As being a photographer, who goes out of state from county to county where he has no fixed location."
1968.376,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,860.287,861.402,And does what?
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,861.402,864.105,And takes pictures and conduct settings.
1968.376,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,864.105,865.738,Does he stops with that?
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,865.738,868.072,Yes and --
1968.376,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,868.072,872.085,Conducts settings and develop the pictures and all the rest.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,872.085,883.67,"No sir, what our court has said that this license is directed at is the photographer taking the picture conducting a setting."
1968.376,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,915.681,924.311,"What makes the difference between the transit and the fixed, both are exact same thing right?"
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,924.311,938.908,"No sir, we say that there is a quite a distinction between the two, we say that the license on a fixed location, on a photograph gallery is another place and that this license --"
1968.376,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,938.908,940.572,Why?
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,940.572,941.154,Sets up or not.
1968.376,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,941.154,950.303,"If I understand you correctly, that you said a moment ago that a photographer has great expertise in taking the picture."
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,952.908,954.338,"Yes, sir that is true."
1968.376,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,954.338,967.256,"Well, is there a difference between the expert photographer taking a picture in a fixed location and an exert photographer taking a picture in the exact same location but moving on."
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,967.256,975.914,"I would say no sir, not in the operation of the camera and taking the picture, I would say it would all be the same recognize –"
1968.376,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,975.914,981.306,Now why do you charge the itinerant more if it’s the same action.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,981.306,988.892,"Well, that depends whether the itinerant or the transit has charged more."
1968.376,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,994.607,1006.435,Why is it that the itinerant that works 52 weeks is charged more than the stationary man who works 52 weeks?
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1006.435,1012.497,"Well, we say they are in different classes or sub-classes and that the state."
1968.376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.497,1025.923,Your law puts them on different classes but what about has your court ever explained or gone into the basis for the different classification and imply the different class.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1025.923,1051.531,"I believe Your Honor in this Graves case, they touched on it, I don’t know how deeply, I don’t recall that part of the case but I believe that they did touch on that and in the Graves case they did point out that this transit photographer license, it applies to those who come from without and from within the state alike."
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1074.978,1099.511,"Suppose in their state taxation system of photographers, suppose there is a large photographers business and he has half a dozen people in there who take the pictures, do you charge him one, charge them one or half a dozen licenses."
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1099.511,1107.722,"In that case your honor, the license would be on the photograph gallery and it would only the one license that’s true."
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1107.722,1126.885,I thought you told us a little while ago that this was a personal that it was directed against the person who takes some pictures and if that is true why wouldn’t you charge him six license fees instead of one if he had six people taking pictures.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1126.885,1135.631,Your Honor the -- our reasoning there is that they have two separate and distinct licenses.
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1136.358,1139.714,What are the two separate and distinct licenses?
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1139.714,1152.02,"Well, we say that the photographer who has a fixed place of business in a different place from the travelling photographer that goes from county to county."
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1170.832,1177.559,What is the state’s interest in separating these two that you just mentioned for purposes of taxation.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1184.087,1196.079,"Your Honor, I would like to say this along that line in explanation is that in the case that the fixed location."
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1246.299,1249.742,Let’s see if it’s in the last sentence here.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1286.082,1305.309,"Your honor in that case, if they have no fixed place of business, I think you would charge them both this $5 license just saying whether they develop the film in the county or well they send it out you would charged him the same licenses of $5 a week."
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1305.309,1313.62,"Well I gathered for this case up-to-date may be its wrong, that in the main what they are complaining about is this."
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1335.431,1350.496,"Your Honor, you can prosecute, penalize a person but not paying any tax, whether it’s in Oklahoma, Alabama anywhere else everyone one of these taxes --"
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1350.496,1369.668,"Taxing, if it can be shown that what your tax is, is the tax directly on the other interstate commerce which says you got to pay this much tax to do business in the state and interstate commerce."
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1372.001,1379.344,Your Honor we say that we are not because of the fact that this tax is not an entrance fee.
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1384.464,1390.584,"Then separate people who had in two states in interstate commerce if they don’t pay it, isn’t it?"
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1390.584,1395.376,"Your Honor, they are supposed to pay the tax."
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1397.185,1401.54,"Wouldn’t keep them out, will they prosecuted for --"
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1401.54,1406.549,"Yes, but that would be not for paying the tax, it wouldn’t be a mean."
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1406.549,1415.496,"It would be not for paying a tax on doing business in the interstate commerce, that’s what I understand is that your argument?"
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1415.496,1420.879,But the same person located within the state would also be --.
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1420.879,1422.442,Well that’s a different question.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1422.442,1423.265,Yes.
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1423.265,1430.749,"Can you tax interstate comers at all, if you put a tax on it, if they had engaged on interstate commerce."
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1430.749,1433.29,I have agree -- whole heartedly
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1433.29,1434.47,Well I can’t quite understand --
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1434.47,1437.045,Yes and that’s what I’m trying to find out.
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1437.045,1441.432,"Why wouldn’t be doing business in interstate state commerce, they went to (Inaudible)."
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1441.432,1442.126,Yes.
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1442.126,1448.54,"Took the picture, and then sent it all to be developed and then sent back."
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1462.144,1478.226,"Your Honor, it had been held by this court and I would think you’ve written some of the opinions that I read, that where you can realistically separate activities and localize them that you can validly tax them and --"
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1478.226,1478.721,That’s right.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1478.721,1522.098,"And that’s exactly our contention in this case that and another point right there -- this court in United Gas Pipeline versus City of Mobile held that it was a prerogative, I won’t say prerogative but the right of the state courts to define the meaning of a tax and tell what the characteristics of a tax are and in that case this court sent that case back to Alabama for the state court to define the meaning of the tax."
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1550.073,1553.216,So which one had the most --
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1553.216,1563.618,"Well, the majority sent it back. The majority of the court sent that case back to Alabama."
1968.376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1563.618,1565.804,What was the citation to that case.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1565.804,1566.582,Sir?
1968.376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1566.582,1568.781,What was the citation to that case?
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1568.781,1576.775,"Your honor, I have the --"
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1775.72,1784.689,"Mr. Burton, what is that case -- if you make mistake in relying on something I’ve written in this field."
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1784.689,1785.215,"Well, that case --"
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1785.215,1787.06,Our case is that.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1787.06,1805.456,"Your Honor, I want to point out one thing in that case it was brought out that before you could secure the license in that case that you had to get a permit from the department of public safety, now that’s not so in this case."
1968.376,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1843.261,1845.296,And if you operate.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1845.296,1845.924,Sir?
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1845.924,1851.13,"I thought you had said for the license, am I wrong?"
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1857.38,1878.362,"It’s a license tax, Your Honor, I have used that word and I had used rather loosely but this is a license, it’s a tax and is on, and the Alabama court has held that it’s only doing a business, it’s not a right to do business."
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1889.993,1893.723,"Well it does put you, does put you in jail."
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1895.18,1897.618,"Well, Your Honor --"
1968.376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.618,1900.193,This was pretty effective business.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1900.193,1903.806,That’s what it left it yes.
1968.376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1929.196,1949.937,"Because the statute says, for any person or a corporation engage in any businesses, they shall pay them the probate fee which is or the tax which is a -- and the tax is there and saying that every license is a personal privilege to transact the business."
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1954.483,1957.552,"The statute does say that Your Honor, that is very true."
1968.376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.92,1970.127,This business some people will --
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1970.127,1977.275,"Well I tell you, it’s not the duty of the state or the Federal government to catch any tax pleas--"
1968.376,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1977.275,1985.128,"Well, the claims inside the -- didn’t know what the businesses are and giving your license --"
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,1985.128,1990.665,"Well I would think that, that would be pretty bad."
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1990.665,1997.869,As I recall it the NAACP failed to pay a $10 license.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,2002.011,2005.424,Well Your Honor I don’t what the license it was.
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2005.424,2009.917,"Still not -- I think you’d find it was 100,000."
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,2009.917,2010.859,Yes.
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2023.189,2025.749,I was thinking it’s what that was rule.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,2025.749,2030.374,"It could be, I’m not familiar with the case Your Honor."
1968.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2030.374,2033.445,But it indicated a little danger not paying the license tax.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,2033.445,2034.335,Yes.
1968.376,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2058.375,2062.25,Was it the Olan Mills case?
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,2062.25,2062.79,Sir?
1968.376,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2062.79,2066.554,"The Olan Mills case was a criminal case, wasn’t it?"
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,2066.554,2068.014,No sir.
1968.376,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2077.956,2083.663,But you said they don’t usually do it and against that I have example of when they actually did it.
1968.376,1,43951,william_h_burton,,2083.663,2084.288,Yes.
1968.376,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2110.174,2111.883,Mr. Thorton you may.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2111.883,2113.673,I just have a word.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2197.528,2223.266,"Now let me ask Mr. Thorton, if I understood Mr. Burton correctly, if you had a photographer based in Montgomery and he sent photographers around this -- among the six adjoining counties, but all of the work was done in the state of Alabama, nevertheless under this statute as to the activities of those photographers who went around in the six states, the license fee would be $5 a week."
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2227.59,2229.943,I believe that would be the correct construction.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2229.943,2244.799,"Now suppose in that very situation, all that happened or rather instead of developing everything in the State of Alabama, of the pictures taken by those photographers who went around the six counties."
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2258.276,2262.946,"No, on the $25 license in Montgomery on the $5 one?"
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2262.946,2265.131,No on the $5 license.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2265.131,2266.206,That’s this case.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2266.206,2266.504,That’s right.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2266.504,2267.752,That is this case.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2273.419,2291.715,"Yes, but I gather then if you’re right, then all -- the photographer who now does all of his work in Alabama would have to do to escape that $5 week tax, would be to send the developing work out of Alabama to be dealt with."
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2291.715,2300.636,"Well, the going out of the state is what makes the photography at a fixed location a transient operation."
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2300.636,2301.129,Yes.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2301.129,2308.036,If it’s already a transient operation I don’t believe whether he develops it in the state or out of the state would make any difference.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2308.036,2309.791,Yes.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2334.544,2336.591,"Well, no, no."
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2371.514,2376.122,The only reason they put you in the transient class because you sent your pictures outside.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2376.122,2377.306,That’s correct.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2389.943,2390.979,How can they cure it?
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2390.979,2392.015,What.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2392.015,2393.185,How can they cure?
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2393.185,2393.718,What’s that?
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2393.718,2396.424,How can it be cured? You say you can cure that so easily.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2396.424,2406.741,"Well, they would just demand the license and say that regardless of where the film is developed, the license would be $5 a week."
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2406.741,2407.689,For whom?
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2407.689,2409.814,For transient photographers.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2409.814,2412.138,Well how they prove you are transient?
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2412.138,2416.35,Well the reason they proved we were a transient here was because we sent it out.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2416.35,2421.719,"But how could they ever prove that you are transient, whether if they amended the ordinance like this."
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2421.719,2433.234,"Well, my part is that they might cure that by eliminating the discriminatory nature of the tax, because of the interstate activity."
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2434.85,2437.654,"You see, you would still object to the $25 a year."
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2437.654,2438.914,"Oh yes, oh yes."
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2438.914,2440.143,And that’s your -- that’s the point you would like us to --
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2440.143,2442.355,That’s correct.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2442.355,2443.473,They can’t tax you at all.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2443.473,2444.215,That’s correct.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2444.215,2461.024,"Now let’s suppose I’m making -- that I’m a manufacturing steel products, selling them all over the country and I decide to establish an office, a sales office in Alabama, Montgomery."
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2480.387,2481.443,"No, I would not say that."
1968.376,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.774,2493.576,Well then how do you -- why can’t Alabama do that to you and in so far as you take pictures at a fixed location in Alabama.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2493.576,2498.713,"Well, maybe they can’t."
1968.376,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.713,2501.957,"Because that really, dispose of you -- that would your first point isn’t it?"
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2501.957,2504.468,"No, my last point."
1968.376,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.468,2506.314,I think it exposes your first point.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2506.314,2516.455,"Well then, if it does, I don’t want make that concession, because I -- and I didn’t understand your question adequately I’m sorry, this I don’t know --"
1968.376,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2516.455,2525.532,Well Mr. Mr. Thorton there is a little more to the facts of this case and just the mere exposure of films isn’t there?
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2546.865,2548.679,Yes sir.
1968.376,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2548.679,2560.437,Well doesn’t that bear somewhat on whether it’s a local thing that is being taxed or not or whether it could be taxed as a local activity?
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2560.437,2569.177,"Well, admittedly the more local activities we engage here, the more the state has to latch on to."
1968.376,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2569.177,2570.912,Yes.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2570.912,2583.762,"But we think in this case, see this license isn’t at Penny, if they go at Penny, that’s a different proposition as to Penny’s activities with reference to advertising, our coming into the state to."
1968.376,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.232,2616.17,And your first point and your last point are inconsistent.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2619.521,2621.452,I haven’t thought so.
1968.376,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2621.452,2622.091,What?
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2622.091,2625.515,I hadn’t thought so.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2625.515,2631.319,Because your last point starts out with the proposition that we are taking photographs in a fixed location.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2631.319,2632.171,Yes.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2632.171,2636.485,And the only reason you make an itinerant out of this is because we send the photographs out of the state.
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2636.485,2637.472,That is correct.
1968.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2637.472,2644.26,"But if you say you’re taking photographs in fixed location, it seems to me they would be able to put the $25 charge on you."
1968.376,2,33284,j_edward_thornton,,2644.26,2647.106,"Well, I’m backing off on that completely."
1968.376,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2651.56,2653.558,Very well Mr. Thorton.
